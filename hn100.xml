<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Check it out! <a href="https://leebutterman.com/wikipedia-search-by-vibes/">https://leebutterman.com/wikipedia-search-by-vibes/</a></p><p><img src="https://www.leebutterman.com/assets/wikipedia-search-by-vibes-offline.gif" alt="this webapp is running on airplane mode on an iphone and rendering search results in real time for the default onomatopoeia query and thereafter for the sequoia query, it is rendering search results for millions of embeddings in realtime"></p><h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2><p>This is a browser-based search engine for Wikipedia, where you can search for “the reddish tall trees on the san francisco coast” and find results like “Sequoia sempervirens” (a name of a redwood tree). The browser downloads the database, and search happens offline. To download two million Wikipedia pages with their titles takes roughly 100MB and under 50 milliseconds to see the final results. This uses sentence transformers to embed documents, product quantization to compress embeddings, <a href="https://github.com/lsb/pq.js"><code>pq.js</code></a> to run distance computation in the browser, and <a href="https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js"><code>transformers.js</code></a> to run sentence transformers in the browser for queries.</p><h2 id="is-this-good">Is this good?</h2><p>Yes.</p><p>Real-time search over millions of documents is happening in real-time completely offline. Results stream back every 10ms on a mobile device, and search results update gradually as the database is sequentially scanned.</p><h2 id="timing-first-results-in-21ms-70-of-final-results-in-116ms-faceted-search-in-23ms">Timing: first results in 21ms, 70% of final results in 116ms, faceted search in 23ms</h2><p>The distance computation over 2M embeddings takes 250ms in total, over 20 iterations, and we can display intermediate results with a faceted top-10 computation that takes 8ms. To display intermediate results, we run batches of 100k distance computations at a time, and compute the top-k and repaint after a (30ms) timer runs out.</p><p>We order embeddings by compressed page size: more information-dense pages are the first to be analyzed and returned in a top-10 ranking, and might be more useful in a search result. Note that the search results continue to stream in and update the top results, but most of the lower-page-size pages do not rank in the top 10, so the search appears faster than if we did not update the UI until everything returned.</p><p>70% of the final search results were in the first 670K embeddings, which in total rendered in 116 milliseconds (note the topk timing at the bottom left, which counts distance calculations as positive times and topk calculations as negative times):</p><p><img src="https://www.leebutterman.com/assets/wikipedia-search-by-vibes-last-frame.gif" alt="final search query about redwoods with timing data"></p><p>Note that changing the facet for the onomatopoeia search (changing the first letter of the page to return) avoided running a new embedding, and returned in under 25ms. Changing the number of results from top 10 to top 20 or top 100 is similarly instantaneous.</p><h2 id="200k-embeddings-and-page-titles-compress-down-to-10mb-in-arrow">200k embeddings and page titles compress down to 10MB in Arrow</h2><p>The database is small enough to support casual use cases of up to a million embeddings without special treatment.</p><p>Note that, for high performance, we use Arrow instead of JSON. Arrow can store our 8-bit integer product quantization arrays compactly, and Arrow can store an array of strings as an array of indexes into one buffer, which is a significant savings over a million Javascript string objects.</p><h2 id="these-onnx-models-run-in-wasm-for-now">These ONNX models run in WASM for now</h2><p>There is no GPU acceleration, only WebAssembly, so far. ONNX is a convenient compile target. WebGPU is still very new, and is an eagerly-anticipated future direction.</p><h2 id="step-1-embed-all-of-wikipedia-with-a-sentence-transformer">Step 1: embed all of Wikipedia with a sentence transformer</h2><p>There are a lot of sentence transformers to choose from! There is a leaderboard of sentence embeddings: <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/mteb">https://huggingface.co/blog/mteb</a></p><p>The <code>all-minilm-l6-v2</code> model has reasonable performance <a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2">https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2</a> and is small and available in ONNX weights <a href="https://huggingface.co/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/">https://huggingface.co/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/</a> for transformers.js <a href="https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js">https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js</a> .</p><h2 id="step-2-use-product-quantization-to-compress-embeddings">Step 2: use product quantization to compress embeddings</h2><p>6M pages * 384-dimension embeddings * 32-bit floats is over 9GB. Even a million embeddings in float16 precision is 800MB. This is too large for casual usage.</p><p>As a first approximation, to choose the top million, one approach would be to choose the pages with the most information: compress each page and see the number of bytes that come out. Lists would be overrepresented (lists are less compressible than general text), there’s no appreciation of the link structure of webpages, but it’s cheap to compute and easy to start with.</p><p>FAISS (<a href="https://faiss.ai/">https://faiss.ai</a>) is a highly popular embedding search engine serverside, with a lot of tuning knobs for creating different styles of search indices. Autofaiss (<a href="https://github.com/criteo/autofaiss">https://github.com/criteo/autofaiss</a>) will usually recommend using Product Quantization, after creating IVF indices or HNSW indices (Pinecone has a great intro to vector indexing <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-indexes/">https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-indexes/</a>).</p><p>Product quantization is exceptionally simple to implement: creating a ‘distance table’ is <a href="https://github.com/matsui528/nanopq/blob/89dd8da1c449e0a0f3ac4b4635d87ef83368cd34/nanopq/pq.py#L168-L171">under 5 lines of numpy</a> and using that to find distances is a <a href="https://github.com/matsui528/nanopq/blob/89dd8da1c449e0a0f3ac4b4635d87ef83368cd34/nanopq/pq.py#L217">one-liner</a>.</p><h2 id="intermezzo-faceted-search">Intermezzo: faceted search</h2><p>Often times, you will want to search in some product subcategories, like finding only PDFs in a web search, or results in ancient Latin. Splitting up the distance computation from computing a top-10 ranking allows us to fudge the distances in flight before ranking. For million-scale search, this is highly feasible. In this search of Wikipedia, there is one search facet: the first character of the page. Because the top-k ranking is separate from distance computation we can avoid recomputing query embeddings and distances to explore different facet values in real time.</p><h2 id="step-3-hand-write-onnx">Step 3: hand-write ONNX</h2><p>ONNX has a specific opcode that does exactly the product quantization step! That opcode is GatherElements. Unfortunately, the PyTorch ONNX export does not use this special opcode for the model as written. Thankfully, there is abundant support for reading and writing ONNX outside of a PyTorch compilation step.</p><p>A useful graphical editing tool for ONNX is ONNX-modifier, at <a href="https://github.com/ZhangGe6/onnx-modifier">https://github.com/ZhangGe6/onnx-modifier</a> , which presents a friendly interface to add elements into the dataflow graph of any exported ONNX model.</p><p>By taking the multiple steps in the PyTorch model that gets compiled to ONNX, and replacing all of those with one ONNX opcode, distance computation is roughly 4x faster.</p><h2 id="step-4-export-numpy-to-arrow">Step 4: export numpy to Arrow</h2><p>As mentioned, the Arrow format is much more compact in memory and much more compact on disk to store the embeddings and the metadata (page titles).</p><p>Because the Arrow array format only stores one-dimensional data, and because we have 48 dimensions of embedding data, and because we do not want to store embedding data wrapped in another data format, we need two separate schemas, one for the metadata (with a hundred thousand rows each), and one for the embeddings (with a hundred thousand * 48 rows each), and we reshape the embeddings at load time.</p><p>Storing the product quantization codebook in JSON is under 1.0MB, so it is less crucial to optimize this part.</p><h2 id="step-5-let-me-know-what-you-think-">Step 5: let me know what you think 🙂</h2><p>Lots of the library functions in the full <a href="https://github.com/lsb/sqlite-vector-search/tree/trunk/vector-search-sqlite-react">Wikipedia search app</a> should migrate into reusable <a href="https://github.com/lsb/pq.js">pq.js</a> components. A lot of the ONNX shapes are pre-baked, so it would be useful to support different quantization levels and different embedding dimensions. <a href="mailto:leebutterman@gmail.com">Give a shout!</a></p></div> </article></div></div>]]></description>

The titles include “Wild Mushroom Cookbook: form [sic] forest to gourmet plate, a complete guide to wild mushroom cookery” and “The Supreme Mushrooms Books Field Guide of the South-West”.</p><p>Four samples from the books were examined for the Guardian by Originality.ai, a US firm that detects AI content. The company said every sample had a rating of 100% on its AI detection score, meaning that its systems are highly confident that the books were written by a chatbot such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chatgpt" data-link-name="in body link">ChatGPT</a>.</p><p>Examples of prose from the books include: “The sweet smell of freshly cooked mushrooms wafted through the air, bringing back fond memories of my mother” and “Foraging for wild mushrooms is a deeply rewarding experience that connects us with nature’s abundance and the rich tapestry of flowers that the Earth provides.”</p><p>The other books tested by Originality.ai were “Wild Mushroom Cookbook: A beginner’s guide to learning the basics of cooking with wild mushrooms for health and flavor, complete with easy-to-follow recipes!” and “Wild Mushroom Cookbook: unlock the delicious secrets of nature’s most flavorful fungi”. The Guardian has attempted to contact the authors named on the books.</p><p>Leon Frey, a foraging guide and field mycologist at Cornwall-based Family Foraging Kitchen, which organises foraging field trips, said the samples he had seen contained serious flaws such as referring to “smell and taste” as an identifying feature. “This seems to encourage tasting as a method of identification. This should absolutely not be the case,” he said.</p><p>Some wild mushrooms, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/aug/10/victoria-death-cap-mushroom-poisoning-what-are-death-caps-deadly-toxic-poisonous-australia" data-link-name="in body link">like the highly poisonous death cap</a>, which can be mistaken for edible varieties, are toxic.</p><p>Frey said that one book refers to the lion’s mane fungus, which is edible but a protected species in the UK and should not be picked. “I would recommend choosing books from reputable sources,” he added.</p><p>Prof Myron Smith, a fungi specialist at Carleton University in Canada, said the books were “totally irresponsible”. He said: “Some of the differences between edibles and non-edibles are very subtle and it really takes an experienced eye and knowledge to discriminate between them.”</p><figure id="4c8e1696-c2bc-4b8d-b1c4-cf6262f96d9d" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TweetBlockElement"><gu-island name="TweetBlockComponent" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TweetBlockElement&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;nojs-tweet\&quot;><p lang=\&quot;en\&quot; dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot;>🚨: PSA Alert!<br>🔗: link in bio<a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/amazon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;>@Amazon</a> and other retail outlets have been inundated with AI foraging and identification books. <br><br>Please only buy books of known authors and foragers, it can literally mean life or death. <a href=\&quot;https://t.co/FSqQLDhh42\&quot;>pic.twitter.com/FSqQLDhh42</a></p>&amp;mdash; newyorkmyc (@newyorkmyc) <a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/newyorkmyc/status/1695689778224594959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;>August 27, 2023</a></blockquote>&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/newyorkmyc/status/1695689778224594959&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1695689778224594959&quot;,&quot;hasMedia&quot;:false,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;inline&quot;,&quot;isThirdPartyTracking&quot;:false,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;Twitter&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;4c8e1696-c2bc-4b8d-b1c4-cf6262f96d9d&quot;}}"><div id="tweet-container-4c8e1696-c2bc-4b8d-b1c4-cf6262f96d9d"><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨: PSA Alert!<br>🔗: link in bio<a href="https://twitter.com/amazon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Amazon</a> and other retail outlets have been inundated with AI foraging and identification books. </p><p>Please only buy books of known authors and foragers, it can literally mean life or death. <a href="https://t.co/FSqQLDhh42">pic.twitter.com/FSqQLDhh42</a></p></div>— newyorkmyc (@newyorkmyc) <a href="https://twitter.com/newyorkmyc/status/1695689778224594959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2023</a></blockquote></div></gu-island></figure><p>The AI mushroom books were first reported by the <a href="https://www.404media.co/ai-generated-mushroom-foraging-books-amazon/" data-link-name="in body link">404 Media site</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <section>
        <p>The Dead Sea scrolls, made of parchment and papyrus, are still readable nearly two millennia after their creation — yet the expected shelf life of a DVD is about 100 years. Several of Andy Warhol’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/24/5646554/andy-warhols-lost-amiga-computer-art-photo-essay?ref=longnow.org">doodles</a>, created and stored on a Commodore Amiga computer in the 01980s, were forever stranded there in an obsolete format. During a data-migration in 02019, millions of songs, videos and photos were lost when MySpace — once the Internet’s leading social network — fell prey to an <a href="https://mashable.com/article/myspace-data-loss?ref=longnow.org">irreversible data loss</a>.</p><p>A false sense of security persists surrounding digitized documents: because an infinite number of identical copies can be made of any original, most of us believe that our electronic files have an indefinite shelf life and unlimited retrieval opportunities. In fact, preserving the world’s online content is an increasing concern, particularly as file formats (and the hardware and software used to run them) become scarce, inaccessible, or antiquated, technologies evolve, and data decays. Without constant maintenance and management, most digital information will be lost in just a few decades. Our modern records are far from permanent.</p><p>Obstacles to data preservation are generally divided into three broad categories: <em>hardware longevity</em> (e.g., a hard drive that degrades and eventually fails); <em>format accessibility</em> (a 5 ¼ inch floppy disk formatted with a filesystem that can’t be read by a new laptop); and <em>comprehensibility</em> (a document with an long-abandoned file type that can’t be interpreted by any modern machine). The problem is compounded by encryption (data <em>designed</em> to be inaccessible) and abundance (deciding what among the vast human archive of stored data is actually worth preserving).</p><p>The looming threat of the so-called “<a href="https://longnow.org/ideas/category/digital-dark-age/">Digital Dark Age</a>”, accelerated by the extraordinary growth of an invisible commodity — data — suggests we have fallen from a golden age of preservation in which everything of value was saved. In fact, countless records of previous historical eras have all but disappeared. The first Dark Ages, shorthand for the period beginning with the fall of the Roman Empire and stretching into the Middle Ages (00500-01000 CE), weren’t actually characterized by intellectual and cultural emptiness but rather by a dearth of historical documentation produced during that era.</p><p>Even institutions built for the express purpose of information preservation have succumbed to the ravages of time, natural disaster or human conquest. The famous library of Alexandria, one of the most important repositories of knowledge in the ancient world, eventually faded into obscurity. Built in the fourth century B.C., the library flourished for some six centuries, an unparalleled center of intellectual pursuit. Alexandria’s archive was said to contain half a million papyrus scrolls — the largest collection of manuscripts in the ancient world — including works by Plato, Aristotle, Homer and Herodotus. By the fifth century A.D., however, the majority of its collections had been stolen or destroyed, and the library fell into disrepair.</p><p>Digital archives are no different. The durability of the web is far from guaranteed. <a href="https://longnow.org/ideas/a-long-bet-on-link-rot-is-resolved-but-questions-about-the-durability-of-the-web-still-remain/">Link rot</a>, in which outdated links lead readers to dead content (or a cheeky dinosaur icon), sets in like a pestilence. Corporate data sets are often abandoned when a company folds, left to sit in proprietary formats that no one without the right combination of hardware, software, and encryption keys can access. Scientific data is a particularly thorny problem: unless it’s saved to a public repository accessible to other researchers, technical information essentially becomes unusable or lost. Beyond switching to <a href="https://www.planetanalog.com/the-hottest-data-storage-medium-ismagnetic-tape/?ref=longnow.org">analog alternatives</a>, which have their own drawbacks, how might we secure our digital information so that it survives for generations? How can individuals, private corporations and public entities coordinate efforts to ensure that their data is saved in more resilient formats?</p><p>Organizations like The Long Now Foundation are among those working to combat the Digital Dark Age (Long Now in fact coined the term at an early <a href="https://longnow.org/events/01998/feb/08/time-and-bits/">digital continuity conference</a> in 01998), drawing on open-source software, coordinated action across platforms, transparency in design, innovative technologies, and a long view of preservation. From thought experiments and industry analysis to more concrete projects, these organizations are imagining preservation on a massive time scale.</p><figure><img src="https://static.longnow.org/2023/07/ROSETTA_DISK_02.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1323"><figcaption>The Rosetta Disk is just one possible way that we can preserve linguistic data for future generations.</figcaption></figure><p>Consider the <a href="http://rosettaproject.org/?ref=longnow.org">Rosetta Project</a>, Long Now’s first exploration into very long-term archiving. The idea was to build a publicly accessible digital library of human languages that would be readable to an audience 10,000 years hence. “What does it mean to have a 10,000-year library?” asks Andrew Warner, Project Manager of Rosetta. “Having parallel translations was enough to unlock the actual Rosetta Stone, so we decided to construct a ‘decoder ring,’ figuring that if someone understood one of the 1,500 languages on our disk, they could eventually decipher the entire library.” Long Now worked with linguists and engineers to microscopically etch this text onto a solid nickel disk, creating an artifact that could survive millennia. More symbolic than pragmatic, the Rosetta Project underscores the problem of digital obsolescence and explores ways we might address it through creative archival storage methods. “We created the disk not to be apocalyptic, but to encourage people to think about our more immediate future,” says Warner.</p><p>Indeed, the idea of a 10,000 year timescale captures an anxious public imagination that’s very much grounded in the present. How will technological innovation such as generative artificial intelligence change the way we interpret (and govern) the world? What threats — climate change, pandemics, nuclear war, economic instability, asteroid impacts — will loom large in the next decamillennium? Which information should we preserve for posterity, and how? What are the costs associated with that preservation, be they economic, environmental or moral? “Long Now will be a keeper of knowledge,” says Warner. “But we don’t want to end up erecting a digital edifice in a barren wasteland.”</p><hr><p>As personal computing and the ability to create digital documents became ubiquitous toward the end of the 20th century, preservation institutions — museums, libraries, non-profits, archives — and individuals — were faced with a new challenge: not simply how to preserve material, but <em>what</em> to collect and preserve in perpetuity. The astonishingly rapid accumulation of data has led to a problem of abundance: digital information is accumulating at a staggering rate. Scientific, medical and government sectors in particular have amassed billions of emails, messages, reports, cables and images, leaving future historians to sift through and categorize an enormously capacious collection — one projected to <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3325397/idc-expect-175-zettabytes-of-data-worldwide-by-2025.html?ref=longnow.org">exceed hundreds of zettabytes by 02025</a>. The Clinton White House, by one estimate, churned out 6 million emails per year. NASA’s sky surveys rely on over 2 billion uploaded images. The endless proliferation of junk-content, both human and A.I.-generated, makes sifting through all this data even trickier.</p><p>The term of art for this sorting is known as <em>appraisal</em>: deciding whether or not something should be preserved and what resources are required to do so. “One ongoing challenge is that there’s so much to preserve, and so much that can help diversify the archival record and reflect the society we live in,” says Jefferson Bailey, Director of Archiving &amp; Data Services at the <a href="https://archive.org/about/">Internet Archive</a>, a digital library based in San Francisco that provides free public access to countless collections of digitized materials.</p><figure><img src="https://static.longnow.org/2023/07/Internet-Archive-servers.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500"><figcaption>Servers housed at the Internet Archive's San Francisco headquarters.</figcaption></figure><p>The organization began in 01996 by archiving the Internet itself, a medium that was just beginning to grow in use. Like newspapers, the content published on the web was ephemeral — but unlike newspapers, no one was saving it. Now, the service has more than two million users per day, the vast majority of whom use the site’s <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine,</a> a search function for over 700 billion pages of internet history. Educators interested in archived websites, journalists tracking citations, litigators seeking out intellectual property evidencing or trademark infringement, even armchair scholars curious about the Internet’s past, all can take a ride on this digital time travel apparatus, whose mission is “to provide Universal Access to All Knowledge.” That includes websites, music, films, moving images and books.</p><div><p>💡</p><div><p><strong>WATCH</strong> Brewster Kahle's 02011 Long Now Talk, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_ALlJGU_c&amp;ref=longnow.org">Universal Access to All Knowledge</a>," on how the Internet Archive, deemed "impossible" when he founded it in 01996, became an essential part of the web. </p><p><strong>WATCH</strong> Jason Scott's 02015 Long Now Talk, "<a href="https://youtu.be/kugg_fewUgQ?ref=longnow.org">The Web in an Eye Blink</a>," which details Scott's project at the Internet Archive to save all the computer games and make them playable again inside modern web browsers.</p></div></div><p>Some of the services provided by the Internet Archive enable institutions to document their own web properties or older materials, but the frequency of this backup varies. “We archive many widely-read and frequently-changing websites multiple times a day, whereas other sites may only be archived once or twice a year,” says Bailey. Web scrapers allow for easy archiving, but then there’s the problem of storage. A single copy of the Internet Archive library collection occupies more than 99 petabytes of server space (the organization stores at least two copies of everything). Safely storing any long-lived data requires significant emissions, energy and cost.</p><p>The Internet Archive also takes multi-century preservation energy costs into account: “We own and operate and run all our own data centers,” says Bailey. “That’s partly because we’re an archive and don’t want to be dependent on corporate infrastructure, and partly because we can then run less expensive climate control operations.”</p><figure><img src="https://static.longnow.org/2023/07/ignite-project-silica-superman-closeup_1920x1280.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1280"><figcaption>Microsoft Research’s Project Silica storage device.</figcaption></figure><p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-silica/?ref=longnow.org">Project Silica</a> aims to tackle the problem by providing an alternative to traditional magnetic media, which degrades over time. The company created a low-cost, durable WORM media (an acronym for Write Once, Read Many, which means that data is written to a storage medium a single time and cannot be erased or modified). Considered immutable, WORM storage plays a pivotal role in meeting data security and compliance requirements and protecting against ransomware and other threats. Project Silica’s media is also resistant to electromagnetic frequencies: stored in quartz glass, the lifetime of data can be extended to tens of thousands of years. This has important implications for sustainability, because users can leave data in situ, eliminating the costly cycle of periodically copying data to a new media generation.</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.longnow.org/2023/07/87581945-94a94b80-c68e-11ea-8934-0870b0025e7e.webp" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://static.longnow.org/2023/07/arcticvault1.webp" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></div><figcaption>The Arctic Code Vault in Svalbard.</figcaption></figure><p>Another option is to store data in Earth’s most remote places. GitHub created an <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/?ref=longnow.org">Arctic Code Vault</a>, a data repository preserved in the Arctic World Archive (AWA), a very-long-term archival facility 250 meters deep in the permafrost of an Arctic mountain. Such cold storage is meant to last at least 1,000 years and shield data from the outside world’s effects. Arctic archiving strategies could have potential as much of the world warms. Eliminating the need for costly HVAC filtration or cooling systems, building for redundancy, putting in place multiple failovers, storing data in remote or unconventional locations — these are certainly laudable measures, but more will need to be done to mitigate the enormous ecological impact of all this storage. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/29/streamings-dirty-secret-how-viewing-netflix-top-10-creates-vast-quantity-of-co2?ref=longnow.org">Streaming</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/03/climate/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html?ref=longnow.org">cryptocurrency</a>, and day-to-day <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think?ref=longnow.org">Internet use</a> already make up nearly 4% of global CO2 emissions — a statistic that rivals the carbon footprint of the aviation industry. Sustainability must be a paramount concern of digital preservation technologies.</p><hr><p>For individual users worried about data preservation, the answer may lie in a switch to better systems with more robust methods of encoding, or investing in mechanisms that permit a kind of time travel to older formats. <a href="https://archive-it.org/?ref=longnow.org">Archive-It</a>, Internet Archive’s web archiving service, offers subsidized and grant-funded services to organizations, including over 1,500 libraries, archives, governments and nonprofits, enabling users to create a personalized cultural heritage storage system. There’s also <a href="https://www.permanent.org/?ref=longnow.org">Permanent Legacy Foundation</a>, a cloud service backed by a nonprofit that allows consumers to permanently store and share their digital archives with loved ones, community members and future generations. “The most distinctive component of Permanent is our legacy planning feature,” says Robert Friedman, Executive Director at Permanent. “We have a very robust vision for memorialized content — what people can do with their archives once they’re no longer able to maintain them.” For a one-time fee, Permanent will convert a user’s files (documents, video, image, audio) to more durable formats; a Microsoft Word document might be converted to a PDF, for example. “The purpose is to make sure there exists at least one copy of every file that isn’t tied to a proprietary format,” says Friedman.</p><div><p>💡</p><p><strong>READ</strong> our <a href="https://longnow.org/ideas/the-permanent-legacy-foundation-wants-to-preserve-your-digital-legacy-for-future-generations/">02020 profile</a> of the Permanent Legacy Foundation and its goal to preserve individuals' digital legacies for future generations.</p></div><p>Not being tied to a corporate entity or the commercial cloud means many of these organizations can have a direct stake in the sustainability of their operations. “If you need your data available consistently, then you have to keep running the operation at idle,” says Friedman. But for many people, their data will never be needed again after death, in which case, those personal archives can be sealed and deleted. “We don’t strip you of your rights,” he adds, “but we do need to know what to do with that data, including whether to destroy it.” Permanent is also conservative in its appraisals, and its subscription model encourages individuals to be selective about what they choose to preserve. (Fees collected by Permanent are used to fund the ongoing cost of storage and operations.)</p><p>“This challenge is not something that one organization is going to solve: it has to be a collective effort,” says Bailey. Federal agencies, public libraries, research institutions and private corporations, each with different budgets and mandates, must come together to address the issue of storage and associated concerns. And, as technology accelerates and emulation of older systems becomes more difficult, Digital Dark Age preppers may need to consider not just the survival of data, but the possibility that it may be misunderstood. Getting future readers to parse what we’ve preserved, and to make sense of that information, is an existential challenge without easy answers.</p><p>The basic lingua franca of the internet is bits: zeroes and ones that lack intrinsic meaning without software and hardware. These bits are effectively linguistic symbols, which can be transmitted over long distances and represent wildly different objects — a string of ones and zeros might represent a photograph, video, sound or text. Barring the invention of some extraordinary universal translation system, making sense of these binary codes without knowing how they were intended to be read is impossible. &nbsp;Also consider online disinformation, spread either by humans or artificial intelligence. Many digital archives already struggle to exclude or annotate content, not to mention living websites like Wikipedia, Twitter or Facebook, which must be continuously monitored for harmful or fraudulent content. “If you exclude fake news, does that mean you run the risk of a non-representative archive?” asks Bailey. “We are open to removal if there’s a reason, and we do it.”</p><p>Public and private organizations and policy-makers will need to decide what content should be restricted, embargoed, or scraped from the web entirely, and design robust digital repositories that can weather the ravages of time. People with limited resources must also be ensured the ability to preserve their data; long-term storage should be designed for equity as well as for sustainability. Finally, we must be judicious in what we store and preserve, creating a meaningful collection for future historians. Our future — and our past — depend on it.</p>

<p>The most important thing about reading this blog post is to not get scared off by the formulas. The post may look like all the crap you normally skim over, so you may be tempted to skim over this one. Don’t! <strong>None of this is hard.</strong> Just read the post top to bottom, and I promise you every individual step and the whole thing put together will make sense.</p>
<section id="highschool-math">
<h2 data-anchor-id="highschool-math">Highschool math</h2>
<p>In hight school your math teacher may have started a treatment of linear algebra by making you solve a system of linear equations, at which point you very sensibly zoned out because you knew you’d go on to program computers and never have to solve a system of linear equations again (don’t worry, I won’t be talking much about them here).</p>
<p><span>\[
\begin{eqnarray}
0x_1 + 1x_2 = 0\\
-1x_1 - 0x_2 = 0
\end{eqnarray}
\tag{1}
\]</span></p>
<p>You also may have learned that for some reason you can take the coefficients and put them in a 2D array like this: <span>\(A=\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}\)</span>. You’ve now defined a matrix <span>\(A\)</span>, and you can re-express the system of linear equations above as follows:</p>
<p><span>\[
\newcommand\qvec[1]{\begin{bmatrix}#1\end{bmatrix}}
A\qvec{x_1\\x_2}=0
\tag{2}
\]</span></p>
<p>If you’re <em>really</em> hellbent on cleaning things up, you can express the vector <span>\(\qvec{x_1, x_2}\)</span> as <span>\(x=\qvec{x_1 \\ x_2}\)</span>, which now gives you a really clean equation:</p>
<p><span>\[
Ax=0
\tag{3}
\]</span></p>
<p>Equations 1 - 3 are just different ways to say the exact same thing. In different situations you may prefer one notation over another, but there is no material difference between them. They are all equivalent.</p>
</section>
<section id="matrix-vector-multiplication">
<h2 data-anchor-id="matrix-vector-multiplication">Matrix-vector multiplication</h2>
<p>I’ll talk about what matrix-vector multiplication <em>means</em> in a moment. For now let’s look at how the operation is defined. The precise definition of matrix-vector multiplication flows out of the notation above, so you never again have to look it up on wikipedia. If you need to multiply a matrix by a vector, say <span>\(\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \\ \end{bmatrix} \qvec{1 \\ 2}\)</span>, just recall that this is equivalent to the left side of the system of equations above. Before, we took the coefficients in the linear equation system and factored them out into a 2D array. Now we reverse the procedure– take our 2D array and factor it back in as coefficients:</p>
<p><span>\[
\qvec{
0*1 + 1*2\\
-1*1 - 0*2
}=\qvec{2 \\ -1}
\]</span></p>
<p>If you forget how matrix-vector multiplication works, just remember that its definition flows out of the notation. Convert the matrix-vector multiplication notation back into the linear equation system notation again, and you get the matrix-vector multiplication formula.</p>
<p>You may remember from high school that there is an operation defined on vectors called the dot product. The dot product is the sum of pairwise multiplication of elements of two vectors. E.g. <span>\(\qvec{0, 1}\cdot\qvec{1, 2}=0*1 + 1*2=2\)</span>. The dot product of two vectors is an operation that represents the degree to which the two vectors point in the same direction.</p>
<p>That’s simple enough. But here is something curious. Another way to think of matrix-vector multiplication is by treating each row of a matrix as its own vector, and computing the dot products of these row vectors with the vector we’re multiplying by (in this case <span>\(\qvec{1, 2}\)</span>). How on earth does that work?! What does vector similarity have to do with linear equations, or with matrix-vector multiplication? I cannot answer this question quite yet. But we’ll eventually build up to an answer in future posts.</p>
</section>
<section id="matrices-as-functions">
<h2 data-anchor-id="matrices-as-functions">Matrices as functions</h2>
<p>Now let’s look at what matrix-vector multiplication means. This blew my mind when I first learned about it. You can think of a matrix as a function, and you can think of multiplying a matrix by a vector as applying that function to the vector. So when you see <span>\(Ax\)</span>, autocomplete it in your head to “calling some function <span>\(A\)</span> with argument <span>\(x\)</span>”.</p>
<p>This is actually not so strange– you can think of many structures as functions. For example, you can think of a number <span>\(3\)</span> as a function. When you multiply it by things, it makes them three times bigger. Thinking about matrices this way happens to be very convenient.</p>
<p>The fact that <span>\(Ax=0\)</span> denotes both the linear system in equation 1, and a call to a function <span>\(A\)</span> with argument <span>\(x\)</span> (getting the zero vector in return) leads to a curious insight about the relationship between high school math and programming.</p>
<p>In high school you’re given equations and asked to find their roots. We already established that a system of equations is equivalent to matrix-vector multiplication, which can be thought of as function application. And so, in high school you’re <em>given</em> a function <span>\(A\)</span> along with its output, and asked to <em>find the inputs that match that output</em>. Programming is usually the exact opposite. In programming what you’re <em>given</em> is the shape of inputs and outputs, and your job is to <em>construct a function</em> <span>\(A\)</span> that converts inputs to desired outputs. The computer then executes the functions you construct, often at scale.</p>
<p>So it turns out that solving systems of linear equations in high school math classes and writing React code in your day job are two sides of the same coin! It’s a complicated idea, so it takes a while to wrap your head around its implications (and its limitations). Illuminating this relationship in much more depth is another thing I hope to accomplish with these series of posts.</p>

<section id="what-does-beginbmatrix0-1--1-0-endbmatrix-do">
<h2 data-anchor-id="what-does-beginbmatrix0-1--1-0-endbmatrix-do">What does <span>\(\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}\)</span> do?</h2>
<p>Going back to our lowly 2x2 matrix <span>\(A=\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}\)</span>, let’s consider what this matrix does. Taking an equally lowly vector <span>\(x=\qvec{0, 1}\)</span> and multiplying <span>\(A\)</span> by <span>\(x\)</span>, we get <span>\(Ax=\qvec{1, 0}\)</span>. Let’s do this a few more times:</p>
<p><span>\[
\begin{aligned}
&amp;A\qvec{1 \\ 0}=\qvec{0, -1}\\
&amp;A\qvec{0 \\ -1}=\qvec{-1, 0}\\
&amp;A\qvec{-1 \\ 0}=\qvec{0, 1}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>After the fourth operation we’re back where we started. Plotting this we get:</p>
<div data-execution_count="22">
<p><img src="https://coffeemug.github.io/spakhm.com/posts/01-lingalg-p1/linalg-p1_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png"></p>
</div>
<p>So the matrix <span>\(A\)</span> performs a clockwise rotation on its input vector by 90 degrees! How does that work? Suppose we had to write a normal Python function to do a clockwise 90 degree rotation:</p>
<div data-execution_count="33">
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>def</span> rotate(vec):</span>
<span id="cb1-2">    x, y <span>=</span> vec</span>
<span id="cb1-3">    <span>return</span> [y, <span>-</span>x]</span>
<span id="cb1-4"></span>
<span id="cb1-5">[rotate([<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>]),</span>
<span id="cb1-6"> rotate([<span>1</span>, <span>0</span>]),</span>
<span id="cb1-7"> rotate([<span>0</span>, <span>-</span><span>1</span>]),</span>
<span id="cb1-8"> rotate([<span>-</span><span>1</span>, <span>0</span>])]</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-execution_count="33">
<pre><code>[[1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0], [0, 1]]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>These are the same results that we got by matrix multiplication. It helps to tinker with matrix-vector multiplication by hand to internalize how it works. Can you write a matrix that rotates its input counterclockwise? How about one that rotates by 45 degrees? A matrix that returns its input as is?</p>
</section>
<section id="matrix-matrix-multiplication">
<h2 data-anchor-id="matrix-matrix-multiplication">Matrix-matrix multiplication</h2>
<p>In highschool your teacher also gave you a bunch of rules for how to multiply matrices by each other, and then, if you’re lucky, maybe explained what matrix-matrix multiplication means. I always thought it’s a silly way of teaching it. Where did the rules come from? Did Moses bring them down from mount Sinai on stone tablets?</p>
<p>Instead, let’s do it the sensible way and put the horse before the cart. Knowing what we know, if <em>we</em> were tasked with defining matrix multiplication, what would we <em>want it to do</em>? What could be a reasonable definition?</p>
<p>We’ve seen in the previous section that <span>\(A\)</span> rotates its input vector clockwise by 90 degrees. Of course when we apply <span>\(A\)</span>, take the resulting vector, and apply <span>\(A\)</span> again, <em>that</em> gets rotated by 90 degrees. So applying <span>\(A\)</span> twice rotates the <em>original</em> input clockwise by 180 degrees. Mathematically, we can express it like this: <span>\(A(Ax)\)</span>. We perform matrix-vector multiplication <span>\(Ax\)</span> which produces a vector, we take that vector, and perform matrix-vector multiplication on that.</p>
<p>Normally in math we want the multiplication operation to associate. It would be strage if the result of <span>\(2*(2*3)\)</span> were different from <span>\((2*2)*3\)</span>. So it’s sensible to apply this principle to matrices and make <em>their</em> multiplication associative. In other words, we want the following equation to be true: <span>\[
A(Ax)=(AA)x
\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span>\(A(Ax)\)</span> rotated <span>\(x\)</span> clockwise by 180 degrees, ideally <span>\(AA\)</span> would be a matrix that does exactly the same thing. To put it more generally, if matrix <span>\(A\)</span> performs some operation, and another matrix <span>\(B\)</span> performs a different operation, we want the matrix <span>\(M=AB\)</span> to perform both of those operations one after another. A different way of putting it is that if we think of matrices as functions, we want matrix multiplication to act in the same way as function composition.</p>
<p>This is exactly what matrix multiplication does. The derivation is a little bit messy, so instead of doing it inline I added it an <a href="#appendix-matrix-matrix-multiplication-derivation">appendix</a> at the end of this post. If you forget why matrix-matrix multiplication is defined the way it is, you can always come back to this explanation.</p>
</section>
<section id="type-systems">
<h2 data-anchor-id="type-systems">Type systems</h2>
<p>Let’s look at another example of matrix-vector multiplication, this time with a non-square matrix:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 \\
-1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
\qvec{1 \\ 2}
=\qvec{2 \\ -1 \\ 0}\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s call this matrix on the left <span>\(M\)</span>. In the equation above we get our result by performing the dot product of <span>\(\qvec{1, 2}\)</span> with every row of <span>\(M\)</span>. In other words, we treat each row of <span>\(M\)</span> as a vector, perform a pairwise multiplication of its elements with <span>\(\qvec{1, 2}\)</span>, and sum them.</p>
<p>Now here is something interesting. Since you can’t perform a dot product of two vectors with different dimensions, for matrix-vector multiplication to work the number of elements in <span>\(\qvec{1, 2}\)</span> must be equal to the number of columns in <span>\(M\)</span>. Switching to thinking of <span>\(M\)</span> as a function, <em>we’ve now learned something about the type of its input</em>. <span>\(M\)</span>’s arguments <em>must</em> be vectors of two dimensions.</p>
<p>The opposite is true for <span>\(M\)</span>’s rows. Because we perform a dot product of <span>\(\qvec{1, 2}\)</span> with every row of <span>\(M\)</span> and <span>\(M\)</span> has three rows, the output vector must necessarily have three elements. And so, the number of rows in <span>\(M\)</span> tells us about the type of its output.</p>
<p>Here is a simple way of expressing this in typescript:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>// Columns are the input; rows are the output</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span>type</span> mC <span>=</span> [<span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>number</span>]<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><span>type</span> mR <span>=</span> [<span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>number</span>]<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><span>type</span> M <span>=</span> (in<span>:</span> mC) <span>-&gt;</span> mR<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now let’s consider how types for matrix multiplication work. Suppose we have a different matrix <span>\(N\)</span>, and we’d like to multiply <span>\(N\)</span> by <span>\(M\)</span>. What must the type of the matrix <span>\(N\)</span> be? Well, if we look at a term <span>\(NMx\)</span>, <span>\(M\)</span>’s output becomes <span>\(N\)</span>’s input. Thefore, <span>\(N\)</span>’s input and <span>\(M\)</span>’s output must be of the same type. In other words, <span>\(N\)</span>’s number of columns must be the same as <span>\(M\)</span>’s number of rows:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>type</span> N <span>=</span> (in<span>:</span> mR) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>any</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When you think about which matrices can and cannot be multiplied by each other, it’s actually quite simple– the output of one matrix (its rows) must have the same dimension as the input of another (its columns). If you get confused about that, perhaps writing it out in typescript notation will help!</p>

<section id="whats-next">
<h2 data-anchor-id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>This post should give you a basic intuition for what matrices are and how they work. However, we’ve just scrated the surface. Here are some interesting questions for you to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>You saw we can treat rows of a matrix as vectors. What is the intuitive meaning of these row vectors?</li>
<li>This (correctly) suggests we can also treat matrix columns as vectors. What is the intuitive meaning of column vectors?</li>
<li>If we think of a matrix <span>\(A\)</span> as a function, can we look at it and tell which inputs result in the output of zero? In other words, how do we solve <span>\(Ax=0\)</span>?</li>
<li>We know matrix multiplication can be thought of as composing two functions into a single function. Can we do the opposite and break up a matrix into multiple smaller functions? How? And what would these smaller functions do?</li>
<li>What the heck are determinants, eigenvectors, and eigenvalues?</li>
</ul>
<p>To start answering these questions, in the next part I plan to cover linear combinations, vector spaces, linear maps, and linear independence. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="appendix-matrix-matrix-multiplication-derivation">Appendix: matrix-matrix multiplication derivation</h2>
<p>Coming back to matrix-matrix multiplication, we’ve already established that we want <span>\((AB)x=A(Bx)\)</span>. Let’s look at how to derive the multiplication definition from this equation. Rather than do it generally, I’ll do it for a 2x2 example, but exactly the same principle applies to matrices of other sizes.</p>
<p>Let <span>\(A=\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \\ \end{bmatrix}\)</span>, let <span>\(B=\begin{bmatrix} b_{11} &amp; b_{12} \\ b_{21} &amp; b_{22} \\ \end{bmatrix}\)</span>, and let <span>\(x=\qvec{x_1 \\ x_2}\)</span>. Now let’s look at <span>\(A(Bx)\)</span>. Doing matrix-vector multiplication <span>\(Bx\)</span> we get:</p>
<p><span>\[
Bx=\qvec{x_1b_{11} + x_2{b12} \\ x_1b_{21}+x_2b_{22}}
\]</span></p>
<p>That’s a vector, and we already know how to multiply a matrix by a vector, so we do it again (and get a slightly messy result):</p>
<p><span>\[
\begin{aligned}
A(Bx)
&amp;=\qvec{
  a_{11}(x_1b_{11} + x_2b_{12}) + a_{12}(x_1b_{21} + x_2b_{22}) \\
  a_{21}(x_1b_{11} + x_2b_{12}) + a_{22}(x_1b_{21} + x_2b_{22})}\\
&amp;=\qvec{
  x_1a_{11}b_{11} + x_2a_{11}b_{12} + x_1a_{12}b_{21} + x_2a_{12}b_{22} \\
  x_1a_{21}b_{11} + x_2a_{21}b_{12} + x_1a_{22}b_{21} + x_2a_{22}b_{22}}\\
&amp;=\qvec{
  x_1(a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21}) + x_2(a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22}) \\
  x_1(a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21}) + x_2(a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22})}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>This is starting to look like the left side of a linear system of equations again, and we know we can rewrite it by factoring out the coefficients into a matrix:</p>
<p><span>\[
A(Bx)=\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21} &amp; a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22} \\
a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21} &amp; a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22}
\end{bmatrix}\qvec{x_1 \\ x_2}
\]</span></p>
<p>This is our matrix <span>\(AB\)</span>! It’s first column is <span>\(A\qvec{b_{11} \\ b_{21}}\)</span>, and its second column is <span>\(A\qvec{b_{12} \\ b_{22}}\)</span>. In other words each column of <span>\(AB\)</span> is a matrix-vector product of <span>\(A\)</span> with a corresponding column of <span>\(B\)</span>. Which is precisely the definition of matrix-matrix multiplication.</p>

If people like Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, and Alan Newell were among the first to think deeply about how symbolic AI, in which machines manipulate explicit verbal-like representations, might work, Doug was the first to try really hard to make it actually work. I have spent my whole career arguing for consilience between neural networks and symbolic AI, and on the strictly symbolic side of that equation, Lenat was light-years ahead of me, not just more deeply embedded in those trenches than I, but the architect of many of those trenches. </span></p><p><span>Lenat spent the last 40 years of his life launching and directing a project called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc" rel="">Cyc</a><span>, an intense effort to codify all of common sense in machine-interpretable form. Too few people thinking about AI today even know what that project is. Many who do, write it off as a failure. Cyc (and the parent company, Cycorp, that Lenat formed to incubate it) never exploded commercially – but hardly anybody ever gives it credit for the fact that it is still in business 40 years later; very very few AI companies have survived that long.</span></p><p>My own view is that Cyc has been neither a success nor a failure, but somewhere in between:  I see it as a ground-breaking, clarion experiment that never fully gelled. No, Cyc didn’t set the world on fire, but yes, it will seem more and more important in hindsight, as we eventually make real progress towards artificial general intelligence. </p><p><span>Most young AI researchers have never even heard about it. But every single one of them </span><em>should know something about Cyc. </em><span>They don’t need to like it, but they should understand what it was, and what it tried to do, and what they might do instead to accomplish the same goals. </span></p><p><span>Not because Cyc will get used out of the box, as some sort of drop-in replacement for Large Language Models, but because what Lenat tried to do - to get machines to represent and </span><em>reason</em><span> about common sense — still must be done. Yejin Choi’s wonderful 2023 TED talk,</span><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/yejin_choi_why_ai_is_incredibly_smart_and_shockingly_stupid" rel=""> Why AI is incredibly smart and shockingly stupid</a><span>, followed directly in that tradition, explaining why common sense is still, despite their apparent success, lacking in current AI systems. (My 2019 book with Ernie Davis, </span><a href="http://rebooting.ai/" rel="">Rebooting AI</a><span> was very much on the same topic.)</span></p><p>Metaphorically, Lenat tried to find a path across the mountain of common sense, the millions of things we know about the world but rarely articulate. He didn’t fully succeed – we will need a different path – but he picked the critical mountain that we still must cross. </p><p>That’s what Lenat, Choi, Davis, and I have all been trying to say, and it’s exactly where Large Language Models struggle, over and over. To take but one of a zillion constantly changing examples, this very morning someone sent me, with Google Bard mixing together truth with obvious nonsense, in completely fluent paragraphs:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a2b42d8-fb3a-497b-a167-ab6c389a20eb_1089x648.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a2b42d8-fb3a-497b-a167-ab6c389a20eb_1089x648.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a2b42d8-fb3a-497b-a167-ab6c389a20eb_1089x648.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a2b42d8-fb3a-497b-a167-ab6c389a20eb_1089x648.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a2b42d8-fb3a-497b-a167-ab6c389a20eb_1089x648.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a2b42d8-fb3a-497b-a167-ab6c389a20eb_1089x648.png" width="1089" height="648" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a2b42d8-fb3a-497b-a167-ab6c389a20eb_1089x648.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:648,&quot;width&quot;:1089,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:305879,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a2b42d8-fb3a-497b-a167-ab6c389a20eb_1089x648.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a2b42d8-fb3a-497b-a167-ab6c389a20eb_1089x648.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a2b42d8-fb3a-497b-a167-ab6c389a20eb_1089x648.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a2b42d8-fb3a-497b-a167-ab6c389a20eb_1089x648.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Depending on the wording, any given model might or might not get questions like that right on any given day; Large Language Models tend to be accurate in some wordings, inaccurate in others. From them we sometimes see an illusion of common sense, depending on the vagaries of what the training set is and the precise wording of a question, but something is obviously still missing. And even if this specific example is patched up, there will inevitably be others of a similar flavor. Cyc is an effort to find a deeper, more robust answer.</p><p>As the AI researcher Ken Forbus of Northwestern University put it to me in an email this morning, “The Cyc project was the first demonstration that symbolic representations and reasoning can scale to capture significant portions of commonsense. While today billion-fact knowledge bases are common in industry, Cyc remains the most advanced in terms of expressiveness, capturing more of the range of thoughts that humans are capable of.  My group has been using Cyc’s representations in our research for decades… Our field would do well to learn more from the Cyc project.” A Google researcher, Muktha Ananda, Director of their Learning Platform, wrote condolences to me this morning, “I have always been a great admirer of [Lenat’s] vision, perseverance and tenacity. His work on Cyc was a great source of inspiration for my own journey into knowledge graphs/webs.” </p><p>§</p><p>Over the last year, Doug and I tried to write a long, complex paper that we never got to finish. Cyc was both awesome in its scope, and unwieldy in its implementation. The biggest problem with Cyc from an academic perspective is that it’s proprietary. To help more people understand it, I tried to bring out of him what lessons he learned from Cyc, for a future generation of researchers to use. Why did it work as well as it did when it did, why did fail when it did, what was hard to implement, and what did he wish that he had done differently? We had nearly 40,000 words, sprawling, not yet fully organized, yet filled with wisdom. It was part science, part oral history.  Needless to say, it takes a long time to organize and polish something of that length. In between our other commitments, we were making slow but steady progress. And then in the new year, I got busy with AI policy, and he got sick; progress slowed. Closer to the end, he wrote a shorter, tighter paper, building in part on the work we had done together. When he realized that he did not have much time left,  we agreed that I would help polish the shorter manuscript, a junior partner in what we both knew would likely be his last paper. </p><p><span>One of his last emails to me, about six weeks ago, was an entreaty to get the paper out ASAP; on July 31, after a nerve-wracking false-start, it came out, on arXiv, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04445.pdf" rel="">Getting from Generative AI to Trustworthy AI: What LLMs might learn from Cyc</a><span>.  The brief article is simultaneously a review of what Cyc tried to do, an encapsulation of what we should expect from genuine artificial intelligence, and a call for reconciliation between the deep symbolic tradition that he worked in with modern Large Language Models.  </span></p><p>In his honor, I hope you will find time to read it.</p><p><em><strong>Gary Marcus</strong><span> has focused his career on integrating neural networks and symbolic approaches; he still hopes that will happen.</span></em></p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/doug-lenat-1950-2023?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Please considering sharing this post, in Doug’s memory</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/doug-lenat-1950-2023?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/doug-lenat-1950-2023?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://vitonsky.net/blog/2023/09/01/malware-in-browser-extensions/">https://vitonsky.net/blog/2023/09/01/malware-in-browser-extensions/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37352803">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>September 1, 2023</span><span>5<!-- --> minutes to read<!-- --></span></p></div><div><p>I've developed a few browser extensions, and every week I receive numerous emails with "revenue offer". Some experienced developers know that offers like these will inject malware into the browsers of your users, but scammers who make these offers will not tell you about it. They offer "integrations" that don't look so suspicious. Imagine how many developers have accepted these offers. Then look at the number of extensions in your browser and think about how much risk there is that you have an extension with malware.</p>
<!-- --><p><img src="https://vitonsky.net/files/a0b4319b3c5aa50037d2b7721e6a9ca2f878128cd584bfba48d06afa74082ed3.jpg" alt="Snatch - the movie"></p>
<!-- --><p>Browser extensions may request a lot of permissions, which can be necessary to implement some features and to improve the user experience. However, having wide permissions can increase the attack surface for hackers. This is why browser extensions are a great target for hackers.</p>
<!-- --><p>Browser extensions can access any content on a page, such as emails, private messages in social media, and bank account information. Extensions may also capture pressed keys and send passwords to hackers. The collected data may be sold or used by hackers to steal money, identities, or for blackmail.</p>
<!-- --><p>In recent years, browser extensions have started inserting advertisements on web pages. Here's how it works: a browser extension developer signs up on an ads platform and creates an account for some application. Then they inject ads on any web pages users visit and earn money from clicks. Sometimes even the ads platform doesn't know how the developer is generating clicks.</p>
<!-- --><p>These are not the only ways hackers can use malware in your browser. They can also click on links, open sites in the background for DDoS purposes, and more. The key point is that your browser will be shared with a hacker.</p>
<!-- --><p>Let's see how extensions can be hijacked in case the developer is not a hacker.</p>
<!-- --><h2>Monetization offers of scammers</h2>
<!-- --><p>Extension developer may even not be a hacker, but an extension can be hacked by a third party because the programmer is an engineer with a low qualification level who can't detect scams. Social engineering works on programmers as well.</p>
<!-- --><p>I frequently received emails like this:</p>
<!-- --><blockquote>
<!-- --><p><img src="https://vitonsky.net/files/1e9b6b51d1f4d049da6bd0ef1245df0b84cd49d23c5a7e8e1e7f1e1b692d5696.png" alt="I trust you're doing well. I want to introduce an exclusive revenue-generating opportunity for your Google Translate extension, through our specially curated Premium Bing Hosted Product"></p>
<!-- --></blockquote>
<!-- --><p>The problem we have is that some developers agree to offers like this because they don't understand that it's a scam. As a result, hackers in the screenshot above will inject malware into the clear extensions with good reputation.</p>
<!-- --><p>Developers may not even see the problem, they might just include third-party code that doesn't appear to be malware and actually accomplishes the things scammers claim. For example, it might add Bing suggestions to searches.</p>
<!-- --><p>Malware may intentionally not execute for some people, like developers and app store reviewers, but it does execute for users. This is why it is not secure to embed external resources like JavaScript code, but developers do it under different pretexts.</p>
<!-- --><p>If you are a developer and you are considering an offer like this, remember that you are not only betraying users who trust you, but your extension will also be removed everywhere in a few months when enough reports are sent by users.</p>
<!-- --><h2>Offers to buy project</h2>
<!-- --><p>Except "monetization offers" my spam folder also contains offers like this</p>
<!-- --><blockquote>
<!-- --><p><img src="https://vitonsky.net/files/505fd4899f5e1986caa02da18654e10fc96ea3cb014d3cc48258502215e41587.png" alt="I hope you're doing well. I came across your Chrome extension and wanted to ask if you've ever considered selling it"></p>
<!-- --></blockquote>
<!-- --><p>The idea the same - scammers offers to buy a project (usually for funny money like $10.000), but actually they want to buy users to hack and rob them.</p>
<!-- --><h2>How to protect yourself</h2>
<!-- --><p>As you can see, even if an extension developer is not a hacker, you are still in danger because the extension can still be hacked.</p>
<!-- --><p>Browser app stores try to "moderate extensions", but usually, this means the extensions are analyzed with automated tools that attempt to detect malware patterns. In cases where a hacker hides it well, a robot will approve the new release.</p>
<!-- --><p>To decrease risks, you should keep the number of extensions you use to a minimum and learn more about the extension and its author before installing it.</p>
<!-- --><p>The author must be a real person with a GitHub and social media presence, not just a random person.</p>
<!-- --><p>The author must be a highly qualified programmer and hacker; otherwise, they may be easily deceived by scammers.</p>
<!-- --><p>Browser extensions must be open-source. If you can't find the extension's sources, you can be sure it's malware.</p>
<!-- --><p>The fewer dependencies the extension code has, the better it is for security.</p>
<!-- --><p>Never install random extensions without conducting a background check.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            <p><span>Gerardo Serrano and Stephanie Wilson may have little in common. But there is at least one major tie that binds them: The government seized their vehicles, never charged either of them with a crime, and, most pertinently, made them wait years before resolving their cases.</span></p> <p><span>It is not uncommon for victims of civil forfeiture—the practice that allows law enforcement to take people's assets without having to prove the owner was guilty of a crime—to endure protracted delays before they have the opportunity to even step foot in a courtroom and defend themselves. The U.S. Supreme Court will soon hear </span><i><span>Culley v. Attorney General of Alabama</span></i><span> and </span><a href="https://reason.com/2023/04/18/the-supreme-court-will-decide-whether-you-have-a-right-to-a-prompt-hearing-after-cops-seize-your-property/"><span>decide</span></a><span> if those who find themselves in that situation are entitled to a probable cause hearing after the seizure and, if so, how speedily it must happen.</span></p> <p><span>That the highest court in the country has to rule on whether people get such a hearing is an apt indictment of how unaccountable civil forfeiture has become.</span></p> <p><span>Serrano's case is instructive. In September 2015, while traveling to Mexico, he stopped at the border in Eagle Pass, Texas, to take pictures. That upset some Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, who demanded he surrender the password to his cellphone. Serrano refused. The agents then searched his new Ford F-250 truck, found five stray bullets, and accused him of smuggling "munitions of war." Serrano had a concealed carry permit, and there was no firearm in his vehicle. The officers </span><a href="https://reason.com/2021/04/19/civil-forfeiture-supreme-court-gerardo-serrano-truck-customs-border-protection/"><span>confiscated his car</span></a><span> anyway.</span></p> <p><span>But the fragile nature of the allegation didn't matter, because it would never be subject to scrutiny. The government didn't press charges. They did, however, keep his vehicle for two years, without holding a hearing where he could contest the seizure—or without ever filing a formal forfeiture complaint.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The dearth of due process protections was devastating. Serrano paid the government $3,800—10 percent of the car's value—as a requirement to fight the move in federal court; he was met with more radio silence, even after the feds cashed the check. A Kentucky resident, he subsequently spent thousands of dollars on rental cars while his vehicle sat halfway across the country, locked in a Texas parking lot.</span></p> <p><span>Serrano never got that hearing, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit </span><a href="https://reason.com/2021/04/19/civil-forfeiture-supreme-court-gerardo-serrano-truck-customs-border-protection/"><span>ruled</span></a><span> was fine. The federal government mysteriously changed its tune after two years went by—only when Serrano filed a lawsuit, represented by the Institute for Justice (I.J.), the libertarian-leaning public interest law firm. But as I.J., Serrano, and Wilson write in a recent </span><a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-Brief-of-Amici-Curiae-in-Support-of-Petitioners.pdf"><i><span>amicus</span></i><span> brief</span></a><span> to the Supreme Court, the majority of innocent property owners do not have the resources to file a major class-action suit in order to coerce the government into returning their assets.</span></p> <p><span>It is almost always the government, in fact, that has the leverage to do the coercing, which they use to deter property owners from reclaiming what is theirs. One important tool at its disposal: delaying any hearings.</span></p> <p><span>Wilson knows first-hand. In 2019, over the span of less than six months, police in Detroit seized </span><i><span>two </span></i><span>of her cars after alleging that her ex-boyfriend and the father of her child was a petty drug offender. Wilson, a nursing student, was not suspected of wrongdoing, no arrests were made, and cops did not find drugs or guns in either of her vehicles.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>They proceeded forthwith. In the first instance, Wilson attempted three times, unsuccessfully, to fight the seizure: She was initially told she was too early to file a claim of interest on the car; on the second try, the government couldn't locate her paperwork; by the third try, she had missed a deadline, precluding her from further fighting for her car.</span></p> <p><span>After the second seizure, almost two years went by before Wilson was permitted to go before a judge, who sided with her. The government would not get to keep another one of her vehicles.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It was not for lack of trying.</span></p> <p><span>Detroit is a fitting case study of how byzantine the process of contesting a forfeiture has become. Before any victim is allowed to state their case, and only after they have successfully filed that claim of interest on their property, they must attend four in-person "pre-trial" conferences where prosecutors put a "deal" on the table: The owner may have their property back if they pay the government a fixed fee. In Wilson's case, she would have to buy her own car back for $1,800, not including storage and towing fees, an offer she declined at every conference. She couldn't afford it. Those meetings happen during the workday; if victims are unable to skirt professional commitments that conflict with any of the conferences, the government lays claim to their property, and the victim can no longer contest the seizure.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Wilson is named in a </span><a href="https://casetext.com/case/ingram-v-cnty-of-wayne-1"><span>suit</span></a><span> challenging those practices, which was argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in May. The court's decision is yet to be released. But in her case, and in similar cases across the country, the government has a considerable stake in upholding the status quo.</span></p> <p><span>You don't have to look very far to figure out what it is. Law enforcement agencies typically pocket the majority of the proceeds from civil forfeiture seizures. As of 2020, Wilson's home state, Michigan, along with 24 others—Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming—direct </span><i><span>95 percent to 100 percent</span></i><span> of the funds extracted from seizures toward law enforcement, according to the I.J. </span><a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/policing-for-profit-3-web.pdf"><span>report</span></a><span><em> Policing for Profit</em>. The federal government, which targeted Serrano, is also in that category, funneling money to either the Department of Justice or the Department of the Treasury.</span></p> <p><span>An additional seven states—Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Washington—send 80 percent to 95 percent of the proceeds to law enforcement. Several more fall below that threshold but still benefit handsomely from forfeitures, which in part explains why governments are loath to change course.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Law enforcement agencies bolster their budgets with forfeiture funds in interesting ways. A 2017 report from the </span><i><span>Philadelphia Weekly</span></i> found<span> that police used the money to </span><a href="https://reason.com/2017/09/21/the-secret-slush-funds-of-asset-forfeitu/"><span>purchase</span></a><span>, among other things, submachine guns, uniform embroidery, web design services, and a lawn mower, along with tens of thousands of dollars in cash withdrawals. (Forfeiture money also went toward satisfying someone's parking ticket.) In 2021, law enforcement in Georgia were </span><a href="https://reason.com/2021/09/29/georgia-tax-crimes-unit-illegally-spent-asset-forfeiture-funds-on-trinkets-and-swag/"><span>revealed</span></a><span> to have spent the money illegally on furniture, Fitbits, gym paraphernalia, and vehicles. In police seminars a few years back, session leaders </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/us/police-use-department-wish-list-when-deciding-which-assets-to-seize.html"><span>offered suggestions</span></a><span> for what sort of property to target based on cops' wishlists, which included flat-screen televisions—those "are very popular with the police departments," one government employee said on video—along with cash and cars (the nicer the better).</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, governments across the U.S. collectively take billions of dollars each year in forfeitures. Between 2002 and 2018, according to the I.J. report, people forfeited at least $63 billion. That stratospheric figure woefully undercounts the actual total, as only 20 states and the feds provided data for that time frame.</span></p> <p><span>So it's not surprising, then, that the government opposes even modest measures of accountability and due process—something as simple as a hearing—when they come across people like Serrano and Wilson. Deprived of the ability to formally and publicly air the cases against them, which are often less than flimsy, the government can pressure victims into giving up their assets entirely or accepting a "deal" like the $1,800 offer Wilson received.</span></p> <p><span>Such settlements are common. Consider the case of Carl Nelson and Amy Sterner Nelson, from whom the FBI </span><a href="https://reason.com/2022/02/18/fbi-seized-almost-1-million-from-amy-sterner-carl-nelson-never-charged-them-with-a-crime/"><span>seized almost $1 million</span></a><span> in May 2020 after alleging Carl, who formerly worked as a real estate transaction manager for Amazon, had participated in an illegal kickback scheme with developers. (He was never charged with a crime.) Following the seizure, the family sold their car and their West Seattle house, liquidated their retirement, and temporarily moved with their four daughters into Amy's sister's basement.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In February 2022, the FBI and the Nelsons agreed to <a href="https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nelson-forfeiture-settlement.pdf">settle</a>: Out of the $892,000 the government took, it would give back $525,000. Carl and Amy would forfeit $109,000, with the rest of the sum eaten by court fees. Getting $525,000 back is certainly better than nothing, but losing about $367,000 can hardly be called a bargain.</span></p> <p><span>Serrano, Wilson, and the Nelsons all saw around two years go by before their forfeiture cases were resolved. But even that is not exhaustive. In 2013, police in Indiana seized Tyson Timbs' Land Rover after arresting him for selling drugs to undercover cops. His car—which he had purchased a few months prior for about $42,000—was not connected with drug money. He bought it with his father's life insurance payout.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps more importantly, Timbs, who has a history of drug addiction and relapsed after his dad died, turned his life around post-arrest. But law enforcement would still spend the next </span><i><span>eight years</span></i><span> fighting for the right to keep his car—a reminder that civil forfeiture has little to do with crippling crime and more to do with making the government richer.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Timbs' case provides a particularly vivid illustration of that motive. In the struggle to keep his Land Rover, the state of Indiana argued <a href="https://reason.com/2019/07/03/indiana-is-still-arguing-that-its-constitutional-to-seize-your-car-for-driving-5-mph-over-the-speed-limit/">multiple times</a> that it should be able to take ownership of someone's car for going five mph over the speed limit. That is not parody, although when the solicitor general <a href="https://reason.com/2018/11/28/breyer-destroyed-civil-asset-forfeiture/">made that argument</a> in 2018 in front of the Supreme Court, it was reportedly met with laughter from some of the justices.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The state also submitted that law enforcement should be able to <a href="https://reason.com/2021/02/05/civil-asset-forfeiture-indiana-supreme-court-tyson-timbs/">seize everything you own</a> if you're suspected of committing a drug offense; that there should be no proportionality. The Indiana Supreme Court <a href="https://reason.com/2021/06/10/indiana-said-the-government-should-be-able-to-take-everything-you-own-if-you-commit-a-drug-crime-the-state-supreme-court-wasnt-having-it/">rejected</a> that in 2021.</span></p> <p><span>Many people, however, do not have the time and financial resources to fight their cases for months or years on end as they hope for, say, a hearing—which is evident in the billions of dollars the government successfully pockets each year via civil forfeiture. And if a victim is able to wade through the bureaucracy and finally get his or her day in court, it is not guaranteed they will be able to find representation.</span></p> <p><span>In April 2015, cops in Indiana </span><a href="https://reason.com/2022/04/01/civil-asset-forfeiture-police-indiana-supreme-court-terry-abbott/"><span>seized</span></a><span> about $10,000 cash from Terry Abbott after he sold drugs to a confidential informant. A little more than three years passed, and in July 2018, the government moved for summary judgment in the case. Abbott intended to fight the seizure, but he had a problem: The government had taken his money, which he needed to pay an attorney.</span></p> <p><span>While defendants are constitutionally entitled to a lawyer in criminal proceedings, civil forfeiture is a civil proceeding, as its name suggests, and thus that constitutional protection no longer applies—despite that the practice is used when police suspect someone of a crime, and that its stated purpose is hamstringing criminal activity.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>So Abbott </span><a href="https://reason.com/2022/04/01/civil-asset-forfeiture-police-indiana-supreme-court-terry-abbott/"><span>had to represent himself</span></a><span>. It's a quandary many civil forfeiture defendants confront. "If you can't afford to defend yourself, let alone feed yourself, it becomes complicated," Amy Nelson </span><a href="https://reason.com/2022/02/18/fbi-seized-almost-1-million-from-amy-sterner-carl-nelson-never-charged-them-with-a-crime/"><span>told me</span></a><span> last year, which captures just how coercive the forfeiture process is and how few options people have.</span></p> <p><span>But the first step is getting before a judge at all. When the Supreme Court hears </span><i><span>Culley</span></i><span> next term, they will consider the facts of two cases, both centered around innocent people whose cars were confiscated in Alabama. In one, police seized Halima Culley's vehicle after they arrested her son—who had borrowed the car—for marijuana possession and drug paraphernalia. In the other, cops took Lena Sutton's vehicle after she let a friend, who was found with methamphetamine, use it to run an errand. Sutton would go on to wait over a year before her car was returned; Culley was barred from reclaiming her property for 20 months.</span></p> <p><span>No matter the Court's ruling, the government will still have the upper hand in civil forfeiture proceedings. But the justices have an opportunity to blow over one of the many cards stacked against the people and to send the government a reminder: that due process is a right, not a privilege.</span></p>                        </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
							
<p>I'm not looking to make a habit out of writing about the Terms of Service of companies; first, it was <a href="https://stackdiary.com/brave-selling-copyrighted-data-for-ai-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brave</a>, then <a href="https://stackdiary.com/zoom-terms-now-allow-training-ai-on-user-content-with-no-opt-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoom</a>, and I could have written about Microsoft, but Mozilla has <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/microsoft-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taken care of that for me</a>. And then there is AWS, which <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_ai-opt-out.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">opts you in by default</a> as opposed the other way around. It's all happening in real-time.</p>



<p>Now, as to why the X/Twitter new terms are interesting, it's actually pretty simple. Elon has taken a lot of radical steps to build a fortress around X, to make it as isolated as possible from the outside world (<em>cough, scrapers</em>), but now that he got <a href="https://stackdiary.com/xai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">xAI going for him</a> - it only makes sense that he'd use X as a source of data that technically only he has access to (highly unlikely, bots still rummage the platform like the plague).</p>



<p>Wasn't Elon the one who said that <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1648784955655192577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft used Twitter's data illegally</a> and that he wanted to bring them <a href="https://apnews.com/article/twitter-microsoft-ai-training-data-dispute-musk-nadella-292fd9de9cc2623003fd1ce44897c912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to court</a>? It's funny how that works because now you're going to be working for Elon Musk, and he does not plan to pay you, and he certainly does not plan to ask for your permission to use your content this way.</p>

You can read the full terms here: <a href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://twitter.com/en/privacy</a> - Section 2.1</figcaption></figure>



<p>The part that interests me the most is that just recently, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1693756240260698550" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon made a tweet</a> in which he said that:</p>



<p>If you’re a journalist who wants more freedom to write and a higher income, then publish directly on this platform!</p>



<p>But what he is really saying is, "Come and publish interesting information exclusively on X so that we can use it for our subsidiary companies and train our models on it!".</p>



<p>How unlikely is it that the endgame here is to merge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Corp." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X Corp</a> together with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAI_(company)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">xAI Corp</a> down the line? It even says on the <a href="http://x.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">xAI</a> homepage:</p>



<p>We are a separate company from X Corp, but will work closely with X (Twitter), Tesla, and other companies to make progress towards our mission.</p>



<p>If Elon is committed to AI and the big bottleneck is going to be data quality and uniqueness, yeah - I don't think he's going to think twice about building a drip feed for xAI.</p>



<h3>What do the updated terms mean for you?</h3>



<p>Here's the kicker: based on these AI-assigned definitions in the updated terms, your access to certain content might be limited, or even cut off. You might not see certain tweets or hashtags. You might find it harder to get your own content seen by a broader audience. The idea isn't entirely new; we've heard stories of shadow banning on Twitter before. But the automation and AI involvement are making it more sophisticated and all-encompassing.</p>



<p>This shift isn't just about Twitter. Imagine this methodology expanding across the entire internet. Imagine if your "definitions," determined by AI, controlled not only what you could see on Twitter but also what search results appeared for you on Google, or which news stories showed up in your Facebook feed.</p>



<p>It's not that the internet has fewer pathways or offramps; it's just that you might not see them all. They are hidden or revealed based on your AI-defined identity. So while the internet remains vast and expansive, your individual experience of it could become very narrow, indeed.</p>



<p>What makes this change particularly eye-catching is that Elon Musk, who has had his say about Twitter in the past, once showed concern over third-party organizations using Twitter data to train their own AI systems. He argued that it wasn't ethical. Now, Twitter itself has decided to do just that. So, is it a case of 'do as I say, not as I do'? That's for you to decide.</p>



<p>In short, Twitter is no longer a universal experience but a personalized realm defined by AI algorithms. What we should really be asking ourselves is, are we okay with this AI-driven, highly customized yet restrictive internet experience? It's not a change confined to Twitter; it's a glimpse into what could be the new normal for the internet.</p>

<p>Using the vulnerability described in this advisory an attacker may take control of an encrypted Linux computer during the early boot process, manually unlock TPM-based disk encryption and either modify or read sensitive information stored on the computer’s disk. This blog post runs through how this vulnerability was identified and exploited - no tiny soldering required.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>This is an exploration of a real security vulnerability we discovered and exploited while working with one of our clients. This vulnerability can be used to gain local root access to a TPM-protected Ubuntu 20.04 Linux computer if it uses RedHat’s <a href="https://github.com/latchset/clevis">Clevis</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut">dracut</a> software to implement unattended unlocking for LUKS full disk encryption. This configuration is desirable when a computer needs to have disk encryption but still allow remote reboots without having someone manually unlock it afterwards. Under normal circumstances, all an attacker who turns up at the encrypted computer would see is a login prompt with no way to gain direct access to the system.</p>
<p>When you turn on your encrypted Linux computer you probably have to enter two passwords before you can use it: first you have to enter the disk encryption password to unlock LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) and then you need to enter a user’s password to log in to the unlocked system. This is mildly annoying when the computer is in front of you but a genuine obstacle if you want to encrypt a server or an appliance device in a remote location where someone won’t be present to type in the password every time the computer reboots.</p>
<p>When we discovered this vulnerability, our client was developing an appliance that needed to operate in a potentially hostile environment and reboot periodically without user interaction. This article outlines one method an attacker might use to read the encrypted contents of the computer’s disk or sneakily modify them. This could allow you to steal secrets or plant a cool backdoor!</p>
<p>You might wonder how Microsoft manages to have disk encryption that allows Windows to start up partially and only then requires the user to enter their personal password once? The answer to this and unattended Linux encryption is <a href="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/articles/TPM-sniffing">a Pulse Security favourite</a>: the TPM or Trusted Platform Module. This tiny, hardened computer inside the bigger computer can be used for a variety of tasks requiring a trusted third party - such as automatically supplying the password for an encrypted disk during startup. This requires the TPM to have some knowledge of how to decrypt or unlock the disk encryption password. Bus sniffing attacks are possible when a discrete TPM chip is used, but with firmware-based TPMs (also sometimes called fTPMs) this attack is not always possible. A solution that can be performed entirely in software is preferable and increases the exploitability of the attack.</p>
<h2 id="exploit">Exploit</h2>
<p>Generally, a Linux computer using TPM-protected unattended disk encryption will still allow a user to view the output of the boot process and optionally manually enter a decryption password with the keyboard. This allows for situations where the computer fails to boot and needs someone to troubleshoot the startup process. While the unattended TPM unlocking is taking place, the user is still presented with the password prompt and an opportunity to enter input.</p>
<p>Here’s a photo of a laptop running Ubuntu 20.04 waiting for someone to type in a disk decryption password:</p>
<p><a href="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/waiting.jpg"><img src="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/waiting.jpg" alt="A ThinkPad waits"></a></p>
<p>Faced with this, we should really perform some fuzzing to see if we can cause unexpected behaviour that might be useful. Successful fuzzing often involves supplying input to a program that the program doesn’t anticipate. In this case, the program is expecting us to provide input using the keyboard. This raises the question of what kinds of input might be unexpected in this situation.</p>
<p>In 2016 <a href="https://hmarco.org/bugs/CVE-2016-4484/CVE-2016-4484_cryptsetup_initrd_shell.html">a vulnerability was disclosed</a> in Debian’s cryptsetup startup script allowing an attacker to simply hold down the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key and gain root access to the early boot environment of an encrypted Debian computer. I wondered if something similar might still be possible in this scenario.</p>
<p>There’s a limited window of time before the TPM will unlock the disk and the boot process will proceed automatically to the login prompt, so how can we effectively fuzz this input opportunity? What if we could type faster than a human being?
Using an Atmel ATMEGA32U4 microcontroller (such as you’d find in an Arduino Leonardo development board) we can emulate a keyboard that sends virtual keypresses at essentially the maximum rate that the computer will accept. The following short Arduino program sets up a Leonardo as a keyboard emulator:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<code>#include "Keyboard.h"
void setup() {
delay(1000);
Keyboard.begin();
}
void loop() {
Keyboard.press(KEY_RETURN);
delay(10);
Keyboard.releaseAll();
delay(10);
}</code>
</td>
<td>
<a href="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/emulator.jpg"><img alt="Keyboard emulator labeled 'ENTER CANNON'" src="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/emulator.jpg"></a>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>One second after being plugged in this program begins to simulate pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on a virtual keyboard every 10 milliseconds. This is about 10x faster than the usual keyboard repeat rate you’d get simply holding down a key, and Linux seems to recognise around 70 characters per second using this method, or one keypress approximately every 15 milliseconds.</p>
<p>Sending keypresses this fast quickly hits the maximum number of password entry retries, while keeping the system from unlocking the disk automatically due to password guess rate limiting, and systemd eventually gives up trying to unlock the disk. It takes a minute or two but the recovery action in this failure scenario is to give us a root shell in the early boot environment:</p>
<p><a href="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/failing.jpg"><img src="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/failing.jpg" alt="systemd says &quot;Failed to start Cryptography Setup&quot;"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/failed.jpg"><img src="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/failed.jpg" alt="initrd sitting at a root shell"></a></p>
<p>From here it’s easy to manually use the TPM to unlock the disk with the Clevis tooling and mount the root volume for hacking (it takes a few tries sometimes, but it gets there in the end):</p>
<p><a href="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/gottem.jpg"><img src="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/gottem.jpg" alt="systemd says &quot;Unlocking the disk and mounting the root filesystem&quot;"></a>
 </p>
<h2 id="why-does-this-happen">Why does this happen?</h2>
<p>dracut relies on systemd to unlock LUKS-encrypted disks in the early boot environment. An <a href="https://systemd.io/PASSWORD_AGENTS/">“agent” plugin architecture</a> is used by systemd for disk encryption where a request for a system-wide password can be answered by a pool of different responders, including a script automatically supplying a password and the usual method of just “asking the user”. Clevis implements a systemd password agent for unlocking, but the user may also enter a password using the normal interactive agent. Both of these agents are responding to the same request issued by systemd.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in this case exposing a password prompt to the user gives us an attack surface to influence the behaviour of the early boot process.</p>

<p>It’s a little bit unclear whose fault this problem is exactly, it sits at an unfortunate intersection of a number of different design decisions and implementations. I did find that you can sometimes exploit this issue if you mash the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key really fast yourself too, so a keyboard emulator isn’t necessarily required either.</p>
<p>The simplest way to address the most immediate problem: Add <code>rd.shell=0</code> and <code>rd.emergency=reboot</code> to the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/dracut.cmdline.7.html">kernel command line</a>. This ensures that if anything fails during the early boot process the computer will reboot immediately rather than dropping into a root shell.</p>
<p>There are some wider questions to consider here but they’re a lot harder to fix. In an ideal world any deviance from the expected execution flow during early boot would result in the TPM refusing to unlock the disk. While PCR extension in TPMs is good for checking if certain specific things did or didn’t happen, and that general platform configuration matches expectations, it isn’t a great defence against the computer just doing something else entirely that doesn’t interact with the TPM. In this case the TPM has no way to know that the early boot environment has dropped to a shell and can’t tell the difference between the boot script asking for the disk unlock secret and an attacker with their hands on the keyboard.</p>
<p>Microsoft avoids some of this problem by unlocking the disk encryption key very early in the boot process and immediately extending PCR11, meaning that by the time a user gets any kind of interactive access to the computer they can no longer do their own unlock.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Physical access to a computer is still hard to secure. There are a surprising number of edge cases that must be navigated to successfully use boot-time TPM PCR measurement for unlocking secure unattended disk encryption. And don’t forget - always fuzz the user input, even if it’s just a keyboard.</p>

<p><a href="https://nostr-resources.com/">Nostr</a> – the simple, decentralized messaging protocol with the potential to replace (and even integrate with) centralized apps like Twitter and WhatsApp – is going mainstream. And fast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve never seen anything quite like it. From December 13th to January 10th, the number of public key identities interacting with Nostr jumped from ~700 to ~250,000 👀 Yes, you read that right, the number of identities increased &gt;30,000% 😯 And even if you only count individual users as identities with profiles in their bio, which is probably a more reliable indicator, user count still jumped &gt;100x!</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v7Jw7jmF48OhNs2d7ADGE892ZIsWX77Q6JZAPK6cGZMStiVIuENu0_7O0v48JI7afXWsg8iG_gRzem2Vk5fr-N02fxFkvwIK-F315HCTk5IeICIhWTlfhPlln2oTscBLbGuIdtL6-aUQqoJf4_TdlsvxqAYHUedChP5SqdcWZ8az5zJKx_llBUgB4QsG8w" alt=""><figcaption>Stats courtesy of <a href="http://nostr.band/stats.html">nostr.band/stats.html</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The proximate cause of this recent explosion in usage was a Jack Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1603945963944480768">tweet</a> and Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/dergigi/status/1604548665196138499">ban</a> (nothing buys publicity like prohibition).&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>But I believe this rapid uptake has much deeper roots which are destined to blossom into a new mainstream protocol that’s as widely adopted as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> for the web or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">SMTP</a> for email, an analogy which DK paints nicely <a href="https://www.curiousdk.com/p/decentralized-social-media-just-had">here</a>.</p>



<p>The reasons are 2-fold:</p>



<ol>
<li>Trust in <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/user-trust-social-platforms-falling-according-our-new-study">social media</a> platforms (and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/394283/confidence-institutions-down-average-new-low.aspx">institutions</a> more broadly) is at all time lows. People are increasingly aware of the value of free speech and dangers of letting any centralized platform decide what is and is not acceptable to say</li>
</ol>



<ol start="2">
<li>Nostr has the perfect mix of ingredients to maximize rate of innovation: it’s open/permissionless, incredibly simple/flexible, and has a clear path to evolve</li>
</ol>



<p>I won’t belabor the first point – the controversy over censorship on social media platforms is a well documented <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/09/social-media-content-moderation/">crux of the culture wars</a>. But the second point is very important. I believe that open and permissionless systems inevitably win over closed competitors because open systems can marshal the collective resources of many more contributors than any individual business can employ. This is the central reason why our Internet continues to run on open standards (TCP/IP/HTTP), why Wikipedia and Linux dominate in their respective domains, and why the growth rate of open source software continues to <a href="https://www.coss.community/cossc/open-source-is-eating-software-faster-than-software-is-eating-the-world-3b01">outpace</a> that of its closed counterparts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But being open as a protocol is not necessarily enough. Many have raised the compelling counterpoint that open source protocols eventually ossify, allowing for closed platforms to innovate even faster on top (see <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">here</a> and <a href="https://mignano.co/2022/07/13/the-standards-innovation-paradox/">here</a>). But I don’t see that as much of an issue with Nostr because: A) it’s one of the simplest protocol specs ever – the only object type is a <a href="https://twitter.com/pourteaux/status/1605577543087558656?s=20&amp;t=OuOs0ty3jVH1lGsMO5uuuQ">JSON blob with 7 fields</a>. That simplicity leads to incredible flexibility, allowing for the design of all kinds of interoperable apps on top. B) Nostr has a clear path to evolve and improve via <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips">Nostr Improvement Possibilities (NIPs)</a>. <a href="https://fountain.fm/">Fountain</a> founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/merryoscar">Oscar Merry</a>, stressed to me the importance of having a clear path forward for protocol change by noting all of the <a href="https://podcastindex.org/stats">recent activity</a> we’ve seen around RSS for podcasting since <a href="https://twitter.com/adamcurry?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Adam Curry</a> and friends launched <a href="http://podcastindex.org/">podcastindex.org</a> + <a href="https://origin.fm/blog/podcasting-2point0/">podcasting 2.0</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we’re watching all of this theory play out in real time. Just look at how much got done across the Nostr ecosystem in a single day 🤯</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ey1LczjogQu_X73a-4DCa_T7MM4BR4D2229fXoy1cb8O8nfXvtk1-8FYpvNERtXIF51abvtc0xXW_5aKR6UfBOlAnN6nrYPsLlejuIS3VImwxq5vYZdTvu8PfDYM7DsRyonocnNv2H0B7aybjTke5xuQXKsAv-gYxHG-3QVpOaJu2Vd3I44rQk1JUOlsqw" alt=""><figcaption>Screenshot from <a href="http://nostr.band/">nostr.band</a> Nostr search engine</figcaption></figure>



<p>What’s more, all of this recent Nostr growth came while <a href="http://damus.io/">Damus</a>, arguably the most well-known and polished Nostr iOS app, had to hard cap at 10k users (the limit for TestFlight) while waiting for Apple’s App Store to approve its official release. That limitation has, apparently, not done much to slow growth. Instead users are creating their Nostr identities with other apps like <a href="http://getalby.com/">Alby</a>, a browser extension for bitcoin lightning payments that also supports Nostr, and then interacting with Nostr through emerging web clients like <a href="http://astral.ninja/">astral.ninja</a>, <a href="http://iris.to/">iris.to</a>, <a href="http://nostr.rocks/">nostr.rocks</a>, <a href="https://notes.blockcore.net/">blockcore notes</a>, and <a href="https://branle.netlify.app/">branle</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Again, the killer feature here is that ALL of these apps are open and interoperable. I was able to successfully port my identity and social graph from Damus to Alby and then access each of the web clients above.</strong> Many have <a href="https://twitter.com/albertwenger/status/1518684477052096515?s=20&amp;t=m8f3FHeCqU72HUGvzqOhPw">dreamed</a> of Twitter enabling this sort of functionality by re-opening its API as it did in its earliest days. But while Twitter is a centralized company with an advertising driven revenue model, Nostr is a neutral protocol whose data stream will NEVER be shut to developers, because it CANNOT be shut to developers. Only individual clients and relays can restrict data. But then new ones will inevitably rise to augment and/or take their place. In fact, I would not be at all surprised to see Twitter itself become a major Nostr client in the coming year.</p>



<p>This is all incredible for building a more free and open world, which is ultimately the mission. But this new, open network also excites the investor in me. That’s because I believe that as Nostr emerges as the open standard for messaging, it will develop symbiotically with the open standards for money (bitcoin) and payments (Lightning Network). Together these three open systems will combine to create the first ever <a href="https://value4value.info/">Value4Value</a> protocol stack (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenjhall/status/1605729184122146816">Stephen Hall</a>), where service providers must continue to innovate and provide real value or else their users will exit for better options. This dynamic will enable a myriad of interesting, venture scale business opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://value4value.info/">Value4Value</a> is a simple but revolutionary concept: people who create valuable content or services should be remunerated appropriately by those who derive value. For a beautiful vision of how a Value4Value world could look, check out this recent <a href="https://dergigi.com/2022/12/18/a-vision-for-a-value-enabled-web/">essay</a> from Gigi. One of the essay’s central claims is that most of the ills of our modern attention/outrage economy stem not from some fundamental human evil, but rather from inadequate technology and broken incentives. The core culprit is credit based money, which unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearer_instrument">bearer instrument</a> cash carries counterparty risk. This counterparty risk has prevented the use of small micropayments and/or necessitated the collection of customer identity. Put another way, people must currently pay for value online either in batches (subscriptions) or with a proxy currency (attention).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But with the <a href="https://hivemind.vc/why-lightning-why-now/">Lightning Network</a>, anyone can send nearly free and instant payments globally with a bearer instrument – denominations of bitcoin (satoshis) – worth as little as a fraction of a penny. What’s more, this system is open to all 8B people alive, independent of where they live, whether or not they have a government identity, and how much money or credit they have. This is a brand new construct which I believe will completely rewire all Internet commerce (and ultimately grow it orders of magnitude by on-boarding billions of new users and use cases).</p>



<p>So how do Nostr, Bitcoin, and the Lightning Network fit together to build this future? And what sorts of business opportunities will these integrations yield? Well for starters, let’s be clear, it’s not that Nostr MUST use Bitcoin and Lightning. They’re completely independent protocols. But the fit is simply too natural not to emerge. And because both the <a href="https://twitter.com/fiatjaf?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">creator</a> and many early developers of Nostr are also open source Lightning Network developers, the likelihood of this marriage seems inevitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe there will be multiple initial use cases for integrating Nostr and Lightning, each of which will create new business models (either standalone or partially bundled). I think they’ll loosely follow along the four axes that Nostr is currently unbundling from centralized apps like Twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/macieklaskus">Maciek</a> did an excellent job of <a href="https://twitter.com/macieklaskus/status/1606977470124752896">outlining this unbundling</a>:</p>



<figure><a href="https://twitter.com/macieklaskus/status/1606978675693572096"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ya8JkrWaRpp97r8yvzGor3NHUzX0pofRD_p0XOjYwUdbQ1cgD7EvvTbg7mW5Nm3-MeiSRZVtXvrdzX5eqaUupu5qUD0dAef9P2ipLLG9vbq_93is4yVRILsBpHeIh1WOkv-ttjPymwlJHF8hO4qWYNK0N_NrzKMBjGUI_tAhRmkJG39VuTqBAhGJu3mIKA" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>I’ll rephrase these dimensions as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Relays &amp; Resources&nbsp;</li>



<li>Identity</li>



<li>Clients &amp; Apps&nbsp;</li>



<li>Search &amp; Discovery&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Let’s examine each layer and its potential business models:</p>



<ol>
<li><em>Relays &amp; Resources</em></li>
</ol>



<p>First, perhaps the most obvious opportunity is on the server/resource side. Today, <a href="http://nostr.watch/relays/find">dozens</a> of individuals and organizations are running Nostr relays simply to support the cause. But as the number of users grows 3-4 orders of magnitude and support is added for richer data like images and video, it will quickly become prohibitively expensive to run these relays altruistically. I expect to soon see premium relays that charge per KB written or read. There’s already at least one <a href="https://twitter.com/roasbeef/status/1610765009692545024">credible proposal</a> to do just that by hooking up Nostr relays with LSATs (Lightning based pseudonymous token identities). I also expect to see <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-caching/">caching services</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">content delivery networks</a> emerge to help users filter the global firehose of information based upon their own preferences and to ensure fast and reliable connection. Eventually I expect to see other resources like bandwidth and compute metered and billed for in similar fashion.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="2">
<li><em>Identity&nbsp;</em></li>
</ol>



<p>Second, we’re already starting to see multiple services emerge to validate a user’s identity. <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md">NIP 05</a> establishes a standard for web servers to validate that the holder of a Nostr public key also has (or has purchased) access to that web server. <a href="https://nostrplebs.com/">Nostrplebs</a> is one of the leading early services that charges for identification exclusively in satoshis over the Lightning Network. <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxAWebster/status/1610753954882945024">Alby</a> and <a href="https://stacker.news/items/118706">Stacker News</a> have both launched free NIP 05 verification associated with their users’ Lightning Address (a human readable address to receive Lightning payments). <a href="http://lnbits.com/">LNbits</a> <a href="https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/tree/main/lnbits/extensions/nostrnip5">released</a> open source software that allows anyone to verify Nostr identities at a domain they control. Still others like <a href="https://twitter.com/pourteaux">@porteaux</a> are proposing ideas to use the Bitcoin blockchain itself as the namespace. </p>



<p>I believe this idea could integrate with <a href="https://twitter.com/namcios/status/1535302090360250368?s=20&amp;t=CXKT4zbh4Op9cxu-lt-_Gg">Block’s vision for Web 5</a>, which to the best of my understanding, also anchors <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/dids-built-on-bitcoin-fix-the-web">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> into the Bitcoin blockchain. It’s early, but I expect to see a variety of services and features emerge here.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="3">
<li><em>Clients &amp; Apps&nbsp;</em></li>
</ol>



<p>Third, clients could charge users directly, though I expect many will actually monetize via their relay or some ancillary service. One feasible model could be giving away a consumer version of the app for free and then charging for an enterprise version with additional features (think enterprise Slack or Discord) as <a href="https://twitter.com/jb55?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">jb55</a> <a href="https://www.podpage.com/citadeldispatch/cd63-building-nostr-a-censorship-resistant-alternative-to-twitter-with-fiatjaf-jb55-and-mrkukks/">mentioned</a> as a possible direction for Damus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clients could also likely take a small cut for coordinating payments that flow through their app to resource providers (e.g. paid relays), service providers, or other users.&nbsp; And there’s always the option that some clients introduce <a href="https://stacker.news/items/121253">various forms of advertising</a>.</p>



<p>And while most people are still thinking about clients in the social media context, I expect to see many more custom apps (with potentially unique business models) built with Nostr and Value4Value assumptions baked in.&nbsp; As Jack laid out nicely in this <a href="https://fountain.fm/episode/12616447623">podcast</a>, the future of Nostr is likely a Cambrian explosion of microapps, each focused on a specific niche or use case. But that can all communicate interoperably. Like him, I’m particularly excited about specialized services that help creators fund and distribute their work. I expect to see several companies move quickly in this direction – e.g. <a href="http://fountain.fm/">Fountain</a> for podcasts, <a href="https://wavlake.com/">Wavlake</a> for music, and <a href="https://geyser.fund/">Geyser</a> for generalized crowdfunding. I also expect to see a lot of experimentation in how open source software gets developed. <a href="https://twitter.com/NostrDirectory">Nostrdirectory</a> proposed the interesting idea of a bounty poll app where users vote with their satoshis for what a dev builds next. This could lead to a cool Github + Trello + Upwork type mashup.</p>

<p>Perhaps we’ll even see the emergence of a new decentralized Nostr/Lighting marketplace like a modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBazaar">OpenBazaar</a>, an early protocol for p2p commerce <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2015/06/introducing-ob1/">backed by USV</a>, which was a great idea, but just too early in my opinion. Their key mistakes were requiring everyone to run a dense desktop app + node and using mainchain Bitcoin for payments. Nostr + Lightning solve these problems by allowing anyone to access the marketplace via light web or mobile clients with instant Lightning Network payments. My early money here is on <a href="https://github.com/lnbits/Diagon-Alley">Diagon Alley</a> (from <a href="https://stacker.news/items/120388">LNbits</a>), which was itself an early inspiration for the creation of the Nostr protocol.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XHMnGvQPfU0Rcfmg8l_fdHChQ_htNKjCbTPy-spwHA18VPtHRsC8b5t0iH-li6nD0LIZto9VURRGXD_9QzGmqI3sdSHL_UrRZr8FOziqPkdKqHBGSNI37POyi7FW9_YnMYdsXPP0eaCUrcozkD2a-gYbWKANZiDSWEs0KdY8QGm0p4uF-wKWd2ZID3FCRg" alt=""></figure>







<p>LNbits founder <a href="https://twitter.com/arcbtc">Ben Arc</a> has also published ideas for other types of Nostr + Lightning marketplaces as well, including a <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr/issues/21">decentralized Uber</a>. Perhaps one day all marketplaces will be coordinated trustlessly via Nostr.</p>



<p>In addition to microapps flourishing, we may also see the emergence of new super apps like a decentralized WeChat for users who prefer to combine all of their messaging and commerce in one place. Imagine if CashApp becomes your primary messaging app (or WhatsApp your primary payments app). I could easily see a world where remittances are sent with a text message and goods sold via a Tweet.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="4">
<li><em>Search &amp; Discovery</em></li>
</ol>



<p>Fourth, just as with web 1.0 and 2.0, I believe that the biggest winners will emerge in search &amp; discovery. My best bet is that we’ll see Nostr search engines that differentiate by indexing the most data and providing the best social graph &amp; ValueRank market signal, an idea which I fleshed out in <a href="https://hivemind.vc/howtodisruptgoogle/"><em>How to Disrupt Google</em></a>. TL;DR: for the first time in history, we can now associate information with value. As the amount of information goes infinite, only the amount of bitcoin (value) remains scarce. Attaching this value to information will help surface the highest quality information (in association with other attributes like the identity of who pledged that value).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before playing with Nostr, I believed that the best way to create this new value-based search engine was by either dropping satoshis on top of the current web (via tips from a browser extension like <a href="http://getalby.com/">Alby</a>) or by creating a brand new value-native knowledge marketplace like <a href="http://stacker.news/">StackerNews</a>. I now think that perhaps the best way to build this search engine is on top of Nostr, a blue ocean of quality content that Google and other centralized web companies will likely not index for some time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to build this vision, we need two key primitives: A) identity and B) value associated with individual Nostr posts (perhaps via tips like people are already giving on StackerNews or in Fountain). Put another way, we need an open social graph and open value graph. Every Nostr post already contains identity metadata (the poster’s public key). And the integration between posts and value is emerging quickly! jb55&nbsp;has already published his plan to do this for Damus. He’s also going to propose it as a new <a href="https://github.com/lnurl">LNURL</a> spec and/or NIP as well.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/phW8XqTUgm971POhaJYfgN_RaOrRpgQ_kZMP0SKR8yCxXihV7i9qfYsDQ2nnKgtrVdBWqMi1OjbS14Z7CVA9KeaxJGAGiQRtd6WNKBkZflFyvVQjspPmoS2xAjNjiLsd9InHWElLoMAMatFVCTadRIu8yYEvFfOup_DS6su2y_xgeYOKPDCeYRt-p0BJcg" alt="" width="620" height="426"><figcaption>Screenshot from <a href="http://nostr.rocks/">nostr.rocks</a> Nostr client&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>And <a href="http://astral.ninja/">astral.ninja</a> has already shipped this feature! Here’s a <a href="https://share.cleanshot.com/7TzYCKg0">screencast</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/Bumi">Bumi</a> instantly tipping <a href="https://twitter.com/nvk?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">NVK</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jack?lang=en">Jack</a>. And here’s a screenshot of me tipping 100 satoshis to a Nostr post by GPT-3 Bot, a chatbot interface to Open AI’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aAWBxlM_CDymLJqfKcSlXLlubBoJeVDg9b8pVHA3zsL3Bj2KV0UBtwe224oznFESFq1XVcQkNy6LzP54gJPeM-NfUYjU1gOHOnMIr9wxCVx1V5BXrSQe3FnjZ-Nzq-WmiG8jTaSBFYsoDk7arjTuKQAIX5P98_h3oyo0WWuhD3b0WRvN-N5dNSJoAfAn9A" alt=""><figcaption>Screenshot from <a href="http://astral.ninja/">astral.ninja</a> Nostr client&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>(<em>I kept the tip-selector interface for this screenshot. The experience is even more seamless when I turn on auto-tipping in astral.ninja and set an automatic budget on Alby</em>)</p>



<p>If your mind wasn’t blown already, let me clarify: I just sent a micropayment via an open twitter-like client to a bot interface for GPT-3 🤯 What other financial system can bank the AIs? 😉</p>



<p>The search engine that can best index and rank these new Nostr posts and their associated value will be in an incredible position to build the next Google. <a href="https://twitter.com/ArturBrugeman">Artur</a> has a similar idea, as his 2 sites – <a href="https://realsearch.cc/">realsearch</a> and <a href="https://nostr.band/">nostr.band</a> – are playing with each of these ideas. I expect that he’ll merge them at some point. His Nostr search engine is already particularly good – I used it multiple times to find specific Nostr posts while writing this article. I expect to see (and fund) several more approaches here and will likely expand my thinking on this idea in future posts. </p>



<p>Ultimately, I’m still open minded about how each of these layer &amp; businesses will develop and whether they’ll do so as independent entities or get rebundled either partially or fully. My best bet is that we’ll see some early winners that merely re-create existing services and business models. But the really big winners will come in the second wave once evolution plays its course and mashes up communication and commerce in truly novel ways that no one yet expects. New medium, new message (<a href="https://fountain.fm/episode/12616447623">h/t NVK</a>). And to hammer home the point – <strong>the real magic is that all of these apps, no matter their specific focus, will speak openly and interoperably.</strong> It sure feels like we’re getting close to building a global <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/hivemind_vc">hivemind</a> of communication and commerce 😉&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with each passing day, I’m becoming increasingly convinced that this rapidly developing ecosystem is what will bring Bitcoin and the Lightning Network mainstream. Many are already <a href="https://stacker.news/items/120480">speculating that the recent surge</a> in Wallet of Satoshi Lightning payments may be directly attributable to Nostr usage. Just wait until Damus integrates tipping and gets approved by the app store…</p>



<p>I recognize that all of this is still very early and that these claims are bold. But my spidey sense says that this is not a drill. I’ve seen enough early adoption and understand enough of the potential to believe that Nostr + Bitcoin + Lightning represents the most interesting opportunity to rebuild a decentralized Internet. And I’m planning to go all in on this thesis with Hivemind Fund 2 (just as I did on the Lightning Network with Hivemind Fund I). If you’re a hacker experimenting with Nostr, <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxAWebster">please reach out</a>. This is my top priority.</p>



<p>The best way to reach me, of course, is on Nostr <a href="https://emojipedia.org/call-me-hand/#:~:text=Emoji%20Meaning,call%20me%E2%80%9D%20(please).">🤙</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>(Edit: Please note that I changed my Nostr public key identity. My last private key was compromised, likely from using it to log into a web client last month. This is still a very new technology, so please make sure to only use your private key in an iOS app like Damus or stored in a browser extension like Alby. Ideally, you should never paste it directly into any web client.)</em></p>



<p>If you’re new to Nostr, I’ve found that <a href="https://damus.io/">Damus</a> is the easiest way to get started. But while their TestFlight is still full, here’s a <a href="https://nostr.how/guides/web/desktop">guide</a> on how to get started with <a href="https://getalby.com/">Alby</a> and various web clients.</p>

We offer a comprehensive set of tools that help our Fortune 500 clients understand and improve how they’re perceived in the marketplace, how aware consumers are of the value they provide, and how much consumers trust them to provide the value they promise. We've been rapidly expanding our list of enterprise customers and deepening our integrations with "household name" partners like Amazon and Clorox. As we grow, we need engineers to help us build even more unique, differentiated, valuable, scalable, and robust analytical SaaS tools and products.</p><p>About the Role:</p><p>We are looking for an Adtech-experienced engineer who’s excited about doing the wide variety of technical work that modern SaaS startups need. That includes backend web development (JVM frameworks), frontend SPA development (mostly React), AWS-based cloud engineering, and some data engineering. We are also particularly interested in someone who knows (or is interested in learning) the intricacies of our industry and our business and who is comfortable leading conversations with customers and partners to scope, define, and execute the technical integrations that have become one of our major levers of growth. We're not fixated on years of experience, but this role is unlikely to be right for someone with less than 10. Our team emphasizes high-quality, high-velocity, sustainable software development in a collaborative and inclusive team environment. We’re a small team that gives our engineers a lot of autonomy and empowerment, and we want people who are excited to step in to learn whatever skills or technologies are needed, to contribute wherever in the R&amp;D process they're needed, and to grow their careers by taking on pivotal responsibilities early in their tenure.</p><p>If you are interested, email me directly: matus@upwave.com or check out the specific role <a href="https://www.upwave.com/job/6815819002/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.upwave.com/job/6815819002/</a>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/31/a_star_star_domains/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/31/a_star_star_domains/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37351628">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>If you fancy creating a blog or website to discuss the Arm architecture or the Softbank-owned outfit that develops it, keep the British CPU designer's name out of the domain name you choose – or draw the wrath of its lawyers.</p>
<p><em>The Register</em> offers that advice after Maria Markstedter – a noted author, assembly language expert, and security researcher who's written extensively about Arm at the websites she operates – <a href="https://twitter.com/Fox0x01/status/1691774253014618222" rel="nofollow">received</a> a cease-and-desist demand from Arm's lawyers. Her offense? According to the letter she shared on Xitter, using the trademark "Arm" in the domain name <code>arm-assembly.com</code> that she used to promote a book she wrote about the ISA.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the letter went to the web host provider for her Arm-related websites, who passed it onto Markstedter to handle. The missive demanded that the website come down as it featured Arm's "Arm" trademark in the domain name.</p>

    

<p>"The website operated under the domain name arm-assembly.com ... is using Arm IPR in the domain name," the legal letter stated. "The domain name incorporates the famous Arm Ltd mark and suggests an association with the famous Arm Ltd brand and/or Arm Ltd sponsorship or endorsement of this website."</p>

        


        

<p>Yes, there is a need for trademark holders, like Arm, to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justia.com/intellectual-property/trademarks/enforcement/">assert</a> their ownership and rights and protect their marks. Still, the order came as quite a shock to Markstedter, given her close relationship with the design house stretches back six years.</p>
<p>"I first thought this must've been a misunderstanding given my previous relationship with Arm," she told <em>The Register</em> last night.</p>

        

<p>"I wrote my thesis about Arm security features and exploit mitigations for Arm's internal use, [have] given internal presentations, keynoted their conference, advocated for them, visited them at their HQ in Cambridge – all without compensation because I wanted this to be a mutually beneficial relationship instead of a gig."</p>
<p>Markstedter, who runs the Arm programming training'n'tutorial outfit Azeria Labs, therefore asked Arm what all the fuss was about – only to meet radio silence. Then, on Monday, blogs and websites owned and operated by Markstedter were taken down by her hosting provider after it received another cease and desist letter. These websites included:</p>
<ul>
<li>arm-reversing.com</li>

<li>arm-exploitation.com</li>

<li>arm-basics.de</li>

<li>azeria-labs.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Markstedter told us the sites offered educational resources, courses on reverse-engineering Arm code, and promotions for her latest book.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://azeria-labs.com/">Azeria-Labs.com</a> was taken down despite not including "Arm" in its name – the cease and desist order Arm sent to Markstedter's hosting provider identified her sites by a single IP address they all shared, which led to the provider tearing down everything.</p>
<p>The labs dotcom, and its catalog of tutorials covering Arm assembly and exploit mitigation, is now back online.</p>

        

<p>"In order to get my site back ASAP, I yielded and transferred my domains to them, and Azeria Labs got unblocked," Markstedter told us.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/23/china_arm_tradewar/">Arm reveals just how vulnerable it is to trade war with China</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/29/arm_css_n2/">Need a datacenter processor? Try our take-and-bake Neoverse N2 cores, says Arm</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/21/arm_ipo_official/">It's official! Arm files for IPO on Nasdaq</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/10/arm_riscv_website/">Up in arms! Arm kills off its anti-RISC-V smear site after own staff revolt</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This resolution did involve transferring ownership of four of the domains containing the offending "Arm" trademark to Arm.</p>
<p>"At the very least, I expected a simple heads-up or direct contact from them acknowledging the unfortunate necessity of their actions and asking for input on possible resolutions," Markstedter said.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>At the very least, I expected a simple heads-up or direct contact from them acknowledging the unfortunate necessity of their actions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Yet I have only been contacted by their lawyers, and despite bringing this matter to their attention, I have yet to receive an official email from Arm attempting to address and resolve the issue or apologize."</p>
<p>In the wake of the takedown, Markstedter <a href="https://twitter.com/Fox0x01/status/1696569707493552504" rel="nofollow">registered</a> leg-assembly.com to promote her book and plans to spin up additional body-part-related domains to provide additional resources on the Arm instruction set architectures.</p>
<p>"My disappointment with Arm's actions doesn't mean I've got any hard feelings towards the amazing folks working at Arm. They've been a huge support over the years, and I genuinely appreciate that," she emphasized. "The frustration is more about the decision-making from the higher-ups and legal teams that led to this domain issue."</p>
<h3>Litigate or lose it?</h3>
<p><em>The Register</em> asked Arm to comment on the cease-and-desist order, and its representatives told us it had nothing to say. Then as we were preparing to publish this article, the chip designer came back and said its actions were necessary to protect its Arm brand.</p>
<p>"We value the contributions that our developer and researcher community make to the Arm ecosystem and are committed to continuing to work with them as collaboratively and constructively as possible," a spokesperson told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We recognize that this activity is sometimes met with frustration and are actively working to find a solution that works for all parties involved</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"At the same time, we have a duty to protect the Arm brand, which has been built over more than 30 years. Like all companies with registered trademarks, Arm is legally obligated to ensure those trademarks are protected and used appropriately. We recognize that this activity is sometimes met with frustration and are actively working to find a solution that works for all parties involved."</p>
<p>However, Markstedter told us that, apart from Arm's legal team, she hasn't received a single email from the firm itself that discusses finding a mutual solution. Markstedter said she had suggested Arm could donate her book to universities and persons who couldn't afford them, but had yet to receive any feedback on the proposal.</p>
<p>Arm's rush to snatch up domain names is somewhat ironic, considering that in 2018 the biz <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/10/arm_riscv_website/">create</a> the website <code>riscv-basics.com</code> and used it to host content smearing rival RISC-V architecture and list multiple reasons why Arm's tech is superior. Arm pulled the dot-com after an internal revolt by its staff, and the domain has since lapsed into someone else's hands.</p>
<p>Arm's takedown comes just a week after the Neoverse designer officially <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/21/arm_ipo_official/">filed</a> for an IPO on the US Nasdaq. In the filing, Arm disclosed numerous risk factors, including many related to its operations in China. However, we don't recall any mention of experts writing tutorials about its ISA as something Arm thinks investors need to worry about.</p>
<p>That said, it did warn: "We primarily rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and contractual protections ... to protect our IP rights.</p>
<p>"The steps we take to protect our IP rights may be inadequate."</p>
<p>Some may well agree with that. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><p>Scott</p><p>Having used a wide range of field device communications busses from simple 4-20mA, classic serial busses like UART and Modbus, and more modern CAN bus, native USB, and Ethernet options I'm always playing with different transports and protocols to see what solutions make sense in my grab-bag of designs for hardware projects.</p>
<p>I first became aware of Single Pair Ethernet when I was mindlessly browsing Sparkfun's new products announcements a while ago, but didn't jump in because I felt the real utility was the ability to power devices over the same cable.</p>
<p>More than a year later, Sparkfun's Single Pair Ethernet Design Challenge gave me the excuse to create the hardware I originally wanted, offering a power budget that can handle non-trivial hardware with data rates to match.</p>

<p>This write-up summarises my (successful) attempts at building a <em>Power over Data Line</em> (PoDL) compliant device and power supply as part of a one-month '<em>sink or swim</em>' approach to designing and testing new hardware, and getting to look at maturity of the 10Base-T1 ecosystem.</p>
<p>I'll quickly cover some PoDL basics, then walk through the critical design decisions and test process for a prototype underwater sensor node suitable for ocean research.</p>
<p>All project files and full schematics are <a href="https://github.com/Scottapotamas/spe-marine-node" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-single-pair-ethernet-interesting" is="h2">Why is Single Pair Ethernet interesting?</h2>
<p>Put simply, it's a step closer to what sounds like my ideal transport:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports reasonably high data rates (for microcontrollers) at ~10 Mbps,</li>
<li>Adds the ability to provide reasonable amounts of power with up to 50W,</li>
<li>Has the ability to integrate easily with existing networking stacks,</li>
<li>and doesn't over-complicate wiring.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus, Single Pair Ethernet supports long range &gt;1km cable runs which exceed typical Ethernet specifications, and does so while aiming for far lower power consumption.</p>
<p>Off to the side, 10Base-T1S has similar goals but is built around a multi-drop half-duplex wiring configuration for shorter distance networks.</p>
<h2 id="power-over-data-lines" is="h2">Power over Data Lines</h2>
<p>With conventional PoE, two spare pairs are used for power transfer which avoids the need to mix power and data.</p>
<p>With SPE+PoDL, the high frequency data signals are low voltage (<code>1.0Vpp</code> or <code>2.4Vpp</code>) compared to the large DC offset required by PoDL. Add in the fact that a single cable run can be &gt;1km long and some care needs to be taken to correctly couple and decouple data from the power lines.</p>

<p>The coupled inductors (differential mode) couple DC supply onto the twisted pair, while the transceiver's data is inductively coupled through the isolation transformer. To reduce common mode noise, a choke filters the input, and it's also a good idea to protect the transceiver from high voltage transients with suitable ESD supression measures (typically TVS diodes).</p>
<p>For convenience in the field, the specification allows the conductors to be installed in any orientation. This means that downstream devices need to support reverse polarity power with a rectification or FET based switching arrangement.</p>
<h3 id="podl-types-and-classes" is="h3">PoDL Types and Classes</h3>
<p>Standards develop and change over time as the group and industry work out the details. SPE+PoDL is just as confusing as I expected and has 16 supported power classes and a compatibility matrix between power classes and <code>10Base-T1S</code>, <code>10Base-T1L</code>, <code>100BaseT1</code>, <code>1000BaseT1</code>.</p>
<p><code>IEEE 802.3bu</code> started by defining several Types of power capable SPE devices <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> and <code>D</code>, primarily for automotive use. This included 10 classes for unregulated and regulated 12V and 24V options, along with regulated 48V.</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>PD Power Budget (W)</th><th>PD Vmin</th><th>PD Vmax</th><th>Current Limit (mA)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>0.5</td><td>4.94</td><td>18</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>4.41</td><td>18</td><td>227</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>18</td><td>249</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>10.6</td><td>18</td><td>471</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>10.3</td><td>36</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>8.86</td><td>36</td><td>339</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>23.3</td><td>36</td><td>215</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>10</td><td>21.7</td><td>36</td><td>461</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>30</td><td>40.8</td><td>60</td><td>735</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>50</td><td>36.7</td><td>60</td><td>1360</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p><code>IEEE 802.3cg</code> later simplified things by adding Type E devices (<code>10Base-T1L</code> only) and another 6 classes of power delivery suitable for ~1-8W devices running with 20-30V (nominally 24V), and a massive 50W when using 54V supplies.</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>PD Power Budget (W)</th><th>PD Vmin</th><th>PD Vmax</th><th>Current Limit (mA)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>10</td><td>1.23</td><td>14</td><td>30</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>3.2</td><td>14</td><td>30</td><td>240</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>8.4</td><td>14</td><td>30</td><td>632</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>7.7</td><td>35</td><td>58</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>20</td><td>35</td><td>58</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>52</td><td>35</td><td>58</td><td>1579</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>For my typical projects, being able to use 24V with a few watts of power budget is the right balance of capable and practical, so I decided to aim for Class 12 support.</p>
<p>When a power supply wants to provide power to a downstream device, it first attempts to <strong>detect</strong> compliant PD hardware, and then uses a bidirectional communications process called SCCP to <strong>classify</strong> the device.</p>
<h3 id="detection--classification" is="h3">Detection &amp; Classification</h3>
<p>Detection is reasonably straightforward - the power supply uses a constant-current source capable of 9-16mA and ensure the open-loop voltage doesn't exceed 5.5V.</p>
<p>The downstream device uses this stimulus current to power up a small regulator for it's VID circuitry. Then, it sinks current until the voltage is brought within the specified signature range of 4.05-4.55V.</p>
<p>The power supply monitors the power line voltage and can signal to when a valid downstream device is identifying itself correctly.</p>
<p>The classification process is more involved, where both sides implement current sinking circuitry for a half-duplex 333bps communications link. The <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/an/snla395/snla395.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TI SNLA395 appnote</a> explains it reasonably well.</p>

<p>Electrically this can be as simple as some resistors and an extra mosfet on each board controlled by a microcontroller, but reference material often includes extra buffering and input protection circuitry.</p>
<p>While literature suggest either bit-banging or an SPI peripheral make data transfer easy, I wasn't particularly keen to spend several hundred dollars to buy the specification <em>and then</em> implement a driver to communicate correctly.</p>
<p>Looking for alternatives, the <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/products/ltc9111.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analog Devices LTC9111</a> is a viable option for adding SCCP to the Type E downstream devices, with the added benefit of simplifying input polarity handling. For ~$5 and a simplified BOM this is probably a pretty easy choice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a simple supply-side SCCP controller doesn't seem to exist yet, the only option I could find was the incredibly expensive ($20) <a href="https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ltc4296-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LTC4296</a> 5-port controller intended for switch style devices.</p>
<h3 id="fast-startup" is="h3">Fast Startup</h3>
<p>For a fully capable PoDL supply, both detection and classification steps would be implemented.</p>
<p>However the standard allows us to only implement detection <strong>OR</strong> classification and call it 'Fast-start operation'. Given the lower complexity of detection, this was a pretty appealing option.</p>
<h2 id="submersible-sensor-node" is="h2">Submersible Sensor Node</h2>
<p>So now we understand what SPE+PoDL will let us do, lets get into the design.</p>
<p>Marine scientists often need to make observations or stimulate the environment. The combination of harsh environmental conditions, specialised hardware, and tricky cross-domain skill-sets needed to develop bespoke hardware presents a special challenge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Did you know</em>: Playing sounds of healthy reefs can help attract marine life to damaged reefs and accelerate recovery processes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A single conductor pair providing power and data over long distances offers some interesting improvements in data rate, reduced power consumption, and simpler (cheaper/lighter) cabling.</p>
<p>Building on the Sparkfun MicroMod ecosystem (and hardware provided as part of the design challenge), I'll design replacements for the data-only ADIN1110 function boards which add PoDL capabilities.</p>
<p>Then we'll package them in a waterproof enclosure suitable for small sensing payloads as a technology demonstrator.</p>
<h3 id="mechanical-design" is="h3">Mechanical Design</h3>
<p>The electronics need to fit inside a practical waterproof housing, so I let the mechanical design drive the design choices for the electronics stack.</p>
<p>I considered building a housing out of PVC pipe with glands and a heaping of potting compound, but found <a href="https://bluerobotics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueRobotics</a> sell reasonably configurable waterproof housing parts for building custom modules for use on their ROV platforms. As a bonus, STEP models for most of their parts made it pretty easy to plan out the housing and mock up the electronics.</p>
<p>I chose the smallest 2″ acrylic tube (<em>~58mm OD</em>) and matching aluminium end-caps. This provides an internal volume constrained by the 50 mm tube diameter and ~118 mm maximum gap between bulkheads.</p>

<p>The top cap/bulkhead has 4×M10 threaded holes for accessories as part of BlueRobotic's hardware ecosystem. The prototype uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.5mm Wetlink penetrator for the tether cable</li>
<li>10m, high resolution pressure sensor</li>
<li>White indicator LED</li>
<li>Pressure relief/test valve</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst this prototype won't see properly deep water, BlueRobotics suggest this tube configuration should be capable of withstanding 200 meter operation, and far deeper if an aluminium sleeve is used.</p>
<p>I created mockup PCB models which I could use for board outlines in KiCAD, and to check how much height was available for the tall parts like SPE connector block and inductors.</p>

<p>There's a reasonable amount of room in the tube, but clearances like these usually have a habit of looking larger when being designed on a screen.</p>
<p>There are 3 PCB's that need to be designed - the main 'spine' PCB which behaves like a MicroMod compliant carrier board, and the power supply and device variants of the SPE+PoDL communications board.</p>
<h3 id="backplane-pcb" is="h3">Backplane PCB</h3>
<p>Acting as the MicroMod 'carrier', this board acts as the tube's electrical spine and provides the processor and function board NGFF (aka M.2) connectors, as well as USB and SWD connectors, a 3.3V regulator, some I2C headers, and breakout pads for expansion IO.</p>

<p>The hardest part of designing this board was trying to untangle the supported GPIO across the range of processor boards, and how that's mapped against the function boards. While Sparkfun's documentation and guides normally sit between '<em>pretty good</em>' and '<em>excellent</em>', this process was rather tedious.</p>
<p>From another (unfinished) project, I already had pretty much the entire range of MicroMod processor boards laying around (<code>ESP32</code>, <code>STM32F405</code>, <code>NRF52840</code>, <code>RP2040</code>, <code>SAMD51</code>, <code>Teensy</code>, <code>Apollo3</code>/Artemis) and wanted the design to support the widest range of targets possible (the whole point of MicroMod).</p>
<p>This list of options is cut down substantially if much more than the primary SPI and I2C busses are needed, you want <code>ADIN1110</code> example library to work, and most processor boards have subtle implementation inconsistencies which turn the pin allocation into a trade-off balancing act.</p>

<p>It's a two-layer 46 x 100 mm 1.6 mm 2-layer board with pretty relaxed fabrication requirements, costing under $10 from typical commodity Chinese PCBA fabs.</p>
<p>I opted to try the taller 4mm solderable standoff on the rear for sensor mounting and added some spare IO pads and solderable links to make/break the <code>I2C1</code> bus from the connectors.</p>

<p>The key areas of discussion are the signature circuitry, and how power is handled once the supply enables full bus voltage.</p>

<p>From left to right, we've got a <code>AP7375</code> wide input voltage LDO which can tolerate bus voltage providing the 3.3V supply to a <code>MCP65R41T</code> comparator with an internal 1.2V internal reference.</p>
<p>The voltage divider (<code>R1</code>, <code>R2</code>) is configured to output approximately 1.2V (matching the internal reference voltage) for a 4.05V input voltage. The output of the comparator then controls a simple N-channel mosfet which switches the <code>TL431</code> shunt regulator on or off, resulting in a regulated voltage which matches the signature voltage range.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In bench testing the signature voltage measured on the supply side was ~3.905V, slightly lower than intended.</p>
<p>I ended up replacing <code>R2</code> with 390k to compensate for voltage drop over the rectifier diodes, resulting in a signature voltage of 4.4V.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming the detection circuit works correctly, the power supply would then enable the full bus voltage of 24VDC.</p>

<p>The <code>TPS26625</code> eFuse switch is configured to automatically switch on once the input voltage is above the PoDL Class 10-12 minimum voltage specification of 14V. It also provides configurable over-voltage and current limiting which makes a compact layout possible.</p>
<p>The 5V regulator is an interesting part - the Texas Instruments <code>TLVM23625</code> is a tiny, 36V capable, 2.5A switch-mode regulator with an integrated inductor and switch. This was pretty helpful with the constrained layout.</p>
<p>The 5V output is used to power the function board's 3.3V LDO, and also back-powers the carrier board. I included a current shunt and amplifier allow for sink-side current measurement on the 5V rail.</p>

<p>This board shares the input coupling network and <code>ADIN1110</code> design with the PD board, but replaces the detection signalling circuitry and bulk regulator with the necessary circuitry to test and detect valid downstream devices.

<p>Unlike the PD board, managing the detection process does require microcontroller interaction to enable the current source, watch the detection circuit, and then disable the current source before enabling the HV switch.</p>
<p>Additionally, maintain full voltage signature (MVFS) behaviour needs the microcontroller to monitor the current sense signal for a minimum peak load of 11mA per 10ms span to keep the power supply  active (though this can be set lower if needed).</p>

<p>From left to right, a 7V output wide input LDO powers the current stimulus circuit. Instead of building a constant-current source from scratch, I use a <code>NSI50010YT1G</code> LED driver IC which is switched on/off by a P-channel mosfet. This approach is intentionally simple, but probably not ideal as there's limited control over the current output and startup slew-rate.</p>
<p>The current source output is protected from the switched 24V output by a diode, and also has a 5.6V zener diode to clamp the output voltage to the specified maximum open-loop voltage of 5.5V.</p>
<p>Once the downstream powers up and starts presenting the signature voltage range of 4.05V to 4.55V, the <code>TLV6700</code> window comparator output provides the microcontroller with the <code>VID_VALID</code> signal.</p>
<p>The microcontroller then enables this board's <code>TPS26625</code> eFuse to pass the 24V input supply to the downstream device. On this board, the eFuse's ULVO and OVP is configured for the Class 10-12 allowable PSE range of 20-30V.</p>

<p>I'm a little annoyed with how the detection circuitry part placement and routing turned out, a mix of rushing the design late at night and higher part count made it tricky to fit in the same area as the PD's circuitry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an aside, this PSE design probably makes more sense as it's own carrier board, or as a media converter to 10BaseT ethernet.</p>
<p>Implementing it as a function board allowed for design re-use and opens up some flexibility in final use-cases though.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="printable-mounting-brackets" is="h3">Printable mounting brackets</h3>
<p>With the boards designed, I brought exported STEP models back into my CAD model and designed a pair of 3D printed board mounts use the 4×M3 internal mounting holes in the bulkheads.</p>
<p>The upper bracket abuses the solderable standoffs on the rear of the backplane board as mounting features, along with the key cutout in the PCB to force alignment.</p>

<p>Because the mounted electronics need to slide through the tube to meet the other end-cap, a simple tapered groove design is used to retain the PCB once installed.</p>
<h3 id="electronics-assembly--testing" is="h3">Electronics Assembly &amp; Testing</h3>
<p>PCBs and printed parts were ordered from China and arrived in South Australia in a pretty impressive 4-days. The components from DigiKey arrived a day or two later.</p>
<span>
      
    </span>
<p>I assembled 2 of each board using a pretty typical paste stencil and reflow plate, with some hot air assisting for heavier parts.</p>
<span>
      
    </span>
<p>Bring-up testing didn't throw any surprises, I started with a lab supply to check the power paths didn't have any critical errors.</p>
<p>The PD board eFuse ULVO/OVP behaviour and 5V regulator behaved as expected. The rectifier and decoupling network also handled 24V with either polarity without issue, dropping about 0.4V across the rectifier diodes.</p>
<p>Testing the PSE board was similar, checking the current source output with a multimeter, then using the lab supply to provide a 4.2V test voltage to trigger the window comparator's output.</p>

<p>I quickly wrote some simple PD detection handling code which uses a state-machine to control the detection behaviour:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the current source,</li>
<li>Wait for the downstream device to boot,</li>
<li>Check the comparator output for VID valid flag (and filter it),</li>
<li>Disable the current source, wait a bit,</li>
<li>Enable the power switch to enable 24V supply.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scope trace below shows the PoDL bus voltage in yellow (<code>CH1</code>), and the PD board's 5V regulator is the blue trace (<code>CH2</code>). The state-machine timing was intentionally slowed down to make the trace easier to understand.</p>

<p>We can see the current source enable, settle at 4.4V for 5ms, then decay once the current source is disabled. Then the 24V switch enables with a nicely controlled slew rate thanks to the eFuse, followed by the 5V regulator cleanly coming up a couple of milliseconds later.</p>
<p>This is a successful power up sequence for 24V PoDL!</p>
<p>On the data side, I mounted the custom function boards into the MicroMod function carrier and flashed some basic Arduino test sketches to exercise the ADIN1110's self-test loopback.</p>

<p>We can communicate with the MAC over SPI successfully, so that part of the implementation is also working fine!</p>
<h4 id="making-late-night-mistakes" is="h4">Making late night mistakes</h4>
<p>At this point, it's rather amazing that the design and implementation has gone almost perfectly to plan...</p>
<p>So I tried testing a 6S LiPo battery as my 'field' 24V source instead of my lab supply. I'm sure a few of you reading are seeing where this is going.</p>
<p>The inrush spike resulted in the PSE board's onboard (unprotected) 7V LDO being sacrificed to the cause. Hindsight is 20/20 and immediate, so I cobbled together a simple resistor based soft-start circuit and filter from scrap parts to prevent any future mishaps.</p>
<p>Also, it was about this time when I noticed I had unfortunately placed the processor board mounting standoff about 1.05mm further than it's intended position. Not a big deal, but incredibly frustrating to see gap between screw and board edge.</p>
<h3 id="firmware" is="h3">Firmware</h3>
<p>With the electronics <em>mostly</em> working without issue, it was time to interface to the test sensors and send some packets.</p>
<p>The boards were designed without assuming any specific sensors would be used, but I used these I2C sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature &amp; Humidity - <code>SHTC3</code> via <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16467" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sparkfun <code>SEN-16467</code></a></li>
<li>Motion - <code>LSM6DSO</code> via <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sparkfun <code>SEN-18020</code></a></li>
<li>Depth/Pressure - <code>MS5837</code> via <a href="https://bluerobotics.com/store/sensors-cameras/sensors/bar02-sensor-r1-rp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueRobotics <code>Bar02</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Sparkfun breakouts mount directly to the standoffs on the rear of the backplane board.</p>
<p>The <code>Bar02</code> comes with a JST-GH connector, so I re-terminated it with a JST-SH connector for consistency with the other boards and headers on the backplane PCB.</p>
<p>Attempting to avoid any more scope-creep, I opted to use the Arduino ecosystem instead of going bare-metal with my preferred STM32 or ESP32 toolchains. The promise of quick integration with pre-made libraries for the sensors, T1L transciever, and communications protocol was alluring.</p>
<p>The project is structured as a simple super-loop which runs some state-machines to handle polling sensors before packing data into packets for transfer over SPE.</p>
<h4 id="writing-a-ms5837-driver" is="h4">Writing a MS5837 Driver</h4>
<p>The very cool <code>MS5837-02</code> pressure sensor supports absurdly high precision (via oversampling) at rather high sample rates - starting with a base resolution of <code>0.11 mbar</code> at <code>1.5kHz</code> and <code>0.016 mbar</code> at <code>~60Hz</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Converting the pressure resolution into a more understandable unit puts the absurdity of this sensor into context:</p>
<p><code>0.016 mbar</code> equates to a depth change of roughly <code>0.16 millimeters</code> in sea water. <code>160 μm</code>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the BlueRobotics Arduino driver only supports the maximum oversampling (<code>OSR = 8192</code>) setting and forces a 40ms blocking delay...</p>
<p>I implemented a generic C library to work with the <code>MS5837-02</code>, letting the integrating developer take back some control over configuration and sampling behaviour. This approach allows the library to be used with a simple state-machine or with RTOS style yields.</p>

<p>While the temperature is needed for the 2nd order pressure compensation maths, I didn't see any downside from reducing the temperature oversampling slightly which also allows for quicker turnaround time.</p>
<p>My driver is a simple open-sourced and <a href="https://github.com/Scottapotamas/MS5837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available standalone on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h4 id="internal-sensors" is="h4">Internal Sensors</h4>
<p>The SHTC3 and LSM6DS0 Arduino libraries were better behaved, and I was able to throw together a reasonable implementation sampling the IMU's FIFO buffer reasonably easily.</p>
<h4 id="adin1110-serial-bridge" is="h4">ADIN1110 Serial Bridge</h4>
<p>At the start of the project I wanted to implement proper TCP/IP support via LwIP to connect the sensor node directly to a normal Ethernet network through a media converter, but the lack of integration examples and diminishing amount of time meant I knew I would run out of time during debugging. Maybe next time!</p>
<p>Building off Sparkfun's reasonably thin <code>sfe_spe_advanced</code> wrapper around Analog Device's library, I was able to send raw buffers of bytes between the transcievers with fairly minimal effort.</p>
<p>Because I'm familiar with the protocol (and wrote the library) I was able to connect the <code>electricui-embedded</code> read and write callbacks, and setup the power-supply side MicroMod process to act as a nearly transparent SPE-to-Serial proxy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that a 10 Mbps networked node was constrained by a 10x slower serial link (<code>912600 baud</code>) was slightly amusing, but will hopefully be an area I can address with a bit more time in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="user-interface" is="h3">User Interface</h3>
<p>I'm using Electric UI's <a href="https://electricui.com/docs/interface/transformer">DataFlow and DataTransformer</a> system to calculate real-time wave height statistics on the stream of depth sensor data. Turns out wave analysis and meaningful visualisations are slightly non-trivial, so I'll probably write a second post going into greater depth.</p>
<p>As a quick overview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter the incoming pressure measurement stream to reduce noise,</li>
<li>Calculate the rate of depth change (derivative),</li>
<li>Detect peak and troughs, and the time between them,</li>
<li>Average the midpoint height of detected waves to create a long-running reference depth,</li>
<li>Generate a histogram to show wave behaviour relative to the reference depth.</li>
</ul>
<p>These statistics are data-loggable alongside the raw sensor streams.</p>

<p>Also pictured is the <em>vanity</em> <code>APA102-2020</code> LED rings which were intended to act as an adjustable mock load to test the power delivery components.</p>
<p>The printed mount was then screwed to the aluminium cap, where I had already installed the 2-core tether cable and external sensors.</p>

<p>Once assembled, I removed the pressure-relief valve stem and attached a vacuum pump to perform a leak test.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm pretty happy with how everything turned out, just wished I had a bit more time for refinement!</p>
<h2 id="field-testing" is="h2">Field Testing</h2>
<p>We tested the tube in a pool briefly to check buoyancy. During the early mechanical design stages I created a simple spreadsheet to estimate the assembly mass and displacement from first-principles which suggested additional ballast weight was not needed (slightly negatively buoyant). In the real-world it was slightly positively buoyant and could use a bit of extra weight.</p>
<p>Being the natural over-achiever (and qualified diver) that he is, my colleague Michael suggested we should give it real-world test.</p>
<p>We drove down to a popular dive reef with good jetty access to test the sensor node.</p>

<p>By stitching some velcro lengths to each side of some printed mounting clamps, it provided a fairly easily removable and non-invasive mounting solution that could be handled underwater.</p>
<p>If the sensor node was deployed for longer periods of time, a more carefully designed mount would be necessary.</p>

   <p>Off the coast of California is an unusual "octopus garden" — the largest congregation of deep-sea octopuses ever discovered on Earth, where over 6,000 octopuses huddle around an extinct underwater volcano in the black, cold ocean depths, almost two miles below the surface. </p>   <p>Most are brooding females that spend their days doing nothing but guarding nests full of eggs, a tedious task which can take nearly two years.<strong> </strong>It would take even longer if not for the warm water seeping from the seafloor that speeds up<strong> </strong>the growth of their babies, according to new <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg3247">research</a> that suggests this natural incubator is why octopuses gather there in such huge numbers. </p>   
   <p>The discovery, published in the journal <em>Science Advances</em> on Wednesday, highlights how low-key hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor can create isolated patches of cozy warmth, hidden in the darkness, that could play an outsized role in supporting deep-sea life. Thousands of such spots could be dotted up and down coastlines, researchers say. </p>   <p>"It's definitely a special site for these animals. It's a breeding site for this octopus. It has effects for the entire community nearby that then has spillover effects beyond that," says <a href="https://www.mbari.org/person/james-barry/">Jim Barry</a> of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California, the lead researcher for this work. "So it's regionally important and we still know very little about it. How many more of these are there?"</p>   <h3>A surprise in shimmering water </h3>   <p>Scientists found this site about five years ago, when a submersible vehicle got sent to explore some underwater hills around Davidson Seamount, a submerged mountain off the coast of central California that once was a volcano. </p>   <p>While the seamount was well-studied, the surrounding areas were not, and researchers were shocked when the vehicle's headlamps suddenly revealed large groups of purple octopuses, <em>Muusoctopus robustus</em>, that were crouched over nests of eggs.</p>   <p>Octopuses generally are antisocial loners that would rather fight another octopus than live in close quarters. And yet biologists had stumbled onto an enormous octopus garden, a trippy scene straight out of a Beatles song. </p>   
   <p>"They thought, 'Well, let's get a really close look.' And as they zoomed into these octopus, then they saw this shimmering water and they realized this is a thermal spring, this is warm water coming out. And that was somewhat of a surprise because this is an inactive volcano," explains Barry.</p>

   <p>The first time scientists ever <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg3247">observed</a> a bunch of deep-sea octopuses gathering together was about a decade ago, in another place where warm water seeped out of the seafloor, off Costa Rica. But researchers studying that rocky outcrop didn't see any viable eggs and thought that perhaps the higher temperatures there had harmed their development. </p>   <p>Just this summer, however, <a href="https://schmidtocean.org/scientists-discover-new-deep-sea-octopus-nurseries-in-costa-rica/">another expedition</a> revisited that outcrop and saw that it was actually an active, successful nursery. </p>   <p>"It really kind of blew my mind because it is so drastically different and they're taking observations in the exact same places that we had been looking at," says <a href="https://ccom.unh.edu/user/ahartwell">Anne Hartwell</a>, with the Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center at the University of New Hampshire, who visited the Costa Rica site in 2014.</p>   <p>Hartwell is part of the team that recently spent months doing robotic work to study the octopus garden near California, to figure out what role warm water might play in drawing octopuses together. </p>   <p>"The robots we use are so advanced and they have such great technology and cameras and dexterity with their mechanical arms," says Hartwell. "They enable us to not quite be down there in person, but get a lot done as if we were."</p>   <p>The researchers mapped an area the size of a few football fields in detail, installed a time-lapse camera that watched octopuses continuously, and visited individual octopus nests again and again while monitoring water temperatures with probes. </p>   <div id="res1195199276">

   <p>"We found 6,000 animals in just a small area, and that was just a portion of where the octopuses are distributed. So we're estimating, I don't know, up to 20,000 animals may be there," explains Barry. He adds that the female octopuses are so focused on tending their nests that they mostly ignored the investigators. </p>   
   <p>"We can drive up to within eight inches of them and hold a camera right there. They don't do a thing," he says. </p>   <h3>The allure of rare warmth in the deep </h3>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1195402656" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>The ocean water at this depth is normally about 35 degrees Fahrenheit, but the spa-like waters seeping out of cracks and crevices got up to about 51 degrees Fahrenheit—and that's where the octopuses wanted to brood. </p>   <p>"The females only nest in warm sites. As far as we can tell, we could find none in cold waters," says Barry. "There are plenty of nesting sites available, but they don't nest on just any bare rock. They only choose those sites where there's a nice warm pool. And in fact, if one female leaves, we found that another one will jump in there within a couple of weeks."</p>   <p>What's more, he says, the octopus eggs matured much more quickly than one would expect, based on what's known about other octopuses that live in the cold ocean depths. </p>   <p>Brood times for nesting females there seemed to be about 1.8 years, while previous <a href="https://www.mbari.org/news/deep-sea-octopus-broods-eggs-for-over-four-years-longer-than-any-known-animal/">observations</a> of a deep-sea octopus in cold water showed that it took 4.5 years for its eggs to hatch, a length of time longer than any other animal. </p>   <p>Biologists know from prior research that warming generally speeds the pace of octopus embryo development. Barry says that having a shorter brooding period should give the offspring a greater chance of survival, since the female octopuses and their developing embryos would spend less time in an immobile, vulnerable state.   </p>   <div id="res1195201918">

   <p>"Seeing that they are getting a brooding time of 1.8 years is awesome.

It's like, whoa."</p>   <p>But these female octopuses have given up their predatory life to reproduce and, instead, they themselves are being eaten when they die. The octopus garden seems to support a teeming variety of other life such as crustaceans, anemones and snails. "These are all parts of an ecosystem that's sustained by the octopus being there and dying in there," Voight says.</p>   <p>Despite the richness of this ecosystem, it could easily have been missed by explorers, because the ocean bottom is so vast and dark, illuminated only for brief moments by the lights of slow-moving exploration vehicles. </p>   <p>"When you think of the deep sea, it's kind of muddy and flat and nothing too much conspicuous around," says Voight. "Then you stumble upon something like this and it's like a bonanza."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>
  Hello,<br>
  today we are going to talk about some flying robot behavior improvements. Some of the problems we fixed were reported countless times, so I hope that some people will appreciate it :).
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Quality of life versus flashy features<author>kovarex</author></h3>
<p>
  I know that you are mainly looking forward to the new content, and that <i>just</i>
  quality of life improvements aren't the kind of things that make people buy the game and get excited for.
</p>

<p>
  But I strongly believe, that if you want to add content, mechanics, and systems to a game, which already isn't simple, there is always a risk of just it being too much. By doing QOL improvements, we reduce the small hassles and annoyances, which effectively creates an extra mental space to enjoy more in the game. Its like cleaning your room before getting a new toy.
</p>

<p>
  So to make things clear, the reason that we make and present these kind of changes is not because we don't want to make new flashy features, we just want the new stuff to be enjoyable without a burden of having too much to deal with.<br>
  But don't worry, we will show something new next week!
</p>

<h3>Smarter robot tasks<author>Oxyd</author></h3>

<p>
  Logistic and construction robots have been in the game for a while, and at their
  core they are fairly simple entities. A logistic robot, for example, may be told
  to go pick up an item from a chest, and deliver it to another chest. So far so
  good, but in Factorio there usually is more than one item to be transferred —
  so what does the game do when tasked with transferring, say, 500 items from one
  box to another?
</p>

<h4>The Old Way</h4>
<p>
  In Factorio 1.1, the game keeps a list of all idle robots, including those
  hiding away in roboports, and when a task needs to be taken care of, it
  selects the nearest idle robot from that list. So, to transfer 500 items from
  a provider chest to requester, the game would find the first idle robot
  closest to the provider chest and task it with the transfer. This robot now
  has a task, so it is removed from the list of idle robots.
</p>

<p>
  But we still have 499 other items to transfer (ignoring robot capacity bonus
  for simplicity). The logistic network simply repeats the previous steps for
  all the other items — find the next closest idle robot, task it with
  transferring the next item and so on until there is a robot for each of the
  500 items in the box.
</p>

<p>
  The problem with this strategy is that while the first few robots may be
  located in roboports reasonably close to the provider chest, by the time we
  get to the last items the network may have to reach for robots at the other
  end of the factory because there is no closer idle robot for the task. The
  end result is that the first batch of robots will arrive at the chest, take
  the item and deliver it to the destination, and then recharge and go have a
  nap in a roboport — transferring a single item was all these robots were
  tasked with and the remaining items have already been assigned to other
  robots. After that, a slow trickle of robots from far away parts of the
  factory will come in and transfer the remaining items.
</p>

  </p>
</div>


<p>
  The situation is similar for construction robots, and this can be especially
  apparent when using one's portable roboport. Say the player wants to remove a
  bunch of trees in their factory. A single personal roboport can have up
  to 25 construction robots, so that's up to 25 trees that will be
  deconstructed using the player's personal robots. All remaining trees will
  be assigned to robots from the main logistic network, and the player will
  have to wait for them to arrive for the trees to be gone — even though the
  player's personal robots are right there with nothing better to do!
</p>

    </video>
  </p>
</div>


<h4>The New Way</h4>
<p>
  Choosing a robot for a task only from the list of idle robots clearly isn't
  the best strategy. Assigning a task to a robot that is currently busy but
  nearby may be a better choice, even if the new task may have to wait until
  the robot finishes its other tasks. This required two main changes to the
  logistic network code.
</p>

<p>
  The first change was to allow robots to have multiple tasks assigned to
  them. Much of the code has been written with the assumption that a robot
  has exactly one job, but after some code refactor, robots now have a queue of tasks.
</p>

<p>
  Second, we need a way to select a robot for a task. Each task has a starting position,
  for example a deconstruction order starts at the entity to be deconstructed. Until now, the selection process
  was simple — just select the idle robot closest to that point.<br>
  But now, when we can also select a robot with one or more queued tasks, the process
  becomes a bit more complex.
</p>

<p>
  The new metric for robot selection is the <i>arrival time</i>. For an idle robot,
  its arrival time is simply the distance to the starting position divided by its speed.
  For a busy robot, we can look through its queue of tasks, figure out where and when the robot is
  going to end up when its done, and then add the flight time from there to the starting position of the new job.<br>
  When selecting a robot for a task, we select the one that is going to arrive first, even if it has to take care
  of other things before that.
</p>

<p>
  It is worth pointing out that the arrival time calculation is only an estimate.
  For example, we simplify the effects of the recharging times.
  A keen-eyed player will no doubt notice situations where choosing a different
  robot could have been a little bit more efficient.
  But in the big picture, it doesn't seem to be very noticeable.
</p>

<p>
  Let's see how the new system handles our previous two examples. The initial batch of robots is tasked with
  transferring all the items which results in them shuffling back and forth
  between the requester and the provider.
</p>

    </video>
  </p>
</div>


<p>
  For deconstructing trees, each of the player's personal robots does more than
  just a single tree. Robots from the main network still come to help out, but
  this time it's because they can help get the whole job done faster.
</p>

  </p>
</div>


<h4>Performance</h4>
<p>
  Having a simple list of all busy robots and going through it each time a new
  task comes in may work fine for small factories, but with several thousand
  robots flying everywhere it can quickly become a UPS drain. To alleviate
  that, we implemented a different representation.
</p>

<p>
  Whenever a robot's queue of tasks is updated, it calculates its final
  position estimate — that is, its final position and the time at which it
  will finish. Each map chunk now stores a list of all busy robots that are
  estimated to finish on that chunk. So when a robot updates its final position
  estimate, it registers itself in that chunk's list of robots. When searching
  for a robot for a particular task, the game now starts its search at the
  chunk where the job's starting position is located, and continues its search in
  an outward spiral.
</p>

<p>
  Storing busy robots on chunks and searching in a spiral improved the
  performance by a lot, and even factories with thousands of busy robots run well.
</p>

<h3>Smarter robot other things<author>Klonan</author></h3>

<p>
  While playing and developing the expansion for the last 2 years, we have also accumulated a few more features and changes to make the robots feel smarter and work better.
</p>

<h4>Roboport robot requests</h4>

<p>
  There are some situations when you need to make sure some roboports always have robots to service tasks. For example if you have a little resupply point with buffer chests, you want logistic robots around to quickly empty your trash and refill your supplies. It is quite annoying when all the materials are right there, but you are stuck waiting around, because due to natural robot migratory patterns, the roboports in the area are quite empty.
</p>

<div>
    <p>
      <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="">
        <source src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-374-robot-requests-before.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Mp4 playback not supported on your device.
      </video>
    </p>
  </div>


<p>
  It could be solved with requester chests, inserters, circuit network, and such... but we decided a smoother approach. You can now set logistic requests for robots directly inside the roboport GUI. Robots will be dispatched from other roboports to fulfill the request (important to note, robots will not be taken from storage or provider chests).
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-374-robot-requests-gui.png">
</p>

<p>
  With this new feature, we can set all the roboports near our resupply point to always have 100 logistic robots available. Once we arrive, our needs are serviced in record time, and afterwards you can see robots arriving to get the roboport back up to 100.
</p>

<div>
  <p>
    <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="">
      <source src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-374-robot-requests-after.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Mp4 playback not supported on your device.
    </video>
  </p>
</div>


<p>
  Another nice use of this is that we can use the roboport requests to remove certain robots from the network. Perchance we had some mod with higher quality worker robots, we can request the low quality ones and remove them with a filter inserter, over time removing the worse robots from circulation.
</p>

<h4>Better robot charging heuristic</h4>

<p>
  When a worker robots runs low on energy, they need to find a nearby roboport to charge at, but they need to be a little bit smart about it. For instance if they always chose the closest roboport, then you would get queues and traffic jams at some roboports while others are completely empty.
</p>

<p>
  For these 'smarts' we use a quite simple heuristic, factoring in not just how close the roboport is, but also how many other robots are currently charging there. Typically this worked 'well enough' but every so often you could encounter a little inconvenient situation where they are still bunching up on some roboports while ignoring others that are just a little bit further.
</p>

<div>
  <p>
    <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="">
      <source src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-374-charging-heuristic-before.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Mp4 playback not supported on your device.
    </video>
  </p>
</div>


<p>
  In some extreme cases this can actually be quite a problem, as the robots waiting to charge still use energy for hovering, so lose more energy, in a positive feedback loop where all robots who join the queue will fall to 0 energy while they are waiting their turn. Generally though the main problem here is that the player looks at the robots and thinks "These robots are so dumb...". Not the end of the world, but we can do better...
</p>

<p>
  Surprisingly in this case the issue can be helped a lot by just a small improvement in the heuristic logic. When deciding which roboport to charge at, the robots crucially did not consider the current robots on the way to that roboport, only those already in the queue, and did not factor in how many free charging spots the roboport has open. By adding these two extra parameters into the equations, the distribution of the robots improves quite nicely.
</p>

<h4>
  Mitigation for robot pathing over lakes
</h4>

<p>
  It has been a problem for a long time, the robots are pretty dumb when it comes to pathfinding, and try to fly over areas that have no logistic network coverage. This is because for performance reasons, we don't do any pathfinding at all. The robots just fly in a straight line to the job position.
</p>

<p>
  One major problem of this is the possibility of the robots to get stuck in an infinite loop. This is because they fly out over uncovered territory, run out of battery, and return back to recharge and try again. Obviously they will never make it.
</p>

<div>
  <p>
    <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="">
      <source src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-374-robot-path-before.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Mp4 playback not supported on your device.
    </video>
  </p>
</div>


<p>
  This issue was notable enough and annoying enough for us that we really did want to come up with a fix. The solution we came to was a smart trick in the roboport selection when they run out of energy. Usually the robot just chooses one of the nearest roboports, which is fine for normal circumstances, but in this case leads to the robot turning completely around in failure.
</p>

<p>
  So we changed the selection logic, so that the robot tries to always charge at a roboport that is closer to the destination than the robot is. This means that even if the robot will potentially fly with low energy for longer, it will always be able to make some progress towards the target, and eventually complete their mission.
</p>

    </video>
  </p>
</div>


<p>
  It is not a perfect solution, but should hopefully help prevent the most egregious issue of this technical constraint.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>Andrew Marble<br><a href="http://marble.onl/">marble.onl</a><br>andrew@willows.ai<br>August 30, 2023</p>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil liberties advocacy group, recently published a good article entitled “ISPs Should Not Police Online Speech—No Matter How Awful It Is.”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It argues that providers within the internet “stack” should refrain from censoring traffic according to their own values. That laws and regulations already exist to deal with norms around content; subjective single chokepoint censorship will inevitably be abused and not limited to things universally agreed as worth blocking; and that once infrastructure providers start applying their own judgements, pressure will mount to censor more and more things. Importantly, they’re not advocating for a free-for-all, but against vigilante justice, advocating that legal and regulatory mechanisms be used to deal with infringing content.</p>
<p>The AI industry would be well served by taking a similar stance with respect to model licensing. A core principle of open source software licenses is non-discrimination in how the software is used. Copyright holders open sourcing their licenses rightly do not concern themselves with end uses. This is not an invitation for illegal use (which is already illegal). It’s an implicit acknowledgement that a license is the wrong place to try and enforce opinions, norms, laws, whatever you want to call them, about use.</p>
<p>Recently we’ve seen (so-called) “ethical” and commercially oriented licenses pushed as alternatives to open-source. I’m talking specifically here about AI models where the weights are released for download, not about served models or infrastructure. For example, the OpenRail++ license used by StableDiffusionXL includes the following schedule<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You agree not to use the Model or Derivatives of the Model:</p>
<p>In any way that violates any applicable national, federal, state, local or international law or regulation;</p>
<p>For the purpose of exploiting, harming or attempting to exploit or harm minors in any way;</p>
<p>To generate or disseminate verifiably false information and/or content with the purpose of harming others;</p>
<p>To generate or disseminate personal identifiable information that can be used to harm an individual;</p>
<p>To defame, disparage or otherwise harass others;</p>
<p>For fully automated decision making that adversely impacts an individual’s legal rights or otherwise creates or modifies a binding, enforceable obligation;</p>
<p>For any use intended to or which has the effect of discriminating against or harming individuals or groups based on online or offline social behavior or known or predicted personal or personality characteristics;</p>
<p>To exploit any of the vulnerabilities of a specific group of persons based on their age, social, physical or mental characteristics, in order to materially distort the behavior of a person pertaining to that group in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological harm;</p>
<p>For any use intended to or which has the effect of discriminating against individuals or groups based on legally protected characteristics or categories;</p>
<p>To provide medical advice and medical results interpretation;</p>
<p>To generate or disseminate information for the purpose to be used for administration of justice, law enforcement, immigration or asylum processes, such as predicting an individual will commit fraud/crime commitment (e.g. by text profiling, drawing causal relationships between assertions made in documents, indiscriminate and arbitrarily-targeted use).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This combines things that are already illegal, things that are subject to current regulation, things that arguably should be subject to regulation, and judgements of the copyright holder about what AI should not be used for. Likewise, Facebook’s LLaMA model contains various usage restrictions<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, including the usual enumeration of illegal things but notably (bolding mine)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2. Engage in, promote, incite, facilitate, or assist in the planning or development of activities that present a risk of death or bodily harm to individuals, including use of Llama 2 <strong>related to the following:</strong></p>
<p>a. Military, warfare, nuclear industries or applications, espionage, use for materials or activities that are subject to the International Traffic Arms Regulations (ITAR) maintained by the United States Department of State</p>
<p>b. Guns and illegal weapons (including weapon development)</p>
<p>c. Illegal drugs and regulated/controlled substances</p>
<p>d. Operation of critical infrastructure, transportation technologies, or heavy machinery</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are clearly value judgements about specific things. While we don’t know the motivations, the result is that Facebook has acted as a kind of vigilante censor telling us how we can and cannot use source code in an extra-legal way.</p>
<p>The choice of license resides with the companies releasing the models. However, the resources required to build these models put them firmly in the same category as backbone infrastructure providers, and so applying their own values on uses has the same negative effect as internet censorship. They’ve already crossed from just restricting purely illegal uses to specific legal ones (guns, military), as well as restricted “disinformation” which has become a synonym for disagreement. It’s only a matter of time until special interests push for more restrictions, including ones that you don’t agree with. To make matters worse, past open source licenses were uniform (other than the copyright/copyleft divide) making assembling a system out of different software components straightforward. If we have to start taking the morals imposed by every model provider into account when building AI solutions, this adds an added complication that will surely benefit some bureaucrat but that’s overall a dead weight on the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Again, there are existing laws and regulations that deal with inappropriate uses, and current efforts to enact more to deal specifically with AI. Advocating against corporate censorship or restriction doesn’t mean agreeing with all uses, it means imposing the restrictions democratically and not through vigilantism. So far these restrictions have received little attention in the AI community. We need stronger norms and more pressure calling out restrictive licenses, even if we agree with the current restrictions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Not long ago if you went to McDonalds for a coffee, it came with a sticker on the cup. If you saved up six on a little piece of card (also on the cup), your 7<sup>th</sup> coffee was free. A simple system, and very private.</p><p>That sticker system was scrapped in 2020, for an app<sup>1</sup>. Suddenly, McDonalds have gone from knowing nothing about you, to collecting your financial info, your location and even looking at your search and browsing history. And for your &lt;cough&gt; convenience, you can sign-in with Facebook, Google or Apple.</p><p>OK, so I work in business too, and it’s imperative that you use data to understand customer behaviour and market to them. But do you really need this level of information? This is just one example of what I refer to as ‘creeping surveillance’.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://elnion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blog-2-Appstore-screen-shot-sm.jpeg" alt="" width="353" height="750" srcset="https://elnion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blog-2-Appstore-screen-shot-sm.jpeg 470w, https://elnion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blog-2-Appstore-screen-shot-sm-141x300.jpeg 141w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://elnion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blog-2-Appstore-screen-shot-sm.jpeg"></figure><p><strong>How data about you is monetized</strong></p><p>I can only guess at what all that data is used for in the example above<sup>2</sup>, but it’s typical of many apps that give you free stuff in exchange for data. I also don’t want to beat-up on McDonalds – as a reputable business they do provide opt-outs and are doing a lot to transform their business into a more sustainable one, which is great news.</p><p>Much more problematic are where the developer’s ONLY purpose for the app is to siphon your data – the user functions are merely a ruse designed to get you to install it. From games to widgets, productivity apps, and even ones that claim to <em>protect</em> your privacy. Whatever function you need, you can be pretty sure there’s a ‘data vampire’ app for that.</p><p>But why? Well, data about you is a lucrative business.</p><p><strong>We value your privacy</strong></p><p>It may be the biggest lie ever told. They sure do value it though. They value it because your privacy is up for sale all over the place – and mostly, WITH your consent<sup>3</sup>. Cookie walls – you hate them, so you click OK. Privacy policies – you hate them too, so you don’t read them. Data collection opt-outs are hidden or long winded. It’s all by design. It’s called obfuscation, and they want you to give in. Even user ‘privacy control panels’ are mostly designed to mislead you – all of which, incidentally, is not technically allowed under GDPR.</p><p>Data about you<sup>4</sup> makes $billions for big tech, but smaller companies can still make huge profits from personal data collected from websites and apps. Depending on the level of detail, the data from just a few thousand individuals could net thousands of dollars for a small company, or even a lone developer. It all goes into a pot that profiles you to a scary level of detail – believe me when I say they can predict your actions better than you can. That’s why real time bidding ad-clicks can go for anything from a few cents to $2 and up. Remember, that’s just for a single user click on an ad.</p><p><strong>It’s time for business to believe in choice</strong></p><p>Creeping surveillance has become normalized when it really should not be – it’s dysfunctional. Many people believe privacy to be a human right. Even Mark Zuckerberg purchased the properties surrounding his own<sup>5</sup> to create a privacy buffer for his family (which you contributed to, I’m sure he’s grateful). It’s not the only example – Larry Page, the co-founder of Google is a famously private person. The fact is that the people that want to trade on <em>your</em> privacy, crave it for themselves.</p><p>This is why data collection should be a choice. Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. Let’s not forget that many people are happy with data collection – they <em>want</em> the most integrated and tailored experience possible.&nbsp; And they want it even though they know the ramifications; I’ve met ‘privacy professionals’ that think this way. Personally, I do my best to avoid tracking, apart from with the companies I trust, then I play the game. Surely looking for engaged people like that means you’ve found your hot prospect?</p><p>Talking from the business side for a moment, there are plenty of ways to combine tactics – tokenisation, anonymization, differential marketing (and more), in addition to what I’m sad to say has become ‘traditional’ data collection. Let people choose, it fosters trust. Make it simple to select what level of tracking people are comfortable with, including ‘none’. This layered approach will make your prospects and customers happy – if they trust you. It shouldn’t really trouble you unless you are Meta, Google, or swathe of other big names, of course.</p><p>The problem is that marketing teams are under so much pressure to get lead numbers up, lead quality suffers. This is often driven by sales management demanding more leads, only to complain about lead quality afterwards, at which point they blame marketing. So, whether you’re in sales and marketing or just reading this with a casual interest in privacy, consider this. When the starting gun was fired on GDPR in May 2018, many US websites worried about the legal consequences blocked European visitors, but the New York Times took a different approach. They dropped real-time bidding and behavioural ads and focused on contextual and regional ads instead. The NYT ad business continued to grow ‘nicely’ as they put it<sup>6</sup>, even without all that creepy targeting.</p><p>In my next blog I’ll be looking at what you can do to preserve your privacy. When you lose ground to this sort of creeping erosion of your rights, it can be really very hard to reclaim them, so it’s important that we all keep fighting.</p><hr><p>1: This blog refers to the UK App; screen shot shows the privacy information from Apple’s UK app store. Data collection may vary by country or region</p><p>2: I have asked McDonalds why they need my browsing history on several occasions, but so far, they have not responded</p><p>3: Don’t get hung-up on consent folks, it’s not needed if a business has what’s called a ‘legitimate interest’ – which can be a rather stretchy, elastic term when in the hands of less reputable businesses</p><p>4: Note that I don’t refer to it as ‘your data’ – that’s because it isn’t</p><p>5: Why Mark Zuckerberg buys up properties that surround his 10 homes: <br><a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/news-trends/article/3009010/why-mark-zuckerberg-buys-properties-surround-his-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/news-trends/article/3009010/why-mark-zuckerberg-buys-properties-surround-his-10</a></p><p>6: After GDPR, The New York Times cut off ad exchanges in Europe — and kept growing ad revenue, Digiday, Jan 2019:<br><a href="https://digiday.com/media/gumgumtest-new-york-times-gdpr-cut-off-ad-exchanges-europe-ad-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://digiday.com/media/gumgumtest-new-york-times-gdpr-cut-off-ad-exchanges-europe-ad-revenue/</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

It’s quite rare. Companies rely on our offerings – their businesses literally live on these services – and it’s something that we take seriously. For example SimpleDB is still around, even though DynamoDB is the “NoSQL” DB of choice for our customers.</p><p>So, two years ago, when <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-classic-is-retiring-heres-how-to-prepare/">Jeff Barr announced that we’d be shutting down EC2-Classic</a>, I’m sure that there were at least <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27988964">a few of you</a> that didn’t believe we’d actually flip the switch — that we’d let it run forever. Well, that day has come. On August 15, 2023, we shut down the last instance of Classic. And with all of the history here, I think it’s worth celebrating the original version of one of the services that started what we now know as cloud computing.</p><p>EC2 has been around for quite a while, almost 17 years. Only SQS and S3 are older. So, I wouldn’t blame you if you were wondering what makes an EC2 instance “Classic”. Put simply, it’s the network architecture. When we launched EC2 in 2006, it was one giant network of 10.2.0.0/8. All instances ran on a single, flat network shared with other customers. It exposed a handful of features, like security groups and Public IP addresses that were assigned when an instance was spun up. Classic made the process of acquiring compute dead simple, even though the stack running behind the scenes was incredibly complex. “Invent and Simplify” is one of the <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles">Amazon Leadership Principles</a> after all…</p><p>If you had launched an instance in 2006, an m1.small, you would have gotten a virtual CPU the equivalent of a 1.7 GHz Xeon processor with 1.75 GB of RAM, 160 GB of local disk, and 250 Mb/second of network bandwidth. And it would have cost just $0.10 per clocked hour. It’s quite incredible where cloud computing has gone since then, with a P3dn.24xlarge providing 100 Gbps of network throughput, 96 vCPUs, 8 NVIDIA v100 Tensor Core GPUs, 32 GiB of memory, and 1.8 TB of local SSD storage, not to mention an EFA to accelerate ML workloads.</p><p>But 2006 was a different time, and that flat network and small collection of instances, like the m1.small, was “Classic”. And at the time it was truly revolutionary. Hardware had become a programmable resource that you could scale up or down at a moment’s notice. Every developer, entrepreneur, startup and enterprise, now had access to as much compute as they wanted, whenever they wanted it. The complexities of managing infrastructure, buying new hardware, upgrading software, replacing failed disks — had been abstracted away. And it changed the way we all designed and built applications.</p><p>Of course the first thing I did when EC2 was launched was to move this blog to an M1.small. It was running <a href="https://movabletype.org/">Moveable Type</a> and the M1 was good enough run the server and the local (no RDS yet) database. Eventually I turned it into a highly-available service with RDS failover, etc., and it ran there for 5+ years until the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html">Amazon S3 Website feature</a> was released in 2011. The blog has now been “serverless” for the past 12 years.</p><p>Like we do with all of our services, we listened to what our customers needed next. This led us to adding features like Elastic IP addresses, Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, CloudWatch, and various new instance types that would better suit different workloads. By 2013 we had enabled VPC, which allowed each AWS customer to manage their own slice of the cloud, secure, isolated, and defined for their business. And it became the new standard. It simply gave customers a new level of control that enabled them to build even more comprehensive systems in the cloud.</p><p>We continued to support Classic for the next decade, even as EC2 evolved and we implemented an entirely new virtualization platform, <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2020/09/reinventing-virtualization-with-nitro.html">Nitro</a> — because our customers were using it.</p><p>Ten years ago, during my 2013 keynote at re:Invent, I told you that we wanted to “support today’s workloads as well as tomorrow’s,” and our commitment to Classic is the best evidence of that. It’s not lost on me, the amount of work that goes into an effort like this — but it is exactly this type of work that builds trust, and I’m proud of the way it has been handled. To me, this embodies what it means to be customer obsessed. The EC2 team kept Classic running (and running well) until every instance was shut down or migrated. Providing documentation, tools, and support from engineering and account management teams throughout the process.</p><p>It’s bittersweet to say goodbye to one of our original offerings. But we’ve come a long way since 2006 and we’re not done innovating for our customers. It’s a reminder that building evolvable systems is a strategy, and revisiting your architectures with an open mind is a must. So, farewell Classic, it’s been swell. Long live EC2.</p><p><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/farewell-ec2-classic-certificate.png" alt="Certificate of achievement" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, go build!</p><p>Recommended posts</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2019/08/modern-applications-at-aws.html?utm_campaign=related+posts&amp;utm_source=farewell+ec2+classic">Modern applications at AWS</a></li><li><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/05/monoliths-are-not-dinosaurs.html?utm_campaign=related+posts&amp;utm_source=farewell+ec2+classic">Monoliths are not dinosaurs</a></li><li><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/10/amazon_ec2_in_full_production.html?utm_campaign=related+posts&amp;utm_source=farewell+ec2+classic">Amazon EC2 in full production (2008)</a></li></ul></span></section><hr></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>In December, Apple</span> said that it was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-photo-scanning-csam-communication-safety-messages/">killing an effort</a> to design a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-detection-icloud-photos-encryption-privacy/">privacy-preserving iCloud photo-scanning tool</a> for detecting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on the platform. Originally announced in August 2021, the project had been controversial since its inception. Apple had first paused it that September in response to concerns from digital rights groups and researchers that such a tool would inevitably be abused and exploited to compromise the privacy and security of all iCloud users. This week, a new child safety group known as Heat Initiative told Apple that it is organizing a campaign to demand that the company “detect, report, and remove” child sexual abuse material from iCloud and offer more tools for users to report CSAM to the company.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, in a rare move, Apple responded to Heat Initiative, outlining its reasons for abandoning the development of its iCloud CSAM scanning feature and instead focusing on a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-photo-scanning-csam-communication-safety-messages/">set of on-device tools and resources for users</a> known collectively as Communication Safety features. The company's response to Heat Initiative, which Apple shared with WIRED this morning, offers a rare look not just at its rationale for pivoting to Communication Safety, but at its broader views on creating mechanisms to circumvent user privacy protections, such as encryption, to monitor data. This stance is relevant to the encryption debate more broadly, especially as countries like the United Kingdom weigh passing laws that would require tech companies to be able to access user data to comply with law enforcement requests.</p><p>“Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and we are committed to breaking the chain of coercion and influence that makes children susceptible to it,” Erik Neuenschwander, Apple's director of user privacy and child safety, wrote in the company's response to Heat Initiative. He added, though, that after collaborating with an array of privacy and security researchers, digital rights groups, and child safety advocates, the company concluded that it could not proceed with development of a CSAM-scanning mechanism, even one built specifically to preserve privacy.</p><p>“Scanning every user’s privately stored iCloud data would create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit," Neuenschwander wrote. "It would also inject the potential for a slippery slope of unintended consequences. Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could create a desire to search other encrypted messaging systems across content types.”</p><p>Heat Initiative is led by Sarah Gardner, former vice president of external affairs for the nonprofit Thorn, which works to use new technologies to combat child exploitation online and sex trafficking. In 2021, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-detection-icloud-photos-encryption-privacy/">Thorn lauded Apple's plan</a> to develop an iCloud CSAM scanning feature. Gardner said in an email to CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday, August 30, which Apple also shared with WIRED, that Heat Initiative found Apple's decision to kill the feature “disappointing.”</p><p>“Apple is one of the most successful companies in the world with an army of world-class engineers,” Gardner wrote in a statement to WIRED. “It is their responsibility to design a safe, privacy-forward environment that allows for the detection of known child sexual abuse images and videos. For as long as people can still share and store a known image of a child being raped in iCloud we will demand that they do better.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In the email to Cook, Gardner wrote that Apple's photo-scanning tool “not only positioned Apple as a global leader in user privacy but also promised to eradicate millions of child sexual abuse images and videos from iCloud. … Child sexual abuse is a difficult issue that no one wants to talk about, which is why it gets silenced and left behind. We are here to make sure that doesn’t happen.”</p><p>Apple maintains that, ultimately, even its own well-intentioned design could not be adequately safeguarded in practice, and that on-device nudity detections for features like Messages, FaceTime, AirDrop, and the Photo picker are safer alternatives. Apple has also begun offering an application programming interface (API) for its Communication Safety features so third-party developers can incorporate them into their apps. Apple says that the communication platform Discord is integrating the features and that appmakers broadly have been enthusiastic about adopting them.</p><p>“We decided to not proceed with the proposal for a hybrid client-server approach to CSAM detection for iCloud Photos from a few years ago,” Neuenschwander wrote to Heat Initiative. “We concluded it was not practically possible to implement without ultimately imperiling the security and privacy of our users.”</p><p>On Heat Initiative's request that Apple create a CSAM reporting mechanism for users, the company told WIRED that its focus is on connecting its vulnerable or victimized users directly with local resources and law enforcement in their region that can assist them rather than Apple positioning itself as an intermediary for processing reports. The company says that offering this intermediary service may make sense for interactive platforms like social networks.</p><p>The need to protect children from online sexual abuse is urgent, though, and as these concerns intersect with the broader encryption debate, Apple's resolve on refusing to implement data scanning will continue to be tested.</p><p>Read the full exchange between Heat Initiative and Apple below. WIRED has redacted sensitive personal information for the privacy of senders and recipients:</p><figure data-testid="IframeEmbed"></figure><p><em>Updated 9:40 am ET, September 1, 2023: Added statement from Heat Initiative's Sarah Gardner.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Now you can also customise your notification content and use <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/" rel="nofollow">Jinja2 templating</a> for their title and body!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">JSON API Monitoring</h2>
<p dir="auto">Detect changes and monitor data in JSON API's by using either JSONPath or jq to filter, parse, and restructure JSON as needed.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/master/docs/json-filter-field-example.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/master/docs/json-filter-field-example.png" alt="image"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This will re-parse the JSON and apply formatting to the text, making it super easy to monitor and detect changes in JSON API results</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/master/docs/json-diff-example.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/master/docs/json-diff-example.png" alt="image"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">JSONPath or jq?</h3>
<p dir="auto">For more complex parsing, filtering, and modifying of JSON data, jq is recommended due to the built-in operators and functions. Refer to the <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for more specifc information on jq.</p>
<p dir="auto">One big advantage of <code>jq</code> is that you can use logic in your JSON filter, such as filters to only show items that have a value greater than/less than etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">See the wiki <a href="https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/JSON-Selector-Filter-help">https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/JSON-Selector-Filter-help</a> for more information and examples</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Parse JSON embedded in HTML!</h3>
<p dir="auto">When you enable a <code>json:</code> or <code>jq:</code> filter, you can even automatically extract and parse embedded JSON inside a HTML page! Amazingly handy for sites that build content based on JSON, such as many e-commerce websites.</p>

<p><strong>Organic Maps</strong> is a free Android &amp; iOS offline maps app for travelers, tourists, hikers, and cyclists based on top of crowd-sourced <strong><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="OpenStreetMap" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a></strong> data. It is a privacy-focused, open-source <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">fork</a> of <strong>Maps.me</strong> app (previously known as <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Maps.Me" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maps.me"><strong>MapsWithMe</strong></a>), maintained by the same people who created <strong>MapsWithMe</strong> in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Organic Maps</strong> is one of a few applications nowadays that supports 100% of features without an active Internet connection. Install Organic Maps, download maps, throw away your SIM card (by the way, your operator constantly tracks you), and go for a weeklong trip on a single battery charge without any byte sent to the network.</p>

By incorporating art into buildings and interior spaces, they have been transformed, resulting in a fusion that creates beautiful, inspiring, and spiritually uplifting environments. Throughout history, various art movements, such as the Renaissance in the 17th century, <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/baroque">Baroque</a> in the 18th century, and <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/art-nouveau">Art Nouveau</a>, Art Déco, and <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/bauhaus">Bauhaus</a> in the early 20th century, have had a significant impact on architecture. Architects drew inspiration from the ideals, concepts, stylistic approaches, and techniques of these movements, using them to create large-scale habitable structures. As the home is a fundamental expression of an architectural movement and the simplest canvas to exhibit the artistic ethos of any particular era, studying the interior spaces of houses provides a detailed picture of art's influence on spatial organization, furniture design, product patterns, and user interaction.</p><p><a data-nr-picture-id="64de02defbc658017a49a358" href="https://www.archdaily.com/1005570/from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements/64de02defbc658017a49a358-from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements-photo" rel="attachment"><img alt="From Art Nouveau to the Bauhaus: How Home Interiors Looked in Popular Art Movements - Image 2 of 23" data-nr-picture-id="64de02defbc658017a49a358" data-pin-nopin="true" data-src="https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/64de/02de/fbc6/5801/7a49/a358/thumb_jpg/from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements_1.jpg?1692271331" height="125" longdesc="https://www.archdaily.com/1005570/from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements/64de02defbc658017a49a358-from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements-photo" title="Victor Horta House Art Nouveau Spaces.

<p>Art Nouveau, <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/art">Art</a> Déco, and <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/bauhaus">Bauhaus</a> are art movements that emerged simultaneously in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as frameworks for architecture to respond to the industrial age. By exploring their relationships with architecture through home interior spaces, we can draw comparisons and distinctions between how each movement responded to the quest for new spatial experiences.</p><h3>Art Nouveau</h3><h6>1890s - 1920s</h6><p>Art Nouveau and Art Déco were two powerful movements that dominated the worlds of fine art, design, and architecture at the turn of the 20th century. While Art Déco was more geometric and modernist, <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/974955/what-is-art-nouveau?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=projects_tab&amp;ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art Nouveau was inspired by nature</a>, featuring sinuous lines and organic shapes. It considered art to be a conceptual whole, searching for harmony in every element of a structure, from its walls and windows to its door handles, furniture, and decorative flourishes.</p><figure aria-labelledby="64de02bdfbc658017a49a354"><a href="https://www.archdaily.com/1005570/from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements/64de02bdfbc658017a49a354-from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements-photo"><picture><source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/64de/02bd/fbc6/5801/7a49/a354/medium_jpg/from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements_3.jpg?1692271296"><img alt="From Art Nouveau to the Bauhaus: How Home Interiors Looked in Popular Art Movements - Image 17 of 23" data-nr-picture-id="64de02bdfbc658017a49a354" height="427" itemprop="image" loading="lazy" longdesc="https://www.archdaily.com/1005570/from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements/64de02bdfbc658017a49a354-from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements-photo" src="https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/64de/02bd/fbc6/5801/7a49/a354/newsletter/from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements_3.jpg?1692271296" width="640"></picture><figcaption id="64de02bdfbc658017a49a354">Victor Horta House Art Nouveau Spaces.

Its aim was to embrace the machine-made products of the industrial age, which Art Nouveau had protested against. By emphasizing artistic decoration through simple, clean lines and shapes, and ornamenting them with stylized geometric patterns, it embraced industrial materials and mechanization of the modern era. It started in the fashion and jewelry industries, then influenced furniture design, interior spaces, and architecture.</p><figure aria-labelledby="64de05838177ff017c22ca43"><a href="https://www.archdaily.com/1005570/from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements/64de05838177ff017c22ca43-from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements-photo"><picture><source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/64de/0583/8177/ff01/7c22/ca43/medium_jpg/from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements_7.jpg?1692272030"><img alt="From Art Nouveau to the Bauhaus: How Home Interiors Looked in Popular Art Movements - Image 4 of 23" data-nr-picture-id="64de05838177ff017c22ca43" height="427" itemprop="image" loading="lazy" longdesc="https://www.archdaily.com/1005570/from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements/64de05838177ff017c22ca43-from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements-photo" src="https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/64de/0583/8177/ff01/7c22/ca43/newsletter/from-art-nouveau-to-the-bauhaus-how-home-interiors-looked-in-popular-art-movements_7.jpg?1692272030" width="640"></picture><figcaption id="64de05838177ff017c22ca43">New Palace, Western Gujarat.

Art Déco sits as the midpoint between these two points on the art spectrum. The interiors of homes can reflect different ways in which art can be an interface to interact with space, and how home spaces can be a means of expression. The craft of space-making can incorporate art in the details of its elements, such as in Art Nouveau, complement art with stylized geometry like in Art Déco, or recess and be a background for art, as in the Bauhaus.</p></article><p><cite><strong>Cite: </strong>Paul Yakubu.

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">...other areas, like metropolitan areas, became harder to read:</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">And areas with lots of hills and mountains became especially cluttered and difficult to scan:</p>
</div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1693526493487_10921">
<p data-preserve-html-node="true">For the past three years, Google’s cartography has largely remained in this difficult-to-scan state—that is, until now.

<p data-preserve-html-node="true" id="back-note1">Unfortunately, Google’s new, in-testing map style is even worse than its old one.

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">It’s difficult to understand Google’s motivations for making such garish changes—that is, until you zoom in further on New York or any of the other three cities where Google <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/google-maps-releases-road-markings-4-cities">recently added road markings</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://zyedidia.github.io/blog/posts/1-d-baremetal/">https://zyedidia.github.io/blog/posts/1-d-baremetal/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37346218">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This post will show you how to use D to write a bare-metal “Hello world”
program that targets the RISC-V QEMU simulator.  In a future blog post (<a href="https://zyedidia.github.io/blog/posts/2-baremetal-visionfive">now
available</a>) we’ll build on this to target actual
hardware: the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starfive/visionfive-2">VisionFive
2</a> SBC. See
<a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/blog-code">blog-code</a> for the final code from
this post. For a more complex example, see
<a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/multiplix">Multiplix</a>, an operating system I am
developing that runs on the VisionFive 2 (and Raspberry Pis).</p>
<h2 id="why-d">Why D?</h2>
<p>Recently I’ve been writing bare-metal code in C, and I’ve become a bit
frustrated with the lack of features that C provides. I started searching for a
good replacement, and revisited <a href="https://dlang.org/">D</a> (a language I used for a
project a few years ago).  It turns out D has introduced a mode called
<a href="https://dlang.org/spec/betterc.html">betterC</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> (sounds exactly like what I
want), which essentially disables all language features that require the D
runtime. This makes it roughly as easy to use D for bare-metal programming as
C. You don’t get all the features of D, but you get enough that it covers all
the things I want (in fact, for systems programming I prefer the betterC subset
of D over full D). D in betterC mode is exactly what it sounds like, and
retains the feel of C – going forward I think I will be using it instead of C
in all situations where I would have otherwise used C (even in non-bare-metal
situations).</p>
<p>Here are the positives about D I value most:</p>
<ul>
<li>A decent import system (no more header files and <code>#include</code>).</li>
<li>Automatic bounds checking, and bounded strings and arrays.</li>
<li>Methods in structs.</li>
<li>Compile-time code evaluation (run D code at compile-time!).</li>
<li>Powerful templating and generics.</li>
<li>Iterators.</li>
<li>Default support for thread-local storage.</li>
<li>Scope guards and RAII.</li>
<li>Some memory safety protections with <code>@safe</code>.</li>
<li>A fairly comprehensive and readable <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/spec.html">online specification</a>.</li>
<li>An active discord channel with people that answer my questions in minutes.</li>
<li>Both an LLVM-based compiler (LDC) and a GNU compiler (GDC), which is officially
part of the GCC project.
<ul>
<li>And these compilers both export roughly the same flags and intrinsics as
Clang and GCC respectively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These features, combined with the lack of a runtime and the C-like feel of the
language (making it easy to port previous code), make it a no-brainer for me to
have D as the base choice for any project where I would otherwise use C.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve told you about my reasons for choosing D, let’s try using it to
write a bare-metal application that targets RISC-V. If you want to follow
along, the first step is to download the toolchain (the following tools should
work on Linux or MacOS). You’ll need three different components:</p>
<ol>
<li>LDC 1.30 (the LLVM-based D compiler). Can be downloaded from
<a href="https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/releases/tag/v1.30.0">GitHub</a>. Make sure to
use version 1.30<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</li>
<li>A <code>riscv64-unknown-elf</code> GNU toolchain. Can be downloaded from
SiFive’s <a href="https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases">Freedom Tools
repository</a>.</li>
<li>The QEMU RISC-V simulator: <code>qemu-system-riscv64</code>. Can be downloaded from
SiFive’s <a href="https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases">Freedom Tools
repository</a>, or also
usually available as part of your system’s QEMU package.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll be using LDC since it ships with the ability to target <code>riscv64</code>.  I have
used GDC for bare-metal development as well, but it requires building a
toolchain from source since nobody ships pre-built <code>riscv64-unknown-elf-gdc</code>
binaries<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. We’ll use the GNU toolchain for assembling, linking, and for other
tools like <code>objcopy</code> and <code>objdump</code>, and QEMU for simulating the hardware.</p>
<p>With these installed you should be able to run:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>$ ldc2 --version
</span></span><span><span>LDC - the LLVM D compiler (1.30.0):
</span></span><span><span>...
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>$ riscv64-unknown-elf-ld
</span></span><span><span>riscv64-unknown-elf-ld: no input files
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>$ qemu-system-riscv64 -h
</span></span><span><span>...
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="cpu-entrypoint">CPU entrypoint</h2>
<p>We’re writing bare-metal code, so there’s no operating system, no console, no
files – nothing. The CPU just starts executing instructions at a pre-specified
address<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> after performing some initial setup. We’ll figure out what that
address is later when we set up the linkerscript. For now we can just define
the <code>_start</code> symbol as our entrypoint, and assume the linker will place the
code at this label at the CPU entrypoint.</p>
<p>A D function requires a valid stack pointer, so before we can execute any D code
we need to load the stack pointer register <code>sp</code> with a valid address.</p>
<p>Let’s make a file called <code>start.s</code> and put the following in it:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="asm"><span><span><span>.section</span> <span>".text.boot"</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>.globl</span> <span>_start</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>_start:</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>la</span> <span>sp</span>, <span>_stack_start</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>call</span> <span>dstart</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>_hlt:</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>j</span> <span>_hlt</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For now let’s assume <code>_stack_start</code> is a symbol with the address of a valid
stack, and in the linkerscript we’ll set this up properly. After loading <code>sp</code>,
we call a D function called <code>dstart</code>, defined in the next part.</p>
<h2 id="d-entrypoint">D entrypoint</h2>
<p>Now we can define our <code>dstart</code> function in <code>dstart.d</code>. For now we’ll just cause
an infinite loop.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="d"><span><span><span>module</span> <span>dstart</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>extern <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> <span>void</span> <span>dstart</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="linkerscript">Linkerscript</h2>
<p>Before we can compile this program we need a bit of linkerscript to tell the
linker how our code should be laid out. We’ll need to specify the address where
the text section should start (the entry address), and reserve space for all
the data sections (<code>.rodata</code>, <code>.data</code>, <code>.bss</code>), and the stack.</p>
<h2 id="entry-address">Entry address</h2>
<p>Today we’ll be targeting the QEMU <code>virt</code> RISC-V machine, so we have
to figure out what its entrypoint is.</p>
<p>We can ask QEMU for a list of all devices in the <code>virt</code> machine by telling it
to dump the its device tree:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>$ qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt,dumpdtb=virt.dtb
</span></span><span><span>$ dtc virt.dtb &gt; virt.dts
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In <code>virt.dts</code> you’ll find the following entry:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>memory@80000000 {
</span></span><span><span>    device_type = "memory";
</span></span><span><span>    reg = &lt;0x00 0x80000000 0x00 0x8000000&gt;;
</span></span><span><span>};

<p>The BSS is a region of memory that the compiler assumes is initialized to all
zeroes. Usually the static data for a program is directly copied into the ELF
executable – if you have a string <code>"hello world"</code> in your program, those exact
bytes will live somewhere in the binary (in the read-only data section).
However, a lot of static data is initialized to zero, so instead of putting
those zero bytes directly into the ELF file, the linker lets us save space by
making a special section (the BSS) that must be initialized to all zeroes at
runtime, but won’t actually contain that data in the ELF file itself.  So even
if you have a giant 1MB array of zeroes, your ELF binary will be small because
that section will be expanded into RAM only when the application starts.
Usually the OS sets up the BSS before it launches a program, but we’re running
bare-metal, so we have to do that manually in the <code>dstart</code> function (in the
next section).  To make this initialization possible, we define the
<code>_bss_start</code> and <code>_bss_end</code> symbols in the linkerscript. These are symbols
whose <em>addresses</em> will be the start and end of the BSS section respectively.</p>
<h2 id="reserving-space-for-the-stack">Reserving space for the stack</h2>
<p>We also reserve one page for the <code>.kstack</code> section and mark the <code>_stack_start</code>
symbol to be located to the end of it (remember the stack grows down). The
stack must be 16-byte aligned.</p>

special file and import it automatically everywhere. So we can create

<p>Most systems have a UART device. Generally how this works is that you write a
byte to a special place in memory<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, and that byte will be transmitted using the
UART protocol over some pins on the board. In order to read the bytes with your
host computer you need a UART to USB adapter plugged into your host, and then
you can read from the corresponding device file (usually <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>) on the
host computer. Today we’ll just be simulating our bare-metal code in QEMU, so
you don’t need to have a special adapter. QEMU will emulate a UART device and
print out the bytes written to its transmit register.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-volatile-loadsstores">Enabling volatile loads/stores</h2>
<p>When writing to device memory it is important to ensure that the compiler does
not remove our loads/stores. For example, if a device is located at
<code>0x10000000</code>, we might write directly to that address by casting the integer to
a pointer. To the compiler, it just looks like we are writing to random
addresses, which might be undefined behavior or result in dead code (e.g., if
we never read the value back, the compiler may determine that it can eliminate
the write). We need to inform the compiler that these reads/writes of device
memory must be preserved and cannot be optimized out. D uses the
<code>volatileStore</code> and <code>volatileLoad</code> intrinsics for this.</p>
<p>We can define these in our <code>object.d</code>:</p>

<p>With that set up, let’s figure out where QEMU’s UART device is located in
memory so we can write to it.</p>
<p>The QEMU <code>virt</code> machine defines a number of virtual devices, one of which is a
UART device. Looking through the QEMU device tree again in <code>virt.dts</code>, you’ll
see the following:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This says that a ns16550a UART device exists at address <code>0x10000000</code>.</p>
<p>On real hardware the UART would need to be properly initialized by writing some
memory-mapped configuration registers (for setting up the baud rate and other
options). However the QEMU device does not require initialization. It emulates
an ns16550a device, and writing to its transmit register is enough to cause a
byte to be written over the UART (which appears on the console when simulating
with QEMU). The transmit register for the ns16550a is the first mapped register,
so it is located at <code>0x10000000</code>.</p>

<p>This code doesn’t print the line number because that requires converting an
<code>int</code> to a <code>string</code> – something left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-linker-relaxation">Enabling linker relaxation</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.sifive.com/blog/all-aboard-part-3-linker-relaxation-in-riscv-toolchain">Linker
relaxation</a>
is an optimization in the RISC-V toolchain that allows globals to be accessed
through the global pointer (stored in the <code>gp</code> register). This value is a
pointer to somewhere in the data section, which allows instructions to load
globals by directly offsetting from <code>gp</code>, instead of constructing the
address of the global from scratch (which may require multiple instructions on
RISC-V).</p>
<p>To enable linker relaxation we have to do three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Modify the linkerscript so that it defines a symbol for the global pointer.</li>
<li>Load the <code>gp</code> register with this value in the <code>_start</code> function.</li>
<li>Enable linker relaxation in our compiler.</li>
</ol>
<p>To modify the linkerscript we just add the following at the beginning of the
<code>.rodata</code> section definition:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>__global_pointer$ = . + 0x800;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This sets up the <code>__global_pointer$</code> symbol (a special symbol that the
linker assumes is stored in <code>gp</code>) to point <code>0x800</code> bytes into the data
segment (RISC-V instructions can load/store values offset up to <code>0x800</code> bytes
from the <code>gp</code> register in either direction in one instruction). This allows
offsets from <code>gp</code> to cover most/all of static data.</p>
<p>Next we add to <code>_start</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>.option push
</span></span><span><span>.option norelax
</span></span><span><span>la gp, __global_pointer$
</span></span><span><span>.option pop
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We need to temporarily enable the <code>norelax</code> option, otherwise the assembler
will optimize this to <code>mv gp, gp</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, we can remove the <code>-mno-relax</code> flag from the <code>riscv64-unknown-elf-as</code>
invocation, and add <code>-mattr=+m,+a,+c,+relax</code> to the <code>ldc2</code> invocation to enable
linker relaxation in the compiler.</p>
<h2 id="removing-unused-functions">Removing unused functions</h2>
<p>If you take a look at the disassembly of the program (<code>make prog.list</code>), you
might notice there are definitions for functions that are never called. This is
because those functions have been inlined, but the definitions were not
removed. Functions/globals in D are always exported in the object file, even if
they are marked <code>private</code> (I’m not really sure why). Luckily modern linkers can
be pretty smart and it’s easy to have the linker remove these unused functions.
Pass <code>--function-sections</code> and <code>--data-sections</code> to LDC to have it put each
function/global in its own section (still within <code>.text</code>, <code>.data</code> etc.). Now if
you pass the <code>--gc-sections</code> flag to the linker, it will remove any
unreferenced sections (hence removing any unused functions/globals). With these
flags I got the final “hello world” binary down to 160 bytes.</p>
<p>This is a basic form of optimization performed by the linker. There are more
advanced forms of link-time optimization (LTO), which I won’t discuss in much
detail. If you pass <code>-flto=thin</code> or <code>-flto=full</code> to LDC, the object files that
it generates will be LLVM bitcode. Then you will need to invoke the linker with
the LLVMgold linker plugin (or use LLD) so that it can read these files. With
this method, the linker will apply full compiler optimizations across object
files.</p>
<!-- ## Why does the Makefile build one object file per source file? -->
<!--  -->
<!-- The Makefile for the project builds one object file per D source file. We could -->
<!-- also pass all the D files to the compiler at once, and generate one object file -->
<!-- from the result. That would probably produce a better-optimized binary (since -->
<!-- we aren't using LTO). However it is not as good for incremental rebuilds, since -->
<!-- we end up recompiling everything from scratch every time. -->
<h2 id="thread-local-storage-and-globals">Thread-local storage and globals</h2>
<p>Globals are thread-local by default in D. That means if you declare a global as
<code>int x;</code> then whenever you access <code>x</code>, the compiler will do so through the
system’s thread pointer (on RISC-V this is stored in the <code>tp</code> register). That
means if you use a thread-local variable, you had better make sure <code>tp</code>
points to a block of memory where <code>x</code> is located, and if you have multiple
threads each thread’s <code>tp</code> should point to a distinct thread-local block (each thread
will have its own private copy of <code>x</code>). I won’t explain in detail how to set that up here,
but briefly, you’ll need to initialize the <code>.tdata</code> and <code>.tbss</code> sections for each thread
in <code>dstart</code>, and load <code>tp</code> with a pointer to the current thread’s local <code>.tdata</code>.</p>
<p>To make a global shared across all threads, you need to mark it as <code>immutable</code>
or <code>shared</code>. A variable marked as <code>shared</code> imposes some limits, and basically
forces you to mark everything it touches as <code>shared</code>. You can still read/write
it without checks, but at least you should be able to easily know if you are
accessing a shared variable (and manually verify you have the appropriate
synchronization). In a future version of D it is likely that directly accessing
a shared variable will be disallowed, except through atomic intrinsics. If you
have a lock to protect the variable, then you will need to cast away the
<code>shared</code> qualifier manually, which isn’t perfect but forces the programmer to
acknowledge the possible unsafety of accessing the shared global. You can
always use the <code>__gshared</code> attribute as an escape hatch, which makes the global
shared but does not make any changes to the type (no limitations). A global
marked as <code>__gshared</code> is equivalent to a C global.</p>

<p>I hope this provided a simple introduction to D for bare-metal programming, and
that you might consider using D instead of C in some future project as a
result.  This post has only covered running in a simulated environment. In a
future post I’ll show how to write bare-metal code for the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starfive/visionfive-2">VisionFive
2</a><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, a recently
released RISC-V SBC produced by StarFive. Stay tuned! (<a href="https://zyedidia.github.io/blog/posts/2-baremetal-visionfive">now
available</a>)</p>
<p>If you want to see a larger example, I am developing an operating system called
<a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/multiplix">Multiplix</a> in D. It has support for
RISC-V and AArch64, and targets the VisionFive, VisionFive 2, Raspberry Pi 3,
and Raspberry Pi 4 (and likely more boards in the future).
Check it out! It is currently heavily in-progress, but I plan to make a post
about it when it is further along.</p>
<p>The code from this post is available in my
<a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/blog-code">blog-code</a> repository.</p>

          Solano County sits at the crossroads of Northern California. Nestled
          between Sacramento, the Delta, San Francisco, and Napa Valley, Solano
          perfectly captures the diversity of California’s landscapes and its
          people. It is the home of agriculture and green energy industries that
          sustainably feed and power our state, strong middle-class communities,
          and our nation’s busiest Air Force base. Eastern Solano County is also
          an area ready for a new community. We’re excited to tell our story.
          </p><p>
          
           California Forever is the parent company of Flannery Associates. Over
          the last few years, Flannery has purchased over 50,000 acres in Solano
          County. To date, our company has been quiet about our activities. This
          has, understandably, created interest, concern, and speculation. Now
          that we're no longer limited by confidentiality, we are eager to begin
          a conversation about the future of Solano County – a conversation with
          all of you. Like much of our state, Solano County faces many
          challenges - but also presents countless opportunities. Over the past
          few years, we have completed surveys and interviews with about 2,000
          residents of Solano County and your voices were clear. Residents want
          more opportunities to buy homes in safe, walkable communities. Good
          paying local jobs, so they can both live and work in the county.
          Better funding to improve schools, promote public safety, and reduce
          homelessness, as well as resources to invest in infrastructure for
          transportation, water, and wildfire protection.
        </p></div>
        <p>
          Last month, 81% of Solano parents we surveyed said that their kids
          won’t be able to find a future in their own neighborhood when they
          grow up.
        </p>
        <p>
          These challenges often have separate, unrelated causes. But they could
          share a common solution. Instead of watching our kids leave, we have
          the opportunity to build a new community that attracts new employers,
          creates good paying local jobs, builds homes in walkable
          neighborhoods, leads in environment stewardship, and fuels a growing
          tax base to serve the county at large. And, Solano has the right
          location for a project like this in the eastern part of the county.

          The area today.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not just our idea. In the past, when preparing long-range
          plans for the Bay Area, the Association of Bay Area Governments
          ("Regional Plan 1970-1990") and the U.S. Department of Commerce
          ("Future Development of the San Francisco Bay Area, 1960-2020") both
          concluded that to keep our region affordable, prosperous, and
          balanced, new industries and communities could be built in eastern
          Solano. The area had low fire risk, access to water, and was
          strategically located in the middle of the larger Northern California
          region. All that remains true today.
        </p>
        
        <h2>
          Let’s dust off those plans, <br>
           and breathe new life into them.
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          California Forever was founded in 2017 by our CEO, Jan Sramek. After
          moving to California a decade ago, Jan spent time in Solano County
          during fishing trips on the California Delta and fell in love with the
          area. Having previously lived in many of the world’s most walkable,
          livable, and sustainable towns and cities, Jan became interested in
          fusing what he learned about those livable communities with those old
          plans for eastern Solano. He became committed to a vision for the
          future of Solano County. Jan and his wife Naytri recently purchased
          their first-ever home in Solano, and they are excited to live here
          with their toddler daughter, her soon-to-arrive little brother, and
          golden retriever Bruce.

          This idea of building a new community and economic opportunity in
          eastern Solano seemed impossible on the surface, but after spending a
          lot of time learning about Solano and its people, Jan became convinced
          that with a thoughtful design, the right long-term patient investors,
          and strong partnerships with all stakeholders, there would be an
          opportunity to build a remarkable place for Solano residents, both
          current and the many generations to come.

          Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross, Reid Hoffman, Michael Moritz, Laurene
          Powell Jobs, and the California investment firm Andreessen Horowitz.
          Our company is committed to Solano and this project for the long term.

          Over the past few years, we have purchased over 50,000 acres in
          eastern Solano County, between Fairfield and Rio Vista. California
          Forever owns about half of the properties in this area. Other
          landowners own the remaining half. Our project would not change the
          zoning of other landowners’ properties – they would remain zoned for
          agriculture, and those landowners would be able to continue their
          agricultural operations. In addition, on our lands, the project would
          include a variety of land uses – a new community, but also solar farms
          and open space, including both agriculture and habitat conservation.
          Our project would protect and support Travis Air Force Base, including
          by respecting Solano County’s official Travis Reserve Area, which is a
          security buffer for the protection of Travis Air Force base
          established by Solano County in its
          <a href="https://www.solanocounty.com/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=11013" target="_blank">General Plan</a>, and subsequently clarified through a recent ordinance.
          </p><p>
          
           We have also assembled a team of experts to design this project in
          partnership with all of you. In doing so, we intentionally found
          people who are not only world-class, but also local to the Bay Area,
          with a deep connection to this area and a shared commitment to solving
          Northern California’s most important challenges. Our growing team
          includes

           With the land and team assembled, we are excited to finally close
          this first chapter and begin the phase of our work that matters most:
          our conversation with you.

        <h2>
          Next, a conversation
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is the beginning of our decades-long collaboration with Solano’s
          residents, elected officials and agencies, as well as the many Solano
          stakeholders, including Travis Air Force Base, labor, business,
          agriculture, educators, police, fire, conservation, and many others.

          To start, we are meeting with the elected representatives of Solano
          County. Second, so that we hear from each of you directly, we will be
          mailing a survey to every Solano household. Third, we are forming a
          Community Advisory Board of Solano citizens. Please send any
          nominations to <a href="mailto:community@californiaforever.com">
            community@californiaforever.com</a>. Finally, we are working on opening offices in Vallejo, Fairfield
          and Vacaville, and will announce the locations once open. Visit us in
          person.

            This is a project that must be not just designed with, but also
            approved by, all Solano residents. Solano County’s Orderly Growth
            Measure directs development into cities, and asks that new projects
            outside of cities be submitted to the voters for approval. We fully
            support these principles, and we will ultimately ask the voters to
            approve the project. The Orderly Growth Measure is the right
            approach to safeguard Solano, including our project, from sprawl and
            disorderly growth for many years to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            California was built on its pioneering spirit, its boundless
            optimism, and the utter conviction that if we work hard, and
            together, that our best days still lie ahead, waiting to be built,
            for our children, and their children, and for all the generations to
            come. California Forever is committed to building a place that
            embodies these ideals. Join us.

          <h2>Design principles</h2>
          <p>
            Ultimately, this is about practical ways to improve the day-to-day
            lives of the people who already, or will one day, live in Solano
            County. We are committed to five principles about what to build, and
            what to protect based on our conversations with the people of
            Solano.

        <h3>Create good paying local jobs, and paths to get those jobs, for Solano’s residents.</h3>
        <p>This project can bring new employers to Solano, and independently create thousands of permanent, good-paying local jobs in construction, energy, services, and other industries. We are also interested in building trade schools and other educational paths that help Solano residents learn the skills they need to get those new jobs and build long-lasting careers</p>

        <h3>Help solve regional infrastructure needs, including energy, transportation, water, and wildfire protection.</h3>
        <p>Eastern Solano benefits from existing transmission lines that could make it possible to build a large solar farm that creates hundreds of jobs and accelerates California’s transition to clean energy. Improvements to Highway 12 could make it safer and less congested. The North Bay Aqueduct needs  <a href="https://www.scwa2.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NBA-Funding-Flyer.pdf" target="_blank"> major upgrades</a> to deliver cleaner and more reliable water to over 400,000 people in Solano and Napa counties. Solano’s rural fire districts need more money to keep communities safe from wildfires. We cannot solve any of these issues on our own, but we want to be part of larger regional solutions.</p>

        <h3>Protect and support Travis Air Force Base.</h3>
        <p>Travis Air Force Base is critical to both our national security and to Solano County. We fully support its mission and always will. For example, when California Water Service and Travis were building a new water pipeline to Travis in 2021 and asked us to sell them a right of way for the pipeline, we immediately offered to donate the right of way for free instead. We are just beginning our dialogue with Travis about the right safeguards, but we are committed to respecting its boundaries both on the ground and in the air. We also hope to work with the Air Force in other ways, including by helping provide homes to base personnel, and training and career options for veterans.</p>

        <h3>Protect Solano’s open space and prime agricultural lands.</h3>
        <p>Solano County has a long history of city-centered growth. We believe building a compact community away from prime agricultural lands, surrounded by open space, is the best way to achieve that objective. Many nearby landowners are committed to agriculture, and have told us they do not want to sell or develop their properties. Their properties will, along with some of our properties, form this agricultural green belt around the new community.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>React Server Components are a lot. We recently <a href="https://www.mux.com/blog/the-building-blocks-of-great-docs">rethought our docs</a> and <a href="https://www.mux.com/blog/rebranding-during-a-recession">rebranded Mux</a> and, while we were at it, moved all of <a href="https://www.mux.com/">mux.com</a> and <a href="https://docs.mux.com/">docs.mux.com</a> over to Server Components. So… believe me. I know. I also know that it’s possible and not that scary and probably worth it.</p><p>Let me show you why by answering the following questions: <a href="#how-did-we-get-here">Why do Server Components matter</a>, and <a href="#what-are-react-server-components-what-are-they-good-for">what are they good for</a>? <a href="#what-arent-react-server-components-good-for">What are they not good for</a>? <a href="#how-do-i-use-react-server-components">How do you use them</a>, <a href="#how-do-i-incrementally-adopt-react-server-components-in-a-real-life-codebase">how do you incrementally adopt them</a>, and <a href="#did-someone-say-advanced-patterns">what kind of advanced patterns should you use</a> to keep them under control? By the end of all this, you should have a pretty good idea of <a href="#so-should-i-use-react-server-components">whether you should use React Server Components</a> and how to use them effectively.</p><h2 id="how-did-we-get-here"><a href="#how-did-we-get-here"><span><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="42" height="42" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 42 42"><path d="m18.172 15.343 3.535-3.535a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 0l1.414 1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07l-3.535 3.536M23.828 26.657l-3.535 3.535a5 5 0 0 1-7.071 0l-1.414-1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0-7.07l3.535-3.536" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" d="m25.243 16.757-8.486 8.486" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path></svg><span>Link42Icon</span></span></span><strong>How did we get here?</strong></a></h2><p>One great way to understand React Server Components is to understand what problem they’re solving. So let’s start there.</p><p>Long ago, in days of yore, we generated websites on servers using tech like PHP. This was great for fetching data by using secrets and doing CPU-heavy work on big computers so that clients could just get a nice, light HTML page, personalized to them.</p><p>Then, we started wondering: What if we wanted faster responses and more interactivity? Every time a user takes an action, do we <em>really</em> want to send cookies back to the server and make the server generate a whole new page? What if we made the client do that work instead? We can just send all the rendering code to the client as JavaScript!</p><p>This was called client-side rendering (CSR) or single-page applications (SPA) and was <a href="https://begin.com/blog/posts/2023-02-21-why-does-everyone-suddenly-hate-single-page-apps">widely considered a bad move</a>. Sure, it’s simple, which is worth a lot! In fact, for a long time, the React team recommended it as the default approach with their tool, <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">create-react-app</a>. And for frequently changing, highly interactive pages like a dashboard, it’s probably enough. But what if you want a search engine to read your page, and that search engine doesn’t execute JavaScript? What if you need to keep secrets on a server? What if your users’ devices are low-powered or have poor connections (<a href="https://unctad.org/topic/least-developed-countries/chart-april-2021">as so many do</a>)?</p><p>This is where server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) came in. Tools like <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a> used SSR and SSG to generate the pages on the server and send them to the client as HTML <em>and</em> JavaScript. The best of both worlds. The client can immediately show that HTML so the user has something to look at. Then, once the JS loads, the site becomes nice and interactive. Bonus: search engines can read that HTML, which is cool.</p><p>This is actually quite good! But there are still a few problems to solve. First: most SSR/SSG approaches send <em>all the JavaScript used to generate the page</em> to the client, where the client then <em>runs it all again</em> and marries that HTML with the JavaScript that just booted up. (This marriage, by the way, is called hydration — a term you’ll see a lot in this neck of the woods.) Do we really need to send and run all that JavaScript? Do we really need to duplicate all of the rendering work just to hydrate?</p><p>Second, what if that server-side render takes a long time? Maybe it runs a lot of code, maybe it’s stuck waiting for a slow database call. Then the user’s stuck waiting. Bummer.</p><p>This is where React Server Components come in.</p><h2 id="what-are-react-server-components-what-are-they-good-for"><a href="#what-are-react-server-components-what-are-they-good-for"><span><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="42" height="42" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 42 42"><path d="m18.172 15.343 3.535-3.535a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 0l1.414 1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07l-3.535 3.536M23.828 26.657l-3.535 3.535a5 5 0 0 1-7.071 0l-1.414-1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0-7.07l3.535-3.536" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" d="m25.243 16.757-8.486 8.486" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path></svg><span>Link42Icon</span></span></span><strong>What are React Server Components? What are they good for?</strong></a></h2><p>React Server Components (RSCs) are, unsurprisingly, React components that run on the server instead of on the client. The “what” isn’t nearly as interesting as the “why,” though. Why do we want RSCs? Well, frameworks that support RSCs have two big advantages over SSR.</p><p>First, frameworks that support RSCs give us a way to define where our code runs: what needs to run <em>only</em> on the server (like in the good ol' PHP days) and what should run on the client (like SSR). These are called Server Components and Client Components, respectively. Because we can be explicit about where our code runs, we can send less JavaScript to the client, leading to smaller bundle sizes and less work during hydration.</p><p>The second advantage of RSC-driven frameworks: Server Components can fetch data <em>directly from within the component</em>. When that fetch is complete, Server Components can <em>stream</em> that data to the client.</p><p>This new data-fetching story changes things in two ways. First, fetching data in React is way easier to think about now. Any Server Component can just… fetch data directly using a node library or using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch"><span>fetch</span></a> function we all know and love. Your user component can fetch user data, your movie component can fetch movie data, and so on and so forth. No more using a library or using <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#fetching-data-with-effects"><span>useEffect</span></a> to manage complex loading states (<a href="https://tanstack.com/query/v3/">react-query</a> I still love you), and no more fetching a bunch of data at the page level with <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props"><span>getServerSideProps</span></a> and then drilling it down to the component that needs it.</p><p>Second, it solves the problem we talked about earlier. Slow database call? No need to wait; we’ll just send that slow component to the client when it’s ready. Your users can enjoy the rest of the site in the meantime.</p><p>Bonus round: What if you need to fetch data on the server in response to a user’s action on the client (like a form submission)? We have a way to do that, too. The client can send data to the server, and the server can do its fetching or whatever, and stream the response back to the client just like it streamed that initial data. This two-way communication isn't <em>technically</em> React Server Components — this is <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions#actions">React Actions</a> — but it’s built on the same foundation and is closely related. We’re not going to talk much about React Actions here, though.

If RSCs are so much better than CSR and SSR, why <em>wouldn’t</em> you use them?

If you want to share data between Server Components without using props, you’ll probably have to use plain ol' <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#sharing-data-between-server-components">modules</a>.</p><p>And here’s the kicker: If you want some sort of data to be limited to a <em>subtree</em> of your React application, there is no great mechanism for doing that in Server Components. (If I'm wrong, please correct me. I really miss this.)</p><p>On our docs site, this wasn’t too big of a problem. The places where we used React Context heavily were also the places that were highly interactive and needed to be shipped to the client anyway. Our search experience, for example, shares state like <span>queryString</span> and <span>isOpen</span> throughout the component tree.</p><p>On our marketing site, though, this really got us. Our marketing site has areas that share a theme. For example, in the screenshot below, each component in our pre-footer needs to understand that it is on a green background so it knows to use the dark green border. Normally, I would’ve reached for Context to share that theme state, but since these are largely static components that are ideal candidates for Server Components, Context wasn’t an option. We worked around this by leaning hard on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS custom properties</a> (which is probably better, since this is a styling concern, not a data concern).

They’re great for fetching data and running expensive code that you don’t want or need to send to the client: rendering the text of a blog post, for example, or syntax-highlighting a code block. When convenient, you should leave your code as Server Components to avoid bloating your client bundle.</p><p>Client Components are the React you know and love. They can be server-side rendered, and they’re sent to the client to be hydrated and executed. Client Components are great when you want to react to user input or change state over time.</p><p>If your whole app was made of Client Components, it would work just like it used to with yesterday’s SSR frameworks. So don’t feel pressured to convert your whole app to Server Components all at once! Adopt them incrementally in places that would stand to gain the most.

Adopt advanced patterns when performance issues arise</strong></a></h3><p>Steps 1 and 2 should be enough for most cases. But if you’re noticing performance issues, there are still some wins you can squeeze out of your RSC conversion.</p><p>For example, when we <a href="https://www.mux.com/blog/the-building-blocks-of-great-docs">migrated our docs site to RSCs</a>, we leaned on two patterns to unlock deeper gains. The first was wrapping key Server Components in <span>Suspense</span> to enable streaming of slow data fetches (as demonstrated earlier). Our whole app is statically generated except for the changelog sidebar, which comes from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">CMS</a>. By wrapping that sidebar in Suspense, the rest of the app doesn’t have to wait for the CMS fetch to resolve. Beyond that, we leveraged Next.js 13’s <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming"><span>loading.js</span></a> convention, which uses Suspense/streaming under the hood.</p><p>The second optimization we applied was creatively rearranging Client and Server Components to ensure that large libraries, like our syntax highlighting, <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a>, stayed on the server.

(The names could be anything; we use <span>.server</span> and <span>.client</span> just to keep things straight.)</p><div><figure><figcaption><div><p>components</p><!-- --><p>/<wbr>CodeBlock</p><!-- --><p>/<wbr>CodeBlock.server.js</p></div></figcaption><pre><code><span></span><span>// filename: components/CodeBlock/CodeBlock.server.js</span>

How can I be sure that my code is running on the server?</strong></a></h3><p>Honestly, at first, we just added <span>console.log</span> to our code during development and checked to see if that log came out of the server or web browser. This was enough to begin with, but we did eventually find a better way.</p><p>If you want to be extra sure that your Server Component will never get included in a bundle, you can import the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-only"><span>server-only</span> package</a>. This is extra handy if you want to make sure a large library or a secret key doesn’t end up where it shouldn’t. (Though if you’re using Next.js, <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables#bundling-environment-variables-for-the-browser">it<em> will</em> protect you</a> from accidentally shipping your environment variables.)</p><p>Using <span>server-only</span> also had another subtle but meaningful benefit for us: <em>legibility and maintainability</em>. Maintainers who see <span>server-only</span> at the top of a file know exactly where that file is running without having to keep a complete mental model of the component tree.</p><h2 id="so-should-i-use-react-server-components"><a href="#so-should-i-use-react-server-components"><span><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="42" height="42" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 42 42"><path d="m18.172 15.343 3.535-3.535a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 0l1.414 1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07l-3.535 3.536M23.828 26.657l-3.535 3.535a5 5 0 0 1-7.071 0l-1.414-1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0-7.07l3.535-3.536" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" d="m25.243 16.757-8.486 8.486" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path></svg><span>Link42Icon</span></span></span><strong>So, should I use React Server Components?</strong></a></h2><p>At the end of the day, React Server Components don’t come for free. It’s not just those gotchas surrounding CSS-in-JS or React Context. It’s also the added complexity: understanding what’s running on the server and what’s running on the client, <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/the-perils-of-rehydration/">understanding hydration</a>, incurring infrastructure costs, and of course, managing the code complexity (especially when mixing Client and Server Components). Every facet of complexity adds another surface for bugs to sneak in and for code to become less maintainable. Frameworks reduce this complexity, but they don’t eliminate it.</p><p>When deciding whether to adopt RSCs, weigh these costs against the benefits — like smaller bundle sizes and faster execution, which can be critical to SEO. Or advanced data loading patterns that can be used to optimize complex data-heavy sites. <a href="https://twitter.com/jescalan">Jeff Escalante</a>, trying to answer the same question in their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJOiXyVKExg&amp;list=PLRvKvw42Rc7MoxLVE_9qM24NAjqDdbBJc&amp;index=5">Reactathon talk</a>, nailed it with this diagram:</p><p>If your team is ready to take on the mental overhead and the performance benefits are worthwhile, then RSCs might just be for you.</p></div></div>]]></description>
