Last time, we started looking at the subsistence of peasant agriculture by considering the productivity of our model farming families under basically ideal conditions: relatively good yields and effectively infinite land.</p>



<p>This week we’re going to start peeling back those assumptions in light of the very small farm-sizes and capital availability our pre-modern peasants had.  Last week we found that, <em>assuming effectively infinite land</em> and reasonably high yields, our farmers produced enough to maintain their households fairly securely in relative comfort, with enough surplus over even their respectability needs to potentially support a small population of non-farmers.  But of course <strong>land isn’t infinite</strong> and <strong>also isn’t free</strong> and on top of that, the societies in which our peasant farmers live are often built to extract as much surplus from the peasantry as possible.</p>

For very Big Men, they might have several such estates and so be absentee landlords, in which case not only the Big Man, but his steward, might be figures of substantial power locally.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Land Holdings</h2>



<p>Returning to where we left off last week, we found that our model families could comfortably exceed their subsistence and ‘respectability’ needs with the labor they had assuming they had enough land (and other capital) to employ all of their available farming labor.  <em><strong>However</strong></em>, attentive readers will have noticed that the labor of these families could work <em><strong>a lot of land</strong></em>: 30.5 acres for The Smalls, 33.6 acres for The Middles and 56 acres for The Biggs.  That may not seem large by the standards of modern commercial farms, but few peasants had anything like such large landholdings; even <em>rich</em> peasants rarely owned so much.</p>



<p>We might compare, for instance, the land allotments of Macedonian and Greek military settlers in the Hellenistic kingdoms (particularly Egypt, where our evidence is good). These settlers were remarkably well compensated, because part of what the Hellenistic kings are trying to do is create a new class of Greco-Macedonian rentier-elites<span id="easy-footnote-1-31305"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-31305" title="That is, landholders with enough land to subsist off of the rents without needing to do much or any actual agricultural labor themselves."><sup>1</sup></a></span> as a new ethnically defined military ruling-class which would support their new monarchies. In Egypt, where we can see most clearly, infantrymen generally received 25 or 30 <em>arourai</em> (17 or 20.4 acres), while cavalrymen, socially higher up still, generally received 100 <em>arourai</em> (68 acres).<span id="easy-footnote-2-31305"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-31305" title="For scale with the cavalrymen we are talking about just a few thousand households lording over a country of perhaps five <em>million</em>; these fellows are honestly closer to something like a medieval knightly elite than the peasantry."><sup>2</sup></a></span> That infantry allotment is still anywhere from two thirds to less than half of what our model families can farm and yet was still large enough, as far as we can tell, to enable Ptolemaic Greco-Macedonian soldiers to live as rentier-elites, subsisting primarily if not entirely off of rents and the labor of others.<span id="easy-footnote-3-31305"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-31305" title="On these allotments, see P. Johstono, <em>The Army of Ptolemaic Egypt, 323-204 BC</em> (2020), 158-160 and C. Fischer-Bovet, <em>Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt </em>(2014), 212-217. On the rentier-self-sufficiency of these parcels, at a 5:1 yield, 30 <em>aroura</em> should yield something like 3,500kg wheat equivalent (almost 12 million calories), more than enough to support the settler&amp;#8217;s household at a 50% rent (see below) using labor from the much smaller adjacent farms of indigenous Egyptians. Indeed, to me it seems very likely the land allotments were calculated precisely on this basis, with infantrymen receiving the smallest allotment that could reliably support a household in leisure."><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Alternately, considering late medieval Europe through the study of Saint-Thibery,<span id="easy-footnote-4-31305"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-31305" title="Le Roy Ladurie, <em>Les Paysans de Languedoc</em> (1966)"><sup>4</sup></a></span> out of 189 households in 1460 in the village just fifteen households are in the same neighborhood of landholdings as the Smalls’ 33.6 acres above (so roughly 55 <em>setérée</em> and up)<span id="easy-footnote-5-31305"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-31305" title="A reminder that the <em>setérée</em> is an exact unit, about 1/5th to 1/4th of a hectare, so about 0.49-0.62 acres."><sup>5</sup></a></span> only six as much as The Biggs (about 90 <em>setérée</em> and up). In short <strong>our assessment so far has assumed our families are </strong><em><strong>extremely</strong></em><strong> rich peasants</strong>. But of course they almost certainly are not!</p>



<p>Instead, as we noted in our first part, the<a href="https://acoup.blog/2025/07/11/collections-life-work-death-and-the-peasant-part-i-households/" data-type="link" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2025/07/11/collections-life-work-death-and-the-peasant-part-i-households/"> average size of peasant landholdings was <em>extremely small</em></a>. Typical Roman landholdings were around 5-10 <em>iugera</em> (3.12-6.23 acres), in wheat-farming pre-Han northern China roughly 100 <em>mu</em> (4.764 acres), in Ptolemaic Egypt (for the indigenous, non-elite population) probably 5-10 <em>aroura</em> (3.4-6.8 acres) and so on.<span id="easy-footnote-6-31305"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-31305" title="Rosenstein (2004), 75, n.68; Erdkamp, (2005), 47-8; Cho-yun Hsu, <em>Han Agriculture: The Formation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy</em> (1980); Johstono, <em>The Army of Ptolemaic Egypt</em> (2020), 101; Fischer-Bovet, <em>Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt </em>(2014), 121"><sup>6</sup></a></span> In Saint-Thibery in Languedoc, the average (mean) farm size was about 24 <em>setérée</em> (~14.5 acres) but the more useful <strong>median farm size</strong> was just <em><strong>five</strong></em> <em>setérée</em> (~3 acres); the average is obviously quite distorted by the handful of households with <em>hundreds</em> of <em>setérée</em> of land.</p>



<p>So we might test three different farm sizes; once again, I am going to use Roman units because that’s how I am doing my background math.  We might posit a relatively a<strong> poor household farm of roughly three <em>iugera</em> </strong>(1.85 acres).  In Saint-Thibery, 68 of the 189 households (36%) had land holdings this small or smaller, so this is not an unreasonable ‘poor household’ – indeed, we could posit much poorer, but then we’re really just talking about tenant farmers, rather than freeholding peasants.  Next, we can posit a <strong>moderate household farm of roughly six <em>iugera</em> </strong>(3.8 acres); reasonably close to the median holding in Saint-Thibery and roughly what we think of as the lower-bound for ancient citizen-soldier-peasants.  Finally, we can posit a <strong>large household farm</strong> <strong>of nine <em>iugera</em></strong> (5.6 acres), reflective of what seems to be the upper-end of typical for those same citizen-soldier-peasants; at Saint-Thibery in 1460 there were a couple dozen families seemingly in this range.<span id="easy-footnote-7-31305"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-31305" title="It&amp;#8217;s hard to tell precisely from what I have because Le Roy Ladurie groups households in brackets."><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>



<p>For the sake of a relatively easier calculation, we can assume the same balance of wheat, barley and beans as last time, which lets us just specify an average yield after seed <em>per iugerum</em> of 81.2-189.5 kg of wheat equivalent (achieved by averaging the per-acre wheat equivalent production across all three crops, with seed removed),<span id="easy-footnote-8-31305"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-31305" title="The average yield-per-<em>iugerum</em> at each fertility level in wheat equivalent are: 4:1, 81.2kg; 5:1, 108.2kg; 6:1, 135.3kg; 7:1, 162.4kg; 8:1, 189.5kg."><sup>8</sup></a></span> with each <em>iugerum</em> demanding between 11 and 15 working days (averaging the labor requirements across all three crops). Finally, <strong>we need to remember the fallow</strong>: in this case we’re assuming about <strong>a third of each farm is not in production in any given year</strong>, meaning it is both not consuming any labor nor producing any crops. That lets us then quickly chart out our peasant families based on the land they might actually have (keeping in mind the household size and household land holdings aren’t going to match; the larger household <em>in people</em> won’t always be the one with more land). First, a reminder of the basic labor availability and grain requirements of our households.</p>

<p>Then for the smallest, 3<em> iugera</em> farm, the numbers work like this:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Small Farm</strong> (3 <em>iugera</em>)<br>2 <em>iugera</em> cropped<br>1 fallow</td><td>The Smalls</td><td>The Middles</td><td>The Biggs</td></tr><tr><td>Labor requirement</td><td>22-30 work days</td><td>22-30 work days</td><td>22-30 work days</td></tr><tr><td>Labor surplus</td><td>405-413 work days</td><td>477.5-485.5 work days</td><td>767.5-775.5 work days</td></tr><tr><td>Production after Seed</td><td>162.4-378.8kg wheat equivalent</td><td>162.4-378.8kg wheat equivalent</td><td>162.4-378.8kg wheat equivalent</td></tr><tr><td>Percentage of <strong><em>Subsistence</em></strong>:</td><td>14-32%</td><td>10-24%</td><td>6-14%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>And then for the medium-sized farm:</p>

<p>And the larger (but not <em>rich peasant</em>) farm:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Large Farm</strong> (9 <em>iugera</em>)<br>6 <em>iugera</em> cropped<br>3 fallow</td><td>The Smalls</td><td>The Middles</td><td>The Biggs</td></tr><tr><td>Labor requirement</td><td>66-90 work days</td><td>66-90 work days</td><td>66-90 work days</td></tr><tr><td>Labor surplus</td><td>345-369 work days</td><td>417.5-441.5 work days</td><td>707.5-731.5 work days</td></tr><tr><td>Production after Seed</td><td>487.6-1,136.5kg wheat equivalent</td><td>487.6-1,136.5k wheat equivalent</td><td>487.6-1,136.5k wheat equivalent</td></tr><tr><td>Percentage of <strong><em>Subsistence</em></strong>:</td><td>41-96%</td><td>31-72%</td><td>18-42%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>And we immediately see the problem: <em>only</em> the Smalls manage to get close to subsistence on very favorable (8:1) fertility assumptions on the small farm they own. Now it <em>is </em>possible for the peasants to push a little bit on these numbers. The most obvious way would be focusing as much as possible on wheat cultivation, which has higher labor demands but also the highest yield-per-acre (or <em>iugerum</em>), producing around 50% more calories than beans and 35% more calories than barley per-acre (see <a href="https://acoup.blog/2025/09/05/collections-life-work-death-and-the-peasant-part-ivb-working-days/" data-type="link" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2025/09/05/collections-life-work-death-and-the-peasant-part-ivb-working-days/">last week’s post for specifics</a>). <strong>But there’s a limit to going ‘all in’ on wheat to meet food shortfalls</strong>: the land might not be suitable for it and wheat exhausts the soil, so our farmers would need <em>some</em> sort of rotation.  That said, peasant diets were <em>overwhelmingly</em> grains (wheat and barley) for this reason: <strong>they provide the most calories for a favorable balance of land and labor</strong>. <strong>Our farmers might also try to supplement production with high-labor, high-density horticulture</strong>; a kitchen garden can take a lot of work but produce a lot of nutrition in a small space. But hitting household nutrition demands <em>entirely</em> with a kitchen garden isn’t going to work both because of the labor demands but also because the products of a kitchen garden tend not to keep well.</p>



<p>Instead the core problem <strong>is that our peasant households are <em>much too large</em> as units of labor for the farmland they own</strong>.  When we say that, what we mean is that given these households are both units of consumption (they have to provide for their members) and units of production (they are essentially agricultural small businesses), an <em>efficient</em> allocation of them would basically have each household on something like 30 acres of farmland, farming all of it (and thus using most of their labor) and selling the excess.  <strong>But the lack of economically sustainable social niches</strong> – that is, jobs that provide a reliable steady income to enable someone to obtain subsistence – <strong>means that these families are <em>very reluctant</em> to leave members without any land at all</strong>, so the holdings ‘fractionalize’ down to these tiny units, essentially the smallest units that <em>could</em> conceivably support one family (and sometimes not even that).</p>



<p>I’ve already seen folks in the comments realizing almost immediately why these conditions might make conquest or resettlement into areas of land easily brought under cultivation so attraction: if you <em>could </em>give each household 30-40 acres instead of 3-6, you could realize <em>substantial</em> improvements in quality of life (and the social standing of the farmers in question). And of course that kind of ‘land scarcity’ problem seems to have motivated both <a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/10/13/collections-ancient-greek-and-phoenician-colonization/" data-type="post" data-id="21229">ancient </a>and<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/05/14/collections-teaching-paradox-europa-universalis-iv-part-iii-europa-provincalis/" data-type="link" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2021/05/14/collections-teaching-paradox-europa-universalis-iv-part-iii-europa-provincalis/"> early modern</a> settler-colonialism: if you put farmers next to flat, open ground owned by another community, it won’t be too long before they try to make it farmland (violently expelling the previous owners in the process). This is also, I might add, part of the continual friction in areas where nomads and farmers meet: to a farmer, those grazing fields look like <em>more land</em> and <em>more land</em> is really valuable (though the response to <em>getting new land</em> is often not to create a bunch of freeholding large-farm homesteaders, but rather to replicate the patterns of tenancy and non-free agricultural labor these societies already have to the point of – as in the Americas – forcibly trafficking <em>enormous</em> numbers of enslaved laborers at great cost, suffering and horror, to create a non-free dependent class whose exploitation can enable those patterns.  Most conquering armies dream of becoming landlords, not peasants).<span id="easy-footnote-9-31305"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-9-31305" title="I would argue that the Roman approach to Italy from 509 to 218 BC appears to be an exception to this rule: the Romans do tend to use conquered land to set up large numbers of small landholding farms.  Not rich peasants, but the Roman military class &amp;#8211; the <em>assidui</em> farmer-citizen-soldiers &amp;#8211; were also clearly not utterly impoverished either.  It&amp;#8217;s striking that the Romans <em>could</em> have set up a system of rents and tribute extraction in Italy but didn&amp;#8217;t, instead effectively terraforming the Italian countryside into a machine for the production of heavy infantry.  That heavy infantry in turn bought the Romans stunning military superiority, which they then used in the second and first centuries BC to create an <em>enormous</em> system of tribute and extraction (rather than extending the approach they had used in Italy)."><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Alternately <strong>as <em>farms</em> these holdings could be a lot more efficient if they had <em>fewer people</em> on them</strong> and indeed when we read, for instance, ancient agricultural writers, they recommend estates with significantly fewer laborers per-unit-land-area than what we’d see in the peasant countryside. But that’s because the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/31/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-big-farms/" data-type="post" data-id="3935">Big Man is farming for profit</a> with a large estate that lets him tailor his labor force fairly precisely to his labor needs; the peasants are farming <em>to survive</em> and few people are going to let their brother, mother, or children starve and die in a ditch because it makes their farm modestly more productive per unit labor. Instead, they’re going try to do anything in their power to get enough income to have enough food for their <em>entire family</em> to survive.</p>



<p>There is no real way around it: <strong>our peasants need access to more land</strong>.  And that land is going to come with <em>conditions</em>.</p>

<h2>The Big Man’s Land</h2>



<p>Now before we march into talking about farming <em>someone else’s land</em>, it is worth exploring why our farmers don’t get more land by just <em>bringing more land under cultivation</em>.  And the answer here is pretty simple: <strong>in most of the world, preparing truly ‘wild’ land for cultivation takes a <em>lot</em> of labor</strong>.  In dry areas, that labor often comes in the form of irrigation demands: canals have to be dug out from water sources (mainly rivers) to provide enough moisture for the fields as the most productive crops (like wheat) demand a lot of moisture to grow well.  In climates suitable for rainfall agriculture, the problem is instead generally forests: if there’s enough rain to grow grain, there’s enough rain to grow <em>trees</em> and those trees have had quite the head start on you.  Clearing large sections of forest <em>by land</em> is a slow, labor-intensive thing and remember, you don’t just need the trees cut down, <em>you need the stumps pulled or burned</em>.  Fields also need to be relatively <em>flat</em> – which might demand terracing on hilly terrain – and for the sake of the plow they need to be free of large stones to the depth of the plow (at least a foot or so).</p>



<p>In short, clearing farmland was both <em>slow</em> and <em>expensive</em> and all of this assumes the land <em>can</em> be made suitable and that no one has title to it.  Of course if the forest is the hunting preserve of the local elite, they’re going to object quite loudly to your efforts to cut it down.  And a lot of land is simply going to be too dry or too hilly or too marshy to be made usable for farming ona practical time-scale for our peasants.  Such land simply cannot be brought usefully into cultivation; you can’t farm wheat in a swamp.<span id="easy-footnote-10-31305"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-10-31305" title="Of course you can drain a swamp, but such drainage efforts are the kinds of things large, well-administered <em>states</em> do, not the sort of thing your local peasants can summon the labor for."><sup>10</sup></a></span>  <strong>So it is quite hard and often impractical to bring new land into cultivation</strong>.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean new land <em>wasn’t</em> brought into cultivation, it absolutely was.  We can sometimes track population pressures archaeologically by watching this process: forests retreat, new villages pop up, swamps are drained and so on as previously marginal or unfarmable land is brought into cultivation.  Note, of course, if you bring a bunch of marginal fields into cultivation – say, a drier hillside not worth farming before – your average yield is going to go down because that land simply isn’t as productive (but demands the same amount of labor!).  But that process is generally slow, taking place over generations in response to population pressures.  It isn’t a solution available on the time-scale that most of our households are operating.  <em><strong>In the moment</strong></em>, <strong>the supply of land is mostly fixed for our peasants</strong>.</p>



<p>Which means our peasants need access to <em>more land</em> (or another way of generating income).  There are a range of places that land could come from:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Peasant Households without enough labor to farm their own land</strong>.  In order to make our households relevant at every part of the process, I haven’t modeled the substantial number of very small households we talked about in the first section, households with just 1 or 2 members.  If none of those householders were working-age males (e.g. a household with an elderly widow, or a young widow and minor children, etc.) they might seek to have other villagers help farm their land and split the production.  For very small households, that might be enough to provide them subsistence (or at least help).  Consequently <strong>those small, often ‘dying’ households provide a (fairly small) source of land for other households</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Rich peasants likewise might have more land than their household could farm or cared to farm</strong>.  Consider the position The Smalls would be if they were a rich peasant household with, say, 25 acres of land (in Saint-Thibery, 26 households (of 189) had this much or more land).  That’s enough land that, under good harvest conditions it would be easy enough to shoot past the household’s respectability requirements.  At which point <em>why work so hard</em>?  Why not sharecrop out a large chunk of your land to small farmers and split the production, so you still make your respectability basket in decent years, but don’t have to work so darn hard?</li>



<li><strong>The Big Man</strong>.  Another part of this ecosystem is invariably <em>large</em> landowners, who might have estates of hundreds of acres.  Columella , for instance, thinks of farm planning (he is thinking about large estates) in units of 100 <em>iugera</em> (62.3 acres) and 200 <em>iugera</em> (124.6 acres; Col. <em>Rust</em>. 12.7-9).  An estate of several hundred acres would hardly be unusual.  Likewise in the Middle Ages, the Big Man might be a local noble whose manor estate might likewise control a lot of land.  The Big Man might also be a religious establishment: temples (in antiquity) and monasteries and churches (in the Middle Ages) often controlled large amounts of productive farmland worked by serfs or tenants to provide their income.  <strong>Naturally, the Big Man isn’t doing his own farming</strong>; he may have some ‘built in’ labor force (workers in his household, enslaved workers, permanent wage laborers, etc.) but <strong>often the Big Man is going to rely substantially on the local peasantry for tenant labor</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>In practice, the Big Man is likely to represent the bulk of opportunities here, but by no means all of them.  As I noted before, while local conditions vary <em>a lot</em>, you won’t be too far wrong in thinking about landholdings as a basic ‘rule of thirds’ with one third of the land controlled by small peasants, one third by rich peasants and one third by the Big Man (who, again, might be a lord or a big landowner or a church, monastery or temple (in the latter case, the land is owned <em>by the god</em> in most polytheistic faiths) or even the king).  But of course only a little bit of the small peasant land is going to be in search of workers, since most peasant households have too many hands for too little land; <em>some</em> of the rich peasant land will be looking for workers (either tenants or hired hands), but rich peasants are still <em>peasants</em> – they do some of their farming on their own.  By contrast, the Big Man is marked out by the fact that he doesn’t do his own farming: he needs <em>some</em> kind of labor supply – wage laborers, enslaved/non-free laborers or tenants – for all of it.</p>



<p>But that also means that something like <em>half</em> (or more!) of the land around our peasant village might be owned by a household that needs outside labor to farm it.  <strong>So we have peasant households with surplus labor that need more land to farm and richer households with surplus land that needs labor</strong>.  The solution here <em>generally</em> was some form of tenancy which in the pre-modern world generally came in the form, effectively of sharecropping: the landowner agreed to let the poorer household farm some of his land in exchange for a percentage of the crop that resulted.  That ‘rent-in-kind’ structure is useful for the peasants who after all are not generally keeping <em>money</em> with which to pay rent.  At the same time, it limits their liability: if the harvest on tenant land fails, they may suffer a shortfall, but they aren’t <em>in debt</em> some monetary quantity of rent (though they may end up in debt in some other way).</p>



<p>Now the question is: <em>on what terms</em>?</p>



<h2>Tenancy</h2>



<p>And the answer here won’t surprise: bad terms.  The terms are bad.</p>



<p>There’s a useful discussion of this in L. Foxhall, “The Dependent Tenant” <em>JRS</em> 980 (1990), which in turn leans on K. Finkler, “Agrarian Reform and Economic Development” in <em>Agricultural Decision Making</em>, ed. P.F. Barlett (1980) to get a sense of what the terms for tenant farmers might normally look like.  Foxhall notes in this and a few other studies of modern but largely non-industrial farming arrangements that almost no households in these studies were entirely uninvolved in sharecropping or tenancy arrangements, but that the terms of tenancy arrangements varied a lot based on the inputs supplied.</p>



<p>The key inputs were labor, traction (for our pre-industrial peasants, this is “who supplies the plow-team animals”), water and seed.  The most common arrangement, representing almost a third of all arrangements, was where the tenant supplied labor only, while traction, water and seed were supplied by the landlord; the tenants share in these arrangements was a measly 18.75%.  A number of arrangements had the tenant supplying not only labor but also some mix of traction, water or seed (but not all) and often the tenant’s share of the production hovered between 40 and 60%, with exact 50/50 splits occurring in about a quarter of the sample.  In just one case did the tenant supply <em>everything</em> but the land itself; in that case the tenant’s share was 81.25%.</p>



<p>One thing that is obvious from just this example is that arrangements varied <em>a lot</em> and are going to depend on need and bargaining power. A ‘landlord’ who has land they want under cultivation but can supply basically nothing else may be relatively easy to negotiate into a fairly generous deal; a peasant who is absolutely destitute save for the labor of their hands is easy to exploit. An even 50/50 landholder, tenant split seems to have been the norm in much of Europe though, reflected in terms for sharecropper (<em>métayer</em> in French, <em>mezzadro</em> in Italian, <em>mitateri</em> in Sicilian, <em>mediero&nbsp;</em>in Spanish) which all mean ‘halver,’ though again the terms (and the share split) varied, typically based on demand but also on what exactly the landlord was providing (seed, plow teams, tools, physical infrastructure (like a farmhouse), etc).</p>



<p>For the sake of simplicity in our model, we can assume something like a 50/50 split, with our tenants supplying half of the seed, so that our net yield is exactly half of what it would have been.  We can then take those assumptions back to our model.  To establish a baseline, let’s run the numbers assuming first a ‘medium’ sized (6 <em>iugera</em>, 3.8 acres, with 4 <em>iugera </em>cropped and 2 fallowed) farm, with our fertility estimate set modestly to 6:1, a ‘good but not great’ yield.  We’re going to ’round up’ to the nearest even <em>iugerum</em> and assume an average of 13 days per <em>iugerum</em> of labor, just to make our calculations a bit simpler.  <strong>How hard is it for our peasants to meet their needs if they have to sharecrop the added land they need</strong>?</p>

<p><strong>As we can see, tenancy <em>dramatically</em> changes the picture for our peasants</strong>. Under these relatively typical assumptions, of our three families all can make subsistence in a normal year but <em>only</em> the Smalls have the right combination of a lot of labor and a relatively small family to have a shot at getting all of their respectability needs (in practice, they’d probably fall short once you consider necessary farm labor not in the fields – fence repair, tool maintenance, home repair and the like). It also isn’t hard to see how we might alter this picture to change our assumptions. Changing the size of the owned farmland has a significant impact (even though it is already so small) because our peasants realize <em>twice</em> the production per unit-land-area for land they own over land they rent (again, terms might vary). Put another way, under these assumptions, somewhat marginal owned farmland that gives an OK-but-not-great yield of 4:1 is of the same use to our peasants as <em>really good</em> tenant-farmed farmland giving a 7:1 yield (both offer 81.2kg of wheat equivalent per <em>iugerum</em> after rent is paid).</p>



<p>That said, <strong>the fact that our peasants end up with enough labor to comfortable exceed their subsistence requirements, but not their comfort requirements is favorable <em>for extraction</em></strong>, which we’ll discuss below.  These are households with spare labor who can’t fulfill all of their wants entirely on their own, giving the state or local Big Men both a lot of levers to squeeze more labor out of them and <em>also</em> giving the households the available above-subsistence labor to squeeze.  By contrast if these peasants had enough land to meet all of their needs themselves, there would be fewer opportunities to compel them to do additional labor <em>beyond that</em>.</p>



<p>But even before we get to extraction, tenancy is also <strong>changing our peasants’ incentives</strong>. Economics has the concept of <em>diminishing marginal returns</em>, the frequent phenomenon where adding one more unit of a given input produces less and less output per additional input-unit. You will find more errors in the first hour of proofreading than the fiftieth hour, for instance. There’s also the concept of <em>diminishing marginal utility</em>: beyond a certain point, getting more of something is less valuable per unit added. Getting one bar of chocolate when you have none? Fantastic. Getting one bar of chocolate when you have ten thousand? Solidly meh.</p>



<p>Both are working on our farmers to press their natural production inclination not to <strong>maximum labor</strong> or even <strong>hitting that respectability basket</strong> but just <strong>subsistence and a little bit more</strong>.  On the diminishing marginal returns front, naturally when it comes to both owned land and rented land, our peasants are going to farm the most productive land <em>first</em>.  This is why when we talk about expanding population and expanding agriculture, we often talk about <em>marginal</em> land (less productive land) coming under cultivation; because all of the really great land was <em>already being farmed</em>.  But poor farmland doesn’t demand less labor time (indeed, it may demand more), it just produces less.  So while we’ve been working here with averages, you should imagine that the first few acres of farmland will be <em>more</em> productive and the latter few <em>less</em> productive.</p>



<p>Tenancy puts this into even more sharp contrast because it creates a really significant discontinuity in the value of farming additional land: the rents are <em>so high</em> that sharecropped or tenant land is <em>much less useful</em> (per unit labor) to the peasant than their own land.  So you have a slow downward slope of ‘land quality’ and somewhere in that slope there is the point at which the peasants have farmed all of their own land and so suddenly the effective yield-per-labor-after-rent drops <em>by half</em> (or more!).  So the first few hundred kilograms of wheat equivalent are probably fairly easy to get: you have a few good fields you own and your net out of them might be 130-190kg of wheat equivalent per <em>iugerum</em>.  Put in a couple dozen days on those two good <em>iugera</em> and The Smalls have just over a quarter of their subsistence needs.  But then they have their more marginal fields, which might only yield 80-100kg.  Still not terrible but the next couple of dozen days of labor don’t get them as far: not to half but just 44% or so.  But now you are out of your own land, so you go to your rich neighbor or the Big Man to get access to some more and suddenly even on their best fields your yield-per-<em>iugerum</em> is 80-95kg so another couple of dozen working days gets you just from 44% to just 57% of what you need.  So you need to line up a lot more land, but <em>now</em> you might be starting to look at the worse fields the Big Man has.  He still wants them farmed, after all, his choice is between doing nothing and earning money or doing nothing and not earning money; he’d rather earn money.  But suddenly you’re looking at maybe as little as 50-60kg of wheat equivalent per <em>iugerum</em> and the labor demands have not gone down.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the comfort you get from each kilogram of wheat equivalent is <strong>also going down</strong>.  The first 80% or so of your subsistence needs is necessary simply to not starve to death; a bit more makes the household sustainable in the long term.  But then – and remember, these choices are coming as you are facing <em>diminishing marginal returns</em> on each day of labor you put in – is it <em>really</em> worth your time to cultivate a couple more fields in order to just get a bit more meat in your diet and have slightly nicer household goods?  Wouldn’t you rather rest?</p>



<p>And so what you see is most peasant households aiming not for the full respectability basket, but that “subsistence – and a little bit more” because as each day of labor produces less product and each product produces less joy, at some point you’d rather not work.</p>



<p>And as we’ve seen <em>in theory</em>, our households might hit that crossover point – subsistence and a little bit more – fairly quickly in their labor supply. We haven’t yet, but should now, account for labor spent on things like maintaining tools, fixing fences and other capital investments. If we allocate, say, 45 days, for that and assume that our farmers also want to have <em>some</em> cushion on subsistence (say, another 10%), we might expect The Smalls to be more or less satisfied (on that medium landholding, average 6:1 yields) with something like 245 working days (56% of total), the Middles with 331 working days (65%) and the Biggs with 560 (70%). Working like that, they won’t be rich and won’t ever become rich (but they were never going to become rich regardless), but they’ll mostly survive – some years will be hard – and they’ll have a little bit more time to rest.  <strong>Some families, a bit more industrious, might push towards achieving most or all of the respectability basket, at least in good years; others might be willing to stick closer to subsistence </strong>(or unable to do otherwise).</p>



<p>Of course in areas where the farmland is meaningfully more marginal – average yields around 4:1 rather than 6:1 – our peasants are going to need to work quite a lot more, about 60% more.  That pushes the Smalls to about 84% of their available labor, the Middles to <em>99%</em> and the Biggs actually slightly into deficit, demanding roughly 110% of their available labor.  <strong>We should keep in mind that each peasant household is going to exist somewhere along the spectrum</strong>: some with larger amounts of property or access to better land, some with less.  We’ll come back to this in a moment, but this is part of why the poorest of the peasantry were often exempt from things like military service: positioned on marginal land in poor communities, they had little excess labor available.  Most peasant households would have been somewhere in between these two, so a labor utilization rate ranging from 50 to 100%, with a lot of households in that 60-80% labor utilization range.</p>



<p>And now you might think, “doesn’t this take us back to peasants actually not working all that much compared to modern workers?” and first I would want to point out that these peasants are also experiencing a quality of living <em>way</em> below workers in modern industrial countries but also <strong>no because we haven’t talked about <em>extraction</em></strong>.</p>







<p>Because of course the problem here, from the perspective of everyone who <em>isn’t</em> our peasants is that if the peasantry only does the amount of agricultural labor necessary to subsist themselves and just a little more, the society doesn’t have economic room for much else in the way of productive (or unproductive) economic activity.  <strong>Remember: our peasants are the only significant population actually <em>doing farming</em></strong>.  Sure the Big Men and the gentry and temples and monasteries may <em>own land</em>, but they are mostly renting that land out <em>to peasants</em> (or hiring peasants to work it, or enslaving peasants and forcing them to work it).</p>



<p>And those landholding elites, in turn, <em>want to do things</em>.  They want to build temples, wage wars, throw fancy parties, employ literate scribes to write works of literature and of course they also want to <em>live in leisure</em> (not farming) while doing this.  And the activities they want to do – the temples, wars, fancy parties, scribes and so on – that requires a lot of food and other agricultural goods to sustain the people doing those things.  It also requires a bunch of surplus labor – some of that surplus labor are specialists, but a lot of it is effectively ‘unspecialized’ labor.</p>



<p>To do those things, those elites need to draw both agricultural surplus and surplus labor out of the countryside.  And we should that of course, obviously, this is an exploitative relationship, but it is also worth noting that for pre-modern agrarian economies, the societies where elites can centralize and control the largest pile of labor and surplus tend to use it to <em>conquer the societies that don’t</em> so ‘demilitarized peasant utopia’ is not a society that is going to last very long (but ‘highly militarized landowner republic’ might).</p>



<p>It is thus necessary to note that when we see the emergence of complex agrarian societies – cities, writing, architectural wonders, artistic achievements and so on – <strong>these achievements are mostly elite projects, ‘funded’ </strong>(in food and labor, if not in money) <strong>out of extraction from the peasantry</strong>.</p>



<p>Exactly <em>how</em> this extraction worked varied a lot society to society and even within regions and ethnic and social classes within society.  As noted above, in areas where agriculture was not very productive, extraction was limited.  By contrast, highly productive regions didn’t so much producer richer peasants as they tended to produce far higher rates of extraction.  In some society, where the freeholding farming peasantry (or part of that peasantry) formed an important political constituency (like some Greek <em>poleis</em> or the Roman Republic), the small farmers might manage to preserve relatively more of their surplus for themselves, but often in exchange for significant demands in terms of military and civic participation.</p>



<p>To take perhaps the simplest direct example of removing labor from the countryside, from 218 to 168, the Romans averaged around 10-12 legions deployed in a given year, 45,000-54,000 citizen soldiers.<span id="easy-footnote-11-31305"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-11-31305" title="On Roman deployments, see Taylor, <em>Soldiers and Silver</em> (2020)."><sup>11</sup></a></span>  Against an adult-male citizen population of perhaps ~250,000 implies that the Roman army was consuming something like a quarter of all of the available citizen manpower in the countryside, though enslaved laborers and males under 17 wouldn’t be captured by this figure.  Accounting for those groups we might imagine the Roman <a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/06/16/collections-how-to-raise-a-roman-army-the-dilectus/" data-type="post" data-id="19439"><em>dilectus</em> </a>is siphoning off something like 15% of the labor capacity of the countryside on average (sometimes spiking far higher, as much as <em>half</em> of it).  On top of that, the demand of these soldiers that they supply their own arms and armor would have pushed farmers to farm a little bit more than subsistence-and-a-little-more to afford the cost of the arms (traded for or purchased with that surplus; at least initially these transactions are not happening in coined money).</p>



<p>We see similar systems in the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-iv-men-of-rohan/" data-type="link" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-iv-men-of-rohan/">Carolingian levy system or the Anglo-Saxon fyrd</a>, where households might be brigaded together – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansus" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansus">in the Carolingian system, households were grouped into <em>mansi</em></a> – based on agricultural production (you can see how that works above as a proxy for ‘available surplus labor!’) with a certain number – three or four <em>mansi </em>in the Carolingian system – required to furnish one armed man for either a regional levy or the main field army.  The goal of such systems is to take the surplus labor above and make it available for military service.</p>



<p>Alternately, the elites might not want their peasants as <em>soldiers</em> but as <em>workers</em>.  Thus the very frequent appearance of<strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corv%C3%A9e" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corv%C3%A9e"><em>corvée</em> labor</a></strong>: a requirement of a certain amount of intermittent, unpaid forced labor.  This might be labor on the local lord’s estate (a sort of unpaid tenancy arrangement) or labor on public works (walls, castles, roads) or a rotating labor force working in state-owned (or elite-owned) productive enterprises (mines, for instance).  As with military service, this sort of labor demand could be shaped to what the local populace would bear and enforced by a military aristocracy against a largely disarmed peasantry.  Once again looking at the statistics above, even a few weeks a year <em>per man</em> (rather than per household) would drain most of the surplus labor out of our households.  Adding, for instance, a month of <em>corvée</em> labor of per work-capable male (an age often pegged around <em>seven</em> for these societies) under our favorable (6:1) assumptions above bring our work totals to 305 days (70% of total) for the Smalls, 373 (77%) for the Middles and 650 (81.5%) for the Biggs.  <em>Corvée</em> labor demands could be less than this, but also often quite a bit more (expectations varied a lot by local laws and customs.</p>



<p>Alternately, elites might just <em>crank up the taxes</em>.  In the Hellenistic states (the Ptolemaic and Seleucid kingdoms especially), the army wasn’t a peasant levy, but rather a core of Greco-Macedonian rentier elites (your ‘rich peasants’ or ‘gentlemen farmers’), regional levies and mercenaries.  To pay for that (and fund the lavish courts and public works that royal legitimacy required), the indigenous Levantine, Egyptian, Syrian, Mesopotamian (etc. etc.) underclasses were both made to be the tenants on the estates of those rentier elites (land seized from those same peasants in the initial Macedonian conquest or shortly thereafter) but also to pay <em>very high taxes</em> on their own land.<span id="easy-footnote-12-31305"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-12-31305" title="The way this was structurally, legally, was that the king, directly or indirectly <em>owned all the land</em> (&amp;#8216;spear-won&amp;#8217;) and so many taxes were instead technically &amp;#8216;rents&amp;#8217; paid to the king."><sup>12</sup></a></span>  So while tax rates on military-settler (that is, Greco-Macedonian rentier elites) land might have been around 10% – 1/12th (8.3%) seems to have been at least somewhat common – taxes on the land of the indigenous <em>laoi</em> could run as high as 50%, even before one got to taxes on markets, customs duties, sales taxes, a head tax and state monopolies on certain natural resources including timber and importantly <em>salt</em>.<span id="easy-footnote-13-31305"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-13-31305" title="On the Seleucid taxation system, see Aperghis, <em>The Seleucid Royal Economy</em> (2004).  For an overview of the relatively similar Ptolemaic system, see von Reden, <em>Money in Ptolemaic Egypt</em> (2007), Préaux, <em>. <em>L’économie royale des Lagides</em></em> (1979)."><sup>13</sup></a></span>  So the poor <em>laoi</em> might be paying extortionate taxes on their own lands, lighter taxes on settler (or temple) lands, but then also paying extortionate rents of those tenant-farmed lands.</p>



<p>Another micro-scale option was <strong>debt</strong>.  We’ve been assuming our farmers are operating at steady-state subsistence, but as we keep noting, <strong>yields in any given year were highly variable</strong>.  What peasants were forced to do in bad years, almost invariably as <strong>go into debt to the Big Man</strong>.  But as noted, they’re simply not generating a lot in the way of <em>surplus</em> to ever pay off that debt.  That in turn makes the debt itself a tool of control, what we often call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_bondage" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_bondage">debt peonage</a>.  Since the Big Man sets the terms of the debt (at a time when the peasant is absolutely desperate) it was trivially easy to construct a debt structure that the peasant could never pay off, giving the Big Man leverage to demand services – labor, tenancy on poor terms, broad social deference, etc. – in perpetuity.  And of course, if the Big Man ever wants to expand his land holdings, all he would need to do would be to call in the un-payable debt and – depending on the laws around debt in the society – either seize the peasant’s land in payment or reduce the peasant into debt-slavery.<span id="easy-footnote-14-31305"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-14-31305" title="The abolition of this specific form of slavery (but not others) is a key political moment in the development of both Rome and Athens (and we may assume, many other Greek <em>poleis</em>) that signals the political importance of the smallholding farmer-citizens and their ability to compel major reforms.  But the Big Man can still seize your farm!"><sup>14</sup></a></span></p>



<p>In short,<strong> elites had a <em>lot of mechanisms</em> to sop up the excess labor in the countryside and they generally used them</strong>.</p>



<p>Consequently, while peasants, unencumbered by taxes, rents, elites, debt, conscription and so on might have been able to <em>survive</em> working only a relatively small fraction of their time (probably around 100 days per year per-working-age male (again, age 7 or so and up) would suffice), <strong>they did not live in that world.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, they lived in a world where their own landholdings were extremely small – too small to fully support their households, although their small holdings might still provide a foundation of income for survival.  Instead, they had to work on land owned or at least controlled by Big Men: local rentier-elites, the king, temples, monasteries, and so on.  Those big institutions which could wield both legal and military force in turn extracted high rents and often demanded additional labor from our peasants, which soaked up much of their available labor, <strong>leading to that range of 250-300 working days a year, with 10-12 hour days each, for something on the order of 2,500-3,600 working hours for a farm-laboring peasant annually</strong>.</p>



<p>Which is quite a lot less than the c. 250 typical work days (261 weekdays minus holidays/vacation) in the United States – just by way of example of a modern industrial economy – at typically eight hours a day or roughly 2,000 working hours a year.  <strong>Of course it is also the case that those roughly 2,000 modern hours buy <em>a much better standard of living</em></strong> than what our medieval peasants had access to – consider that a single unimpressive car represents more value just in worked metal (steel) than even many ancient or medieval <em>elites</em> could muster.  <strong>No, you do not work more than a medieval or ancient peasant: you work somewhat less, in order to obtain <em>far</em> more material comfort</strong>.  Isn’t industrialization grand?</p>



<p><strong>That said, our picture of labor in peasant households is not complete!</strong> Indeed, we have only seen to half of our subsistence basket – you will recall we broke out textiles separately – because we haven’t yet even really introduced the workload of <strong>probably the most fully employed people in these households: the women</strong>. And what’s where we’ll go in the next post in this series.</p>
<ol><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-1-31305"></span>That is, landholders with enough land to subsist off of the rents without needing to do much or any actual agricultural labor themselves.<a href="#easy-footnote-1-31305"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-2-31305"></span>For scale with the cavalrymen we are talking about just a few thousand households lording over a country of perhaps five <em>million</em>; these fellows are honestly closer to something like a medieval knightly elite than the peasantry.<a href="#easy-footnote-2-31305"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-3-31305"></span>On these allotments, see P. Johstono, <em>The Army of Ptolemaic Egypt, 323-204 BC</em> (2020), 158-160 and C. Fischer-Bovet, <em>Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt </em>(2014), 212-217. On the rentier-self-sufficiency of these parcels, at a 5:1 yield, 30 <em>aroura</em> should yield something like 3,500kg wheat equivalent (almost 12 million calories), more than enough to support the settler’s household at a 50% rent (see below) using labor from the much smaller adjacent farms of indigenous Egyptians. Indeed, to me it seems very likely the land allotments were calculated precisely on this basis, with infantrymen receiving the smallest allotment that could reliably support a household in leisure.<a href="#easy-footnote-3-31305"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-4-31305"></span>Le Roy Ladurie, <em>Les Paysans de Languedoc</em> (1966)<a href="#easy-footnote-4-31305"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-5-31305"></span>A reminder that the <em>setérée</em> is an exact unit, about 1/5th to 1/4th of a hectare, so about 0.49-0.62 acres.<a href="#easy-footnote-5-31305"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-6-31305"></span>Rosenstein (2004), 75, n.68; Erdkamp, (2005), 47-8; Cho-yun Hsu, <em>Han Agriculture: The Formation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy</em> (1980); Johstono, <em>The Army of Ptolemaic Egypt</em> (2020), 101; Fischer-Bovet, <em>Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt </em>(2014), 121<a href="#easy-footnote-6-31305"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-7-31305"></span>It’s hard to tell precisely from what I have because Le Roy Ladurie groups households in brackets.<a href="#easy-footnote-7-31305"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-8-31305"></span>The average yield-per-<em>iugerum</em> at each fertility level in wheat equivalent are: 4:1, 81.2kg; 5:1, 108.2kg; 6:1, 135.3kg; 7:1, 162.4kg; 8:1, 189.5kg.<a href="#easy-footnote-8-31305"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-9-31305"></span>I would argue that the Roman approach to Italy from 509 to 218 BC appears to be an exception to this rule: the Romans do tend to use conquered land to set up large numbers of small landholding farms.  Not rich peasants, but the Roman military class – the <em>assidui</em> farmer-citizen-soldiers – were also clearly not utterly impoverished either.  It’s striking that the Romans <em>could</em> have set up a system of rents and tribute extraction in Italy but didn’t, instead effectively terraforming the Italian countryside into a machine for the production of heavy infantry.  That heavy infantry in turn bought the Romans stunning military superiority, which they then used in the second and first centuries BC to create an <em>enormous</em> system of tribute and extraction (rather than extending the approach they had used in Italy).<a href="#easy-footnote-9-31305"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-10-31305"></span>Of course you can drain a swamp, but such drainage efforts are the kinds of things large, well-administered <em>states</em> do, not the sort of thing your local peasants can summon the labor for.<a href="#easy-footnote-10-31305"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-11-31305"></span>On Roman deployments, see Taylor, <em>Soldiers and Silver</em> (2020).<a href="#easy-footnote-11-31305"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-12-31305"></span>The way this was structurally, legally, was that the king, directly or indirectly <em>owned all the land</em> (‘spear-won’) and so many taxes were instead technically ‘rents’ paid to the king.<a href="#easy-footnote-12-31305"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-13-31305"></span>On the Seleucid taxation system, see Aperghis, <em>The Seleucid Royal Economy</em> (2004).

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/09/12/proton-mail-journalist-accounts-suspended/">https://theintercept.com/2025/09/12/proton-mail-journalist-accounts-suspended/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45226903">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p><span>The company behind</span> the Proton Mail email service, Proton, <a href="https://proton.me/#:~:text=We%20are%20a%20neutral%20and%20safe%20haven%20for%20your%20personal%20data%2C%20committed%20to%20defending%20your%20freedom">describes itself</a> as a “neutral and safe haven for your personal data, committed to defending your freedom.”</p>
<p>But last month, Proton disabled email accounts belonging to journalists reporting on security breaches of various South Korean government computer systems following a complaint by an unspecified cybersecurity agency. After a public outcry, and multiple weeks, the journalists’ accounts were eventually reinstated — but the reporters and editors involved still want answers on how and why Proton decided to shut down the accounts in the first place.</p>
<p>Martin Shelton, deputy director of digital security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, highlighted that numerous newsrooms use Proton’s services as alternatives to something like Gmail “specifically to avoid situations like this,” pointing out that “While it’s good to see that Proton is reconsidering account suspensions, journalists are among the users who need these and similar tools most.” Newsrooms like The Intercept, the Boston Globe, and the Tampa Bay Times all rely on Proton Mail for<a href="https://theintercept.com/source/"> emailed tip submissions</a>.</p>
<p>Shelton noted that perhaps Proton should “prioritize responding to journalists about account suspensions privately, rather than when they go viral.”</p>
<p>On Reddit, Proton’s official account <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/1nd1nrc/is_that_true/ndg68pz/">stated</a> that “Proton did not knowingly block journalists’ email accounts” and that the “situation has unfortunately been blown out of proportion.” Proton did not respond to The Intercept’s request for comment.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) -->


<!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[0] -->
<p><span>The two journalists</span> whose accounts were disabled were working on an <a href="https://phrack.org/issues/72/7_md">article</a> published in the August issue of the long-running hacker zine Phrack. The story described how a sophisticated hacking operation — what’s known in cybersecurity parlance as an APT, or advanced persistent threat — had wormed its way into a number of South Korean computer networks, including those of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military Defense Counterintelligence Command, or DCC.</p>
<p>The journalists, who published their story under the names Saber and cyb0rg, describe the hack as being consistent with the work of Kimsuky, a notorious North Korean state-backed APT <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1938">sanctioned</a> by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2023.</p>
<p>As they pieced the story together, emails viewed by The Intercept show that the authors followed cybersecurity best practices and conducted what’s known as responsible disclosure: notifying affected parties that a vulnerability has been discovered in their systems prior to publicizing the incident.</p>
<p>Saber and cyb0rg created a dedicated Proton Mail account to coordinate the responsible disclosures, then proceeded to notify the impacted parties, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the DCC, and also notified South Korean cybersecurity organizations like the Korea Internet and Security Agency, and <a href="https://www.krcert.or.kr/">KrCERT/CC</a>, the state-sponsored Computer Emergency Response Team. According to emails viewed by The Intercept, KrCERT wrote back to the authors, thanking them for their disclosure.</p>
<p>A note on cybersecurity jargon: CERTs are agencies consisting of cybersecurity experts specializing in dealing with and responding to security incidents. CERTs exist in over 70 countries — with some countries having multiple CERTs each specializing in a particular field such as the financial sector — and may be government-sponsored or private organizations. They adhere to a set of formal technical <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2350">standards</a>, such as being expected to react to reported cybersecurity threats and security incidents. A high-profile example of a CERT agency in the U.S. is the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, which has recently been <a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2025/06/cisa-projected-lose-third-its-workforce-under-trumps-2026-budget/405726/">gutted</a> by the Trump administration.</p>

<!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>A week after the print issue of Phrack came out, and a few days before the digital version was released, Saber and cyb0rg found that the Proton account they had set up for the responsible disclosure notifications had been suspended. A day later, Saber discovered that his personal Proton Mail account had also been suspended. Phrack posted a timeline of the account suspensions at the top of the published article, and later highlighted the timeline in a viral social media <a href="https://x.com/phrack/status/1965385266904138241">post</a>. Both accounts were suspended owing to an unspecified “potential policy violation,” according to screenshots of account login attempts reviewed by The Intercept.</p>
<p>The suspension notice instructed the authors to fill out <a href="https://proton.me/support/appeal-abuse">Proton’s abuse appeals form</a> if they believed the suspension was in error. Saber did so, and received a reply from a member of Proton Mail’s Abuse Team who went by the name Dante.</p>
<p>In an email viewed by The Intercept, Dante told Saber that their account “has been disabled as a result of a direct connection to an account that was taken down due to violations of our terms and conditions while being used in a malicious manner.” Dante also provided a link to <a href="https://proton.me/legal/terms">Proton’s terms of service</a>, going on to state, “We have clearly indicated that any account used for unauthorized activities, will be sanctioned accordingly.” The response concluded by stating, “We consider that allowing access to your account will cause further damage to our service, therefore we will keep the account suspended.”</p>
<p>On August 22, a Phrack editors reached out to Proton, writing that no hacked data was passed through the suspended email accounts, and asked if the account suspension incident could be deescalated. After receiving no response from Proton, the editor sent a follow-up email on September 6. Proton once again did not reply to the email.</p>
<p>On September 9, the official Phrack X account made a <a href="https://x.com/phrack/status/1965385266904138241">post</a> asking Proton’s official account asking why Proton was “cancelling journalists and ghosting us,” adding: “need help calibrating your moral compass?” The post quickly went viral, garnering over 150,000 views.</p>
<p>Proton’s official account replied the following day, <a href="https://x.com/ProtonPrivacy/status/1965701661705322849">stating</a> that Proton had been “alerted by a CERT that certain accounts were being misused by hackers in violation of Proton’s Terms of Service. This led to a cluster of accounts being disabled. Our team is now reviewing these cases individually to determine if any can be restored.” Proton then <a href="https://x.com/ProtonPrivacy/status/1965828424963895605">stated</a> that they “stand with journalists” but “cannot see the content of accounts and therefore cannot always know when anti-abuse measures may inadvertently affect legitimate activism.”</p>
<p>Proton did not publicly specify which CERT had alerted them, and didn’t answer The Intercept’s request for the name of the specific CERT which had sent the alert. KrCERT also did not reply to The Intercept’s question about whether they were the CERT that had sent the alert to Proton.</p>

<p>Later in the day, Proton’s founder and CEO Andy Yen <a href="https://x.com/andyyen/status/1965767030688317832">posted</a> on X that the two accounts had been reinstated. Neither Yen nor Proton explained why the accounts had been reinstated, whether they had been found to not violate the terms of service after all, why had they been suspended in the first place, or why a member of the Proton Abuse Team reiterated that the accounts had violated the terms of service during Saber’s appeals process.</p>
<p>Phrack noted that the account suspensions created a “real impact to the author. The author was unable to answer media requests about the article.” The co-authors, Phrack pointed out, were also in the midst of the responsible disclosure process and working together with the various affected South Korean organizations to help fix their systems. “All this was denied and ruined by Proton,” Phrack stated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phrack editors said that the incident leaves them “concerned what this means to other whistleblowers or journalists. The community needs assurance that Proton does not disable accounts unless Proton has a court order or the crime (or ToS violation) is apparent.”</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Recently I read <a href="https://blog.tjll.net/a-beginners-guide-to-extending-emacs/">this beginners guide to extend Emacs</a>.
The guide is perfect for starting out with elisp and it shows a lot of care in teaching how to interact with Emacs.</p>

<p>To me, the most important bit though is this one, from the section aptly named <strong>Emacs Wants You to Extend It</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I haven’t written plugins for other editors extensively, but I can tell you this: emacs doesn’t just make deep customization available, but it actively encourages you to make an absolute customization messes masterpieces. Core editor functions aren’t just documented, but often include tidbits about “you probably want to see this other variable” or “here’s how you should use this”.</p>

  <p>Not only that, but emacs happily hands you functions shaped like nuclear warheads like advice-add (that let you override any function) that can absolutely obliterate your editor if you hold it the wrong way. Of course, this also grants you unlimited power.</p>

  <p>Remember that emacs is designed to be torn apart and rearranged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the core bit of the argument. Emacs, as a system, wants you to
extend it and it gives you all the means to do so. This is in contrast
with systems that can be extended through scripting and instead don’t give
you all the means to do so!</p>

<p>I think the tutorial is a fantastic example of <em>doing things
right</em>. There is a well-thought example, a constructive approach where
the solution grows to a full package.</p>

<p>This is problematic. You may get the impression that extending Emacs
is only possible if you do things right and that is definitely not true.</p>

<p>To make my point I want to walk you through an example. I will show
you how I used standard Emacs extension-points to extend org-mode to sort my
reading lists automatically.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-want">What do I want?</h2>

<p>The behavior I want is that when I save an org file the entries are
ordered automatically. I keep a timeline of the papers I am reading
and it is annoying to keep them kind of ordered.</p>

<p>This is the content of an example buffer.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="org">#+TITLE: My tematic reading list

* Paper which is old but not too old
:PROPERTY:
:year: 2002
:END:

* Definitely older paper but unfortunately it's later in the list
:PROPERTY:
:year: 1998
:END:</code></pre></figure>

<p>When I add a paper to my reading list I run <code>org-sort-entries</code> and
interactively select to order the entries by the value in the property
<code>year</code>. Initally this was nice to have but now it’s just annoying that
I have to keep doing it. Let’s extend org-mode so that this is done automatically.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-solution">A simple solution</h2>

<p>The first step is to automate the interactive part. Lucky for me this is easy
as <code>org-sort-entries</code> is both a function and a command. I can call it in a
script just as I can run it as a command.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="elisp"><span>(</span><span>defvar</span> <span>org-sort-option</span> <span>"year"</span><span>)</span>

<span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>org-sort-run</span> <span>()</span>
  <span>(</span><span>when</span> <span>(</span><span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>derived-mode-p</span> <span>'org-mode</span><span>)</span> <span>org-sort-option</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>case-sensitive</span> <span>nil</span><span>)</span>
	  <span>(</span><span>sorting-type</span> <span>?r</span><span>)</span>
	  <span>(</span><span>getkey-func</span> <span>nil</span><span>)</span>
	  <span>(</span><span>compare-func</span> <span>nil</span><span>)</span>
	  <span>(</span><span>property</span> <span>org-sort-option</span><span>)</span>
	  <span>(</span><span>interactive?</span> <span>nil</span><span>))</span>
      <span>(</span><span>org-sort-entries</span> <span>case-sensitive</span> <span>sorting-type</span> <span>getkey-func</span> <span>compare-func</span> <span>property</span> <span>interactive?</span><span>))))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This solves one part of the problem. Let’s solve the other one, automatically calling
<code>org-sort-run</code> whenever an org-mode buffer is saved.</p>

<p>Emacs already has support for this use-case through the use of hooks. We can run
<code>org-sort-run</code> all the times we want to save a buffer.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="elisp"><span>(</span><span>add-hook</span> <span>'before-save-hook</span> <span>#'</span><span>org-sort-run</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These two together solve the problem but the solution presented is “just more code”.
We tapped into the <em>hook</em> extension point but this would be possible in any
<em>scriptable system</em> that exposes well-defined extension points such as hooks and commands.</p>

<h2 id="leveraging-emacs-extensibility-to-extend-org-mode">Leveraging Emacs’ extensibility to extend org-mode</h2>

<p>I want to show that even if something is not thought with
extensibility in mind Emacs allow us to extend it. Most importantly, while we
want to extend org-mode’s behavior we would like this not to be an
extension to org-mode’s code.</p>

<p>Here’s the updated problem statement. Have the buffer be automatically
sorted and have the sorting criteria be in the buffer itself. We will
specify the sorting as a <em>in-buffer setting</em> and use Emacs to
support this never thought before org-mode behavior.</p>

<p>Our example buffer changes to the following.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="diff"> #+TITLE: My tematic reading list
<span>+#+SORT: year
</span> 
 * Paper which is old but not too old
 :PROPERTY:
 :year: 2002
 :END:
 
 * Definitely older paper but unfortunately it's later in the list
 :PROPERTY:
 :year: 1998
 :END:</code></pre></figure>



<p>The hard part of this is to find how org-mode reads <em><a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/In_002dbuffer-Settings.html">in-buffer
settings</a></em>
from the header. A <kbd>M-x find-library</kbd> later we are in org’s
sources.</p>

<p>Searching for <code>+STARTUP</code> (<kbd>Ctrl+s +STARTUP</kbd>), one of the
supported settings, leads us to <code>org-startup-folded</code> and that in turn
(<kbd>Ctrl+s org-startup-folded</kbd>) leads us to <code>org-startup-options</code>.</p>

<p><code>org-startup-options</code> is the used by (again <kbd>Ctrl+s org-startup-option</kbd>)
<code>org-set-regexps-and-options</code>.</p>



<p>While the documentation for this function is not very convincing, its code
does make sense for what we are after. I copied it here for reference.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="elisp">  <span>(</span><span>when</span> <span>(</span><span>derived-mode-p</span> <span>'org-mode</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>alist</span> <span>(</span><span>org-collect-keyword</span>

				 <span>"LINK"</span> <span>"OPTIONS"</span> <span>"PRIORITIES"</span> <span>"PROPERTY"</span>
				 <span>"SEQ_TODO"</span> <span>"STARTUP"</span> <span>"TODO"</span> <span>"TYP_TODO"</span><span>)))</span>
		  <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>"ARCHIVE"</span> <span>"CATEGORY"</span> <span>"COLUMNS"</span> <span>"PRIORITIES"</span><span>))))</span>
      <span>;; Startup options.  Get this early since it does change</span>
      <span>;; behavior for other options (e.g., tags).</span>
      <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>startup</span> <span>(</span><span>cl-mapcan</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>split-string</span> <span>value</span><span>))</span>
				<span>(</span><span>cdr</span> <span>(</span><span>assoc</span> <span>"STARTUP"</span> <span>alist</span><span>)))))</span>
	     <span>...</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Unfortunately this function calls <code>org-collect-keyword</code> with a list that we cannot
touch. There is no custom variable to set to pass our own keyword.</p>

<p>If this was a “normal programming environment” we would make our changes
to this function body and forever maintain a fork of org-mode. As this
is elisp instead we have choices.</p>

<p>I think the best choice is to use <code>advice-add</code> and have Emacs call our
advice code every time <code>org-set-regexps-and-options</code> is called. We will copy
what we need from the function body but that will be all.</p>

<p>This is what I ended up with.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="elisp"><span>(</span><span>defvar</span> <span>org-sort-option</span> <span>nil</span><span>)</span>

      <span>(</span><span>org-sort-entries</span> <span>case-sensitive</span> <span>sorting-type</span> <span>getkey-func</span> <span>compare-func</span> <span>property</span> <span>interactive?</span><span>))))</span>

<span>(</span><span>add-hook</span> <span>'before-save-hook</span> <span>#'</span><span>org-sort-run</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We keep a buffer-local variable <code>org-sort-option</code> around to store the
property name read from <code>#+SORT: property-name</code>. This variable is initially
<code>nil</code> and will be set from the property name in <code>#+SORT: property-name</code>. To do so
we have a function <code>org-sort-set-option</code>.</p>

<p>But when to call <code>org-sort-set-option</code>? The easy way out is to have Emacs call it whenever
<code>org-set-regexps-and-options</code> is called on a file visit. To achieve this we
tap into <code>advice-add</code> and ask Emacs to run <code>org-sort-set-option</code> after
<code>org-sort-regexps-and-options</code>.</p>

<p>We have now succesfully interposed ourselves in the control flow of the org-mode library.</p>

<p>Org-mode did not provide any interposition point for us, there
is no thought ahead etension-point or configuration variable we can
use to achieve our goal an yet here we are with a sorted buffer.</p>

<p>We succeeded in our effort because <em>Emacs wants you to extend it</em>
and it gives you all the means to do so.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I have made a horrible hack and it works. I have learnt nothing about
how org-mode works or Emacs’ file-visiting extension-points.</p>

    <h2>UTF-8 is a Brilliant Design</h2>
    <time datetime="2025-09-12">2025-09-12</time>
    <meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=no">


<p>The first time I learned about UTF-8 encoding, I was fascinated by how well-thought and brilliantly it was designed to represent millions of characters from different languages and scripts, and <strong>still be backward compatible with ASCII.</strong></p>
<p>Basically UTF-8 uses 32 bits and the old ASCII uses 7 bits, but UTF-8 is designed in such a way that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every ASCII encoded file is a valid UTF-8 file.</li>
<li>Every UTF-8 encoded file that has only ASCII characters is a valid ASCII file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Designing a system that scales to millions of characters and still be compatible with the old systems that use just 128 characters is a brilliant design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you are already aware of the UTF-8 encoding, you can explore the <a href="https://utf8-playground.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UTF-8 Playground</a> utility that I built to visualize UTF-8 encoding.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How Does UTF-8 Do It?</h2>
<p>UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding designed to represent every character in the Unicode character set, encompassing characters from most of the world's writing systems.</p>
<p>It encodes characters using <strong>one to four bytes</strong>. </p>
<p>The first 128 characters (<code>U+0000</code> to <code>U+007F</code>) are encoded with a <strong>single byte,</strong> ensuring backward compatibility with ASCII, and this is the reason why a file with only ASCII characters is a valid UTF-8 file.</p>
<p>Other characters require two, three, or four bytes. The <strong>leading bits of the first byte</strong> determine the total number of bytes that represents the current character. These bits follow one of four specific patterns, which indicate how many continuation bytes follow.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>1st byte Pattern</th>
<th># of bytes used</th>
<th>Full byte sequence pattern</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><span>0xxxxxxx</span></td>
<td>1</td>
<td><span>0xxxxxxx</span><br>(This is basically a regular ASCII encoded byte)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>110xxxxx</span></td>
<td>2</td>
<td><span>110xxxxx</span> <span>10xxxxxx</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>1110xxxx</span></td>
<td>3</td>
<td><span>1110xxxx</span> <span>10xxxxxx</span> <span>10xxxxxx</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>11110xxx</span></td>
<td>4</td>
<td><span>11110xxx</span> <span>10xxxxxx</span> <span>10xxxxxx</span> <span>10xxxxxx</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Notice that the second, third, and fourth bytes in a multi-byte sequence <strong>always start with 10</strong>. This indicates that these bytes are continuation bytes, following the main byte.</p>
<p>The remaining bits in the main byte, along with the bits in the continuation bytes, are combined to form the character's code point. A code point serves as a unique identifier for a character in the Unicode character set. A code point is typically represented in hexadecimal format, prefixed with "U+". For example, the code point for the character "A" is <code>U+0041</code>.</p>
<p>So here is how a software determines the character from the UTF-8 encoded bytes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read a byte. If it starts with <code>0</code>, it's a single-byte character (ASCII). Show the character represented by the remaiing 7 bits on the screen. Continue with the next byte.</li>
<li>If the byte didn't start with a <code>0</code>, then:<ul>
<li>If it starts with <code>110</code>, it's a two-byte character, so read the next byte as well.</li>
<li>If it starts with <code>1110</code>, it's a three-byte character, so read the next two bytes.</li>
<li>If it starts with <code>11110</code>, it's a four-byte character, so read the next three bytes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the number of bytes are determined, read all the remaining bits except the leading bits, and find the binary value (aka. code point) of the character.</li>
<li>Look up the code point in the Unicode character set to find the corresponding character and display it on the screen.</li>
<li>Read the next byte and repeat the process.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example: Hindi Letter "अ" (<a href="https://utf8-playground.netlify.app/0905" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open in UTF-8 Playground</a>)</h3>
<p>The Hindi letter "अ" (officially "Devanagari Letter A") is represented in UTF-8 as:</p>
<p><span>11100000</span> <span>10100100</span> <span>10000101</span>
Here:</p>
<p>The first byte <span>11100000</span> indicates that the character is encoded using 3 bytes.</p>
<p>The remaining bits of the three bytes:
<span>xxxx0000</span> <span>xx100100</span> <span>xx000101</span> 
are combined to form the binary sequence <span>00001001</span> <span>00000101</span> (<code>0x0905</code> in hexadecimal). This is the code point of the character, represented as <code>U+0905</code>.</p>
<p>The code point <code>U+0905</code> (<a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0900.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see official chart</a>) represents the Hindi letter "अ" in the Unicode character set.</p>
<h2>Example Text Files</h2>
<p>Now that we understood the design of UTF-8, let's look at a file that contains the following text:</p>

<p>Now this is a valid UTF-8 file, but it doesn't have to be "backward compatible" with ASCII because it contains a non-ASCII character (the emoji). Next let's create a file that contains only ASCII characters.</p>
<h3>2. Text file contains: <code>Hey Buddy</code></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://iamvishnu.com/utf8-samples/text_with_ASCII_only.txt">text file</a> doesn't have any non-ASCII characters. The file saved on the disk has the following <strong>9 bytes</strong> in it:</p>

<p>So this is a valid UTF-8 file, <strong>and it is also a valid ASCII file</strong>. The bytes in this file follows both the UTF-8 and ASCII encoding rules. This is how UTF-8 is designed to be backward compatible with ASCII.</p>
<h2>Other Encodings</h2>
<p>I did a quick research on any other encoding that are backward compatible with ASCII, and there are a few, but they are not as popular as UTF-8, for example GB 18030 (a Chinese government standard). Another one is the ISO/IEC 8859 encodings are single-byte encodings that extend ASCII to include additional characters, but they are limited to 256 characters.</p>
<p>The siblings of UTF-8, like UTF-16 and UTF-32, are not backward compatible with ASCII. For example, the letter 'A' in UTF-16 is represented as: <code>00 41</code> (two bytes), while in UTF-32 it is represented as: <code>00 00 00 41</code> (four bytes).</p>
<h2>Bonus: UTF-8 Playground</h2>
<p>When I was exploring the UTF-8 encoding, I couldn't find any good tool to interactively visualize how UTF-8 encoding works. So I built <strong>UTF-8 Playground</strong> to visualize and play around with UTF-8 encoding. <a href="https://utf8-playground.netlify.app/1F44B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Give it a try!</a>.</p>

At the time they were supported by a bulwark of EU countries and environmental NGOs that opposed nuclear energy. Honestly, it looked like they might win.</span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-ryc0x156"><span><span>But today, that whole landscape has changed.</span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-bw9py159"><span><span>Germany, long a symbol of anti-nuclear politics, is beginning to shift.

The evidence only gets clearer by the day that nuclear energy has an extremely low environmental impact across its lifecycle, and strong regulations and safety culture ensure that it remains one of the safest forms of energy available to humanity. </span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-2amni169"><span><span>The European Court of Justice has now fully dismissed Austria’s lawsuit. That ruling doesn’t just uphold nuclear energy’s place in EU green finance rules. It also signals a near-certain defeat for the ongoing Greenpeace case – the very lawsuit that inspired me to launch Dear Greenpeace in the first place.</span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-s1mp7538"><span><span>But instead of learning from this, Greenpeace is doubling down.

The highest court in the EU just reaffirmed that nuclear energy meets the scientific and environmental standards to be included in sustainable finance, and Greenpeace still refuses to budge.</span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-kjw4h560"><span><span>Meanwhile, the climate crisis gets worse. Global emissions are not falling fast enough. Billions of people still lack access to clean, reliable electricity.

Last week, however, Nintendo received a more troubling weapon in its legal arsenal: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://archive.org/details/12403397" data-url="https://archive.org/details/12403397" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">US patent 12,403,397</a>, a patent on summoning and battling characters that the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted with alarmingly little resistance.</p><div><p>According to videogame patent lawyer Kirk Sigmon, the USPTO granting Nintendo these latest patents isn't just a moment of questionable legal theory. It's an indictment of American patent law.</p><p>"Broadly, I don't disagree with the many online complaints about these Nintendo patents," said Sigmon, whose opinions do not represent those of his firm and clients. "They have been an embarrassing failure of the US patent system."</p></div><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="32ead01e-7b59-4a59-94fa-8c3859d8d1ab"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

						<p>For a long time now fundamental theoretical physics has been suffering not just from a slowdown in progress, but from a sort of intellectual collapse (I wrote about this <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=14999">here</a> a while back in the context of “epistemic collapse”: the collapse of a shared reality, caused by the loss of reliable sources for distinguishing what is true from what is false.). The Wall Street Journal has a new article entitled <a href="https://www.wsj.com/science/physics/the-rise-of-conspiracy-physics-dd79fe36">The Rise of ‘Conspiracy Physics’</a> with summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>Streamers are building huge audiences by attacking academic physics as just another corrupt establishment. Scientists are starting to worry about the consequences.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you replaced “Streamers” by “Sabine Hossenfelder” this would be reasonably accurate, and a serious discussion of this would have been interesting and worthwhile.  Instead, the article is an excellent example of the sort of epistemic collapse we’re now living in.  There’s zero intelligent content about the underlying scientific issues (is fundamental theoretical physics in trouble?), just a random collection of material about podcasts, written by someone who clearly knows nothing about the topic he’s writing about.  The epistemic collapse is total when traditional high-quality information sources like the Wall Street Journal are turned over to uninformed writers getting their information from Joe Rogan podcasts. Any hope of figuring out what is true and what is false is now completely gone.</p>
<p>I was planning on writing something explaining what exactly the WSJ story gets wrong, but now realize this is hopeless (and I’m trying to improve my mental health this week, not make it worse).  Sorting through a pile of misinformation, trying to rebuild something true out of a collapsed mess of some truth buried in a mixture of nonsense and misunderstandings is a losing battle.</p>
<p>Maybe some day our information environment will become healthy again, but for now I’m not sure what to do about this.   Be aware that if you’re trying to understand the state of fundamental theoretical physics, watching Joe Rogan, Piers Morgan, Professor Dave, etc. podcasts is just going to fill your mind with crap. Reading articles about these podcasts is worse. If a podcaster (e.g. Sabine Hossenfelder) has a book, read the book (Lost in Math is pretty good) rather than watching the podcasts.  In general, reading books is a good idea (I can also recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465092756">this one</a>). </p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>  John Baez comments <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez/115187879181381057">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This quagmire is getting bigger.  It’s another part of what William Gibson recently called the Singularity of Stupid.</p></blockquote>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When a legal takedown request arrives, whether it’s about copyright,
censorship, privacy, or something more vague, how a Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS) project responds can make all the difference.</p>

<p>Handled well, a takedown request can be a manageable administrative step. Handled poorly, it can cause panic, disrupt infrastructure, or even put contributors at legal risk.</p>

<p>As part of our legal resilience research, we spoke with a range of legal experts, software freedom advocates, and maintainers of mature FOSS infrastructure to understand how others manage these moments. In this article, we share what we learned, and how F-Droid is incorporating these lessons into its own approach.</p>

<h2 id="a-pattern-emerges">A Pattern Emerges</h2>

<p>Despite differences in jurisdiction, size, and mission, a few common themes
from our research emerged when we asked how other projects handle takedown
requests:</p>

<h3 id="1-dont-be-a-soft-target">1. Don’t Be a Soft Target</h3>

<p>Legal threats often follow the path of least resistance. FOSS projects that
publish a formal takedown policy, require legal submissions through specific
channels, and insist on a valid legal basis are much less likely to receive,
or comply with, vague or harassing demands.</p>

<p>One FOSS organization, for example, requires all legal correspondence to be submitted by postal mail in the national language and citing local law. Most complaints evaporate once asked to comply.</p>

<h3 id="2-creating-a-transparent-and-documented-process">2. Creating a transparent and documented process</h3>

<p>Several digital rights organizations advised setting up structured response
steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Require submissions to a dedicated legal@ or abuse@ email.</li>
  <li>Insist on full documentation: legal basis, jurisdiction, evidence of the
infringement and identity of the complainant.</li>
  <li>Review for sufficiency, proportionality, and standing before acting.</li>
</ul>

<p>This creates proper documentation to process valid claims, while protecting projects from illegitimate or unfounded requests.</p>

<h3 id="3-use-jurisdiction-strategically">3. Use Jurisdiction Strategically</h3>

<p>Projects based in civil law jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, are often
better positioned to deflect legal demands from foreign entities. Several
organizations emphasized that complying with vague or extrajudicial
requests, especially those originating outside your jurisdiction, can
increase risk unnecessarily. Instead, they recommended requiring a valid
legal basis grounded in the project’s home country. Formal legal processes,
such as court orders or official government channels, were seen as the
appropriate threshold, not informal emails or unverifiable demands.</p>

<h2 id="notification-and-appeals-fairness-and-transparency">Notification and Appeals: Fairness and Transparency</h2>

<p>All of the projects we consulted emphasized the importance of notifying
developers whose apps are being targeted, informing them (if possible) of
the seriousness of the claim, and the proposed strategy F-Droid is taking to
handle the claim.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a threat is deemed to be valid and a developer’s content is flagged for
takedown:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The developer or maintainer is informed, unless prohibited by law (gag
orders).</li>
  <li>A window for response (commonly 14 days) is offered, unless unfeasible due
to seriousness and time restraints of the request itself</li>
  <li>If the developer disputes the claim and provides supporting information
(e.g. license, public domain status, fair use justification), the claim is
reviewed.</li>
  <li>If the claim is upheld, the content is removed, but always with an
internal record and opportunity to appeal.</li>
</ul>

<p>This mirrors principles embedded in international norms (like the <a href="https://manilaprinciples.org/principles.html">Manila Principles</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy">GitHub’s DMCA takedown policy</a>) and avoids overcompliance with weak or abusive claims.</p>

<h2 id="transparency-censorship-and-what-you-can-legally-publish">Transparency, Censorship, and What You Can (Legally) Publish</h2>

<p>Takedown requests occupy a complex space between legal enforcement and
censorship. While some are legitimate claims, like copyright violations or
privacy breaches, others are vague, politically motivated, or intended to
silence dissent. For FOSS projects that have a global user base, it’s not
always obvious how to respond. Complying too quickly can reinforce
censorship practices; resisting without process can lead to full website
shut downs, <a href="https://dn.org/government-influence-on-dns-through-domain-seizures-and-takedowns/">domain names being taken
away</a>
(as in the US) or <a href="https://calyxinstitute.org/about/press/2010-merrill-speaks-at-27th-CCC-berlin">large and costly legal
battles</a>.</p>

<p>One strategy that helps balance this tension is radical
transparency. Several projects we spoke with emphasized the importance of
documenting what actions were taken and why, not just for accountability,
but as a form of resistance. A well-known example is GitHub’s DMCA takedown
policy (as of July 2025), which mandates compliance with valid takedown
requests, but also posts each one publicly in their <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca">github/dmca
repository</a>. The result: potential abusers
know their requests will face public scrutiny, which acts as a deterrent.</p>

<p>However, not all jurisdictions allow this kind of transparency. In India,
for example, we were informed that it is often illegal to disclose that you
have received a government request, even to the developer of the affected
app. In contrast, in Russia, takedown requests can often be <a href="https://reestr.rublacklist.net/en/">legally
posted</a>, though by doing so you may be
putting yourself at risk for retaliation, additional takedown requests and
legal troubles.</p>

<p>With that in mind, some best practices for FOSS projects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Publishing biannual transparency reports, even if redacted or aggregated.</li>
  <li>Maintaining an internal log of all takedown activity, with public
disclosure where legally possible.</li>
  <li>Explaining the general reasons for content removals, who made the request,
under what law, and what action was taken, unless legally prohibited.</li>
  <li>Being explicit about what cannot be shared, and why.</li>
</ul>

<p>Transparency won’t prevent all forms of censorship, but it can slow them
down, raise awareness, and provide a record that strengthens the broader
FOSS ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="what-were-doing-at-f-droid">What We’re Doing at F-Droid</h2>

<p>F-Droid is revising its own takedown policy, informed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dutch law and EU regulations</li>
  <li>The structural support provided by The Commons Conservancy</li>
  <li>Practical lessons from long-standing FOSS organizations</li>
</ul>

<p>Our draft process includes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Written takedown submission request to legal@f-droid.org including the
   required information.:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Identify the specific material in question (e.g. app name)</li>
  <li>Include valid legal basis under applicable jurisdiction (e.g. copyright
  law, court order statutory basis)</li>
  <li>Indicate jurisdiction in which the legal basis is claimed to apply</li>
  <li>Include sufficient evidence of the alleged infringement (e.g. copyright
  certificate, ownership declaration)</li>
  <li>Clearly state that the complaintant is authorized to act on behalf of the
  rights holder</li>
  <li>Include full contact details and a verifiable identity (subject to
  exceptions, such as gag orders or whistleblower protection)</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Verification of jurisdiction and legal basis, including evidence</li>
  <li>Developer notification and appeal procedures</li>
  <li>Rejection of requests lacking documentation or legal authority may be
   rejected or ignored</li>
  <li>Biannual transparency reports and public tracking of takedown requests</li>
</ol>

<p>We’re also working to improve contributor education about potential exposure
when contributing to F-Droid, document internal escalation paths, and ensure
consistent handling of international claims.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Takedown requests are not going away in fact, they’re becoming more frequent
and more complex. But FOSS projects don’t have to face them unprepared.</p>

<p>By building processes, establishing clear jurisdiction, and protecting individuals through structure and policy, we can handle these challenges with the seriousness they deserve without letting them derail our mission.</p>

This post isn’t about the virtues of some editors versus others: <a href="https://www.murilopereira.com/the-values-of-emacs-the-neovim-revolution-and-the-vscode-gorilla/">that's already been written by somebody else</a> (and it’s really good) – if you want to know <i>why</i> I use emacs, I suggest reading that instead.
</p>

<p>
<i>This</i> post will help you understand why "extensibility" and "introspectability" are such prominent emacs features even without an emacs lisp background.
Bridging the gap from <a href="https://www.spacemacs.org/">spacemacs</a> or <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs">doom emacs</a> to a bespoke configuration wasn't easy for me because I didn’t know <i>how</i> to learn emacs, so I'm going to stumble through one of my own use cases to demonstrate how this process goes if you're peeking in from outside the emacs ecosystem, <del>horrified</del> curious about how this all works.

At my day job I write <a href="https://docs.bowtie.works/">our user documentation</a> using <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx</a>.
It expects my stilted prose in <code>.rst</code> format, which is kind of like Markdown if you squint.
</p>

<p>
I do an awful lot of cross-referencing between <i>references</i> (or <code>refs</code>) to link concepts across the documentation.
You define a reference like this:
</p>

<p><span><span>ReST</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font used for directives and roles.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used for all other defining constructs.</span></li></ul></div><div>
<pre><code><span>.. _code_example:</span></code>
<code></code>
<code><span>.. code::</span></code>
<code>   echo "HELP I'M TRAPPED IN A CODE EXAMPLE"</code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
…and then link to it later like this:
</p>

<p><span><span>ReST</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font used for field names and interpreted text.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used for directives and roles.</span></li></ul></div><div>
<pre><code>This <span>:ref:</span><span>`doesn't look like anything to me &lt;code_example&gt;`</span>.</code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
…or like this (if the <code>ref</code> is associated with a title of some sort):
</p>

<p><span><span>ReST</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font used for field names and interpreted text.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used for directives and roles.</span></li></ul></div><div>
<pre><code>Don't say <span>:ref:</span><span>`code_example`</span>.</code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
My problem is that I have an <i>assload</i> of references across the all of the documentation and my brain cannot recall them on the spot.
What I really need is the ability to call up the list of references to easily discover and select from that list – this is basically auto-completion but for documentation headers (or titles).
</p>

<p>
I am ready to write some shitty elisp <a href="http://landoflisp.com/">with the help of aliens</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-a-parentheses-prelude">
<h5 id="a-parentheses-prelude">A Parentheses Prelude</h5>
<p>
Before we dig into emacs' guts, here are some principles that I learned after my first elisp experiments that might help somebody digging into this ecosystem for the first time:
</p>
<div id="outline-container-1-emacs-wants-you-to-extend-it">
<h6 id="1-emacs-wants-you-to-extend-it">1. Emacs <i>Wants</i> You to Extend It</h6>
<div>
<p>
I haven't written plugins for other editors extensively, but I <i>can</i> tell you this: emacs doesn't just make deep customization available, but it actively <i>encourages</i> you to make an absolute customization <del>messes</del> masterpieces.
Core editor functions aren't just documented, but often include tidbits about "you probably want to see this other variable" or "here's how you should use this".
</p>

<p>
Not only that, but emacs happily hands you functions shaped like nuclear warheads like <code><span>advice-add</span></code> (that let you override any function) that can absolutely obliterate your editor if you hold it the wrong way.
Of course, this also grants you <b>unlimited power</b>.
</p>

<p>
Remember that emacs is designed to be torn apart and rearranged.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-2-geriatric-software">
<h6 id="2-geriatric-software">2. Geriatric Software</h6>
<div>
<p>
The first public release of GNU emacs happened in 1985.
Literally <i>40 years</i> of development sits inside of emacs and its developers are <b>still</b> adding non-trivial features (native language server support landed in version 29 in 2023).
</p>

<p>
The ecosystem is vast and the language has evolved for a long time.
There's nearly always something useful if you need a particular piece of functionality, so even moreso than with other ecosystems: remember to do your homework first.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-3-lisp-for-for-the-un-lisped">
<h6 id="3-lisp-for-for-the-un-lisped">3. Lisp for for the un-Lisped</h6>
<div>
<p>
The syntax is polarizing, I know.
Gurus will wince when I get this wrong, but:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing lisp is like writing any other code, just with the parentheses wrapping <i>everything</i> instead of just <i>arguments</i>. <code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Macrodata Refinement"</span><span>)</span></code> becomes <code><span>(</span><span>print</span> <span>"Macrodata Refinement"</span><span>)</span></code></li>
<li>Sometimes you don't get functions, you get macros that behave special ways.
For example, <code><span>let</span></code> sets variables for an inner block of code.
Like this: <code><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>(</span>name <span>"Mark S."</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>print</span> name<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></li>
<li>Lispers say "this is actually data and not calling code" by doing this with single quotes: <code><span>'</span><span>(</span><span>"list"</span> <span>"of"</span> <span>"strings"</span><span>)</span></code></li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm out of my depth in lisp, but if you're a novice, those notes might help.

With that prelude out of the way, let's begin.
</p>

<p>
Inside of emacs you can call up a list of potential <i>completions</i> by using the keyboard shortcut <kbd>M-.</kbd> (that’s "hit the meta key along with period", where "meta" is the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key for me).
This applies in a wide variety of scenarios, like when completing class names or variables.
If we want to ask emacs to hand us a list of potential references, then the system we want to hook into is this <i>completions</i> system.
</p>

<p>
(This is the only time I'll assume we know where to go without crawling through documentation. You could discover it yourself looking for "<code>completion</code>" or similar string in emacs docs).
</p>

<p>
To start our hero’s journey, we figure out what the hell <kbd>M-.</kbd> actually <i>does</i>.
We can ask emacs this by calling the function <code><span>describe-key</span></code>, which is bound to <kbd>C-h k</kbd>.
Hitting <kbd>Ctrl-h</kbd>, then <kbd>k</kbd>, then <kbd>M-.</kbd> drops us into a help buffer that looks like this:
</p>

<pre id="org6bbb9dc"><code>M-. runs the command completion-at-point (found in</code>
<code>evil-insert-state-map), which is an interactive native-compiled Lisp</code>
<code>function in ‘minibuffer.el’.</code>
<code></code>
<code>It is bound to M-..</code>
<code></code>
<code>(completion-at-point)</code>
<code></code>
<code>Perform completion on the text around point.</code>
<code>The completion method is determined by ‘completion-at-point-functions’.</code>
<code></code>
<code>  Probably introduced at or before Emacs version 23.2.</code>
</pre>

<p>
We have the next breadcrumb to follow, which is the variable <code><span>completion-at-point-functions</span></code>.
Running <code><span>completion-at-point</span></code> by hitting <kbd>M-.</kbd> consults that variable to hand us completion candidates, so we <code><span>describe-variable</span></code> it with <kbd>C-h v</kbd> and then choose <code><span>completion-at-point-functions</span></code> from the list of variables:
</p>

<pre id="org56c73d2"><code>completion-at-point-functions is a variable defined in ‘minibuffer.el’.</code>
<code></code>
<code>Its value is (cape-dict cape-file tags-completion-at-point-function)</code>
<code></code>
<code>Special hook to find the completion table for the entity at point.</code>
<code>Each function on this hook is called in turn without any argument and</code>
<code>should return either nil, meaning it is not applicable at point,</code>
<code>or a function of no arguments to perform completion (discouraged),</code>
<code>or a list of the form (START END COLLECTION . PROPS)</code>
</pre>

<p>
…and it goes on from there.
You can see some existing completion functions in there: I use a package called <a href="https://github.com/minad/cape">cape</a> to offer helpful suggestions like file paths if I start typing in something like <code>./filename</code>.
</p>

<p>
The description for this variable instructs us about how to add our own functions (scary!)
You’ll note that emacs calls this a "hook", which is most often just a term used to describe a variable that is a list of functions that get called at a specific time (hooks show up everywhere).
</p>

<p>
I elided the full description for <code><span>completion-at-point-functions</span></code> – which is lengthy! – but if you parse it all out, you learn the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Your completion at point function should return either <code>nil</code> (the elisp "null") – which means your completion function doesn’t apply right now – or another function (which emacs discourages), or a list, which is what we’ll do because it sounds like the most-correct thing to do.</li>
<li>The list we return is <code><span>(</span>START END COLLECTION . PROPS<span>)</span></code>:
<ul>
<li><code>START</code> and <code>END</code> should be positions in the buffer between which emacs will replace the completed symbol with our candidate.
That is, if your cursor is calling a method on a Python object like <code>file.ope|</code> (where the bar is your cursor), emacs will replace just <code>ope</code> when you select <code>open</code> from a list of completions and not the entire <code>file.ope</code> string.</li>
<li><code>COLLECTION</code> is the juicy bit. The documentation calls it a completion "table", and there’s probably hidden meaning there, but you can just return a list of candidates and move on with your day, which is what I'll do.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Okay, so we need to write something to find the bounds of a string to replace and a function that returns that list.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-completions-abound">
<h5 id="completions-abound">Completions Abound</h5>
<div id="text-completions-abound">
<p>
I fooled around with some regular expressions for a while until I did the <i>right</i> thing and examined how other completion backends do it.
If you have the package installed, the aforementioned <code><span>cape-file</span></code> function gives us a hint: hit <kbd>M-x</kbd>, then choose <code><span>find-function</span></code>, select <code><span>cape-file</span></code>, and poke around. You’ll find the use of a function called <code><span>bounds-of-thing-at-point</span></code>.
Describing it with <kbd>C-h f</kbd> <code><span>bounds-of-thing-at-point</span></code> gives us:
</p>

<pre id="orgdb3711b"><code>Determine the start and end buffer locations for the THING at point.</code>
<code>THING should be a symbol specifying a type of syntactic entity.</code>
<code>Possibilities include ‘symbol’, ‘list’, ‘sexp’, ‘defun’, ‘number’,</code>
<code>‘filename’, ‘url’, ‘email’, ‘uuid’, ‘word’, ‘sentence’, ‘whitespace’,</code>
<code>‘line’, and ‘page’.</code>
</pre>

<p>
And <i>that</i> is useful for our <code>START</code> and <code>END</code> needs.
You can take it for a test drive at any time with <kbd>M-:</kbd> <code><span>(</span><span>bounds-of-thing-at-point</span> <span>'</span><span>word</span><span>)</span></code> to see where emacs thinks the <i>word</i> at your cursor starts and ends.
This is a common theme when developing elisp: try out functions all the time within the editor since they’re near at hand.
</p>

<p>
The argument to <code><span>bounds-of-thing-at-point</span></code> is a symbol for a literal <i>thing</i> that is predefined by the function <code><span>define-thing-chars</span></code>.
We pass <code><span>define-thing-chars</span></code> a name for our "thing" and a regex, and we can call <code><span>bounds-of-thing-at-point</span></code> with it from that point on.
The function documentation in <code>thingatpt.el</code> that emacs refers you to explains more if you’re interested.
</p>

<p>
<code><span>define-thing-chars</span></code> expects a string with characters to put into a regex character class (like <code>[...]</code>) - just any valid character.
This is a pretty standard character class and we can start with something super simple.
I can’t be bothered to look up whatever the reStructedText spec is for references, but let’s start with "word characters, dashes, and underscores".
That expressed as a "thing" looks like this:
</p>

<p><span><span>ELisp</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font used to highlight strings.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used to highlight keywords.</span></li></ul></div><div>
<pre><code><span>(</span><span>define-thing-chars</span> rst-ref <span>"[:alpha:]_-"</span><span>)</span></code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now we have a <i>thing</i> called <code>rst-ref</code> we can use with <code><span>bounds-of-thing-at-point</span></code>.
In typical emacs fashion, we can run elisp ad-hoc in our editor just to tinker, so let’s do that now.
</p>

<p>
Remember: we’re trying to write a function to give us the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> of whatever piece of text we intend for a completion to replace.
Let’s try it out: in any sort of buffer, put a piece of fake <code>.rst</code> text with a reference, like this:
</p>

<p><span><span>ReST</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font used for field names and interpreted text.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used for directives and roles.</span></li></ul></div><div>
<pre><code>This is a <span>:ref:</span><span>`other-reference`</span>.</code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Place your point somewhere within "<code>other-reference</code>" and try out your <code>thing</code>:
</p>

<p>
<kbd>M-:</kbd> <code><span>(</span><span>bounds-of-thing-at-point</span> <span>'</span><span>rst-ref</span><span>)</span></code>
</p>

<p>
You’ll see something like <code><span>(</span>number . number<span>)</span></code> in the echo area (the little minibuffer at the bottom of the emacs window frame).
Congratulations!
We’ve got the first part of the problem solved.

<div id="outline-container-gathering-completions">
<h4 id="gathering-completions">Gathering Completions</h4>
<div id="text-gathering-completions">
<p>
Recall the structure of what our "completion backend" needs to return to emacs:
</p>

<p><span><span>ELisp</span></span></p><div>
<pre><code><span>(</span>START END COLLECTION . PROPS<span>)</span></code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can construct <code>START</code> and <code>END</code> with <code><span>bounds-of-thing-at-point</span></code>, now we just need <code>COLLECTION</code>, which is a list of potential candidates.
</p>

<p>
Conceptually the task isn’t hard: we should find all instances of strings of the form:
</p>

<p><span><span>ReST</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font used for all other defining constructs.</span></li></ul></div>

<p>
in our document and capture <code>my-reference</code>.
Where do we start?
</p>

<p>
Once again you can rely on discovery mechanisms like searching for functions that <i>sound</i> related (by browsing <code><span>describe-function</span></code>) or look at existing code.
Personally, I found this:
</p>

<pre id="orge9859ee"><code>(re-search-forward REGEXP &amp;optional BOUND NOERROR COUNT)</code>
<code></code>
<code>Search forward from point for regular expression REGEXP.</code>
</pre>

<p>
The documentation refers you to some other related functions, like this one:
</p>

<pre id="org335f041"><code>(match-beginning SUBEXP)</code>
<code></code>
<code>Return position of start of text matched by last search.</code>
<code>SUBEXP, a number, specifies which parenthesized expression in the last</code>
<code>regexp.</code>
</pre>

<p>
So we can <code><span>(</span><span>re-search-forward</span><span>)</span></code> for something then invoke <code><span>(</span><span>match-beginning</span> 1<span>)</span></code>, for example, if we used a regex capture group to grab the reference’s label.
Cool: we can start there.
</p>

<p>
As you get deeper into elisp you’ll find that regular expressions are <i>everywhere</i>, and this case is no different.
We need a solid regex to search through a reStructuredText buffer (and honor any quirks in emacs’ regular expression engine), so we’ll use this opportunity to kick the tires on <i>interactively</i> developing regular expressions in emacs.
</p>

<p>
Geriatric millennial software engineers like myself grew up on <a href="https://regexr.com/">https://regexr.com/</a> when it was still a Flash application.
Unless you’re a masochist that lives and breathes regular expressions, it’s kind of hard to develop a good regex without live feedback, which sites like <a href="https://regexr.com/">https://regexr.com/</a> provide.
</p>

<p>
Little did I know that emacs comes with its own live regular expression builder and it's goooood.
</p>

<p>
Within any emacs buffer, run <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code><span>re-builder</span></code> to open the regex builder window split alongside the current buffer.
If I then enter the string <code><span>"re-</span><span><span>\\</span></span><span><span>(</span></span><span>builder</span><span><span>\\</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>"</span></code> into that buffer, that string a) gets highlighted in my original buffer and b) the capture group gets highlighted in its own unique group color.
</p>

<p>
You can do this all day long to fine-tune a regular expression, but there’s yet <i>another</i> trick when writing regular expressions, which is to use the <code><span>rx</span></code> macro.
</p>

<p>
My previous example regular expression <code><span>"re-</span><span><span>\\</span></span><span><span>(</span></span><span>builder</span><span><span>\\</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>"</span></code> works, but the quirks when writing emacs regular expressions pile up quickly: escaping characters is one example but there are more, too.
</p>

<p>
Instead, the <code><span>rx</span></code> macro will let you define a regular expression in lisp-y form and evaluate it into a typical string-based regular expression you can use normally, so it works any place emacs expects a string-based regular expression.
For example, if you evaluate this with <kbd>M-:</kbd>:
</p>

<p><span><span>ELisp</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font used to highlight strings.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used to highlight keywords.</span></li></ul></div><div>
<pre><code><span>(</span><span>rx</span> <span>"re-"</span> <span>(</span>group <span>"builder"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is what emacs returns:
</p>

<p><span><span>ELisp</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font for backslashes in Lisp regexp grouping constructs.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used to highlight strings.</span></li></ul></div>

<p>
Identical!
The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Rx-Constructs.html"><code>rx</code> documentation</a> explains all the constructs available to you.
</p>

<p>
Jumping back to <code><span>re-builder</span></code>, with the <code><span>re-builder</span></code> window active, invoke <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>reb-change-syntax</code> and choose <code><span>rx</span></code>.
Now you can interactively build regular expressions with the <code><span>rx</span></code> macro!
In the <code><span>re-builder</span></code> window, you’ve got to enter a weird syntax to get it to take <code><span>rx</span></code> constructs (I’m… not sure why this is), but you end up with the same outcome:
</p>

<p><span><span>ELisp</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font used to highlight strings.</span></li></ul></div><div>
<pre><code><span>'</span><span>(</span><span>:</span> <span>"re-"</span> <span>(</span>group <span>"builder"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Watch the regex get highlighted live just as it was in the string-based regex mode.
</p>

<p>
To bring this full circle, hop into a buffer with an example <code>.rst</code> document like this one:
</p>

<p><span><span>ReST</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font used for all other defining constructs.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used for the adornment of a section header.</span></li>
<li><span>Default font for section title text at level 1.</span></li></ul></div><div>
<pre><code><span>A Heading</span></code>
<code><span>=========</span></code>
<code></code>
<code><span>.. _my-reference:</span></code>
<code></code>
<code>Link to me!</code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using our newfound <code><span>re-builder</span></code> knowledge, let’s build a regex interactively to make short work of it:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Invoke <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code><span>re-builder</span></code></li>
<li>Change the engine to something easier with <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>reb-change-syntax</code> and choose <code><span>rx</span></code></li>
<li>Start trying out solutions</li>
</ul>

<p>
I’ll refer here to the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Rx-Constructs.html">rx constructs documentation</a> which lists out all the possibilities that you can plug into the <code><span>rx</span></code> macro.
Here’s a recorded example of what developing it looks like from start to finish, ending up with a functional <code><span>rx</span></code> construct:
</p>



<p>
Live-highlighting regex development.
Nice.
If you add more groups, more colors show up.
In this example the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Rx-Constructs.html">rx constructs</a> I’m using are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Any strings end up as literal matches</li>
<li>Special symbols <code>bol</code> and <code>eol</code> for "beginning of line" and "end of line", respectively</li>
<li>Symbols like <code>+</code> behave like their regex counterparts ("at least one")</li>
<li>Some symbols like <code>not</code> are nice little shortcuts (in this case, to negate the next form)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Because <code><span>rx</span></code> is a macro, we don’t ever actually <i>need</i> to compile its regular expressions to use elsewhere - we can always just use <code><span>rx</span></code> when we need a regex.

Okay, we've cut our teeth on emacs regular expressions.
Let's use 'em.
(Not our teeth. Regexes.)
</p>

<p>
To start, let's save our reStructuredText regular expression to find a <code>ref</code> so we can easily grab it later.
I'll save the one I came up with to the name <code>tmp/re</code> (this name is arbitrary, I drop temporary variables into <code>tmp/&lt;name&gt;</code> out of habit)
</p>

<p><span><span>ELisp</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font used to highlight built-in function names.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used to highlight strings.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used to highlight keywords.</span></li></ul></div><div>

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now we can reference it easily.
I mentioned before that <code><span>re-search-forward</span></code> accepts a regex, so let's hop into a reStructuredText rev up the regex.
</p>

<p>
Here's my sample text that I'll work with:
</p>

<p><span><span>ReST</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font used for directives and roles.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used for all other defining constructs.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used for the adornment of a section header.</span></li>
<li><span>Default font for section title text at level 1.</span></li></ul></div><div>
<pre><code><span>A Title</span></code>
<code><span>=======</span></code>
<code></code>
<code>Beware the Jabberwock, my son.</code>
<code></code>
<code><span>.. _my-reference:</span></code>
<code></code>
<code>You are like a little baby. Watch this.</code>
<code></code>
<code><span>.. _code-sample:</span></code>
<code></code>
<code><span>.. code::</span> python</code>
<code></code>
<code>   print("emacs needs telemetry")</code>
<code></code>
<code>The end?</code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code><span>re-search-forward</span></code> documentation indicates that it starts at the <code>point</code>'s current position, so head to the start of the buffer, hit <kbd>M-:</kbd> to enter the elisp <code>Eval</code> prompt, and try:
</p>

<p><span><span>ELisp</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font used to highlight built-in function names.</span></li></ul></div><div>
<pre><code><span>(</span><span>re-search-forward</span> tmp/re<span>)</span></code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is anticlimactic because you'll just see the point move to the end of one of the references.
BUT.
This means that the search succeeded.
So… what now?
</p>

<p>
More reading in the <code><span>re-search-forward</span></code> documentation will educate you about emacs <i>global match data</i>.
In non-functional-programming style, functions like <code><span>match-beginning</span></code> and <code><span>match-end</span></code> serve to interrogate a global state that functions like <code><span>re-search-forward</span></code> will modify.
In concise terms, our regular expression defines one match group and we can grab it with <code><span>(</span><span>match-string-no-properties</span> 1<span>)</span></code> to get the first group match (<code><span>match-string</span></code> will return a string with "properties", which is a bunch of data like font styling that we don't want).
</p>

<p>
Within our example buffer, executing this after the regex search should return our match:
</p>

<p><span><span>ELisp</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font used to highlight function names.</span></li></ul></div><div>
<pre><code><span>(</span><span>match-string-no-properties</span> 1<span>)</span></code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I see <code>"my-reference"</code> from this command.
Now we're cooking like it's 1985, baby.
You can enter the minibuffer again with <kbd>M-:</kbd>, press <kbd>↑</kbd> to find the <code><span>re-search-forward</span></code> command again, and repeat this process again to watch the point move to the next match, after which you can see the matched string with <code><span>match-string-no-properties</span></code>.
</p>

<p>
Note that running this a few times will eventually error out after no matches exist past your point.
We'll address this.
</p>

<p>
If you're a human (or Claude) at this point, you can see the path ahead – we need to write some elisp that will:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Move the point to the beginning of the buffer (important, remember that <code><span>re-search-forward</span></code> relies upon the current position of your point)</li>
<li>Iteratively execute an <code><span>re-search-forward</span></code> command to aggregate reference targets</li>
<li>Conclude when there aren't any more matches</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'll start with the code and then explain which demons the parentheses are summoning afterward:

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Without belaboring the point, you can – like I did – discover most of these functions by skimming existing elisp code and using it as a launch pad.
Many of these functions are bog standard and show up all over the place in emacs packages (<code><span>save-excursion</span></code>, <code><span>progn</span></code>, <code><span>goto-char</span></code>…)
</p>

<p>
Here's the result when I run this code against our example <code>.rst</code> file:
</p>

<p><span><span>ELisp</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font used to highlight strings.</span></li></ul></div><div>
<pre><code><span>(</span><span>"my-reference"</span> <span>"code-sample"</span><span>)</span></code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Looks good!

<div id="text-completing-the-completion-backend">
<p>
We're now armed with the ability to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify the bounds of the string we want to replace, and</li>
<li>Collect a list of targets for completion candidates</li>
</ul>

<p>
We are <i>so close</i>.
Recall the description of the variable we need to modify:
</p>

<pre id="orgb0e2210"><code>completion-at-point-functions is a variable defined in ‘minibuffer.el’.</code>
<code></code>
<code>Its value is (cape-dict cape-file tags-completion-at-point-function)</code>
<code></code>
<code>Special hook to find the completion table for the entity at point.</code>
<code>Each function on this hook is called in turn without any argument and</code>
<code>should return either nil, meaning it is not applicable at point,</code>
<code>or a function of no arguments to perform completion (discouraged),</code>
<code>or a list of the form (START END COLLECTION . PROPS)</code>
</pre>

<p>
To return the list that <code><span>completion-at-point-functions</span></code> expects, we already have the ability to identify the bounds of a <code>thing</code> and sweep up a list of candidates in our buffer.
Note the comment about returning <code>nil</code>: we probably don't <i>always</i> want to run our backend, so we should short-circuit our function to eagerly return nil to avoid tying up emacs with a regex loop we don't need.
</p>

<ul>
<li>We're following some naming conventions by calling this a "<code>capf</code>" (a "completion-at-point function) and prefixing with <code>my/</code> (a habit to namespace your own functions)</li>
<li>Our short-circuit takes the form of using <code><span>looking-back</span></code> to ask, "are we inside of a reStructuredText reference"?
Note the use of <code><span>rx</span></code> here again to clean up our lisp.</li>
<li>We use our <code>rst-ref</code> <code>thing</code> to easily snag the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> of the string to replace – note our fallback to <i>just</i> the immediate point if we can't find the bounds of our <code>thing</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We wrap it all up with <code>list</code>.
Personally, even as somebody relatively new to writing Lisps, I find the code pleasant to read and self-evident.
We did a lot in 17 lines of code!
</p>

<p>
Inside of our test <code>.rst</code> buffer, we can test drive this function.
First, invoke <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code><span>eval-defun</span></code> with your cursor somewhere in the function to evaluate it, which makes <code>my/rst-internal-reference-capf</code> available.
Then run:
</p>

<p><span><span>ELisp</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font to highlight quoted Lisp symbols.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used to highlight variable names.</span></li>

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Huzzah!
Our function is now live in emacs' completion framework.
You can trigger the completion by calling <code>completion-at-point</code> at a relevant spot in a buffer.
Many batteries-included emacs distributions like spacemacs or doom emacs slap nice-looking porcelain on top of the completion framework; here's an example that uses the <a href="https://github.com/minad/corfu">corfu</a> package:
</p>



<p>
Congratulations, you've extended emacs for the first time!
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-dressing-up-the-bones">
<h4 id="dressing-up-the-bones">Dressing Up the Bones</h4>
<p>
Okay, this is a pretty basic setup.
You could improve it in <i>many</i> ways, but here are a few ideas about potential directions:
</p>
<div id="outline-container-mode-hooks">
<h5 id="mode-hooks">Mode Hooks</h5>
<div id="text-mode-hooks">
<p>
Manually adding your custom completion function to the <code><span>completion-at-point-functions</span></code> hook is tedious, but there's a way to automate it.
Recall that in emacs parlance, a "hook" is usually a <i>variable</i> that holds a <i>list of functions</i> that get called at a <i>specific time</i>.
</p>

<p>
If you use <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/emacs.html">rst-mode</a>, then opening an <code>.rst</code> file will drop you into <code><span>rst-mode</span></code> and implicitly call the <code><span>rst-mode-hook</span></code> functions.
That means that this line is sufficient to integrate our completion function:
</p>

<p><span><span>ELisp</span></span></p><div><ul><li><span>Font to highlight quoted Lisp symbols.</span></li>
<li><span>Font to highlight Lisp quotes.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used to highlight keywords.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used to highlight variable names.</span></li>
<li><span>Font used to highlight function names.</span></li></ul></div><div>
<pre><code><span>(</span><span>add-hook</span> <span>'</span><span>rst-mode-hook</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>()</span> </code>
<code>    <span>(</span><span>add-hook</span> <span>'</span><span>completion-at-point-functions</span>  <span>#'</span><span>my/rst-internal-reference-capf</span> 0 <span>t</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This says: "when I open an <code>.rst</code> file, run this lambda that modifies <code><span>completion-at-point-functions</span></code> <i>only</i> for this buffer by adding my internal reference completion function".
It's a little nested which makes it less obvious with the two <code>add-hook</code> calls.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-other-files">
<h5 id="other-files">Other Files</h5>
<div id="text-other-files">
<p>
Okay, our example works for references in the <i>same buffer</i> but this is sort of pointless for uses <i>across</i> files.
</p>

<p>
You can solve this too, although my post is already too long so we won't solve this step-by-step.
However, here's how <i>I</i> solved it:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Turn my <code>capf</code> into a minor mode that manages the completion variables</li>
<li>Doesn't search the buffer every time but instead does so once and then rebuilds it with a hook in <code><span>after-change-functions</span></code>, saving it to a hash cache</li>
<li>Walk all <code>.rst</code> files in the current project and run the reference collection function for each, storing the results into a hash cache for all files that don't have live buffers</li>
<li>When it comes time to call the completion function, combine the hash for completions for files without buffers along with each <code>.rst</code> buffer's cached list of references</li>
</ul>

<p>
It sounds complicated, but it works!
Functions like <code><span>with-temp-buffer</span></code> make this pretty easy by aggregating reference targets for files using the exact same function we do for live buffers.
</p>

</pre>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-fancy-completion">
<h5 id="fancy-completion">Fancy Completion</h5>
<div id="text-fancy-completion">
<p>
Emacs' long history includes <a href="https://company-mode.github.io/">company-mode</a>, which is a third-party completion framework that integrates with the <code><span>completion-at-point</span></code> set of functions.
Some <code><span>company-mode</span></code> features include additional metadata about completion candidates, and I found two that were useful: <code>company-kind</code> and <code>company-doc-buffer</code>.
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>company-kind</code> is a simple key that just tells the completion caller what the completion cadidate <i>is</i>.
In our case we can add some eye candy by indicating it's <code><span>'</span><span>text</span></code>.</li>
<li><code>company-doc-buffer</code> lets us add additional context to a completion candidate.
I leveraged this to include a couple of lines following the reference line to help me figure out what exactly the link refers to.
It's easier to show what this looks like rather than tell:</li>
</ul>



<p>
Notes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm using GUI emacs here for the nicer completion popup with <a href="https://github.com/minad/corfu">corfu</a> which displays a transparent, floating frame</li>
<li>My completion candidate "context" is a real excerpt from the text around the reference, complete with styling, etc.</li>
<li>The small icon to the left of each candidate comes from the <code>company-kind</code> attribute.</li>
<li>The <code>~</code> syntax is part of <a href="https://github.com/oantolin/orderless">orderless</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Completion candidate context is an extra frill but very helpful.

<p>
My experience extending a core emacs function was an instructive and interesting exercise.
I don't know what the future of emacs looks like in an increasingly LLM-crazed world, but I hope that future includes an open and powerful way to extend and customize the tools we use to write software.

            <h2>
                Use the right tool for the job.
            </h2>
            

            

            
            
            <p>In my first interview out of college I was asked the change counter problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a set of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given number. IE for USA coinage and 37 cents, the minimum number is four (quarter, dime, 2 pennies).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I implemented the simple greedy algorithm and immediately fell into the trap of the question: the greedy algorithm only works for "well-behaved" denominations. If the coin values were <code>[10, 9, 1]</code>, then making 37 cents would take 10 coins in the greedy algorithm but only 4 coins optimally (<code>10+9+9+9</code>). The "smart" answer is to use a dynamic programming algorithm, which I didn't know how to do. So I failed the interview.</p>
<p>But you only need dynamic programming if you're writing your own algorithm. It's really easy if you throw it into a constraint solver like <a href="https://www.minizinc.org/" target="_blank">MiniZinc</a> and call it a day. </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>int: total;
array[int] of int: values = [10, 9, 1];
array[index_set(values)] of var 0..: coins;

constraint sum (c in index_set(coins)) (coins[c] * values[c]) == total;
solve minimize sum(coins);
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can try this online <a href="https://play.minizinc.dev/" target="_blank">here</a>. It'll give you a prompt to put in <code>total</code> and then give you successively-better solutions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>coins = [0, 0, 37];
----------
coins = [0, 1, 28];
----------
coins = [0, 2, 19];
----------
coins = [0, 3, 10];
----------
coins = [0, 4, 1];
----------
coins = [1, 3, 0];
----------
</code></pre></div>

<p>Lots of similar interview questions are this kind of mathematical optimization problem, where we have to find the maximum or minimum of a function corresponding to constraints. They're hard in programming languages because programming languages are too low-level. They are also exactly the problems that constraint solvers were designed to solve. Hard leetcode problems are easy constraint problems.<sup id="fnref:leetcode"><a href="#fn:leetcode">1</a></sup> Here I'm using MiniZinc, but you could just as easily use Z3 or OR-Tools or whatever your favorite generalized solver is.</p>
<h3>More examples</h3>

<p>This was a question in a different interview (which I thankfully passed):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a list of stock prices through the day, find maximum profit you can get by buying one stock and selling one stock later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's easy to do in O(n^2) time, or if you are clever, you can do it in O(n). Or you could be not clever at all and just write it as a constraint problem:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>array[int] of int: prices = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
var int: buy;
var int: sell;
var int: profit = prices[sell] - prices[buy];

constraint sell &gt; buy;
constraint profit &gt; 0;
solve maximize profit;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Reminder, link to trying it online <a href="https://play.minizinc.dev/" target="_blank">here</a>. While working at that job, one interview question we tested out was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a list, determine if three numbers in that list can be added or subtracted to give 0? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a satisfaction problem, not a constraint problem: we don't need the "best answer", any answer will do. We eventually decided against it for being too tricky for the engineers we were targeting. But it's not tricky in a solver; </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>include "globals.mzn";
array[int] of int: numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
array[index_set(numbers)] of var {0, -1, 1}: choices;

constraint sum(n in index_set(numbers)) (numbers[n] * choices[n]) = 0;
constraint count(choices, -1) + count(choices, 1) = 3;
solve satisfy;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Okay, one last one, a problem I saw last year at <a href="https://chicagopython.github.io/algosig/" target="_blank">Chipy AlgoSIG</a>. Basically they pick some leetcode problems and we all do them. I failed to solve <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/description/" target="_blank">this one</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.</p>
<p><img alt="example from leetcode link" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/63337f78-7138-4b21-87a0-917c0c5b1706.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "proper" solution is a tricky thing involving tracking lots of bookkeeping states, which you can completely bypass by expressing it as constraints:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>array[int] of int: numbers = [2,1,5,6,2,3];

var 1..length(numbers): x; 
var 1..length(numbers): dx;
var 1..: y;

constraint x + dx &lt;= length(numbers);
constraint forall (i in x..(x+dx)) (y &lt;= numbers[i]);

var int: area = (dx+1)*y;
solve maximize area;

output ["(\(x)-&gt;\(x+dx))*\(y) = \(area)"]
</code></pre></div>
<p>There's even a way to <a href="https://docs.minizinc.dev/en/2.9.3/visualisation.html" target="_blank">automatically visualize the solution</a> (using <code>vis_geost_2d</code>), but I didn't feel like figuring it out in time for the newsletter.</p>
<h3>Is this better?</h3>
<p>Now if I actually brought these questions to an interview the interviewee could ruin my day by asking "what's the runtime complexity?" Constraint solvers runtimes are unpredictable and almost always than an ideal bespoke algorithm because they are more expressive, in what I refer to as the <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/the-capability-tractability-tradeoff/" target="_blank">capability/tractability tradeoff</a>. But even so, they'll do way better than a <em>bad</em> bespoke algorithm, and I'm not experienced enough in handwriting algorithms to consistently beat a solver.</p>
<p>The real advantage of solvers, though, is how well they handle new constraints. Take the stock picking problem above. I can write an O(n²) algorithm in a few minutes and the O(n) algorithm if you give me some time to think. Now change the problem to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maximize the profit by buying and selling up to <code>max_sales</code> stocks, but you can only buy or sell one stock at a given time and you can only hold up to <code>max_hold</code> stocks at a time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a way harder problem to write even an inefficient algorithm for! While the constraint problem is only a tiny bit more complicated:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>include "globals.mzn";
int: max_sales = 3;
int: max_hold = 2;
array[int] of int: prices = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
array [1..max_sales] of var int: buy;
array [1..max_sales] of var int: sell;
array [index_set(prices)] of var 0..max_hold: stocks_held;
var int: profit = sum(s in 1..max_sales) (prices[sell[s]] - prices[buy[s]]);

constraint forall (s in 1..max_sales) (sell[s] &gt; buy[s]);
constraint profit &gt; 0;

constraint forall(i in index_set(prices)) (stocks_held[i] = (count(s in 1..max_sales) (buy[s] &lt;= i) - count(s in 1..max_sales) (sell[s] &lt;= i)));
constraint alldifferent(buy ++ sell);
solve maximize profit;

output ["buy at \(buy)\n", "sell at \(sell)\n", "for \(profit)"];
</code></pre></div>

<p>Most constraint solving examples online are puzzles, like <a href="https://docs.minizinc.dev/en/stable/modelling2.html#ex-sudoku" target="_blank">Sudoku</a> or "<a href="https://docs.minizinc.dev/en/stable/modelling2.html#ex-smm" target="_blank">SEND + MORE = MONEY</a>". Solving leetcode problems would be a more interesting demonstration. And you get more interesting opportunities to teach optimizations, like symmetry breaking.</p>

<p>All large ships must have insurance, and Ro Marine has provided this in a big way.</p>
<p>The Norwegian company did not have permission to sell insurance but did it anyway — to clients worldwide.</p>

<p>“It's very serious and unusual that such a serious fraud happens with the help of a Norwegian company. At worst, it could undermine the trust in the Norwegian maritime industry,” says Thomas Angell Bergh from the Norwegian Maritime Authority.</p>

<p>Most of the fake insurance papers were for ships transporting goods out of Russia, mainly oil.</p>
<p>NRK has contacted dozens of Ro Marine’s clients. Only a few were willing to speak with us.</p>
<p>One of the customers says he was scammed by Ro Marine because he believed the insurance policies he purchased were valid.</p>
<p>Another says that "everyone" knows Ro Marine is fake, but that the ships need Western insurance documents. Such documents can make it easier to sail freely, without Western countries interfering in the transport.</p>
<p>This signature appears time and again on documents issued by Ro Marine.</p>

<p>His name is Andrey Mochalin, a Russian citizen and resident of St. Petersburg. Mochalin has experience working for a reputable Norwegian insurance company.</p>
<p>In March, he, two Norwegians and a Bulgarian were charged with forging documents and operating an insurance business without a permit. Mochalin is also being investigated for violating international sanctions.</p>
<p><em>Through an attorney, the Norwegians say they do not understand the charges (see their full response in the fact box later in the article). The Bulgarian tells NRK he is innocent.</em></p>
<p>For several months, NRK and Dossier Center have tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with Mochalin. At the same time, we investigated Ro Marine's operations. What we found surprised experts.</p>
<h2>“Among the worst of the worst”</h2>
<p>Sanctions expert David Tannenbaum is shocked by the the scale of it. He knows how far Russia is willing to go to protect its oil exports, which are crucial for funding Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Sanctions against Russia can make it difficult for tankers carrying Russian oil to obtain insurance that is approved in the West. But they are finding ways around it.</p>
<p>This is where Ro Marine enters the picture.</p>
<p>“Seems like Ro Marine is popular with sanctions evaders. You don't have this roster by accident,” says David Tannenbaum from Deep Blue Intelligence. The American company specializes in detecting sanctions evasion.</p>

<p>For Tannenbaum, it appears that Ro Marine primarily serves the <span data-content="<p>The shadow fleet consists of ships suspected of circumventing Western sanctions. This term is loosely defined as ships having the following characteristics:</p> <ul> <li>Older than 15 years and without Western insurance</li> <li>Changing flags often</li> <li>Difficult to trace real ownership</li> <li>Owned or operated by companies registered in countries that have not joined the economic sanctions imposed after Russia&amp;#39;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022</li> <li>Often deactivating&amp;nbsp;their AIS, a system that permits tracking their movements and calls at Russian ports</li> </ul> <p>Insurance companies have been given a central role in enforcing sanctions against Russia.</p> <p>The Norwegian&amp;nbsp;companies Gard and Skuld are among the twelve in the International Group, which provides insurance for about 90 percent&amp;nbsp;of the world&amp;#39;s shipping.

A fake insurance policy, such as the one offered by Ro Marine, is unlikely to provide any coverage at all.</p> " data-term="shadow fleet">shadow fleet</span> or ships engaged in illegal activities or sanctions evasion.</p>
<p>“Is Ro Marine the worst of the worst? I think they're definitely in contention,” he both asks and answers.</p>
<p>Our documentation shows, for example, that Gatik, known as one of the largest players in the Russian shadow fleet, appears to have placed almost all of their ships with Ro Marine.</p>
<p>In addition, six ships linked to the Russian gas giant Novatek have had fake insurance from the Norwegian company. All six have sailed along the Norwegian coast towards the gas facility Arctic LNG2 in Russia, which is sanctioned by the USA. The ships are sanctioned by the EU.</p>
<p>Ships linked to the sanctioned Iranian oil industry and Iranian military have also been customers of Ro Marine.</p>

<h2>Dangerous cargo from Russia</h2>
<p>Among the cargo ships that have purchased invalid insurance from Ro Marine, we found "<span data-content="<p>The ship with IMO number&amp;nbsp;9125097 was previously called&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Lily-B&amp;quot;.</p> " data-term="Agattu">Agattu</span>".

<p>Three tonnes of missile weapons were transported from St. Petersburg in Russia, according to Russian port records.</p>
<p>The ship joins the ranks of Ro Marine customers who have contributed to Russia's export revenues by transporting goods from Russian ports. This does not apply to all customers, but the vast majority, according to research by NRK and Dossier Center.</p>
<h2>Provoked a NATO country</h2>
<p>Not long ago, it was difficult to imagine that ordinary shipping in Europe could lead to military confrontation. Today, the situation is different. European countries may intervene in oil shipments that violate Western sanctions, which are intended to oppose Putin's bloody war in Ukraine. Russia has its countermeasures.</p>
<p>An illustrative example happened to a Ro Marine customer in mid-May: The oil tanker "<span data-content="<p>The ship has previously been called&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Argent&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;and &amp;quot;Jaguar&amp;quot;. Its IMO number is&amp;nbsp;9293002.</p> " data-term="Blint">Blint</span>".</p>
<p>The Estonian navy suspected the ship was sailing without a flag—a clear violation of international regulations. The navy radioed the vessel, but according to Estonian authorities, the captain refused to cooperate.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a Russian fighter jet came whizzing over them, violating the NATO country’s airspace. Instead of stopping, the sanctioned tanker sailed on to the Russian oil port of Primorsk.</p>
<p>This video of the incident is filmed from inside the ship.</p>

<p>Like many other tankers transporting Russian oil, "Blint" has had fake insurance from Ro Marine, NRK can document.</p>
<p>In this way, Ro Marine has acted in line with the interests of the Russian authorities.</p>
<p>Russia's president, October 2023:</p>
<p>“Thanks to the actions of companies and authorities, the tanker fleet has grown, new mechanisms for payment, <strong>insurance</strong> and reinsurance of our cargo have been created.”</p>

What is the case regarding Ro Marine is difficult to know.”</p><p>  The Russian Embassy in Norway does not answer NRK's questions about Ro Marine's operations because the company is Norwegian and refers us to the Norwegian authorities.

<p>Ro Marine sent the flag state a forged reference, which was originally given to a completely different company, sources tell NRK. With this reference, Ro Marine was recognized by the flag state of Panama in December 2021.</p>

<h2>Russian owner worked many years for a Norwegian company</h2>
<p>The Russian owner of Ro Marine, Andrey Mochalin, has gone underground. Mochalin has not responded to any of the numerous inquiries from NRK and Dossier Center.</p>
<p>For over ten years, he worked for a legitimate Norwegian insurance company. Most of the time, he worked from St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>Occasionally, he visited his employer's office in Oslo. Here he is pictured with his former colleagues.</p>

<p>At this time, two of his Norwegian managers also owned another company that offered insurance. This company later became Ro Marine.</p>
<p>A few weeks after Russia's war against Ukraine began in 2022, Ro Marine passed from Norwegian to Russian ownership.</p>
<p>This is when Mochalin bought Ro Marine from the company of the two Norwegians for almost two million NOK.</p>
<p>These two Norwegians, along with Andrey Mochalin and a Bulgarian citizen, are charged with forging documents and conducting illegal insurance business.</p>
<p>Out of respect for the ongoing investigation, the Norwegians did not want to be interviewed by NRK, according to their lawyer.</p>

<p>Here’s what we can share about the Russian Andrey Mochalin and the others charged in the case (in parentheses is the time period they had official roles in Ro Marine):</p>
<p><strong>A. Mochalin (2022-2025): </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sole owner of Ro Marine during the period when the company's illegal insurance activities were most widespread, according to our documentation.</li>
<li>Majority owner of the Russian company that received payments worth millions of NOK last year marked for Ro Marine.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Norwegian 1 (2016-2023): </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Registered as co-owner in the Russian company that last year received payments worth millions of NOK marked for Ro Marine.</li>
<li>Owner and board chairman in 2021 when someone sent a forged reference on behalf of Ro Marine to Panama. At the time the company lacked a permit to sell insurance.</li>
<li>In 2024, a year after he left the board, contributed to ensuring Ro Marine’s continued operations by securing a new board member: the charged Bulgarian.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Norwegian 2 (2017-2023): </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Owner and managing director in 2021 when someone sent a forged reference on behalf of Ro Marine to Panama. At the time the company lacked a permit to sell insurance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bulgarian (2024-2025): </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Car mechanic without any experience in marine insurance.</li>
<li>Tenant of Norwegian 1 for years.</li>
<li>Board member in Ro Marine for over half a year, up to March 2025.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the Norwegians left the board in 2023, the Norwegian company had a problem. With a Russian as the only board member, the company was in violation of the Companies Act of Norway, which requires at least one board member to be from an EEA country. Since Bulgaria is a member of the EEA, the Bulgarian could solve the issue.</p>
<p>According to the Bulgarian, his Norwegian landlord arranged the board position to help him financially.</p>
<p>However, he never received the money he was promised and left the board because he realized something was wrong, the Bulgarian says. He does not understand the police's suspicion towards him.</p>
<p>“I had no idea what they were doing. I have nothing to hide,” says the Bulgarian to NRK. He has been contacted by the police and says he is fully cooperating with them.</p>


<h2>The consequences of uncovering the scam</h2>
<p>After NRK's revelation in March, several flag states have issued <a href="https://www.nrk.no/vestland/flaggstater-verden-rundt-stanser-skip-og-palegger-tiltak-etter-avsloring-fra-nrk-og-danwatch-1.17363840" ec-id="pp:1.17363840" ec-name="stop orders to ships that used Ro Marine">stop orders to ships that used Ro Marine</a>.</p>
<p>Panama alone has banned 16 ships from sailing because the ships have not shown new, real insurance within the deadline they were given.</p>
<p>The UK has sanctioned Ro Marine. Ro Marines’s website has been taken down. In July, the Oslo District Court forcibly dissolved the company for breach of accounting obligations, because Ro Marine had not submitted annual accounts for 2023.</p>
<p>However, the Russian company in St. Petersburg, which received payments worth millions of NOK marked for Ro Marine, is still active.</p>
<p>One month after NRK's revelation in March, another ship in the Russian shadow fleet presented a fake insurance certificate from Ro Marine. Inspectors at the oil port of Primorsk were presented with a document "signed in Oslo."</p>
<p>The expiration date of the fake insurance?</p>
<p>April next year.</p>
<p><em>NRK has contacted the companies that operate the mentioned ships "Agattu" and "Blint", with no response. We have not been able to contact Gatik. Novatek has not responded to our questions. </em></p>

                        <h2 id="martys-bent">Marty's Bent</h2><figure><img src="https://www.tftc.io/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-11-at-9.59.52---PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="593" height="1060"><figcaption><span>via </span><a href="https://www.therage.co/us-government-to-bring-patriot-act-to-digital-assets/?ref=tftc.io"><span>The Rage</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>We warned a couple of months ago when the Trump administration's "Crypto Brief" was released that there was some language in the brief that advised the government to expand the Patriot Act to account for digital assets. Well, it looks like FinCen and the Treasury have been working on guidelines and a rough outline is shared above courtesy of The Rage, and they are absolutely horrid.</p><p>It seems that FinCen and the Treasury are preparing to outlaw the use of CoinJoin, atomic swaps, single address use, and transaction broadcast timing delays. All of which are common <strong>best use </strong>practices that I would recommend any bitcoiner leveraging self-custody practice. This is an all out attack on financial privacy within bitcoin. If enacted, any user who leverages these tools will be flagged as a suspicious, any attempts to send a UTXO that has touched any of these tools will be rejected by regulated services, and could potentially be sent to prison.</p><p>This is an absurd affront to common sensibilities and freedom in the digital age. The fact that they want to prevent people from using single addresses for individual UTXOs is patently absurd. Not only is it a massive infringement on privacy, but it makes bitcoin usage less economically efficient and degrades the security of every bitcoiner. Loading up a single address with too many UTXOs degrades the entropy of a public-private key pair and makes it easier to brute force a user's private key.</p><p>Instead of expanding the Patriot Act, it should be abolished. Instead of trying to eliminate financial privacy for the 99.9% of law abiding citizens in this country, the government should be actively trying to foster an environment in which it can be improved. The proposed solutions will do nothing but put good Americans in harm's way and degrade the security of their savings.</p><p>We shouldn't have to live in a world where standards cater to the lowest common denominator, in this case criminals, and make things worse off for the overwhelming majority of the population. It's crazy that this even has to be said. The onus is on law enforcement to be so good at their jobs that they are able to prevent crimes from happening before they occur and effectively bring criminals to heel after they commit crimes. It shouldn't be on a neutral protocol and the industry being built on top of it that, when used effectively, provides people with a stable monetary system that respects user privacy and equips them with the tools to receive and spend in a way that provides them with peace of mind.</p><p>Why should everyone have to suffer because of a few bad apples? Isn't that letting the terrorist win? </p><h3 id="bitcoin-is-becoming-less-volatile-as-it-integrates-into-traditional-finance-infrastructure">Bitcoin Is Becoming Less Volatile as It Integrates Into Traditional Finance Infrastructure</h3><p>Mel Mattison revealed a fascinating shift in Bitcoin's market dynamics that challenges conventional crypto wisdom. He pointed out that Bitcoin futures now exhibit lower volatility than platinum futures - a remarkable transformation for an asset once synonymous with wild price swings. The proliferation of ETFs, options, futures, and other traditional financial instruments has fundamentally altered Bitcoin's behavior, creating what Mel calls "volatility suppression." This institutionalization comes with trade-offs: while reducing dramatic downswings, it also caps explosive upside potential.</p><blockquote>"Bitcoin is becoming a TradFi security instrument and it's getting TradFi vol." - <a href="https://x.com/MelMattison1?ref=tftc.io">Mel Mattison</a></blockquote><p>Mel argued that the relationship between volatility and returns means investors must recalibrate expectations. Where 100% annual gains once seemed routine, he now considers 50% returns "massive" for this new era of Bitcoin. This maturation reflects Bitcoin's evolution from speculative experiment to financial infrastructure - less exciting perhaps, but ultimately more sustainable for long-term adoption.</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/QEyxOwaQFzo?ref=tftc.io" rel="noreferrer">full podcast here</a> for more on China's gold strategy, Fed independence battles, and housing market manipulation plans.</p><hr><h3 id="headlines-of-the-day">Headlines of the Day</h3><p>New Bill for Strategic Bitcoin Reserve - via <a href="https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1965148899565600991?ref=tftc.io">X</a></p><p>SEC to Host Crypto Roundtable October 17 - via <a href="https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1965140430838006076?ref=tftc.io">X</a></p><p>Research Proposes Bitcoin for Mars Trade Standard - via <a href="https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1965135337543664112?ref=tftc.io">X</a></p><hr><h3 id="secure-your-bitcoin-the-hard-way">Secure Your Bitcoin The Hard Way</h3><p>Tom Honzik has helped 1,000+ people secure more than 5,000 BTC.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It can be disorienting when our beliefs shift. The world we helped create no longer exists, and our role in it transforms too.</p>
<p>It can be unsettling, naturally. But that's kind of the point.</p>
<p>Looking back at times when I held certain beliefs—about how the world works, and what my role in this story is—it can feel less like a mod was installed and more like an entirely new operating system was swapped in.</p>
<p>Up until my late twenties, I could count the number of times I had been to the gym on one hand.</p>
<p>And worse, as a nerd, I was quietly proud of it. Why waste hours a week on something that hardly mattered? I have better things to do. I pitied the jocks who slaved away in the gym chasing vanity. What for? I don't need that. Who cares?</p>
<p>Like all childish thinking, it contained some truth. Physical fitness is less important than spiritual, emotional, and mental fitness; but it’s still important.</p>
<p>Even Paul, one of history’s most influential figures, with a worldview shaped by the utter centrality of spiritual health, <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1TI.4.8.NIV" target="_blank">said as much</a>.</p>
<p>Your beliefs—and therefore approach to what a healthy life looks like—are foundational. It might sound obvious, but what you believe a "life well lived" looks like has a pretty transformative impact on both what life you end up building and how well lived it looks.</p>
<p>So if we’re a product of our beliefs and our most formative preconceptions are imposed by others, then where’s the hope?</p>
<p>We build, layer upon layer, and the layers laid first—now deeply buried within—are the ones we had the least say in.</p>
<p>We didn't pick them, but they shape everything we are and do. Bad luck, I guess.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we are dynamic beings. Old beliefs can peel off, and new ones take their place. Later layers can somehow seep deeper. Some recent beliefs can even become cornerstones.</p>
<p>For me, something shifted in my late twenties. Growing up I guess you could call it. I don’t remember the exact straw that broke the camel’s back, but a desire for change grew. I started working out.</p>
<p>It began slowly, but I began. Knee press-ups to start, later adding assisted pull-ups.</p>
<p>If anyone was watching, it would have looked stupid. A grown man barely able to push himself off the floor. But I showed up and put in my reps, day by day, week by week, in the privacy of my bedroom.</p>
<p>As the weeks and months passed, my strength grew.</p>
<p>Eventually, I graduated to full press-ups and pull-ups, no mods required.</p>
<p>Every small win reinforced the last and led me further away from who I used to be.</p>
<p>Fast forward almost to a decade and I feel a lot more friction <em>not</em> going to the gym than I do <em>going</em>. Cognitive dissonance is wonderful when it’s on your side, and it pops up whenever my healthy-Fred self-identity and actions diverge.</p>
<p>I'm far from a gym junkie—it hasn't become my life—but I go every weekday, 20 minutes a day. I arrive, do my workout, and leave, while most people are just getting started.</p>
<p>Our self-identity dictates everything, but it is not set in stone.</p>
<p>Changing our beliefs isn’t easy. Both those about the world around us and the world within. We can't simply will our way there and snap our fingers. We must journey. As with all great things, it's a process.</p>
<p>But it is possible. A well-trodden path is ahead for those who wish to walk it.</p>
<p>So how do you? How do you <em>become the person who does the thing</em>?</p>
<p>Earlier this week I spent a couple hours crafting my digital <a href="https://www.fredrivett.com/shelf" target="_blank">/shelf</a>, a place where I can put the things that have impacted me the most up for all to see, so others can take them for themselves should they wish.</p>
<p>On it are these two quotes that have been living rent-free in my head from the beginning. Together, they create a twin-cog flywheel that cannot be stopped:</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="https://seths.blog/2013/07/people-like-us-do-stuff-like-this/" target="_blank">“People like us do things like this”</a>
<cite>Seth Godin</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a href="https://jamesclear.com/quotes/every-action-you-take-is-a-vote-for-the-type-of-person-you-wish-to-become" target="_blank">“Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become”</a>
<cite>James Clear</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Your actions follow your self-beliefs.</p>
<p>If you identity as a failure, incapable of achievement, unfit, unlovable, destined to play a bit-part role in your own story, then by heck no matter how much willpower you put in to push that boulder up the hill, it will return to its place.</p>
<p>But there's a way through: every action you take is a vote for who you wish to become. Every day you wake up, look your old identity in the eye and say "thanks for your service, but you're not needed around here anymore," step forward and lean in, is a day your new identity is built.</p>
<p>It takes time. You have to actually want it. You have to choose to adopt a new mindset. Rome wasn't built in a day. But it comes, a little like how <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/08/08/all-at-once/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Hazel Grace Lancaster describes falling in love in The Fault In Our Stars</a>: <em>"slowly, and then all at once."</em></p>
<p>The path is there, should you choose.</p>
<p>Identify where your identity needs to shift. Then take a step. Cast today’s vote. Find your way through.</p>
<p>Do that day by day, then soon enough, your inner world will shift and recalibrate around the new reality you're co-creating.</p>
<p>Then one day you'll see it.</p>
<p>People like us really do things like this.</p></div></div>]]></description>
