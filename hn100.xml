<p>If you know noth­ing else about medieval Euro­pean illu­mi­nat­ed man­u­scripts, you sure­ly know the Book of Kells. “One of Ireland’s great­est cul­tur­al trea­sures” com­ments&nbsp;<a href="http://www.medievalists.net/2019/03/free-online-course-on-the-book-of-kells-returns/">Medievalists.net</a>, “it is set apart from oth­er man­u­scripts of the same peri­od by the qual­i­ty of its art­work and the sheer num­ber of illus­tra­tions that run through­out the 680 pages of the book.” The work not only attracts schol­ars, but almost a mil­lion vis­i­tors to Dublin every year. “You sim­ply can’t trav­el to the cap­i­tal of Ire­land,” writes <a href="https://bookriot.com/2015/11/05/10-things-know-book-kells/">Book Riot’s Eri­ka Har­litz-Kern</a>, “with­out the Book of Kells being men­tioned. And right­ful­ly so.”</p>
<p>The ancient mas­ter­piece is a stun­ning exam­ple of Hiber­no-Sax­on style, thought to have been com­posed on the Scot­tish island of Iona in 806, then trans­ferred to the monastery of Kells in Coun­ty Meath after a Viking raid (a sto­ry told in the mar­velous ani­mat­ed film <em><a href="https://www.awn.com/animationworld/secret-kells-what-remarkable-animated-feature">The Secret of Kells</a></em>). Con­sist­ing main­ly of copies of the four gospels, as well as index­es called “canon tables,” the man­u­script is believed to have been made pri­mar­i­ly for dis­play, not read­ing aloud, which is why “the images are elab­o­rate and detailed while the text is care­less­ly copied with entire words miss­ing or long pas­sages being repeat­ed.”</p>


<p>Its exquis­ite illu­mi­na­tions mark it as a cer­e­mo­ni­al object, and its “intri­ca­cies,” argue Trin­i­ty Col­lege Dublin pro­fes­sors Rachel Moss and Fáinche Ryan, “lead the mind along path­ways of the imag­i­na­tion…. You haven’t been to Ire­land unless you’ve seen the Book of Kells.” This may be so, but thank­ful­ly, in our dig­i­tal age, you need not go to Dublin to see this fab­u­lous his­tor­i­cal arti­fact, or a dig­i­ti­za­tion of it at least, <a href="https://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/concern/works/hm50tr726?locale=en">entire­ly view­able at the online col­lec­tions of the Trin­i­ty Col­lege Library</a>. <strong>(When you click on the pre­vi­ous <a href="https://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/concern/works/hm50tr726?locale=en">link</a>, make sure you scroll down the page.)</strong> The pages, orig­i­nal­ly cap­tured in 1990, “have recent­ly been res­canned,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170705232205/https://www.tcd.ie/library/news/book-of-kells-now-free-to-view-online/">Trin­i­ty Col­lege Library writes</a>, using state-of-the-art imag­ing tech­nol­o­gy. These new dig­i­tal images offer the most accu­rate high-res­o­lu­tion images to date, pro­vid­ing an expe­ri­ence sec­ond only to view­ing the book in per­son.”</p>

<p>What makes the Book of Kells so spe­cial, repro­duced “in such var­ied places as Irish nation­al coinage and tat­toos?” asks Pro­fes­sors Moss and Ryan. “There is no one answer to these ques­tions.” In their <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2019/03/discover-the-great-medieval-manuscript-the-book-of-kells-in-a-free-online-course.html">free online course on the man­u­script</a>, these two schol­ars of art his­to­ry and the­ol­o­gy, respec­tive­ly, do not attempt to “pro­vide defin­i­tive answers to the many ques­tions that sur­round it.” Instead, they illu­mi­nate its his­to­ry and many mean­ings to dif­fer­ent com­mu­ni­ties of peo­ple, includ­ing, of course, the peo­ple of Ire­land. “For Irish peo­ple,” they explain in the course trail­er above, “it rep­re­sents a sense of pride, a tan­gi­ble link to a pos­i­tive time in Ireland’s past, reflect­ed through its unique art.”</p>

</div>

<p>But while the Book of Kells is still a mod­ern “sym­bol of Irish­ness,” it was made with mate­ri­als and tech­niques that fell out of use sev­er­al hun­dred years ago, and that were once spread far and wide across Europe, the Mid­dle East, and North Africa. In the video above, Trin­i­ty Col­lege Library con­ser­va­tor John Gillis shows us how the man­u­script was made using meth­ods that date back to the “devel­op­ment of the codex, or the book form.” This includes the use of parch­ment, in this case calf skin, a mate­r­i­al that remem­bers the anatom­i­cal fea­tures of the ani­mals from which it came, with mark­ings where tails, spines, and legs used to be.</p>
<p>The Book of Kells has weath­ered the cen­turies fair­ly well, thanks to care­ful preser­va­tion, but it’s also had per­haps five rebind­ings in its life­time. “In its orig­i­nal form,” notes Har­litz-Kern, the man­u­script “was both thick­er and larg­er. Thir­ty folios of the orig­i­nal man­u­script have been lost through the cen­turies and the edges of the exist­ing man­u­script were severe­ly trimmed dur­ing a rebind­ing in the nine­teenth cen­tu­ry.” It remains, nonethe­less, one of the most impres­sive arti­facts to come from the age of the illu­mi­nat­ed man­u­script, “described by some,” says Moss and Ryan, “as the most famous man­u­script in the world.” Find out why by <a href="https://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/concern/works/hm50tr726?locale=en">see­ing it (vir­tu­al­ly) for your­self</a> and learn­ing about it from the experts above.</p>

            <pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2024 15:18:20 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ben.page/jumbocode-ai">https://ben.page/jumbocode-ai</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41757711">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pagefind-body=""> <p>Some thoughts on AI and LLMs, based on being Head of Engineering for <a href="https://ben.page/jumbocode">JumboCode</a>, a club of 180 students at Tufts University that builds software for non-profits.</p>
<p>For context, almost all of our developers are learning web development (TypeScript, React, etc) from scratch, and have little prior experience with programming.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-llms-in-jumbocode-is-ubiquitous">Use of LLMs in JumboCode is ubiquitous</h2>
<p>LLMs excel at writing code for web development — you can describe a frontend component that you want and get a decent React component back.</p>
<p>I didn’t spend the year hawk-eyeing the teams’ repositories, but when I did poke my head in, I found substantial portions that <em>looked</em> LLM-written — that is to say, overly-commented, dissonant, and, at times, horrifying.</p>
<h3 id="horrifying"><em>“horrifying?”</em></h3>
<p>The starkest example I came across was a Next.js project that had:</p>
<ul>
<li>A page written in HTML and vanilla JavaScript, loaded from the <code>public/</code> directory, completely outside of the Next.js + React system.</li>
<li>Vanilla JavaScript loaded in via filesystem APIs and executed via <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code>.</li>
<li>API calls from one server-side API endpoint to another public API endpoint on <code>localhost:3000</code> (instead of just importing a function and calling it directly).</li>
</ul>
<p>These don’t seem to me like classic beginner mistakes — these are <em>fundamental misunderstandings</em> of the tools and the web platform.</p>
<p>LLMs will obediently provide the solutions you ask for. If you’re missing fundamental understanding, you won’t be able to spot when your questions have gone off the rails.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-llms-hinders-learning-of-web-development">Use of LLMs hinders learning of web development.</h2>
<p>LLMs are a shortcut to get assignments done. In the process, however, you learn close to nothing.</p>
<p>It’s cliche, but struggling <em>is</em> learning. The way you learn is that you try different paths, piece bits of information together, and eventually create a mental model.</p>
<p>LLMs don’t require you to form a mental model and allow you to skip to the end result, but in turn you won’t <em>have</em> a mental model when you actually need one (for example, when you need to verify that your LLM has architected the code in a reasonable way).</p>
<p>LLMs are useful if you already have a good mental model and understanding of a subject. However, I believe that they are destructive when learning something from 0 to 1.</p>
<h2 id="you-should-probably-just-ask-a-person">You should probably just ask a person.</h2>
<p>You’ll learn a lot more by asking a real human, like your tech lead or a member of JumboCode’s board.</p>
<p>They can explain something in the exact context that you need it. And, in my experience at least, humans are still better than LLMs at providing concise, proper-level explanations.</p>
<h2 id="youll-probably-still-use-llms-instead-of-asking-a-person">You’ll probably still use LLMs instead of asking a person.</h2>
<p>Asking people is hard work and requires asking questions (scary). Many folks will still ask LLMs to write large swaths of code.</p>
<p>This is likely worse for your learning, but I can’t stop you (and I might be wrong).</p>
<p>But in my opinion, if you don’t have the time to do JumboCode without deferring whole tasks to LLMs, you’re probably better off not doing JumboCode. (And no hard feelings! I just don’t think that going through the motions via LLM-generated deliverables is worth the time.)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="appendix-ben-do-you-use-llms">Appendix: Ben, do <em>you</em> use LLMs?</h2>
<p>Yes, I do! For example, I write code in <a href="https://cursor.so/">Cursor</a>, the self-proclaimed “AI Code Editor.”</p>
<p>But I’m honestly glad that I learned the fundamentals of web development before LLMs became ubiquitous. I don’t know if I would have had the will and motivation to properly learn the foundations otherwise — but doing so has paid off immensely for me.</p>
<p>If I had used LLMs to produce work when I was first learning web development, I would not have learned web development.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

The research team has designed their proposed WiLo tech to be used on existing Wi-Fi and LoRa hardware. </p><p>The advance may find applications in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-of-things" target="_blank">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) technologies–such as networks of long-range sensors used in agriculture or smart cities. </p><p><a href="https://sciprofiles.com/profile/88723" target="_blank">Demin Gao</a>, a professor in the College of Information Science and Technology at <a href="https://eng.njfu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Nanjing Forestry University</a> in China, notes that Wi-Fi has limitations today in its range and its high power consumption.

And while the SX1280’s 2.4 GHz communications band is shared with Wi-Fi (and a host of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1604479" target="_blank">other standards and technologies</a>), Wi-Fi and LoRa signals are not compatible. </p><p>So the researchers developed an algorithm to manipulate the frequency of Wi-Fi’s data transmission signals to match the signals that the LoRa device uses to communicate with other devices. In technical terms, they manipulated Wi-Fi’s data multiplexing standard (called <a href="https://www.cablefree.net/wirelesstechnology/ofdm-introduction/" target="_blank">OFDM</a>) to emulate the longer-ranged chirp signals used in LoRa’s chirp-spreading standard (called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10503" target="_blank">CSS</a>). </p><p>“This enables the use of standard Wi-Fi devices to communicate over long distances using LoRa without additional hardware,” says Gao.<br></p><p>The team tested their new WiLo approach both indoors—in a lab and hallway—and outdoors, over distances up to 500 meters. The researchers reported WiLo achieved a 96 percent success rate. </p><p>Gao says one benefit of WiLo concerns its ability to run on existing, off-the-shelf hardware. As a result, it would not require substantial deployment costs or complexity. On the other hand, one of WiLo’s limitations is the additional power consumption required for Wi-Fi devices to simultaneously handle communication and signal emulation—a problem Gao and his colleagues aim to address in future work. <br></p><p>Moving forward, Gao says, “To commercialize WiLo, the next steps would involve further optimization of the system to improve energy efficiency, data rates, and robustness against interference. This may require additional <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-development">software development</a> and testing across various IoT environments.”</p><p>Ensuring that the system complies with industry standards and integrating security measures for cross-technology communication are also necessary steps, Gao adds. </p><p>The team published their <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680638" target="_blank">research</a> last month in the journal <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=26" target="_blank"><em>IEEE Transactions on Communications</em></a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <section id="what-is-hpy"><h2>What is HPy?<a href="#what-is-hpy" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>HPy provides a new API for extending Python in C.  In other words, you use
<code>#include &lt;hpy.h&gt;</code> instead of <code>#include &lt;Python.h&gt;</code>.</p>
</section><section id="what-are-the-advantages-of-hpy"><h2>What are the advantages of HPy?<a href="#what-are-the-advantages-of-hpy" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Zero overhead</strong> on CPython: extensions written in HPy run at the same
speed as "normal" extensions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Much faster</strong> on alternative implementations such as <a href="https://pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/python">GraalPy</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Universal binaries</strong>: extensions built for the <a href="https://docs.hpyproject.org/en/latest/overview.html#target-abis">HPy Universal ABI</a> can be
loaded unmodified on CPython, PyPy, GraalPython, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A migration path</strong> for mixing legacy C-API calls with HPy API calls. Once
all the code is migrated, the extension can be compiled as a universal binary
that works on any CPython version, PyPy, or GraalPy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Debug mode</strong>: in <a href="https://docs.hpyproject.org/en/latest/debug-mode.html">debug mode</a>, you can easily identify common problems such
as memory leaks, invalid lifetime of objects, invalid usage of APIs. Have
you ever forgot a <code>Py_INCREF</code> or <code>Py_DECREF</code>? The HPy debug mode can be
activated at runtime to detect these mistakes for you on universal binaries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nicer API</strong>: the standard Python/C API shows its age. HPy is designed to
overcome some of its limitations, be more consistent, produce better quality
extensions and to make it harder to introduce bugs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evolvability</strong>: As nicely summarized in
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0620/">PEP 620</a> the standard Python/C API
exposes a lot of internal implementation details which makes it hard to
evolve the C API. HPy doesn't have this problem because all internal
implementation details are hidden.</p></li>
</ul></section><section id="current-status"><h2>Current status<a href="#current-status" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>HPy is under active development. <a href="https://hpyproject.org/blog/posts/2023/10/hpy-0.9.0-fourth-public-release/">0.9.0</a> is the latest alpha release but we
will soon leave the _alpha_ state and are working hard towards a stable release.</p>
<p>We feel that the HPy ABI is stable enough now that we can fulfill our backwards
and forwards binary compatibility promises with the upcoming release, and that
the API now covers enough use cases to migrate important packages (in
particular, checkout our <a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/numpy-hpy/tree/graal-team/hpy#readme">numpy</a> port). We also provide porting guides and
extensive documentation (in particular the <a href="https://docs.hpyproject.org/en/latest/api-reference/index.html">API reference</a>).</p>
<p>We are, of course, always open for design discussions and new reqiurements.</p>
<p>The Python/C API is huge. At the moment many popular functions are
available. Is something missing for the port of your favorite extension?
Please open an issue or even better a PR.</p>
<section id="hpy-compatible-extensions"><h3>HPy-compatible extensions<a href="#hpy-compatible-extensions" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The extensions that we are experimenting with include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/ultrajson-hpy">ultrajson-hpy</a>: this was the first real-world module to be ported to HPy. It is
a nice fit because it only exports functions (as opposed as custom types)
and requires only a small number of API functions.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/piconumpy">piconumpy</a>: as the name suggests, this is a minimal numpy-like module which
defines a custom type (similar to <code>ndarray</code> but with many fewer features of
course).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/numpy-hpy/tree/graal-team/hpy#readme">numpy</a>: one of our ambitious goals is to port numpy to HPy, and to use this
experience to better understand how to design the API. This port is close to
passing the test suite.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/matplotlib-hpy/">matplotlib</a>: Since Matplotlib also has a dependency to NumPy, the migration
to universal mode is not fully finished. HPy provides the legacy compatibility API
such that we can still call legacy C API functions from HPy and successfully
run the test suite.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/kiwi-hpy/">kiwi-solver</a>: A dependency of Matplotlib, it has been fully ported to
universal mode.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Benchmarks and more information about the Matplotlib and kiwi-solver ports can
be found in the <a href="https://medium.com/graalvm/porting-matplotlib-from-c-api-to-hpy-aa32faa1f0b5">GraalVM blog post</a>. The benchmarks show that the HPy ports
have little impact on CPython performance, while enabling close-to-cpython
performance with GraalVM Python for the kiwi-solver complete HPy port.</p>
</section></section><section id="where-we-need-help"><h2>Where we need help<a href="#where-we-need-help" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Documentation:</strong> Our resources are very limited and we therefore concentrate
on technical tasks. We already wrote a significant amount of documentation
(see <a href="https://hpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Documentation</a>) but it is not complete yet. If this non-coding work is
something you can do, let us know.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Publicity:</strong> HPy is already well received among core developers of some
important projects. For instance, we are actively talking to Python, NumPy,
and Cython core developers. However, we need to get more package developers to
be interested in and even use HPy. We appreciate any help for advertising HPy
and we are also happy to help preparing talks, demos, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tooling:</strong> This is also a topic we would need help. We are, for example,
thinking of migration helper tools that do all the boilerplate work that can
be automated when migrating a package from C API to HPy API.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Packaging:</strong> There are several open questions we need to discuss and answer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How to package a universal extension and how to put it on PyPI?</p></li>
<li><p>How best to package HPy itself</p></li>
<li><p>How does HPy integrate with setuptools, mesonpy, or other build systems</p></li>
<li><p>Upstreaming completed forks of the packages listed below, or upstreaming
parts of the forks so the code does not suffer from bit-rot</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Website and logo design:</strong> You don't like this website and the HPy logo?
Well, we have expertise in virtual machines, compilers, low-level programming,
etc, but zero expertise in web development or graphic design. <a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/hpyproject.org/">PRs are welcome

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're in an age where Apple and Google have a near-monopoly over smartphone software. LineageOS and Android modding is dying. We all hate Big Tech monopolies, Google isn't the cool company it once was, Google is showing their true colors. Yet we let them rule our phones and didn't fight back. We <em>need</em> a real GNU/Linux smartphone ecosystem.</p>

<p>Why hasn't the PC ecosystem locked out Linux? Because Linux is too powerful that nobody can really fight it. We fought against Microsoft's monopoly and even if we don't have the Year of the Desktop Linux, we still have access. But why can <a href="https://github.com/melontini/bootloader-unlock-wall-of-shame">phone OEMs take back bootloader unlocking</a>? Because LineageOS isn't powerful enough. OEMs, developers and carriers give the middle finger and got us locked out.</p>

<p>LineageOS has a big flaw: it's dependent on Google. Verizon and banks are much more powerful than modders, so much that if they hate Android modding they both can force us to use stock firmware. Whereas Verizon and banks won't block you from using desktop Linux. It's also the fault of the modding community for not fighting back hard enough the way the GNU/Linux community fought the Microsoft monoculture.</p>

<p>For instance, Chase claims to "require" Windows or Mac but doesn't block Linux. Why? Because Linux is too powerful for Chase. Whereas Chase has blocked modded Android for years if you aren't into a cocktail of Magisk modules. One day, that won't work. I've given up on custom ROMs because of a declining ROM ecosystem, and even I'm not too happy about giving OEMs control over my phone.</p>

<p>While a GNU/Linux smartphone will lack apps, if the US wins their lawsuit against Apple we could push for Progressive Web Apps to make most mobile apps OS-agnostic and leave native apps for games. Heck, Waydroid would be <em>perfect</em> for a GNU/Linux phone: get the Android apps you need in a container.</p>

<p>Why can desktop Linux and Chromebooks not be niche platforms a la BeOS or AmigaOS? Because many desktop use cases went web so they're truly OS agnostic, aside from rouge developers. And even a user agent switcher can work in most cases. Yes, there's still Word and Photoshop and Autodesk, but enough people don't need them also.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3419622014212783578" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
If you've been wondering why entries have been a little slow lately, let me tell you a story.
</p><p>
All collectors tend to be a bit obsessive by nature, and us classic computer nerds probably pick up more hardware than we can (or should) store in our residence — especially if the loves of our lives aren't as enthusiastic about the hobby than we are — and thus have storage units for the overflow. I have two small "cold" climate control units, kept small so that I can be out of one or both relatively quickly, as well as a larger "hot" conventional unit at ambient temperature. The hot unit is indoors and not exposed directly to the sun, so it's not particularly hot for sunny southern California, but I keep working spare electronics, hard disks, tapes, etc. in the cold units as a precaution and use the hot unit for non-working parts units, books, magazines and other household items.
</p><p>
Of course, climate control units cost more, sometimes substantially, and thieves use this as a signal that more valuable stuff is likely to be kept there:
</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO90CaD60O5BfZNhnsywtYKkepciLhXROdFXqd8aOcTOmRGugQ1FEZRTHp4GoDIVVJbk1doJvEa0XTCo7TVaHloP0k7jTJjCAjKZV7dq7k_A6P-j6o9BCpO5o11CRJZ-UhkeVclowFKRVKHxMtIdMCdToTlM2ZLJLZrz9ljAQKY2mzPqIjgSI_zXWvP0k/s4080/PXL_20240806_164239071.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="4080" data-original-width="3072" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO90CaD60O5BfZNhnsywtYKkepciLhXROdFXqd8aOcTOmRGugQ1FEZRTHp4GoDIVVJbk1doJvEa0XTCo7TVaHloP0k7jTJjCAjKZV7dq7k_A6P-j6o9BCpO5o11CRJZ-UhkeVclowFKRVKHxMtIdMCdToTlM2ZLJLZrz9ljAQKY2mzPqIjgSI_zXWvP0k/s320/PXL_20240806_164239071.jpg"></a></p><p>
Both times I've been burglarized, they were the cold units. August was the second time. So, with crime being a nationwide topic, let's talk about what happens when your storage unit gets broken into and how to recover from it.
</p><p>
<a name="more"></a>
The first time was not quite two decades ago at a now defunct national chain. I was obviously rather younger then and didn't recognize that these units were incredibly poorly secured: they had simple plywood doors that opened out as opposed to metal roll-ups, the "latch" (such as it was) was just a regular safety hasp your padlock went on, and the door hinges were completely exposed. The exterior door to the climate control units (because there must be one to keep the climate controlled air in) was a regular unlocked door without any security cameras. According to the police, a couple of tweekers decided to use the climate units as free air conditioned apartments and intermittently took up residence in many of them, including mine. I had the good sense to use a disc lock instead of a regular padlock, but while they may have been drug-addled they turned out to be smarter than I was. Instead of attacking the lock they just pulled the hinge pins (only two) and got in without even touching the door, the lock or the hasp, and then were able to pull the door closed and escape discovery on walkthrus. By moving around they apparently weren't noticed for days.
</p><p>
When a storage unit is hit, the police report that the facility files and any insurance claim they make are completely separate from yours. They may or may not use information from you, but you still have to file your own. During their vacation in my two units they stole and likely hocked my family's Panasonic VHS video camera, which didn't have any tapes we cared about but would have been fun to keep, as well as my first digital camera, an Olympus Camedia something or other that used SmartMedia and still had some photos on it I realized later I never downloaded, a Fisher-Price PXL2000 (the famous pixelicious video camera that uses regular audio cassettes instead of videotape) I had in its original box that I got to use exactly once, and my spare boxed Mattel Intellivision. They also stole a few items from my highway signs collection and even spray-painted a couple I suppose for lulz, and generously left some rather grotty drug paraphernalia and dirty blankets in trade which the police took as evidence.
</p><p>
Only one of those items was recovered, the Intellivision (the one item I cared about <em>least</em> since that was a totally spare unit). It turned up at a pawn shop on the other side of the freeway. California law, at least at that time, said that the pawn shop had to be reimbursed what they paid: they couldn't sell it to you at retail, but they also were to be made whole. I went over with someone from the police department and I think it cost me $60 to recover it; I still have it. The cop also quietly pointed out all the things that were wrong with the storage units and told me to get out the rest of my stuff and leave at my earliest opportunity since they would almost certainly be hit again.
</p><p>
But what about making <em>me</em> whole? I was required to have insurance on the units, but I just had an apartment at the time and didn't carry renter's insurance, so I paid a premium as part of my rental fees to the chain's "insurance partner." If this smells like a kickback deal, you're right, and virtually every self-storage company engages in it. The idea is to offer you something cheap so that the insurance company will then protect the storage company by deflecting claims. The insurance is cheap because it sucks. I had a police report, obviously, but when I tried to submit the claims for each unit — on paper, as we did in the Dark Ages at the beginning of the 21st century — they were rejected for insufficient documentation (because who keeps a receipt for the Intellivision you bought five years ago from a thrift store?) and I was hardly in a position to sue them over it.
</p><p>
As the cop instructed, I bailed out of there a couple months later. The doors had not been upgraded, there was still no lock on the exterior entrance, and the manager said installing cameras would be too expensive. I made sure to note on my "exit survey" that I was leaving because their security was worse than a Russian garrison after a vodka waffle party. The chain subsequently folded and got sold to some other megastorage company and I imagine they're still too cheap to do anything about it.
</p><p>
The current break-in was a bit more professional because the facility I moved to was obviously more serious about security (they could hardly have been less). When I first moved in, the climate control section had proper roll-up doors and sliding security latches, and there were cameras scattered around the premises, but the exterior door was also just a regular door and usually left unlocked. One of the local unhoused encampments noticed this and moved in, leaving a mess and requiring forcible eviction by the police, though they didn't manage to get into any occupied units. After that the management installed a cipher lock-type door handle and issued unique codes to each tenant.
</p><p>
We own a house now, but my particular homeowner's insurance policy doesn't cover rental units (I read every page, believe me). Even though the "partner" insurance was useless the first time around, I still went with the company this facility was getting kickbacks from since it was the cheapest alternative. After all, I figured if I got hit again they wouldn't pay off this time either, so I might as well spend as little money as possible on it.
</p><p>
The door handle only controlled the latch; there was no deadbolt. So what do you do to attack a door like that? You crowbar it and pry the latch open (see also <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">the well-known xkcd</a>). The picture at the beginning was what it looked like when I came to survey the damage. The manager had effected some emergency repairs and installed a temporary keyed deadbolt, requiring me to go to the office to get inside.
</p><p>
And what do you do to attack disc locks? Well, if you're not handy with a pick, you drill them.
</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2aKtVbiekkhiD5SeCwyV4p_wQNZ2RiiGy7tMIZYMs_vhorPEA5ocSxuGC-gf0uZvgo4J4UGdHiEd2mJmP4HXebuKBx_TlM_fopUkbWIuhWStqUFTytfygTMTbwOwgwWQJZJyOh6nyyQwzjGAKoYi0sMDM5u7w6edG6gIHZkoWqowMKJR5ylkDK_SZWWQ/s4080/PXL_20240806_234051528~2.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2aKtVbiekkhiD5SeCwyV4p_wQNZ2RiiGy7tMIZYMs_vhorPEA5ocSxuGC-gf0uZvgo4J4UGdHiEd2mJmP4HXebuKBx_TlM_fopUkbWIuhWStqUFTytfygTMTbwOwgwWQJZJyOh6nyyQwzjGAKoYi0sMDM5u7w6edG6gIHZkoWqowMKJR5ylkDK_SZWWQ/s320/PXL_20240806_234051528~2.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p>
The drilled lock is on the right where you can see the small hole in the keyway. This lock was on the first unit, in which they upended several items and ended up stealing my Atari Portfolio in a camera bag (the good one, of course, not the flaky spare), a boxed set of Agenda VR3 PDAs (the famous MIPS Linux-based one), and an 867MHz Titanium PowerBook G4 in its original box. This unit was somewhat defective in that it has an iffy LCD CCFL that starts up pink. Later after submitting the claim and police report I also noticed they stole a box of Apple Pro Speakers (wait until they try to hook them up to anything).
</p><p>
For some reason they didn't drill the lock on the second unit and instead took several whacks at it with some sort of sharp instrument, but this only made the lock completely inoperable. They then pried the latch off, but the shelves in that unit interfere with the roll-up door unless you know the trick and they apparently weren't able to get inside. (The manager had also replaced the latch before I arrived.) In the process, however, they did succeed in knocking some items around including a couple of hard disks off the shelf from my Outbound laptop systems. They were fortunately backed up before storage and should be replaceable with some other 2.5" IDE equivalent device because they won't spin up now.
</p><p>
Having learned my lesson from the first burglary, I had nothing irreplaceable in the units, though I did have some items from my Tomy Pyuuta collection in the second one temporarily. They also didn't go through any boxes, likely because they didn't have any time: the next scheduled security patrol arrived about ten or fifteen minutes after they gained access and discovered the theft, so no doubt they hauldassed when they saw the guard coming back on rounds. I also wasn't the only person burglarized, though the manager wouldn't tell me exactly how many other units were hit. For the units that were hit, he provided us with covers that slide onto the latch:

I can see how this would make it very difficult to use boltcutters or an angle grinder on the lock shackle, but if you can get a key in it, you can get a wrench or a drill bit in it, so I'm not sure if it adds any meaningful security otherwise. I wandered around to see if the covers were on other units and I counted a few, though I couldn't say if everyone who got one was using it.
</p><p>
This time, same city, the police never showed for my units and I don't know if they came to the premises at all. (Before you ask, I have absolutely no idea if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_California_Proposition_47">Proposition 47</a> has anything to do with it.) I submitted the police reports online and got my case numbers, one for each unit as usual, and then did an online submission with the insurance company including the photos that I had.
</p><p>
The insurance company took about a week to assign an adjuster. Despite having itemized the missing items twice on the police report and in the initial submission, I was asked to complete <em>and notarize</em> another inventory sheet for each unit <em>on paper</em>. The adjuster also wanted any proof of purchase or ownership, such as "a receipt, invoice, order or shipping confirmation, or debit/credit statement." Naturally, these items are so old and have been in there so long that none of this exists. The situation sounded suspiciously like I was going to get stiffed again and I complained to the adjuster that if I had to pay a notary to notarize two documents that may never result in a payout, I'd be out even more money as well as time. (A fairly cynical way of discouraging claims by people for whom that amount of money is more significant.)
</p><p>
To my surprise, although it took several E-mails and another ten days, the adjuster agreed to waive the notarization requirement. (I'm not even sure what the notarization step was accomplishing: the inventory sheets aren't affidavits.) The documents wanted purchase price and location, which I could only do from memory, and a replacement cost, which I did by eBay searches for comparable items. My insurance limit is $2,000 each unit with a $100 deductible, waived if you have a disc lock installed, which I did. I made sure the destroyed disc locks were listed as part of the claim and I determined a total replacement cost of $512.23 in the first unit and $57.23 in the second one.
</p><p>
I didn't hear anything for a month and E-mailed the adjuster again. The next day they paid off on the claim: $269.40 and $48.96. "The policy you have is based on the Actual Cash Value (ACV) of your items, which means depreciation needs to be applied to the item(s) based on their age. I've adjusted the loss presented and added in the applicable sales tax." Since I figured the alternative was $0 and extra vitriol for this blog post, I agreed. The checks arrived this week and we deposited them. They do not make me whole, though of course none of these items are critical.
</p><p>
Here's the lessons learned for those of us with classic computers in storage:
</p><ul>
<li>The quality of the facility's security matters. The best burglary is the one that never happens. If one does, higher quality facilities are more likely to work with less unreasonable partner insurance agencies.
</li><li>Store nothing you really care about in a storage unit. Real burglars notwithstanding, the other kind of theft you may have to worry about is an unscrupulous manager who says you didn't pay your bill and auctions it off. Such horror stories aren't common, but I know people who say this has happened to them, keeping in mind I'm only hearing their side of the story. For example, <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2024/03/after-41-years-my-first-assembly.html">my original Tomy Tutor</a>, the actual computer I got when I was seven in its actual box with its actual accessories that actually still works, will never go in storage. Neither will my first suitcase Commodore KIM-1.
</li><li><em>Use a disc lock.</em> They're certainly better than the cheapo padlocks you buy at the store, but most insurance companies will also reduce or waive your deductable if you have what they consider to be a proper lock, and that usually means a disc lock. If you use the disc lock the storage facility sells, you'll likely pay an additional markup on it, but it's also guaranteed to be acceptable to their partner insurance company. Plus, you can claim the replacement cost.
</li><li>How you do inventory may not have much effect on the success of your claim. The advice that you should take photos of your storage unit each time you're in it is a good one and you might as well do it if you have the presence of mind, but it's not really what they're asking for on claims ("you could have lost it, you could have misplaced it, that's not proof of ownership," etc.), and there's no guarantee you'll have photographed what in fact got taken. A beautiful spreadsheet doesn't prove ownership either. In both cases they wanted receipts and I didn't have any of those. In the first case, the insurance company told me to pound sand. In the second case, they paid off. I'll let you know if a pattern ever emerges, but the photos didn't have anything to do with it in either situation.
</li><li>Bulky and heavy items are ignored. Fortunately, many classic computing items are bulky and heavy, and they take up space in a truck. If it's going to slow them down and it's not clear they can fence it, they might damage it but they probably won't take it. By the way, claim damaged items too, not just stolen ones. You might as well ask.
</li><li>Something neat-looking that's light and portable might get nicked. The Portfolio was in a camera bag, so they probably figured it was a camera and yoinked it. Moreover, anything with an Apple logo that's light and portable <em>will</em> get nicked.  These aren't usually technologically savvy people and they know that Apple makes this cool thing called an iPhone and some watch thing and people like those. So they took the PowerBook and Pro Speakers, even though they probably didn't fetch much when they tried to sell them.
</li><li>Conversely, if you make the thieves' job harder, they'll take less. Gangs that hit self-storage units aren't generally the ones that do a whole lot of preplanning and research. Other than maybe renting a unit themselves to look around and get a gate code, they usually won't know the exact interior layout or what units are occupied, and since they won't know what time window they have before any guards or staff come around they'll prefer to grab what's obvious. In my case, the door on the second unit won't fully open without a bit of particular fiddling, so they obviously gave up. Messy units are harder to work in but also harder to steal from. Put high value items in the back and out of view behind big heavy ones. Hide production packaging in non-descript boxes: they <em>didn't</em> get any of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/palm-os-and-the-devices-that-ran-it-an-ars-retrospective/">my Palm Pilot collection</a>, for example, despite being small, portable, frequently in their original boxes and looking like something of value, because they were all in plain cardboard boxes with opaque descriptions in Sharpie marker. But they got the Agenda VR3 box because it was out on the shelf.
</li><li>You don't get what you don't ask for, and you won't get what you don't constantly get on their case about. The adjuster was clearly not a malignant person, just overworked, because this is a cut-rate insurance company who tries to screw their employees just as much as their covered individuals. The squeaky wheel gets the check.
</li><li>You will never get the full replacement value of your items. Ever. In the end, it's just stuff. I'm not happy it got broken into, but I'm not going to shrivel up or shoot myself in the head over it either. Nothing was in there I can't live without.
  </li></ul><p>
Since the break-in occurred, the temporary deadbolt was replaced with a new cipher lock, but this one controls a full deadbolt, not just a door latch. The facility is also gradually converting the roll-up doors to pick-resistant cylinder locks and dispensing with padlocks altogether. I'm hopeful I won't be writing a third blog post on this topic in a few years.

<pre>svec ← {shape←⍬⍴(⍴⍵)*÷2} ##.<a href="https://dfns.dyalog.com/c_sudoku.htm">sudoku</a> prob  ⍝ Solution vector for Sudoku problem ⍵.

The  Sudoku  puzzle  consists  of a 3×3 grid of 3×3 boxes, each cell of which is
either  empty  or contains a number in the range 1 to 9. A typical problem might
look like this:

    ┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
    │· · 1│6 9 ·│5 · ·│
    │4 · ·│2 7 ·│· · 1│
    │· 7 ·│· · ·│· 9 ·│
    ├─────┼─────┼─────┤
    │· · ·│· · ·│· 3 ·│
    │· · ·│4 3 ·│· · 7│
    │· · ·│7 8 ·│6 · ·│
    ├─────┼─────┼─────┤
    │· · 6│· · ·│8 · ·│
    │· 2 ·│1 4 ·│· 6 ·│
    │· 1 ·│3 5 ·│· 4 ·│
    └─────┴─────┴─────┘

The challenge is to supply the missing numbers in such a way that:

    each 3×3 box and
    each 9-item row and
    each 9-item column

contains each of the 9 numbers with no repeats.

A solution to the above problem might be:

    ┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
    │3 8 1│6 9 4│5 7 2│
    │4 6 9│2 7 5│3 8 1│
    │2 7 5│8 1 3│4 9 6│
    ├─────┼─────┼─────┤
    │7 9 4│5 6 2│1 3 8│
    │6 5 8│4 3 1│9 2 7│
    │1 3 2│7 8 9│6 5 4│
    ├─────┼─────┼─────┤
    │5 4 6│9 2 7│8 1 3│
    │9 2 3│1 4 8│7 6 5│
    │8 1 7│3 5 6│2 4 9│
    └─────┴─────┴─────┘

The  puzzle  may  be generalised to accept problems of shape other than 3×3×3×3,
see examples below.

Argument  matrix [prob] contains numbers 1-9 in occupied cells and 0s otherwise.
Optional  left argument [shape] specifies the box shape for non-square problems.
The result is a vector of all solution matrices.

Technical notes:

This solution was supplied by Veli-Matti Jantunen, who says:

⍺ may be used to denote the sudoku rectangle, the default is 2/(↑⍴⍵)*0.5 (eg. if
"mat" is a 6x6 matrix and the sub area is 2 3, the call must be 2 3 sudoku mat).

The result is a vector of all the solutions found, or ⍬ (no solutions) or ''
(error - should not happen, but if there are zillions of results)

The algorithm is simple:
   handle the matrix as a vector
   the rows, columns and sudoku areas are denoted by index vectors
   do the basic checking for the puzzle (i.e. polish) and with the main function
    check one alternative from the list at time:
     filter all the possible elements for all the cells
      if at least one cell is empty = no solution -&gt; take the next from the list
      if one cell contains more than one number -&gt; select the cell from the
         tightest group and add every combination (from this cell) to the list
      if all cells contain one number = solution -&gt; take the next from the list.

Veli-Matti  also  provides this new-from-old problem shuffler:

    Shuffle←{
    ⍝| Shuffle the original sudoku table to another one ;)
    ⍝| ⍺: sudoku box (use for e.g. 6x6 tables, like 2 3 Shuffle table).

        ⍺←(⍴⍵)*0.5 ⋄ (⎕IO ⎕ML ⎕RL)←1 3(⎕TS+.*2)
        (¯1+?3⍴2){(⌽⍣(↑⍺))(⍉⍣(↑1⌽⍺))(⊖⍣(↑⌽⍺))⍵}⍵{(0,(↑⍴⍺)?↑⍴⍺)[⍵⌷⍺+1]}(↑⍴⍵){∊{⍵[(⍴⍵)?⍴⍵]}{⍵[(⍴⍵)?⍴⍵]}¨⍵⊂⍳⍺}¨⍺/¨⍳¨⌽⍺
    }

David Crossley supplies an alternative coding:

        ⍝ Sudoku - ⍵: N×N setup where box size N*÷2 is integral
        ⍝ The setup is a valid arrangement in some cells of numbers from 1-N; the rest are 0´s.

Finally, here is Arthur Whitney's amazing solution in K 5:

    x(,/{@[x;y;]'(!10)^x*|/p[;y]=p,:,3/:-3!p:!9 9}')/&amp;~*x

Translated by Phil Last into a D-function:

    sudoku←{⎕io←0       ⍝ Whitney/Last
        p←{(↑⍵)∘{(⍺∨.=⍵)/⍳n×n}¨,⍵},(n*÷2){⍵,⍺⊥⌊⍵÷⍺}¨⍳n n←⍴⍵
        m←{(⊂⍵)⌈(⊂⍺=⍳⍴⍵)×(1+⍳n)~⍵[⍺⊃p]}
        (⍴⍵)∘⍴¨⊃{⊃,/⍺ m¨⍵}/{(⍸⍵=0),⊂⊂⍵},⍵
    }

Morten Kromberg's recasting defines some of K's  constructs explicitly and so is
closer to the original.  Note that, like the K version, it takes and returns 81-
vectors, rather than matrices.

    sudoku←{
    ⍝ Define one k fn and one op missing from APL
         wh←{⍸⍵≠0}              ⍝ k '&amp;' function
         mg←{a←⍺ ⋄ a[⍺⍺]←⍵ ⋄ a} ⍝ merge operator: r←old (indexes mg) new

         rcq←(↑,⍳9 9),3/,3⌿3 3⍴⍳9   ⍝ Row, Column, Quadrant
         p←{wh rcq∨.=⍵}¨↓rcq        ⍝ Cells in same row, col or quadrant
         nzd←1+⍳9                   ⍝ Non-zero digits for a little more speed
         ⊃{⊃,/⍺{⍵∘(⍺ mg)¨nzd~⍵[⍺⊃p]}¨⍵}/(wh ⍵=0),⊂⊂⍵ ⍝ kapow!
    }

Roger Hui presents this in the following more beautiful form, generalised for
non-square puzzles:

    Sudoku←{⍺←(⍴⍵)*÷2                   ⍝ Solutions of shape-⍺ Sudoku puzzle ⍵.
        svec ← {⊃pvex/(emt ⍵),⊂⊂⍵}      ⍝ solution vector
        pvex ← {⊃,/⍺∘pvec¨⍵}            ⍝ vector of placements
        pvec ← {(⍺ avl ⍵)⊣@(⊂⍺)¨⊂⍵}     ⍝ placements
        avl  ← {(⍳⊃⍴⍵)~⍵×⊃⍺⌷CMAP}       ⍝ list of available numbers
        emt  ← {(,⍵=0)/,⍳⍴⍵}            ⍝ row &amp; column indices of empty cells

        rcb  ← {(⍳⍴⍵),¨⍺ box(⍴⍵)÷⍺}     ⍝ row/column/box numbers
        box  ← {(⊃⍺)⌿(⊃⌽⍺)/⍵⍴⍳×/⍵}      ⍝ box numbers for a puzzle of size ⍵*2
        cmap ← {⊂[⍳2]1∊¨⍵∘.=⍵}          ⍝ contention map for puzzle ⍵
        CMAP ← cmap ⍺ rcb ⍵             ⍝ contention map for puzzle

        svec ⍵                          ⍝ vector of solutions.
    }
