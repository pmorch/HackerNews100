<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Claude can now create and edit Excel spreadsheets, documents, PowerPoint slide decks, and PDFs directly in <a href="https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.f9d68c1f-678f-481a-840d-b84efe72f7f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude.ai</a> and the desktop app. This transforms how you work with Claude—instead of only receiving text responses or in-app artifacts, you can describe what you need, upload relevant data, and get ready-to-use files in return.</p><p>File creation is now available as a preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise plan users. Pro users will get access in the coming weeks.</p><h2 id="what-you-can-do">What you can do</h2><p>Claude creates actual files from your instructions—whether working from uploaded data, researching information, or building from scratch. Here are just a few examples:</p><ul><li><strong>Turn data into insights</strong>: Give Claude raw data and get back polished outputs with cleaned data, statistical analysis, charts, and written insights explaining what matters.</li><li><strong>Build spreadsheets</strong>: Describe what you need—financial models with scenario analysis, project trackers with automated dashboards, or budget templates with variance calculations. Claude creates it with working formulas and multiple sheets.</li><li><strong>Cross-format work</strong>: Upload a PDF report and get PowerPoint slides. Share meeting notes and get a formatted document. Upload invoices and get organized spreadsheets with calculations.

			</div><div><p>SANTA FE — Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and the New Mexico Early Childhood Education and Care Department announced a historic milestone on Monday: New Mexico will become the first state in the nation to guarantee no-cost universal child care starting Nov. 1.</p>
<p>This groundbreaking new initiative will make child care available to all New Mexicans, regardless of income, by removing income eligibility requirements from the state’s child care assistance program and continuing the waiver of family copayments.</p>
<p>“Child care is essential to family stability, workforce participation, and New Mexico’s future prosperity,” said Lujan Grisham. “By investing in universal child care, we are giving families financial relief, supporting our economy, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to grow and thrive.”</p>
<p>This announcement fulfills the promise made by the governor and the New Mexico Legislature when they created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department in 2019. Since then, New Mexico has expanded access to no-cost child care to families with incomes at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, reducing financial strain on tens of thousands of families.</p>
<p>With Monday’s announcement universal child care will be extended to every family in the state, regardless of income. This amounts to an average annual family savings of $12,000 per child.</p>
<p>“New Mexico is creating the conditions for better outcomes in health, learning, and well-being,” said Neal Halfon, professor of pediatrics, public health and public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, and director of the Center for Healthier Children, Families, and Communities. “Its approach is rooted in data, driven by communities, and becoming a model for the nation.</p>
<p>“By prioritizing public investments in early childhood educators, families, and children, New Mexico continues to lead the way in building a sustainable, affordable, and quality child care and early learning system that helps its communities and economy thrive,” said Michelle Kang, president and CEO of the National Association of the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). “Achieving universal child care will make a huge difference for the state’s children, families, businesses, and educators—and for all of us, by showing that it can be done.”</p>
<p>Families who receive child care assistance report greater financial stability, more time to focus on their children, and the ability to choose higher-quality care settings. Now, every family in New Mexico will have the same opportunity. New Mexico is also taking decisive action to build the supply of infant and toddler care statewide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing a $12.7 million low-interest loan fund to construct, expand, and renovate child care facilities, with an additional $20 million requested in the Fiscal Year 2027 budget.</li>
<li>Targeting growth to focus on care for infants, toddlers, low-income families, and children with special needs.</li>
<li>Partnering with employers and school districts to expand child care options for working families.</li>
<li>Launching a statewide campaign to recruit licensed and registered home providers.</li>
<li><span>To support providers, reimbursement rates will rise to reflect the true cost of care.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Programs that commit to paying entry-level staff a minimum of $18 per hour and offer 10 hours of care per day, five days a week, will receive an incentive rate. New Mexico estimates an additional 5,000 early childhood professionals are needed to fully achieve a universal system.</p>
<p>“Early childhood care and education is a public good,” said ECECD Sec. Elizabeth Groginsky. “By providing universal access and improving pay for our early childhood workforce, we are easing financial pressure on families, strengthening our economy, and helping every child learn in safe, nurturing environments. This is the kind of investment that builds equity today and prosperity for the future.”</p>
<p>With universal child care, New Mexico is leading the nation by showing that what is best for children and families is also the smartest investment for long-term prosperity—building a stronger future for every community in the state.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p dir="auto">The DuckDB distribution for <a href="http://node.js/" rel="nofollow">Node.js</a> on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" rel="nofollow">npm</a> was compromised with malware (along with <a href="https://www.aikido.dev/blog/npm-debug-and-chalk-packages-compromised" rel="nofollow">several other packages</a>). An attacker published new versions of four of duckdb’s packages that included <strong>malicious code to interfere with cryptocoin transactions</strong>. The following packages and versions are affected:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>@duckdb/node-api@1.3.3</code></li>
<li><code>@duckdb/node-bindings@1.3.3</code></li>
<li><code>duckdb@1.3.3</code></li>
<li><code>@duckdb/duckdb-wasm@1.29.2</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note: The current release version of DuckDB is 1.3.2, with 1.4.0 expected to be released on Sept 10th, 2025 (tomorrow as of this writing). We do not plan to ever release a “legit” DuckDB 1.3.3. Users should double-check that they are not accidentally updating to those affected versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We have ourselves noticed this <em>within four hours</em> of it happening. Here’s our response:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>As an immediate response, we have <strong>deprecated</strong> the specific versions.</li>
<li>We have reached out to npm support to <strong>delete the affected versions</strong>. They were so kind to do so.</li>
<li>We have also <strong>re-released</strong> the node packages with higher version numbers (1.3.4/1.30.0) as a further safeguard so the latest version of the package points to a safe version</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">We apologize for this issue. We are reviewing our internal processes to ensure the safety of future releases.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Postmortem</h3>
<p dir="auto">On September 8th (Monday), the DuckDB maintainers received the following message from "<a href="mailto:...@npmjs.help">...@npmjs.help</a>":</p>

He followed the link (now defunct) to a website hosted under the domain <code>npmjs.help</code>. This website contained a <strong>pixel-perfect copy</strong> of the <a href="http://npmjs.com/" rel="nofollow">npmjs.com</a> website. He logged in using the <code>duckdb_admin</code> user and password, followed by 2FA. Again, the user profile, settings etc. were a perfect copy of the <a href="http://npmjs.com/" rel="nofollow">npmjs.com</a> website including all user data. As requested by the email, he then re-set the 2FA setup.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the background, the copycat website forwarded all actions to the actual npm website, so the 2FA was actually updated there, too. But they also added a new API token, which they then used to publish the malicious package versions. In hindsight, the fact that his browser did not auto-complete the login should have been a red flag. It's painful to spell out, but <strong>we fell for a classic phishing attack</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">We again apologize for this mishap. We are reviewing our internal processes to ensure the safety of future releases. It is fortunate that we noticed this within a few hours of it happening. The DuckDBLabs team was able to set up a call at 7AM to perform an immediate response. Fortunately we were not locked out of our NPM account, which also easily could have happened. We were able to rotate passwords, tokens and API keys immediately.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">You too can run malware from NPM (I mean without consequences)</h2><a id="user-content-you-too-can-run-malware-from-npm-i-mean-without-consequences" aria-label="Permalink: You too can run malware from NPM (I mean without consequences)" href="#you-too-can-run-malware-from-npm-i-mean-without-consequences"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Phishing NPM package authors continues, unsurprisingly.
The stakes are not high enough to switch from phishing to anything more advanced (like <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/" rel="nofollow">https://xkcd.com/538/</a>) but seeing article blurbs say "Supply chain Attack" next to "These packages generally receive 2-3 billion downloads per week." might finally be enough to make an impression, one hopes.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is not a detailed analysis of the attack, there's plenty of that already. If you're looking for one, visit our friends at <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/npm-author-qix-compromised-in-major-supply-chain-attack" rel="nofollow">https://socket.dev/blog/npm-author-qix-compromised-in-major-supply-chain-attack</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Instead, let's look at how you could have a compromised dependency like that get into your app and be stopped.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the compromised packages was <code>is-arrayish</code> and I'll use that as an example going forward.</p>

<p dir="auto">So if an app uses <code>is-arrayish</code> in the browser, it will override <code>fetch</code>, <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> and <code>window.ethereum.request</code> and whenever it finds a transaction being sent, it'll replace the target address with one of the malware author's addresses that looks most alike.</p>
<p dir="auto">I won't go into this either, but you can take a look at the summary of "donations" some other friends linked to here: <a href="https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/61fbc095-f19b-479d-a037-5469aba332ab" rel="nofollow">https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/61fbc095-f19b-479d-a037-5469aba332ab</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Pretty low impact for an attack this big. Some of it seems to be people mocking the malware author with worthless transfers.</p>

<p dir="auto">Say we have an app.
The app allows the user to send a meaningless transaction to themselves. Don't expect it to make sense.
It also uses <code>is-arrayish</code> because otherwise we'd have nothing to demo.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <i>9/8/2025</i>
    
    <p>CRDTs. Data structures that can be replicated across multiple nodes, edited independently, merged back together, and it all just works. But collaborative document editing and multiplayer TODO lists are just the tip of the iceberg - I believe the big application is distributed databases, and for that we need to talk about consistency.</p>
<p>CRDTs are a tool for <strong>Strong Eventual Consistency</strong>. Let's start with the definition of normal Eventual Consistency<sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Eventual Delivery</dt>
  <dd>An update delivered to one node will <i>eventually</i> reaches all nodes</dd>
  
  <dt>Eventual Convergence</dt>
  <dd>If two nodes have seen all the same updates, they will <i>eventually</i> have the same state.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) replaces <em>Eventual Convergence</em> with <em>Strong Convergence</em>:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Strong Convergence</dt>
  <dd>If two nodes have seen all the same updates, they will have the same state.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Spot the difference! In SEC two replicas have the same state as soon as the updates are processed, not <em>eventually</em>. If multiple nodes are updated independently, there will be conflicts - this is inevitable. What SEC guarantees is that these conflicts are solved automatically and deterministically.</p>
<p>This has massive implications. SEC means low latency, because nodes don't need to coordinate to handle reads and writes. It means incredible fault tolerance - every single node in the system bar one could simultaneously crash, and reads and writes could still happen normally. And it means nodes still function properly if they're offline or split from the network for arbitrary time periods.</p>
<p>Strong Eventual Consistency is Eventual Consistency that works. If you're doing local first, or low latency geo-replicated systems - accept no substitute. This is the context I think we should see CRDTs in - building blocks of Strongly Eventually Consistent systems. CRDTs as application state as one thing, CRDTs as entire databases are quite another.</p>

(<a href="http://maurycyz.com/tags/programming">Programming</a>) 



<p>Internet ads are horrible:
They waste your time, and the advertising industry makes the internet a worse place.
Payouts are so small that the only way to survive is to turn your site into an ad filled hellhole with no real substance.</p>
<p>If you want to support your favorite authors: send then money.
A dollar helps more then viewing ads ever would.</p>
<p>However, most people see advertising as a part of the internet experience, which is why I added this message to my site:</p>

<ad-note id="box">
<ad-note-content-wrapper>
No adblocker detected. Consider using an extension like <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> to save time and bandwidth. <u>Click here to close.</u>
</ad-note-content-wrapper>
</ad-note>
<p>It’s shown off to the side, and never covers content.
It won’t be shown if there isn’t enough space.
The close button actually works and it stays closed.</p>
<p>The specific recommendation is important because a lot of people have only <em>heard of adblockers from ads</em>.
Commercial adblockers range from sketchy to outright scams:
If they are paying to be promoted, they must expect to make money from users.</p>

<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="css"><span><span>#ad-note-hidden<span>,</span> #ad-note {
</span></span><span><span>        <span>display</span>: <span>none</span>;

</span></span><span><span>}}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The message won’t be visible if an adblocker removes the &lt;div&gt; element – which has a lot of ad-like class names – or
blocks the network request for “nativeads.js”.</p>
<p>The network request ensures that it doesn’t miss blockers like uBlock Origin Lite, which by default will only filter network requests, not page content.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have no way to detect DNS based blocking short of loading an actual ad.
Instead, I made the message unobtrusive and easy to close.</p>
<p>The message won’t be shown in browsers that don’t support JavaScript, because those don’t need adblockers to begin with.
It should be functional without CSS, but I can’t think of any browsers that support JS but not CSS.
(but if you use external CSS, it’s quite common for the request to fail resulting in an unstyled page.)</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://stefanbohacek.com/project/detect-missing-adblocker-wordpress-plugin/">Stefan Bohacek</a> for the original idea. I’ve modified it to reduce false positives and explicitly scoped the cookie so the message is only shown once.</p>

<p>Apple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGztGfRujSE">introduced the Liquid Glass effect during WWDC 2025</a> in June—a stunning UI effect that makes interface elements appear to be made of curved, refractive glass. This article is a hands‑on exploration of how to recreate a similar effect on the web using CSS, SVG displacement maps, and physics-based refraction calculations.</p>
<p>Instead of chasing pixel‑perfect parity, we’ll approximate Liquid Glass, recreating the core refraction and a specular highlight, as a focused proof‑of‑concept you can extend.</p>
<p>We'll build up the effect from first principles, starting with how light bends when passing through different materials.</p>
<div><p>Chrome‑only demo</p><p>The interactive demo at the end currently works in Chrome only (due to
SVG filters as backdrop‑filter).</p><p>You can still read the article and interact with the inline
simulations in other browsers.</p></div>
<h2 id="understanding-refraction"><a href="#understanding-refraction" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Understanding Refraction</h2>
<p><strong>Refraction</strong> is what happens when light changes direction as it passes from one material to another (like from air into glass). This bending occurs because light travels at different speeds through different materials.</p>
<p>The relationship between the incoming and outgoing light angles is described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law"><strong>Snell–Descartes law</strong></a>:</p>

<p>To create our glass effect, we need to define the shape of our virtual glass surface. Think of this like describing the cross-section of a lens or curved glass panel.</p>
<h2 id="surface-function"><a href="#surface-function" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Surface Function</h2>
<p>Our glass surface is described by a mathematical function that defines how thick the glass is at any point from its edge to the end of the bezel. This <strong>surface function</strong> takes a value between <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (at the outer edge) and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (end of bezel, start of flat surface) and returns the height of the glass at that point.</p>

<p>From the height we can calculate the angle of incidence, which is the angle between the incoming ray and the normal to the surface at that point. The normal is simply the derivative of the height function at that point, rotated by <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>90</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-90</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> degrees:</p>

<p>We could make the surface function more complex by adding more parameters, but these four already give a good idea of how the surface shape affects the refraction.</p>
<h2 id="simulation"><a href="#simulation" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Simulation</h2>
<p>Now let's see these surface functions in action through interactive ray tracing simulations. The following visualization demonstrates how light rays behave differently as they pass through each surface type, helping us understand the practical implications of our mathematical choices.</p>

<p>From the simulation, we can see that concave surfaces push rays outside the glass; convex surfaces keep them inside.</p>
<p>We want to avoid outside displacement because it requires sampling background beyond the object. Apple’s Liquid Glass appears to favor convex profiles (except for the Switch component, covered later).</p>
<p>The background arrow indicates displacement—how far a ray lands compared to where it would have landed without glass. Color encodes magnitude (longer → more purple).</p>
<p>Take a look at symmetry: rays at the same distance from the border share the same displacement magnitude on each side. Compute once, reuse around the bezel/object.</p>
<h2 id="displacement-vector-field"><a href="#displacement-vector-field" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Displacement Vector Field</h2>
<p>Now that calculated the displacement at a distance from border, let's calculate the displacement vector field for the entire glass surface.</p>
<p>The vector field describes at every position on the glass surface how much the light ray is displaced from its original position, and in which direction. In a circle, this displacement is always orthogonal to the border.</p>
<h2 id="pre-calculating-the-displacement-magnitude"><a href="#pre-calculating-the-displacement-magnitude" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Pre-calculating the displacement magnitude</h2>
<p>Because we saw that this displacement magnitude is symmetric around the bezel, we can pre-calculate it for a range of distances from the border, on a single radius.</p>
<p>This allows us to calculate everything in two dimensions once (x and z axis), on one "half-slice" of the object, and we will the rotate these pre-calculated displacements around the z-axis.</p>
<p>The actual number of samples we need to do on a radius is of 127 ray simulations, and is determined by the constraints of the SVG Displacement Map resolution. (See next section.)</p>

<h2 id="normalizing-vectors"><a href="#normalizing-vectors" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Normalizing vectors</h2>
<p>In the above diagram, the arrows are all scaled down for visibility, so they do not overlap. This is normalization, and is also useful from a technical standpoint.</p>
<p>To use these vectors in a displacement map, we need to normalize them. Normalization means scaling the vectors so that their maximum magnitude is <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which allows us to represent them in a fixed range.</p>
<p>So we calculate the maximum displacement magnitude in our pre-calculated array:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre><code data-language="ts" data-theme=""><span data-line=""><span>const</span><span> maximumDisplacement</span><span> =</span><span> Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>displacementMagnitudes</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>And we divide each vector's magnitude by this maximum:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre><code data-language="ts" data-theme=""><span data-line=""><span>displacementVector_normalized</span><span> =</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  angle: </span><span>normalAtBorder</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  magnitude: </span><span>magnitude</span><span> /</span><span> maximumDisplacement</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>};</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>We store <code>maximumDisplacement</code> as we will need it to re-scale the displacement map back to the actual magnitudes.</p>
<h2 id="svg-displacement-map"><a href="#svg-displacement-map" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>SVG Displacement Map</h2>
<p>Now we need to translate our mathematical refraction calculations into something the browser can actually render. We'll use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/feDisplacementMap"><strong>SVG displacement maps</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A displacement map is simply an image where each pixel's color tells the browser how far it should find the actual pixel value from its current position.</p>
<p>SVG's <code>&lt;feDisplacementMap /&gt;</code> encodes these pixels in a 32 bit RGBA image, where each channel represents a different axis of displacement.</p>
<p>It's up to the user to define which channel corresponds to which axis, but it is important to understand the constraint:
Because each channel is 8 bits, the displacement is limited to a range of -128 to 127 pixels in each direction. (256 values possible in total).
128 is the neutral value, meaning no displacement.</p>
<p>SVG filters can only use images as displacement maps, so we need to convert our displacement vector field into an image format.</p>

<p>To convert our displacement vector field into a displacement map, we need to convert each vector into a color value. The red channel will represent the X component of the vector, and the green channel will represent the Y component.</p>
<p>We currently have polar coordinates (angle and magnitude) for each vector, so we need to convert them to Cartesian coordinates (X and Y) before mapping them to the red and green channels.</p>

<p>Because we normalised our vectors already, <code>magnitude</code> here is between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>From here, we just remap the values to the range of 0 to 255 for the red and green channels:</p>

<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre><code data-language="tsx" data-theme=""><span data-line=""><span>const</span><span> result</span><span> =</span><span> {</span></span>

<p>The final piece of our Liquid Glass effect is the <strong>specular highlight</strong>—those bright, shiny edges you see on real glass objects when light hits them at certain angles.</p>
<p>The way Apple implements it seems to be a simple rim light effect, where the highlight appears around the edges of the glass object, and its intensity varies based on the angle of the surface normal relative to a fixed light direction.</p>

<p>Both are loaded as separate <code>&lt;feImage /&gt;</code> elements, and then combined using <code>&lt;feBlend /&gt;</code> to overlay the highlight on top of the refracted image.</p>

<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre><code data-language="css" data-theme=""><span data-line=""><span>.glass-panel</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  backdrop-filter</span><span>: </span><span>url</span><span>(</span><span>#liquidGlassFilterId</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The backdrop-filter dimensions does not adjust automatically to the element size, so you need to ensure that your filter images fit the size of your elements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we have all the pieces in place, we can create components that use this effect.</p>
<h2 id="bringing-it-all-together-real-ui-components"><a href="#bringing-it-all-together-real-ui-components" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Bringing It All Together: Real UI Components</h2>
<p>With our refraction math and displacement maps working, let's see how this translates to actual UI components you might use in an application.</p>
<div><p>Chrome‑specific demo</p><p>Chrome allows using SVG filters as <code>backdrop-filter</code>, which
isn’t part of the CSS spec.</p><p>Above, we used regular <code>filter</code> so it’s viewable in
Safari/Firefox.</p><p>The next components use <code>backdrop-filter</code>, so they’re
Chrome‑only.</p></div>
<p>The goal won't be to create real components for production, but just to get a taste of how the effect looks in different UI elements.</p>
<h2 id="magnifying-glass"><a href="#magnifying-glass" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Magnifying Glass</h2>
<p>This component actually uses two displacement maps: one for the refraction on the sides, and one for the zooming, which has a stronger refraction effect.</p>
<p>It also plays with shadows and scaling to create a more dynamic, interactive effect.</p>
<div><div><p><span></span><span>Optics Study</span></p><div><p>Drag the capsule to bend the page. This lens is a compact SVG displacement rig that refracts whatever sits beneath it.</p><p>The field comes from a rounded bezel profile; pixels are pushed along its gradient, then topped with a subtle specular bloom for depth.</p><p>Sweep across strong edges—high contrast makes the bend snap.</p></div></div><p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579380656108-f98e4df8ea62?q=80&amp;w=800&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop" alt="Abstract architectural lines" loading="lazy" draggable="false"></p></div><div><p><label>Specular Opacity</label><span>0.50</span></p><p><label>Specular Saturation</label><span>9</span></p><p><label>Refraction Level</label><span>1.00</span></p></div>
<h2 id="searchbox"><a href="#searchbox" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Searchbox</h2>
<div><p><label>Specular Opacity</label><span>0.20</span></p><p><label>Specular Saturation</label><span>4</span></p><p><label>Refraction Level</label><span>0.70</span></p><p><label>Blur Level</label><span>1.0</span></p></div>
<h2 id="switch"><a href="#switch" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Switch</h2>
<p>This uses a lip bezel, which makes the surface convex on the outside and concave in the middle. This makes the center slider zoomed out, while the edges refract the inside.</p>
<div><p><label>Specular Opacity</label><span>0.50</span></p><p><label>Specular Saturation</label><span>6</span></p><p><label>Refraction Level</label><span>1.00</span></p><p><label>Blur Level</label><span>0.2</span></p></div>
<h2 id="slider"><a href="#slider" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Slider</h2>
<p>Slider allows you to see the current level through the glass, while the sides refract the background. It uses a convex bezel.</p>
<div><p><label>Specular Opacity</label><span>0.40</span></p><p><label>Specular Saturation</label><span>7</span></p><p><label>Refraction Level</label><span>1.00</span></p><p><label>Blur Level</label><span>0.0</span></p></div>
<h2 id="music-player"><a href="#music-player" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Music Player</h2>
<p>This fake music player UI tries to mimic the look of Apple Music’s Liquid Glass panels, using a convex bezel and a subtle specular highlight.</p>
<p>It relies on the iTunes Search API to fetch album art and song details.</p>
<div><p><label>Specular Opacity</label><span>0.40</span></p><p><label>Specular Saturation</label><span>6</span></p><p><label>Refraction Level</label><span>1.00</span></p><p><label>Blur Level</label><span>1.0</span></p><p><label>Progressive Blur Strength</label><span>1.00</span></p><p><label>Glass Background Opacity</label><span>0.60</span></p></div>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This prototype distills Apple’s Liquid Glass into real‑time refraction plus a simple highlight. It’s flexible, but still Chrome‑bound—only Chromium exposes SVG filters as <code>backdrop-filter</code>. That said, it’s already viable inside Chromium‑based runtimes like Electron, elsewhere you could fake a softer fallback with layered blur.</p>
<p>Treat this strictly as experimental. Dynamic shape/size changes are currently costly because nearly every tweak (besides animating <code>&lt;filter /&gt;</code> props, like <code>scale</code>) forces a full displacement map rebuild.</p>
<p>The code needs a cleanup pass and perf work before any possible open‑source release.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my first post—I'd genuinely love any feedback, ideas, critiques, or suggestions. If it sparked a thought or you know someone who'd enjoy this kind of deep‑dive, feel free to pass it along.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>A former top cybersecurity executive at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/whatsapp" data-link-name="in body link">WhatsApp</a> filed a lawsuit on Monday alleging that parent company <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/meta" data-link-name="in body link">Meta</a> disregarded internal flaws in the app’s digital defenses and exposed billions of its users. He says the company systematically violated cybersecurity regulations and retaliated against him for reporting the failures.</p><p>Attaullah Baig, who served as head of security for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/whatsapp" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">WhatsApp</a> from 2021 to 2025, claims that approximately 1,500 engineers had unrestricted access to user data without proper oversight, potentially violating a US government order that imposed a $5bn penalty on the company in 2020.</p><p>He also claimed the company failed to remedy the hacking and takeover of more than 100,000 accounts each day, ignoring his pleas and proposed fixes and choosing instead to prioritize user growth. The lawsuit, filed in US federal court in San Francisco, alleges Facebook-owner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/meta" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Meta</a> failed to implement basic cybersecurity measures, including adequate data handling and breach detection capabilities.</p><p>According to the 115-page complaint, Baig discovered through internal security testing that WhatsApp engineers could “move or steal user data” including contact information, IP addresses and profile photos “without detection or audit trail”.</p><p>The filing claims Baig repeatedly raised concerns with senior executives, including the WhatsApp head, Will Cathcart, and Meta CEO, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg" data-link-name="in body link">Mark Zuckerberg</a>. Meta acquired Whatsapp for $19bn in 2014. The app now boasts three billion users, according to Meta.</p><p>WhatsApp’s vice president of communications Carl Woog wrote in a statement, “Sadly this is a familiar playbook in which a former employee is dismissed for poor performance and then goes public with distorted claims that misrepresent the ongoing hard work of our team.”</p><p>Baig alleges he faced escalating retaliation after his initial reports in 2021, including negative performance reviews, verbal warnings and ultimately termination in February 2025 for apparent “poor performance”.</p><p>The company emphasized that Baig left due to poor performance, with multiple senior engineers independently validating that his work was below expectations. Meta noted in a statement that the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration dismissed Baig’s initial complaint, finding that it had not retaliated against him.</p><p>Before joining Meta, Baig worked in cybersecurity roles at PayPal, Capital One and other major financial institutions.</p><p>He filed complaints with federal regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission before pursuing the current litigation.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>The case adds to ongoing scrutiny of Meta’s data protection practices across its platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, serving billions of users globally.</p><p>Meta agreed to the 2020 government settlement following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved improper harvesting of data from 50 million Facebook users. The consent order remains in effect until 2040.</p><p>In his whistleblower complaint, Baig is requesting reinstatement, back pay and compensatory damages, along with potential regulatory enforcement action against the company.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>This is an article about Silksong, the new game from Team Cherry / the much awaited sequel to Hollow Knight. You may have heard of it even if you aren’t in the gaming sphere, because so many people were trying to download the game on release that virtually all digital marketplaces buckled under the load. But before we talk about Silksong, I want to start by talking about the startup world.</p><p><span>One thing that may not be obvious for people who are not in the startup world is that building a consumer facing company is very different from building a b2b company, especially when it comes to sales. Selling to businesses is very easy. You go to a business and you say "hey, you like making money?" And the business will say "why yes, I do like making money" and you will say "great, I can help you make more money. If you give me $X, I think I can make you more than $X in return." And the business owner will evaluate if you are full of shit or not, and will then give you some cash. By contrast, selling to consumers is really hard, because it's never really clear why a consumer is using or buying your product to begin with. The conversation about money above doesn't really work. Sure, </span><em>some</em><span> people buy products because they think said products will save them money. But people will buy products for status, or because they think doing so will get them laid, or because it will get their parents off their back, or because they want to be entertained, or even for no particular reason at all.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png" width="901" height="572" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:572,&quot;width&quot;:901,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:520611,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://theahura.substack.com/i/173048532?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>“Consumers behave like rational actors” is total bullshit. </figcaption></figure></div><p><span>And some people will pay for your product even if it actively causes them pain and stress, or maybe </span><em>because</em><span> it causes them pain and stress.

The movement is so buttery smooth that simply getting back to the boss that just ripped you to shreds is a complex, skillful, and fundamentally enjoyable experience. Which is good, because you make that trek a lot.</p><p><span>I think the best games are </span><em>expressive</em><span> in some way. When you play the game, you constantly make choices about what you're doing that reflect your mastery and the way you choose to interact. This is very obvious in multiplayer or team games. Like, consider dunking in basketball. No one dunks because they need to. They do it because it feels fantastic to be so good at the game that you can literally dunk on your opponents, which is also why the phrase "dunk on &lt;person/people&gt;" has entered the lexicon. I'm not particularly athletic, so I can't dunk. But I imagine a close equivalent — in the dopamine receptor, brain psychiatry sense — is landing a crazy combo spike in Super Smash Bros. I love pulling off a spike. The blast of light from off screen. The crashing sound. Even the little trail that comes off your opponent as they go shooting down. All of this culminates in a shot of adrenaline and morale for you, and the hopeless feeling of devastation for your opponent.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif" width="480" height="270" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:270,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Basketball and Smash Bros don't have a lot in common.

You could do a long jump. You could jump and dash. You could sprint-jump. You could short jump, grab the first platform wall, jump off, and dash back to the second platform. You could short jump, hit the edge of the first platform, spring off it, and land on the second. You could short jump, grab the edge of the first platform, spring off it, dash, then attack-downwards to get to the ground faster. There are so many options, so many ways of getting around, so many opportunities to show off your reaction time and scrape off frames on how quickly you get from point A to point B. Something as simple as jumping on a ledge becomes a display of technical mastery.</p><p>The only other videogames that have this much focus on movement alone are the Mario 3D platformers — Mario 64, Mario Sunshine, Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, and Mario Odyssey. There, the focus on movement is extremely intentional. Nintendo devs will spend months polishing Mario's movement in simple, empty rooms. They only build the rest of the game when the movement feels perfect.</p><p>Miyamoto back in 1996:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Miyamoto: </strong><span>That’s how we make games at Nintendo, though: we get the fundamentals solid first, then do as much with that core concept as our time and ambition will allow.</span></p><p><strong>Interviewer: </strong><span>And in this case, that fundamental basis was the model you made with Mario and Luigi running around that room.</span></p><p><strong>Miyamoto:</strong><span> Yes, it was being able to move Mario and Luigi around with the 3D control stick, and being able to change the camera view with the press of a button. One of our big development themes was letting the players move Mario around any way they wanted. We wanted to make a game where just moving Mario around was fun.</span></p></blockquote><p>And again in 2007:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Miyamoto:</strong><span> The good part about Mario 64, was how you were able to freely move Mario around, who was now in 3D for the first time. Being very blunt about this, I actually felt at one point that this didn’t really have to be a game.</span></p><p><strong>Iwata:</strong><span> You felt that it was so fun being able to move Mario around, it didn’t need anything else.</span></p><p><strong>Miyamoto:</strong><span> Right. There was no other game before Mario 64, where you were able to truly move around freely in a 3D environment. It was great just being able to move Mario to find a star.</span></p></blockquote><p>This kind of deep, intricate movement is a fantastic match for the Metroidvania genre. There are dozens of ways to move through any single room, which means even when you're backtracking through old territory you never really feel bored. To be honest, I find myself enjoying how quickly I can move through a familiar room, deftly bouncing from one wall to the next as I make my way to my nearly-inevitable demise at the hands of some boss.</p><p>That's the other part of all this, the boss fights. Have I mentioned how difficult these boss fights are? But here too, the movement is a fantastic fit and a saving grace.</p><p><span>Difficult games are not created equal. Many games are </span><em>artificially</em><span> difficult. It's not that they require more skill or more expertise or more practice. Rather, they are poorly built, which results in unpredictable consequences. The most common example of artificial difficulty is shitty hitboxes. You expect to land on a ledge but you fall through. You think you'll dodge an attack but it hits you anyway. You fire a shot that passes through an enemy without doing anything at all.

But I have never, not a single time, felt like any of those deaths were </span><em>unfair</em><span>. Silksong's movement is so finely tuned and so precise that I know deep in my bones that any hit or death is entirely on me. Of course, that in turn makes tangible improvement extremely visible. You go into a boss fight and die, and then you die again, and then again. Each time you get a bit further, and do a few more hits. And slowly, finally, painfully, you come out on top victorious. The game does not pull any punches, so if you win it's entirely because you have developed your expertise to the point where the impossible became possible. As a result, the joy of beating a Silksong boss is perhaps unrivaled in gaming, akin to Sisyphus finally rolling his boulder up the mountain and resting while gazing at the view…only to then encounter the next boss and do it all again.</span></p><p><span>To say that Silksong is not for everyone is an understatement. Silksong is a love letter to exactly one kind of gamer: the perfectionist. You could play Silksong's predecessor, Hollow Knight, and not be all that good at it. Hollow Knight was a tough game, but I think you could get through it and fall in love with the environmental story telling and the lore and the music and characters. Silksong has all of this in spades, too, but it is so damn hard that you will not be able to </span><em>access </em><span>any of it unless you are willing to put in some serious effort. As a result, I suspect many of the people who enjoyed Hollow Knight will actually bounce off Silksong precisely because it is so hard, and they simply won't have the tenacity. You have to be motivated by mastery. You have to seek out improvement. And most of all, you have to love pain.</span></p><p>But for us few who manage to make the climb, I think it will be worth it.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/youtube-views-are-down-dont-panic">https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/youtube-views-are-down-dont-panic</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45173455">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many YouTube content creators, myself included, noticed something in early to mid-August: views were down.</p>

<p>After being on the platform since 2006 (though for me, not being a 'professional' YouTuber until about 5 years ago), I'm used to seasonal dips, adjustments after new tweaks to the algorithm or layout/design changes.</p>

<p>But this was <em>substantial</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/youtube-jeffgeerling-views-down.jpg" width="700" height="350" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-f664a6cf-27d5-4866-b3a5-93f83a8460b2" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;f664a6cf-27d5-4866-b3a5-93f83a8460b2&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="YouTube Jeff Geerling views down"></p>

<p>I had 4 10/10 videos <em>in a row</em>, which is unprecedented. I mean, my content could just be terrible all the sudden, and I've lost all but my core audience. But there are other explanations. Especially when <em>the exact same thing</em> happened to a large number of my peers on YouTube.</p>

<h2>What happened (anecdotally)</h2>

<p>For my own channels, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling">Jeff Geerling</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GeerlingEngineering">Geerling Engineering</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Level2Jeff">Level 2 Jeff</a>, the view counts on new long-form videos took an absolute nosedive sometime in early August. And they haven't recovered.</p>

<p>What's strange is the raw count of <em>likes</em> (people who watched the video and appreciated it enough to hit 'thumbs up') was consistent. And stranger still, overall <em>revenue</em> was consistent.</p>

<p>And this meant the ratio of likes per view and revenue per view went <em>way</em> up. Which, I mean... outside of finance creators and scammers (sometimes hard to distinguish the two), it's hard to break past a $3-5 RPM (revenue per mille), so I can't complain <em>there</em>.</p>

<p>But that's just my anecdata. One YouTuber's feelings aren't much to go on.</p>

<p>The problem is tons of other creators noticed the same change, for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjphsaR75Jk">DarkViperAU</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpVnx4_yqTo">Second Wind</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxZHE1LeJKXY_kVC932bugOmoulYjstt78">HAINBACH</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1Dai1Qy2eo">DankPods</a>, and more.</p>

<p>And after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqCV6Rk8kOA">discussing the problem on last week's WAN show</a>, <a href="https://x.com/BuhDan">Dan Besser from LTT</a> started analyzing the numbers for LTT and a number of other channels, seeing a strong correlation between views, likes, revenue, and other markers, with a sudden, statistically significant change, always in early August.</p>

<h2>What happened (scientifically)</h2>

<p>Go <a href="https://youtu.be/qPen-cHdYmk?&amp;t=949">watch <em>this</em> week's WAN show, starting at 15:48</a>, to see a bit more explanation, but Dan pulled the numbers for all three of my channels to correlate views and likes, to build a view:like ratio, and found a pretty surprising change—which syncs up with the same change he's noticed on a number of other channels.</p>

<p>First, my main Jeff Geerling channel:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/youtube-views-down-jeffgeerling.jpg" width="700" height="356" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-b2e69289-ac86-4b2b-9843-80f26cfbe41f" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;b2e69289-ac86-4b2b-9843-80f26cfbe41f&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Jeff Geerling - YouTube views to likes data analytics"></p>

<p>Then, Geerling Engineering:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/youtube-views-down-geerling-engineering.jpeg" width="700" height="307" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-eafa7227-8c9e-438e-98d7-37594ab6e8e6" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;eafa7227-8c9e-438e-98d7-37594ab6e8e6&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Geerling Engineering - YouTube views to likes data analytics"></p>

<p>And finally, Level 2 Jeff:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/youtube-views-down-level2jeff.jpeg" width="700" height="308" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-d77885ed-343f-451a-b661-0a1e7c01962c" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;d77885ed-343f-451a-b661-0a1e7c01962c&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Level 2 Jeff - YouTube views to likes data analytics"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to Dan from LTT for these graphs—again, go <a href="https://youtu.be/qPen-cHdYmk?&amp;t=949">check out the WAN show for more background</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think there's more to the data, and there are some creators who seem unaffected. Theories for this abound, but it doesn't seem like it's related to a 'fall off' in interested viewers for any of the affected channels. It feels a lot more like what YouTube's done before, like separating "engaged" views from "views" on Shorts, or something like that.</p>

<p>The fact that other numbers are similar in quantity, but much higher in ratio, like watch time per video, RPM, likes, etc., indicates maybe YouTube is doing an A/B test tweaking what counts for the displayed view count... or something is just broken, which is also not without precedent! But usually they announce these things beforehand.</p>

<h2>What's the problem?</h2>

<p>The <em>problem</em>, at least for many creators, is views are currently king when it comes to things like sponsorship deals, promotions, etc.</p>

<p>For <em>me</em>, it's less a problem, as I take sponsorships sparingly (see <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/youtube?tab=readme-ov-file#sponsorships">my sponsorship policies here</a>), and don't rely on that revenue for business continuity. I also have other sources of income, so even if YouTube revenue goes to $0, I will still be on my feet, financially (though I would likely have to take on a 401k job to afford health insurance).</p>

<p>For many creators, especially those who have multiple employees, debts to pay channel expenses, etc., a downturn in views could spell doom. Especially if sponsorship deals they rely on are tied to metrics like 'views per 24h' or 'views over 30/60/90 days'.</p>

<p>As an industry, marketing firms have mostly untied <em>subscriber counts</em> from ad spend decisions, since subscribers are less an indicator of channel health. Maybe this is an indication they need to adjust expectations when it comes to <em>views</em> as well...</p>

<p>Many readers of this blog think all this stuff is hogwash and meaningless anyway (the Internet was better before it was all monetized!), but it is nice to earn an income and get paid for the work I do, in the form of YouTube AdSense.</p>

<p>I, of course, don't begrudge anyone for ad blocking. And I offer all my videos in full 4K resolution downloads <a href="https://www.floatplane.com/channel/JeffGeerling/home">on Floatplane</a>—some viewers even integrate it automatially with Plex or Jellyfin, and skip YouTube entirely! I've even considered experimenting with PeerTube, but I'm not sure whether I'll test those waters or not.</p>

<p>In the end, whether you like modern YouTube or not, it view counts are down, possibly for Shorts as well (I only post one or two shorts a month, so have less data to go on there), but it's not clear why.</p>

<p>I strongly suggest following <a href="https://x.com/BuhDan">BuhDan</a> for more updates, and I'm sure there will be more discussion on future WAN shows, and around other corners of YouTube, on this matter.</p>

<p>It'd be amazing if we had even an acknowledgment of the issue from YouTube, much less an explanation...</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="what-is-chat-control">What is Chat Control?</h2>
<p>The push for Chat Control started in 2021 with the approval of a <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/chatcontrol-european-parliament-approves-mass-surveillance-of-private-communications/">derogation</a> to the ePrivacy Directive by the European Parliament. This derogation escalated to a second proposal for <em>mandatory</em> scanning a year later, which was <a href="https://fortune.com/europe/2023/10/26/eu-chat-control-csam-encryption-privacy-european-commission-parliament-johansson-breyer-zarzalejos-ernst/">rejected</a> in 2023. Nevertheless, lawmakers and lobbyists determined to undermine our safety and civil liberties are bringing it back again two years later, <strong>literally trying to wear you down</strong>.</p>
<p>We cannot let authoritarians wear us down until we lose all our privacy rights. Our privacy rights are fundamental to so many other human rights, to civil liberties, to public safety, and to functioning democracies.</p>
<p>Chat Control undermines all of this.</p>
<p>Cryptography professor and cybersecurity expert Matthew Green described the 2022 proposal document for Chat Control as "<a href="https://fortune.com/2022/05/12/europe-phone-surveillance-crackdown-child-sexual-abuse-material-sparks-outrage-among-cybersecurity-experts-privacy-activists/"><strong>the most terrifying thing I've ever seen</strong></a>".</p>
<p>And terrifying, it is.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/chat-control-criticism">most recent proposal for Chat Control</a> comes from the EU Council Danish presidency pushing for the regulation misleadingly called the Child Sexual Abuse Regulation (CSAR). Despite its seemingly caring name, this regulation will <strong>not</strong> help fight child abuse, and will even likely worsen it, impacting negatively what is already being done to fight child abuse (more on this in the <a href="#would-this-protect-the-children">next section</a>).</p>
<p>The CSAR proposal (Chat Control) could be implemented as early as <em>next month</em>, if we do not stop it. Chat Control would make it mandatory for <em>all</em> service providers (text messaging, email, social media, cloud storage, hosting services, etc.) to scan <em>all</em> communications and <em>all</em> files (including end-to-end encrypted ones), in order to supposedly detect whatever the government deems "abusive material."</p>
<p><strong>The problem is this: Chat Control will not work, it is unreliable, it will escalate in scope, and it will endanger everyone (including the children).</strong></p>
<p>Even if you are not in Europe, know that Chat Control will affect everyone inside <em>and</em> outside of Europe one way or another. Regardless of where you are, you should be concerned and pay attention, and there are things you can do to fight back. This is important.</p>
<p><a data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="Still image from a video showing an illustration of three cellphones being scanned by a red light, with lines leading to a law enforcement icon." src="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/assets/images/chat-control-must-be-stopped/chatcontrol-stopscanningme-video.webp"></a>
</p>
<h2 id="why-is-this-bad">Why is this bad?</h2>
<p>The idea that it's possible to somehow <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/04/11/encryption-is-not-a-crime/#magical-backdoor-only-for-the-good-guys-is-a-complete-fantasy">magically protect</a> information properly while giving access to unquestionably well-intended law enforcement comes from either extreme naivety, lack of information, and plain dishonesty.</p>
<p>This proposal would effectively break any end-to-end encryption protections, and potentially expose all your files and communications to not only law enforcement, but eventually also to criminals of all sorts (with the data breaches, data leaks, and corruption that will inevitably follow).</p>
<p>Here's a summary of some dangers this regulation would create if approved:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Breaking end-to-end encryption</strong>: Removing crucial protections for all sensitive files and communications of vulnerable populations, victims, whistleblowers, journalists, activists, and everyone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mission creep</strong>: Once this mass surveillance system is in place, authorities can decide to add more criteria such as searching all communications for references to drug use, protest attendances, political dissidence, or even <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/22/how-a-french-researcher-being-refused-entry-to-the-us-turned-into-a-diplomatic-mess_6739415_4.html">negative comments</a> about a leader. Europol (the EU law enforcement agency) has already called for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L933xDcSS3o&amp;t=2016s">expanding the program</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="A cartoon illustration explaining that chat control is planning to monitor all chats, emails, and messenger conversations, and use artificial intelligence to automatically report flagged content to the police." src="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/assets/images/chat-control-must-be-stopped/chatcontrol-LornaSchutte-chatcontroleu-1.webp"></a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Criminal attacks</strong>: Each time a backdoor exists, it doesn't take long for criminals to find access and steal our information. This could include criminals finding access to each service independently or to the entire database authorities would keep. A database that would be filled with material tagged as sexually explicit text or photos of children. This could even <em>create</em> new Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) for criminals. For example, consenting teenagers innocently sexting together could have their photos collected in this database, after being wrongly flagged by the automated system. Then, criminals could steal their intimate photos from the governments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>False positives</strong>: With a mass surveillance system this large, moreover a system with no transparency and little oversight, false positives are inevitable. Despite marketing promises from the <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/chat-control-eu-ombudsman-criticises-revolving-door-between-europol-and-chat-control-tech-lobbyist-thorn/">organizations lobbying government officials</a>, we all know AI technologies regularly misfire and cannot be reliable for anything of such importance. Loving parents could get flagged as pedophiles just for innocently uploading a photo of their child in the bathtub on their <em>private</em> cloud. Teenagers exploring their sexuality consensually with each other could get tagged as sexual predators (a label that might stick on them decades later). The police could receive reports for breastfeeding mothers. The list is infinite.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="A cartoon illustration summarizing why chat control is dangerous." src="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/assets/images/chat-control-must-be-stopped/chatcontrol-LornaSchutte-chatcontroleu-3.webp"></a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Overwhelming resources</strong>: The inevitable false positives will completely overwhelm the agencies responsible for investigating flagged material. This will cost them precious time they will not have to investigate <em>actual</em> abuse cases. Organizations fighting child sexual abuse are already overwhelmed and lack resources to prosecute real criminals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hurting victims</strong>: Such system of mass surveillance could prevent victims of child sexual abuse (and other crimes) to reach out for help. Knowing that all their communications would be scanned, they would lose all confidentiality while reporting crimes. The evidences they share could even be tagged by Chat Control, as if they were the perpetrator rather than the victim. Sadly, many will likely decide it's safer not to report at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-censorship</strong>: With Chat Control in place, not only victims might censor themselves and stop reaching out for help, but everyone else as well. When people know they are being observed, they feel less free to be themselves and to share openly. This is doubly true for anyone who is part of a marginalized group, such as <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/06/03/importance-of-privacy-for-the-queer-community/">LGBTQ+ people</a>, or anyone who is being victimized or at risk of victimization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="A cartoon illustration explaining how chat control does not protect the victims and might silence them due to loss of confidentiality." src="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/assets/images/chat-control-must-be-stopped/chatcontrol-LornaSchutte-chatcontroleu-2.webp"></a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Undermining democracy</strong>: This surveillance system would allow governments to spy on opposition. Chat logs from opposing candidates, activists, and journalists could all be accessed by authorities in order to silence opponents or blackmail candidates. Even if you trust your government to not do this now, this doesn't mean it could not be used in this way by the next government. We have all seen how fast the political landscape can change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Violating the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> (and other laws)</strong>: The General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) offers wonderful protections to Europeans. Sadly, Chat Control would make a complete farce of it. The Right to Erasure (right to delete) could be reduced to ashes by Chat Control, including for any highly sensitive information wrongly caught in the CSAR net. Moreover, it would <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/chat-control-criticism">violate Article 7 and Article 8</a> of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Protecting the children is only the excuse used in hope of convincing a misinformed public. <strong>Chat Control is authoritarian mass surveillance.</strong></p>
<p>Authorities understand well how important protecting communication and information is. This is why they included an exemption to protect <em>their own</em> communications, but not yours.</p>
<h2 id="would-this-protect-the-children">Would this protect the children?</h2>
<p>No.</p>
<p>This cannot be stressed enough: <strong>This regulation would not protect the children, it would <em>harm</em> the children</strong>, and everyone else too, worldwide. Claiming otherwise is either naivety, or misinformation.</p>
<p>Last year, the civil and human rights association European Digital Rights (EDRi) put together a <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/joint-statement-on-the-future-of-the-csa-regulation/">joint statement from 48 organizations</a> for children's protection, digital rights, and human rights, demanding that the European Parliament invest instead in proven strategies to fight child abuse. This appeal to reason does not seem to have been heard by most EU Member States.</p>
<p>There are many things we can do as a society to increase protections for children and fight abusers and criminals, but Chat Control is far from it all. Protection of the children is clearly only an excuse here, and a very misleading one.</p>
<p><a data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="A popular No Yes meme, with the face replaced with the European Commission logo. In the No-part is: &quot;Invest in: social workers, help for victims, support hotlines, prevention, education, targeted police work, IT-security&quot;, and in the Yes-part below is: &quot;Buy Chat Control filter technology that doesn't solve the problem&quot;." src="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/assets/images/chat-control-must-be-stopped/chatcontrol-stopscanningme-meme-4.webp"></a>
</p>
<h3 id="mislabelling-children-as-criminals">Mislabelling children as criminals</h3>
<p>First, this automated system is flawed in many ways, and the false-positive rate would likely be high. But let's imagine that, magically, the system could flag CSAM at an accuracy rate of 99%. This still means 1% of reports would be false. Expanded to the size of Europe Union's population of approximately 450 million people, exchanging likely billions of messages and files every day, this still means millions could be falsely tagged as sexual predators, with all the <a href="https://www.republik.ch/2022/12/08/die-dunklen-schatten-der-chatkontrolle">consequences</a> this implies.</p>
<p>Worse, the Swiss federal police reported that currently about 80% of all automated reports received were <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/#WhatYouCanDo">false-positives</a>. This means in reality, the error rate is likely far higher than 1%, and actually closer to an <strong>80% error rate</strong>. Of the approximate 20% of positive reports, in Germany, over 40% of investigations initiated <a href="https://www.polizei-beratung.de/aktuelles/detailansicht/straftat-verbreitung-kinderpornografie-pks-2022/">targeted children</a> themselves.</p>
<p>Sometimes, flagged content is simply teenagers innocently sexting each other consensually. Not only would they be wrongly tagged as criminals under Chat Control, but they'd be triggering an investigation that would expose their intimate photos to others.</p>
<p>Even in a magical world where Chat Control AI is 99% accurate, it would still wrongly tag and <strong>expose sensitive data from millions of children</strong>. In reality, no AI system is even remotely close to this accuracy level, and proprietary algorithms are usually opaque black boxes impossible to audit transparently. The number of children Chat Control would harm, and likely traumatize for life, would be disastrous.</p>
<h3 id="exposing-childrens-sensitive-and-sexual-information">Exposing children's sensitive and sexual information</h3>
<p>Any content that could be deemed suspicious or explicit by the system, accurately or not, would be flagged and reported.</p>
<p>When this content is reported, it will likely be uploaded to a database for human review. This means that if a teenager was sending an intimate photo of themselves to another consenting teenager, they could be flagged as sharing CSAM, even if it's their own photo. Then, their photo would be sent to the police for review. Information that should very much have stayed protected and private between these two teenagers is now exposed to strangers. This is wrong, and dangerous.</p>
<p>Even innocuous communications such as daily conversations, teenagers chatting with each other, parents reporting information about their child to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html">doctor</a>, and therapists talking with their patients, could all inadvertently expose children sensitive information. This is information that should have remained <em>private</em>, and would now be uploaded to a police database, likely <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/an-garda-siochana-unlawfully-retains-files-on-innocent-people-who-it-has-already-cleared-of-producing-or-sharing-of-child-sex-abuse-material/">stored there forever</a> with few recourses to remove it.</p>
<p>The more we collect sensitive information about children (photos, faces, locations, identifications, medical information, private chats, experiences, etc.), the more we risk exposing children to harm. This includes systems used by authorities and governments. Even if everyone with legitimate access to this data is miraculously 100% exemplary and incorruptible citizens, the databases and scanning systems will still be vulnerable to attacks from criminals and hostile governments alike.</p>
<p>The only way to protect children's information properly is to <strong>1) not collect it</strong>, and <strong>2) use end-to-end encryption to protect it</strong> when we cannot avoid collecting it. Spying on everyone and every child is the opposite of that.</p>

<p>It's impossible to perfectly secure information online. There is a lot we can do to improve security (much more than is done now), but data breaches will happen.</p>
<p>If governments mandate a backdoor to have access to all our online communication and stored files, it's inevitable that at least some criminals will eventually get access to it as well. This is even truer if this system is closed-source, <a href="https://fortune.com/europe/2023/09/26/thorn-ashton-kutcher-ylva-johansson-csam-csa-regulation-european-commission-encryption-privacy-surveillance/">privatized</a>, and isn't subjected to frequent independent audits with strong accountability.</p>
<p>Once a vulnerability is found by criminals, they will have the same access as authorities have to our data. With Chat Control, this means pretty much all our data.</p>
<p>In addition, Chat Control could facilitate the proliferation of even more spyware and <a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/">stalkerware</a> on the market, thriving on the vulnerabilities found in the powerful system. This would allow <em>anyone</em> to purchase access to spy on <em>anyone</em>, including databases of identified children. It could give a direct backdoor-access to pedophiles. How could <em>this</em> be helping to protect the children?</p>
<h3 id="the-danger-is-inside">The danger is inside</h3>
<p>Even if the idea of online strangers accessing children's sensitive data is terrifying, the worse danger in often much closer.</p>
<p>Sadly, we already know that the <a href="https://content.c3p.ca/pdfs/C3P_SurvivorsSurveyFullReport2017.pdf">vast majority</a> of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by adults close to the child, not strangers, and that two-thirds of CSAM images appear to have been <a href="https://theconversation.com/new-research-shows-parents-are-major-producers-of-child-sexual-abuse-material-153722">produced at home</a>. Chat Control would do nothing to fight this. In fact, it could facilitate it.</p>
<p>Child abuse is an incredibly important topic to discuss and to fight against as a society. Utilizing this issue as an excuse to pass a surveillance law that would endanger everyone, including the victims, is despicable.</p>
<p>When children are living with the abuser, the only escape is outside the home, and sometimes this means <em>online</em>. Abusers often use spying technologies to control and restrict access to help for their victims. If we make mass surveillance mandatory and normalized, this risks aggravating the stalkerware problem by obligating providers to implement backdoors in their systems. We would effectively be helping abusers at home to restrict access to help for their victims, including victims of CSAM. This is completely unacceptable.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-actually-help-the-children">How to actually help the children</h3>
<p>Despite the politicization of this issue to manipulate the public opinion in accepting mass surveillance, there are actually <em>proven</em> solutions to help to protect the children, online and offline.</p>
<p>First, governments should <a href="https://mogis.info/static/media/uploads/eu-libe-mogis-hahne-07032023_en.pdf">listen</a> to <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/most-criticised-eu-law-of-all-time/">organizations already doing the work</a>. Most are understaffed and under-resourced to properly support the victims and prosecute the criminals. Thousands of more reports every day would not help them do any effective work. More capacity to conduct <em>targeted</em> investigation and arrest criminals, and more capacity to create safe spaces to support the victims and witnesses will help.</p>
<p>Privacy should be the default, for everyone.</p>
<p>If all our services were using end-to-end encryption when possible, and implemented proper security and privacy features and practices, this would effectively help to protect the children as well. Abusers and criminals are looking for leaked and stolen data all the time. When a cloud photo storage gets hacked, your photos are up for grabs online, including the photos of your children. When parents upload photos of their children and their address online, and this data gets exposed (leaked, breached, AI-scraped, etc.), this data then becomes accessible to criminals.</p>
<p><strong>Better privacy protections also means better protections for the children.</strong></p>
<p>Children themselves should receive better education on how their data is used online and how to protect it. Additionally, it is vital to provide better education on what behaviors aren't normal coming from an adult, and how to reach out for help when it happens. Children should have access to safe and confidential resources to report abuse, whether it's happening outside or inside their home.</p>
<p>Parents should be careful when sharing information about their children. And when they have to, they should benefit from complete confidentiality, knowing their communication is fully end-to-end encrypted and not shared with anyone else.</p>
<p>There is so much we can do to help to protect better the children online, surveillance is the opposite of it all.</p>
<h2 id="how-would-this-affect-me">How would this affect me?</h2>
<p>If this regulation is approved on <strong>October 14th, 2025</strong> (the date for the final vote), the consequences would be devastating for everyone, even outside the European Union.</p>
<p>We have seen how platforms implemented better privacy practices and features after the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> became effective in 2018, features that often benefited people worldwide. This could have the same effect in reverse.</p>
<p>Every platform potentially handling data of people located in the EU would be subjected to the law. Platforms would be obligated to scan all communications and all files of (at least) data subjects located in the EU, even data currently protected with end-to-end encryption. This would affect popular apps and services like Signal, Tuta, Proton, WhatsApp, Telegram, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="outside-of-europe">Outside of Europe</h3>
<p>This would not only affect Europeans' data, but also the data of anyone outside communicating with someone located in the European Union. Because end-to-end encryption can only work if <strong>both</strong> ends are protected.</p>
<p>If Chat Control gets approved and applied, it will become very difficult to communicate with anyone located in the EU while keeping strong protections for your data. Many people might just accept the surveillance passively, and as a result lose their rights, their protections, and compromise their democratic processes. Overtime, this will likely lead to a slippery slope towards dystopian authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Outside of Europe, you could expect to see services removing some privacy-protective features, downgrading encryption, blocking European countries that are subjected to the law, or moving outside of Europe entirely. If localization-based scanning is too complicated to handle for an application, some companies might just decide it's simpler to scan communications for all users, worldwide.</p>
<p>Additionally, Five Eyes countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) have already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L933xDcSS3o&amp;t=2163s">expressed support</a> for Chat Control, and might be keen to try the same at home, if this gets approved and tested in Europe first.</p>
<h3 id="inside-of-europe">Inside of Europe</h3>
<p>Without using tools that would be now deemed illegal, you would lose any protections currently granted by end-to-end encryption. It would become impossible for you to send an email, a text message, or a photo without being observed by your government, and potentially also by criminals and foreign governments, following the inevitable data breaches.</p>
<p>You would have to constantly self-censor to avoid triggering the system and getting reported to the authorities. At first, you would probably just have to stop sending nudes, sexting, or sending photos of naked children in the bathtub or playing at the beach. Then, this would escalate to never mentioning drug or anything that could sound like drug, even as a joke. Later, you might have to stop texting about going to a protest, and stop organizing protests online. Further down the line, you might even have to self-censor to make sure you are not saying anything negative about a leader, or a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-resuming-student-visa-appointments-state-dept-official-says-2025-06-18/">foreign politician</a> even. This isn't that hypothetical, this sort of <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/19/china-police-big-data-systems-violate-privacy-target-dissent">oppressive surveillance</a> already exists in some countries.</p>
<p>Many services you currently rely on right now would simply shut down, or move away from Europe entirely. Businesses might also move outside of Europe if they worry about protecting their proprietary information. This could cause massive layoffs, while organizations move to jurisdictions where they are allowed to keep their data protected and unobserved.</p>
<p>Finally, even if this doesn't affect you personally, or you don't believe it will, <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/03/10/the-privacy-of-others/"><strong>this isn't just about you</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The data of vulnerable people would be exposed and their safety put at risk. Victims might decide to stop reaching out for help or reporting crimes. Sources requiring anonymity might decide the risk isn't worth reporting valuable information to journalists. Opponents of governments in power could be silenced. Every democracy in the European Union would suffer greatly from it.</p>
<p>Chat Control is completely antithetical to the values the European Union has been presenting to the world in recent years.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I used Apple Configurator to turn my iPhone into a dumb phone. I can only access the apps and websites I want to use, and it’s feeling great!</p>
<p>Compared to when I started I’m saving about 2 hours of screen time a day. If I kept this up for a month I promised to write a post about this setup. It’s now two months so here’s my post. What follows is a backstory, observations, and a how-to-guide.</p>
<p>To get straight to the how-to-guide, <a href="#how-to-guide">click here</a>.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>It’s common to rack up 4 hours or more of screen time a day on your phone. Here’s one way to see the cost of that: <strong>every 20 years, you lose 5 years of your waking time looking at your phone.</strong></p>
<p>This is what had me dreaming about the 2000s and old Nokia phones. But I couldn’t just go back to Nokia. My iPhone gave me Google Maps, Spotify, Uber and Waymo, Kindle and Audible, ChatGPT and Claude, Whatsapp, Wallet.</p>
<p>There’s real utility to iPhones. If only access to utilities didn’t mean I’d also have access to social media.</p>
<p>I often regretted my time on Twitter and Instagram. It would interrupt my flow states at work and detract from quality time with the people I loved. Even alone time suffered: instead of solitude I found myself checking for notifications. <sup id="f-1"><a href="#n-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Failed Attempts</h2>
<p>I tried and failed to fix this problem three times. Let me enumerate:</p>
<p><strong>I tried self-control but I found myself outmatched.</strong> On the surface the solution feels simple: why not just stop using distracting apps? For me using self-control here was like a hunter-gatherer using a club in open battle with a nuclear society. Social media companies spent centuries of human effort figuring out ways to get me to check my phone. If I wanted to win, I would need to use guerrilla methods.</p>
<p><strong>I tried Screen Time but it was too easy to ignore.</strong> Apple comes with Screen Time. You can set limits, but I found them useless. Once a limit runs out all you need to unlock your distracting app is to press a button. Do this a few times and you no longer notice the button.</p>
<p><strong>I tried switching phones, but couldn’t let go of the long-tail of iPhone apps.</strong> There are lots of interesting dumb phones out there. There’s some with e-ink screens that are really cool. But they only have a few apps. There was always <em>some</em> app that I missed. Even with recent Android-based dumbphones, there were still apps that were only available on the iPhone (I am looking at you Things 3).</p>
<p>If only I could keep my iPhone, but choose <em>just</em> the apps and the websites that I wanted.</p>
<h2>Apple Configurator to the rescue</h2>
<p>That’s where I discovered <a href="https://support.apple.com/apple-configurator">Apple Configurator</a>. Apple Configurator lets organizations deploy specific restrictions onto iPhones. This is what lets Apple Stores restrict the iPhones on display, so you can’t change their wallpaper to something humorous.</p>
<p>Configurator is meant for businesses, but nothing stops us from using it personally. And it’s free too!</p>
<h2>The Pros of Apple Configurator</h2>
<p>I found three advantages to using Configurator.</p>
<p>The first is that <strong>there is</strong> <strong><em>real</em></strong> <strong>friction to making changes.</strong> In order to adjust restrictions, you have to physically connect your iPhone to your laptop and open up a kludgy piece of software. This is cumbersome enough that if you have enough willpower to go through with it, you’ll be level-headed enough to not want too. <sup id="f-2"><a href="#n-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second is that <strong>you can actually disable the App Store!</strong> This is a marvelous win. Having an App Store in your home screen is like being dieter with a pastry shop in your kitchen. It’s not a good idea. So no more App Store. And combine that with content filters for websites, and you can <em>really</em> lock down your phone. When you are at your weakest, there’s effectively no way to hack around the restrictions.</p>
<p>And the final win, <strong>it’s still an iPhone.</strong> This means you can make a dumbphone that fits your needs exactly. There are some apps that sound distracting on the surface, that I just needed plain and simple. For example, my startup uses Discord to talk to users; I want to have it. I want the GitHub app. I want Things3 and Waymo. I want to access specific websites. I can set it all up so my phone is exactly the utility I need it to be.</p>
<h2>The Cons of Apple Configurator</h2>
<p>If you’re getting excited, let me prepare you with two cons.</p>
<p>The first is that <strong>you have to factory reset your iPhone.</strong> You can only set up Apple Configurator with a completely reset phone. This means the initial setup is annoying and will take you a few hours. But perhaps this a good thing too. If you go through this trouble, you’ll be even more motivated to stick with your choices.</p>
<p>The second is that <strong>getting the right setup takes a few weeks, and you may need to rely on others.</strong> When you start out you may forget an app or two (or a lot more). For example, I went to my gym the day after I set my restrictions, only to remember that they have a special iPhone to check in. You’ll have lots of little frictions like this. As you do, you’ll improve your configuration so this happens less. It’ll get better but there will still be a long-tail. Maybe you’re at a restaurant and they need you to open a website for example. You may end up having to bug some people around you for their phone. It can be annoying but I haven’t found this to be too troublesome.</p>
<h2>Observations so far</h2>
<p>So, it’s 2 months in. Here’s my experience so far:</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>It feels <em>great.</em> <strong>My phone feels like a utility.</strong> I think this is the same kind of change in feeling I would have had if I shifted from eating junk food to healthy food. My phone used to have this gravity: like invariably my attention would shift towards it. Now it just feels like a very useful rock.</p>
<p><strong>I found ChatGPT and Claude critically useful</strong>. Whenever I need some information, I can just ask my LLM, and it can give me a distraction free summary. It helps the long-tail of weird situations too: for example if someone asks me to take a look at a website, I can ask my LLM to scrape it and summarize the details for me. It’s pretty hard to get distracted this way.</p>
<p>And in the the last 2 months <strong>I have not felt the desire to remove the restrictions</strong>. This wasn’t the case with any previous setup I tried. I think it’s because the friction feels just right. I feel like I can control exactly how my phone should work; there’s just a day or two delay. The delay keeps me level-headed.</p>
<h2>The remaining issues</h2>
<p>So far the only real unsolved issue I have are related to “semi-important” apps. Consider email. I still need to have access to email, and I want to have notifications enabled so I don’t miss something truly important. But 90% of the emails I get aren’t important.</p>
<p>I am not sure what the solution is to these kind of apps. Maybe I can find a special mail app, that only shows you important emails. If I had something like this I think I would just be over the moon with this setup. <sup id="f-3"><a href="#n-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h2>The Overall</h2>
<p>I used to spend about 4 hours a day on my phone. I’m now down to about 2 hours a day. Looking at the stats, it’s 1 hour of reasonably productive apps, mixed with communication apps (my family lives in a different country, so I make long calls). Overall I don’t regret this time.</p>

<h2>The How-To Guide</h2>
<p>If you want to do this yourself, it’s going to take a 2-hour initial commitment, and about 2 weeks of tweaks to get everything set up just right.</p>
<p>In the first 2 hours, you will factory reset your phone, and set up Apple Configurator. As those two weeks progress, you’ll tweak your restrictions so you have just the apps and the websites you actually need.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s get into those first 2 hours!</p>
<h2>1. Factory reset your iPhone</h2>
<p>Time to reset your iPhone. Go to Settings → General → Transfer or Reset iPhone → Erase all content and settings.</p>
<p><img src="https://stopa.io/img/idumbphone/1_iphone.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is the first, and the scariest step. Do it, and you are on the journey 🫡</p>
<h2>2. Install Apple Configurator</h2>
<p>Now head on over to the Apple and install <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id1037126344?mt=12">Apple Configurator</a>. Open the app and click ‘Get Started’</p>
<p><img src="https://stopa.io/img/idumbphone/2_configurator_open.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h2>3. ‘Prepare’ your iPhone</h2>
<p>We can then prepare your device for configurator. Connect your iPhone to your laptop. You should see it show up in Configurator. Once you do, Right click and click “Prepare”:</p>
<p><img src="https://stopa.io/img/idumbphone/3_prepare.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Select “Manual Configuration”, with “Supervise devices” like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://stopa.io/img/idumbphone/4_prepare_manual_config.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>You can skip “Sign in to Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager”.</strong> Just press Next.</p>
<p><img src="https://stopa.io/img/idumbphone/5_prepare_skip_biz_manager.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now enter an “Organization”. Since this is just for yourself, you are an organization of one : ). I use my name:</p>
<p><img src="https://stopa.io/img/idumbphone/6_prepare_org.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In “Configure iOS Setup Assistant”, select “Don’t show any of these steps”</p>
<p><img src="https://stopa.io/img/idumbphone/7_prepare_assistant.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Click “Prepare”</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://stopa.io/img/idumbphone/8_prepare_click.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Aand you’re ready to go!</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://stopa.io/img/idumbphone/9_prepare_done.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Your phone is now ready for Configurator.</p>
<h2>4. Set up your iPhone</h2>
<p>Before we start adding restrictions, let’s set your phone up. Go through Apple’s setup, and make sure <strong>you do not restore your iPhone from an iCloud backup.</strong> This will undo the supervision stuff we just did.</p>
<p>Once you set things up, go ahead and <strong>install all the apps that you’ll need</strong>. As a way to jog your memory, here are the apps that I ended up installing:</p>

<p>Now it’s time to set up your restrictions! You’ll create a new Configurator ‘Profile’.</p>
<p>Click ‘File’ → ‘New Profile’.</p>
<p>You’ll make three changes</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>Under ‘General’: For ‘Security’ and ‘Automatically Remove Profile’, set ‘Never’:</p>
<p><img src="https://stopa.io/img/idumbphone/10_config_general.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>Content Filter</h3>
<p>Head on over to ‘Content Filter’, and click ‘Configure’. For ‘Filter Type’, select “Specific Websites only”:</p>
<p><img src="https://stopa.io/img/idumbphone/11_config_content_filter.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Enter some of the sites you want to use. To jog your memory, here are some sites I added:</p>

<span>-</span> https://instantdb.com</span></pre></div><h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>‘Restrictions’ are where we will disable the App Store. Click on ‘Restrictions’ → ‘Configure’.</p>
<p>Keep everything as it is, <strong>just uncheck ‘Allow Installing Apps’</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://stopa.io/img/idumbphone/12_config_restrictions.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With that, save your profile. Once we install this profile on your phone…you’re done.</p>
<h2>6. Add your profile!</h2>
<p>So let’s install this profile to your iPhone.</p>
<p>Right click your phone on Configurator, hit ‘Add’ → ‘Profiles’, pick your profile, and you’re ready to go!</p>
<p><img src="https://stopa.io/img/idumbphone/13_add_profile.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>When you load your phone, you should no longer see an App Store!</strong></p>
<h2>An on/off switch</h2>
<p>After a while you may realize you need to install some new apps. When you want to do that, connect your phone, ‘Right click’ → ‘Remove’ → ‘Profile’</p>
<p><img src="https://stopa.io/img/idumbphone/14_remove_profile.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once you remove your profile, you’re back to a restrictionless world. Make all the changes you need, and then add it back.</p>
<h2>Fin</h2>
<p>And with that, you have an iPhone dumbphone! I hope it’s as useful for you as it has been for me.</p>
<p>If you follow the instructions and have any issues or changes to make, please send me an email.</p>

<p><em>Thanks to Ilia Parunashvili for trying the original instructions I wrote out and providing screenshots.</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks to Alex Kotliarskyi, Alex Reichert, Daniel Woelfel, Jacky Wang, Nicole Garcia Fischer, for reviewing drafts of this essay.</em></p>
<p><a id="n-1" href="#f-1">[1]</a> Let the record show I don’t think these apps are useless. I made friends on Twitter, heck I worked at Facebook for 4 years. I just think these are tools better used in moderation. But it’s hard to use them in moderation on your phone.</p>
<p><a id="n-2" href="#f-2">[2]</a> And if you already have your laptop handy, there’s an easier fix for your distraction: just use your laptop to check Twitter.</p>
<p><a id="n-3" href="#f-3">[3]</a> My friend Alex Kotliarskyi mentioned I could try using Google’s App Script to talk to an LLM and filter emails. This could be cool!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/backups-header.png" alt="Two Android phones against a light-blue background showing Signal secure backups, allowing the user to opt in to create a secure backup archive of messages and media."></p><p>In the past, if you broke or lost your phone, your Signal message history was gone. This has been a challenge for people whose most important conversations happen on Signal. Think family photos, sweet messages, important documents, or anything else you don’t want to lose forever. This explains why the most common feature request has been backups; a way for people to get Signal messages back even if their phone is lost or damaged.</p><p>After careful design and development, we are now starting to roll out secure backups, an opt-in feature. This first phase is available in the latest beta release for Android. This will let us further test this feature in a limited setting, before it rolls out to iOS and Desktop in the near future.</p><p>Here, we’ll outline the basics of secure backups and provide a high-level overview about how they work and how we built a system that allows you to recover your Signal conversations while maintaining the highest bar for privacy and security.</p><h2 id="secure-backups-101">Secure Backups 101</h2><p>Secure backups let you save an archive of your Signal conversations in a privacy-preserving form, refreshed every day; giving you the ability to restore your chats even if you lose access to your phone. Signal’s secure backups are opt-in and, of course, end-to-end encrypted. So if you don’t want to create a secure backup archive of your Signal messages and media, you never have to use the feature.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>If you do decide to opt in to secure backups, you’ll be able to securely back up all of your text messages<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and the last 45 days’ worth of media<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> for free.</p><p>If you want to back up your media history beyond 45 days<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, as well as your message history, we also offer a paid subscription plan for US$1.99 per month.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p><p>This is the first time we’ve offered a paid feature. The reason we’re doing this is simple: media requires a lot of storage, and storing and transferring large amounts of data is <a href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-is-expensive/">expensive</a>. As a nonprofit that refuses to collect or sell your data, Signal needs to cover those costs differently than other tech organizations that offer similar products but support themselves by selling ads and monetizing data.</p><h2 id="anatomy-of-secure-backups-privacy-first-always">Anatomy of Secure Backups: Privacy First, Always</h2><p>At Signal, our commitment to privacy informs which features we build and the ways that we build them.</p><p>Using the same zero-knowledge <a href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-private-group-system/">technology</a> that enables Signal groups to work without revealing intimate metadata, backup archives are stored without a direct link to a specific backup payment or Signal user account.</p><p>At the core of secure backups is a 64-character recovery key that is generated on your device. This key is yours and yours alone; it is never shared with Signal’s servers.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> <strong>Your recovery key is the only way to “unlock” your backup when you need to restore access to your messages. Losing it means losing access to your backup permanently, and Signal cannot help you recover it.</strong> You can generate a new key if you choose. We recommend storing this key securely (writing it down in a notebook or a secure password manager, for example).</p><p>These choices are part and parcel of Signal’s guiding mission to collect as close to no data as possible, and to make sure that any information that is required to make Signal robust and usable cannot be tied back to the people who depend on Signal.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> This is why wherever there’s a choice between security and any other objective, we’ve prioritized security.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p><h2 id="enabling-secure-backups">Enabling Secure Backups</h2><p>If you want to opt in to secure backups, you can do so from your Signal Settings menu. For now, only people running the latest <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-Signal-Beta">beta version</a> of Signal on Android will be able to opt in. But soon, we’ll be rolling this feature out across all platforms.</p><p>Once you’ve enabled secure backups, your device will automatically create a fresh secure backup archive every day, replacing the previous day’s archive.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Only you can decrypt your backup archive, which will allow you to restore your message database (excluding <a href="https://signal.org/blog/view-once/">view-once messages</a> and messages scheduled to <a href="https://signal.org/blog/disappearing-messages/">disappear</a> within the next 24 hours). Because your secure backup archive is refreshed daily, anything you deleted in the past 24 hours, or any messages set to disappear are removed from the latest daily secure backup archive, as you intended.</p><h2 id="backing-up-moving-forward">Backing up, moving forward</h2><p>We’re excited to introduce secure backups, making sure you can retain access to your Signal messages even when your phone is lost or destroyed. But secure backups aren’t the end of the road.</p><p>The technology that underpins this initial version of secure backups will also serve as the foundation for more secure backup options in the near future. Our future plans include letting you save a secure backup archive to the location of your choosing, alongside features that let you transfer your encrypted message history between Android, iOS, and Desktop devices.</p><p>Secure backups are available in today’s Android beta release. A full public release, along with iOS and Desktop support, is coming soon.</p></div></div>]]></description>
