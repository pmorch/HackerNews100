        <h2 id="hetzner-raises-prices">Hetzner raises prices<a href="#hetzner-raises-prices" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>This morning I received an email from Hetzner stating that they are raising prices in the US while significantly reducing bandwidth.</p>
<p>The largest price percentage increase is <strong>27.52%</strong> for <strong>CPX21</strong> servers, and the smallest is <strong>4.17%</strong> for <strong>CX3+</strong> servers.</p>
<p>Bandwidth allotments are decreasing on average, across all products, <strong>88.19%</strong> from previous allotments.</p>
<p>I’ve been a big fan of Hetzner. Unfortunately they’ve made a feeble attempt to dress this change up in the name of “fairness”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the new tariff structure, we want to make conditions for our customers around the world as fair as possible … Until this change, customers who have used fewer resources have covered the costs, in a way, for other customers who have used much more resources. We want to make things more balanced. The new prices will give our customers the best possible price for the resources they use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hetzner</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d love to see a better explanation for why prices are increasing <em>so much</em> in exchange for such a significant drop in bandwidth allotments. A lot of Hetzner customers cite generous bandwidth allotments as one of the reasons they’ve chosen Hetzner as a provider. As far as I can tell, that generosity has evaporated in the great US of A.</p>
<p>And the fact that this was announced on Thanksgiving Day, a major holiday in the US, certainly deserves a dishonorable mention.</p>
<h2 id="update">Update<a href="#update" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Now that I’ve looked at my invoice, Hetzner’s price change and justification is even more frustrating.</p>
<p>

<p>I personally use <code>0TB</code> per month across 6 <code>CPX21</code> servers (I know I’m over-provisioned; that’s not the point). The point is I’ve been paying <code>€42.30 + €1.00/mo</code> for <code>20TB</code> of bandwidth, of which I’ve used zero on average. What Hetzner’s statement tells me is that even at that price, I was subsidizing some heavy users. And to thank me for it, I can now pay <code>€53.94/mo</code> in exchange for <code>12TB</code>, for fairness.</p>

<p>From the updated bandwidth and pricing table provided in Hetzner’s email, here are the price changes for CCX and CPX servers in Ashburn and Hillsboro.</p>

<p>Dear Adriano Caloiaro</p>

<p>We are writing to inform you about important changes to the tariff 
structure of our Cloud servers (CCX and CPX lines) and our Load balancers at 
our US locations in Ashburn and Hillsboro.</p>

<h4>What will change?</h4>

<p>Starting on 1 December 2024, 01:00 am CET, we will begin charging new 
prices for newly-created Cloud servers and introduce new amounts for included 
traffic for Cloud Servers and Load balancers at the US locations in Ashburn 
(ASH) and Hillsboro (HIL). This also applies to existing Cloud servers and 
Load balancers that are switched to a different tariff using the 
“Rescale” function. For any existing Cloud servers and Load balancers you 
have at these locations, the new prices and the new amounts for included 
traffic will apply later, starting on 1 February 2025, 01:00 am CET. The 
price for traffic overage will remain unchanged in the new price 
structure.</p>

<p>What are the new prices and amounts of included traffic?</p>

<p>Below, you can see a list of the old and new prices and the included 
traffic.

</tbody></table>
All monthly prices are excl. VAT and excl. IPv4 addresses.

<h4>Why are we making these changes?</h4>

<p>With the new tariff structure, we want to make conditions for our 
customers around the world as fair as possible. To do that, we will calculate 
our prices based on local conditions in Europe, Singapore, and the USA. Until 
this change, customers who have used fewer resources have covered the costs, 
in a way, for other customers who have used much more resources. We want to 
make things more balanced. The new prices will give our customers the best 
possible price for the resources they use.</p>

<h4>What else do I need to know?</h4>

<p>Displayed prices and included traffic on Cloud Console</p>

<p>For technical reasons, we will display the new prices and amounts of 
included traffic on the Cloud server and Load balancer detail pages on Cloud 
Console starting on 1 December 2024. This will also be true for your existing 
Cloud servers and Load balancers. However, the invoice will still be issued 
according to the previous conditions. A corresponding note will be displayed 
for your existing affected products. On the invoice preview on the 
“Usage” page, you will see the correct existing price for your existing 
servers.</p>

<p>Displayed prices on the Cloud API</p>

<p>In the transition time period between 1 December 2024 and 1 February 2025, 
the Cloud API will already return the new prices and included traffic. This 
will also be true for your existing Cloud servers and Load balancers. But 
this will only affect the display here. The invoice preview will display the 
correct existing price. And of course, your invoice itself will be for the 
correct existing price.</p>

<p>Traffic warning</p>

<p>You may see early traffic warnings during the transition time period 
starting on 1 December 2024 for your existing Cloud servers and Load 
balancers. Please note that the previous traffic included for existing Cloud 
servers and Load balancers remains valid until 31 January 2025.</p>

<p>If you do not agree with this adjustment, you can cancel the affected 
products at any time. We ask for your understanding for why we are making 
these changes. We truly believe that we can continue to offer you our Cloud 
Servers and features at the best price-performance ratio despite these 
adjustments.</p>

<p>We will be happy to answer any questions you may have. Please write us a 
support request using your account on Cloud Console at <a href="https://console.hetzner.cloud/support">https://console.hetzner.cloud/support</a></p>

<p>Thank you for your trust and support.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>Around nine years ago I published Ninja, a build system that is
mostly comparable to Make.  At the time <a href="https://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2011/02/ninja.html">I was a bit embarrassed to
share my side
project</a>
but since then it has become widely popular.</p>
<p>I can't list all of the users off the top of my head anymore, but some
of the "big" projects that use Ninja include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome, which eventually removed all of its non-Ninja builds;</li>
<li>Android, which uses it for some large component of the system that
I've never quite understood;</li>
<li>all <a href="https://mesonbuild.com/">Meson</a> projects, which appears to
increasingly be the build system used in the free software world;</li>
<li>many other projects that that use Ninja with CMake (for one
random example, the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift#system-requirements">build instructions for the Swift programming
language</a> tell you
to install Ninja).</li>
</ul>
<p>Ninja has been by far my most successful open source project,
depending on how you quantify success.  (Other projects of mine like
Chrome have more users, but I was responsible for only parts of
Chrome; Ninja also has had important contributions by collaborators
but it feels more like "mine".)  I released Ninja in 2011, gave
ownership of the Ninja project away in 2014, and it has since been
passed on again to a third maintainer, so now that my part in the
story is pretty much over I here would like to reflect on what I
learned.</p>
<p>If I were to summarize what I learned in a single sentence, it would
be this: we talk about programming like it is about writing code, but
the code ends up being less important than the architecture, and the
architecture ends up being less important than social issues.</p>
<p>That is, as programmers we like to talk about problems as if they are
primarily technical — "how do I optimize this loop to squeeze more
qps out of this service?" — when in my experience the tech almost
always ends up secondary to bigger picture factors.  I have since seen
that same observation in other words stated by many others as
describing the journey from a "junior" to "senior" engineer which also
rings very true against my career, so I also hope in this
retrospective to give some insight into what that means.</p>
<h2>The tech</h2>
<p>Let's start by getting some technical details out of the way.</p>
<p>What Ninja specifically does is pretty simple; given a description of
the requirements, I'd expect a competent undergrad, perhaps in a
systems course, to be able to bang out a basic version of it without
much help.  To summarize, the user gives Ninja a <code>ninja.build</code> file
which (omitting some details) contains all the commands you'd like
Ninja to run, along with which files each command consumes and
produces.  Ninja loads this file, checks the modification timestamps
of the various files, and executes in parallel the commands needed to
bring everything up to date.  As compared to Make (which does pretty
much the same thing) Ninja provides <em>fewer</em> features in its input
build language, and is primarily structured around making the few
things it does very fast.</p>
<p>The few things Ninja does are: (1) parse and interpret that build
file; (2) check the modification times of its inputs; (3) execute the
needed commands.  The goal is to get to step 3 as fast as possible
even on huge (&gt;100k input files) projects, and doing so is a
collection of careful but small optimizations. For one small example,
Ninja is careful to map each input file path to a unique in-memory
object as early as possible, and then on it uses pointer comparisons
between those objects for testing path equality (interned strings,
effectively).  I wrote a chapter for the book "The Performance of Open
Source Software" about Ninja that tells some of the stories of the
lower level technical details of making that fast which <a href="https://www.aosabook.org/en/posa/ninja.html">you can read
online</a>.</p>
<p>Many people have done rewrites of Ninja over the years.  It's a small
enough project that it's fun to try implementing in your favorite
language.  For some examples,
<a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-llbuild">llbuild</a> and
<a href="https://shakebuild.com/">Shake</a> both support Ninja files as inputs,
and <a href="https://github.com/michaelforney/samurai">samurai</a> is a nearly
file-by-file reimplementation (with less code, but with fewer features
and no tests(!)). Ninja is pretty easy to implement for the fun 20% of
it and the remaining 80% is "just" some fiddly details.  To my
knowledge nobody has ever made a faster implementation.</p>
<h2>Some architecture notes</h2>
<p>Some pieces of Ninja took struggle to get to and then are obvious in
retrospect.  I think this is true of much of math, that once you have
distilled the ideas to their essence they seem obvious. The power
comes from having the right way of thinking about the problem.  I
mostly stumbled through Ninja's design but once I was on the other
side of it I came to see I accidentally hit some good points in the
design space.  Here are a few examples.</p>
<p><strong>The graph representation</strong>.  Make doesn't well handle the case when
build rules produce multiple files.  I don't know how Make is
structured internally, but I would guess that it represents the build
structure as a graph between files since that is what the input syntax
looks like and that structure would generate that behavior.  Ninja
instead uses a bipartite graph between files and commands, where file
nodes are edges into command nodes which have edges back out to files.
This representation better captures the structure of builds: the
command is out of date if any of its inputs change, and it updates all
its outputs when it runs.  (The one graph invariant is that a given
file may have at most one input edge.)  For another consequence of
this, note that the command line itself can be thought of as an input
to command nodes, in that the command is out of date (and consequently
so are its outputs) if the command-line flags change.</p>
<p><strong>The deps log</strong>.  To get C header dependencies right you need to
consume additional dependency data produced by the C compiler.  It's
described more in <a href="https://www.aosabook.org/en/posa/ninja.html">the book chapter</a>. I recall struggling with
whether to bring in a database and how to reconcile that with my
aspirations of simplicity until I finally hit upon a <a href="https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/blob/master/src/deps_log.h#L29">representation
format</a>
that ended up pretty tight.  (It's unfortunately still wrong in some
important ways but oh well.)</p>
<p><strong>End-to-end / crash-only</strong>.  Ninja is not a persistent daemon process
but instead does all its work from scratch on each execution.  This
is intentional and a mixture of the insights of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">the end-to-end
principle</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash-only_software">crash only
software</a>, which
is to say: given that you need to run Ninja from scratch sometimes,
if you make that fast, then you don't need to build a second "online"
codepath.  Projects that can stay memory-resident tend to eventually
let their startup performance languish.</p>
<p><strong>File status</strong>.  The reason programmers sometimes expect build tools to
be memory resident is so they can cache status about files on disk.
But in practice, the kernel is already caching this information in
memory and caching it again in userland doesn't save you much;
fetching file status from Linux is extremely fast.  Ninja does it all
from a single thread even.  On a machine that was "fast" ten years
ago you can <a href="https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Timing-Numbers">stat 30k files in 10s of
milliseconds</a>.
(A programming joke: half of performance problems are fixed by
introducing a cache; the other half are fixed by removing one.)</p>
<p><strong>Orders of magnitude</strong>.  A rule of thumb is that you can get scale by
2x with optimization, but to scale by 10x you need to rearchitecture.
Ninja was designed around Chrome's build which at the time had around
30k build steps.  These days it's used in much smaller settings where
it's likely not needed (see below discussion on speed) and in larger
settings like the Android build where it is failing to scale and will
likely need an alternative approach.</p>
<p><strong>Underspecifying and overspecifying</strong>.  Ninja executes commands in
parallel, so it requires the user to provide enough information to get
that correct. But at the other extreme, it also doesn't mandate that
it has a complete picture of the build. You can see one discussion of
this dynamic <a href="https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/issues/1303">in this bug in
particular</a> (search
for "evmar" to see my comments).  You must often compromise between
correctness and convenience or performance and you should be
intentional when you choose a point along that continuum.  I find some
programmers are inflexible when considering this dynamic, where it's
somehow obvious that one of those concerns dominates, but in my
experience the interplay is pretty subtle; for example, a tool that
trades off correctness for convenience might overall produce a more
correct ecosystem than a more correct but less convenient alternative,
if programmers end up avoiding the latter.  (That could be <a href="https://neugierig.org/software/blog/2011/10/why-not-haskell.html">one reason
Haskell isn't more
successful</a>.
Now that I work in programming languages I see this dynamic play out
regularly.)</p>
<p>And finally, the biggest architectural insight is:</p>
<h2>The 'assembler' metaphor</h2>
<p>When people think of build systems they think of a broad range of
features, so broad that often the way build systems talk about
themselves sometimes aren't even comparable across different tools.
The marketing text for these tools often talks about how user-friendly
the input syntax is.</p>
<p>Ninja's insight (discovered in retrospect) is that all of these tools,
no matter the high-level features, ultimately eventually must
construct some sort of graph of the <em>actions</em>: the files they intend
to keep up to date and which commands to execute.  Ninja only
implements that action graph and leaves it to the user to choose
another "generator" program on top.</p>
<p>I originally invented this two program split just because it neatly
fit into the project (Chrome) I was working on at the time, but I have
since come to see it as Ninja's primary contribution.</p>
<p>On one side, it allowed me to make Ninja stupid but quick, because
anything costly (such as "glob for *.c") is forced into the generator.
Compared to other build systems that do all the work in one pass,
Ninja's design effectively forces you to "snapshot" the action graph
to disk once you've computed it.  Another way to look at this is that
it effectively has you cache the action graph across builds.</p>
<p>On the other side, it also meant Ninja was useful in very flexible
ways, because the generator could be as high level as the user wanted
("tests are found by globbing the entire source tree for files with
'test' in their name").  Importantly, it forced the developer who used
Ninja to decide what they were going to pay for.  If their generator
program wanted to glob all over the disk looking for files, it was
welcome to, but then it would be more obvious to them why their builds
were slow.</p>
<p>(I should note here that a clean separation between a generator and
the resulting action graph is not as easy as I make it out to be.
Ninja ultimately has a lot of fiddly details that are all struggling
around which layer the work belongs in, but it's hard to write up the
lessons learned.)</p>
<p>The irony of this aspect of Ninja's design is that there is nothing
preventing anyone else from doing this.  Xcode or Visual Studio's
build systems (for example) could just as well do the same thing: do a
bunch of work up front, then snapshot the result for quick
reexecution.  I think the reason so few succeed at this is that it's
just too tempting to mix the layers.</p>
<p>Ninja's closest relative is Make, which attempts to encompass all of
this programmer-facing functionality (with globbing, variable
expansions, substringing, functions, etc.) that resulted in a
programming language that was too weak to express all the needed
features (witness autotools) but still strong enough to let people
write slow Makefiles.  This is vaguely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule">Greenspun's tenth
rule</a>, which
I strongly attempted to avoid in Ninja.</p>
<h2>Defaults dominate</h2>
<p>By default, Ninja executes the desired commands in parallel.  Make is
capable of this too; Ninja borrows the same flag name for this
capability (<code>-j</code>) and just uses a different default value.  However,
because Make defaulted to running commands serially, it is relatively
easy to write a Makefile that underspecifies dependencies such that it
is unsafe to execute it in parallel.  In fact, there's even some
commercial vendor that offers some sort of "Makefile accelerator" tool
that helps people discover and repair underspecified dependencies.</p>
<p>In contrast, because Ninja always executes commands in parallel (even
on a single-core system) it ends up revealing mistakes like these
earlier.  This means that programs that build with Ninja typically end
up safe to build in parallel.  (Ninja has no fancy system for
detecting when you've gotten things wrong, it just causes wrong builds
more often.)  In contrast, users often forget or are unaware of the
flag to Make that makes it also run in parallel.  It is embarrassing
to take credit for this because it's just a flag, but just because of
its default value, Ninja in practice will end up being "twice as fast
as Make" or more for users who aren't careful.  The lesson is that all
the optimization in the world doesn't matter if your users don't
actually see it.</p>
<h2>Speed</h2>
<p>In this post I have talked about performance a few times, and it's
important to note that there are lots of different kinds of
performance metrics to care about in a build system.  For example, one
might care "how long does the build take when I start from scratch?"
Ninja was solely focused on the edit-compile cycle of <em>incremental</em>
builds in large codebases, which is to say you've run a build, you've
edited one file, and you run the next build.</p>
<p>When I wrote Ninja, I had a memory of blaze (aka
<a href="https://bazel.build/">bazel</a>) being very fast, but it had been years
since I had last used it.  Because of this memory, I kept trying to
make Ninja even faster, to try to catch up with my memory of blaze.
Ironically it turns out blaze is not particularly fast on the speed
metric I cared about; because blaze is a Java program, even having
blaze print its "help" output is pretty slow.</p>
<p>It is maybe silly of me to fixate on incremental builds, but I
strongly believe that iteration time has a huge impact on programmer
satisfaction, and Ninja is used exactly in the edit-compile loop where
the difference of 1 second and 4 seconds is critical.  I think I am
personally more latency-sensitive than the average programmer, but I
also believe that programmers <em>feel</em> latency and it affects their mood
even if they don't notice it.  (Google has recently done some research
in this area that kinda confirmed my belief, here's hoping they'll
publish it publicly!)</p>
<p>It is very difficult to communicate to users the many possible
meanings of "fast".  The Ninja manual tries to warn people away from
using it on small programs. Literally the <a href="https://ninja-build.org/manual.html#_using_ninja_for_your_project">second paragraph after the
introduction</a>
says "If your project is small, Ninja's speed impact is likely
unnoticeable" and recommends using a different build system.
Unfortunately "fast" sells, and the Ninja list often had users trying
to use it for their miniature apps and getting frustrated by its lack
of features.</p>
<p>Though Ninja focused on incremental rebuild performance, some users
reported that Ninja improved their end-to-end build performance too.
This was unintentional, but is because Ninja (again by virtue of doing
nearly nothing) consumes very little CPU while running those builds,
while comparable programs for whatever reason consume more CPU while
running and that takes CPU away from the underlying build.</p>
<p>In my post <a href="https://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2010/05/fast.html">"What does it mean for a browser to be
fast"</a>
I go into how there are many aspects to speed, and that ultimately
what's important is the user's <em>perception</em> of speed.  Ninja is very
terse in its output: for most successful builds, it prints a single
line.  In contrast, other build systems tend to print a bunch of
(often gratuitously colored) output with timing numbers about the
various stages of the build it's going through, which makes them feel
heavy.  Ninja, by virtue of saying little, makes it feel even more
like it's not there.</p>
<h2>CMake</h2>
<p>I originally built Ninja to work with Chrome's wacky one-off build
system and left it at that.  Somehow a kind stranger named Peter
Collingbourne found Ninja and did the work to plug it into the much
more popular CMake build system.  Ninja's design fits well into CMake,
but there were (as always) a lot of details to work out and Peter did
most of this, initially to use Ninja to work on LLVM.  This was more
than just CMake, but also required building new semantics into Ninja.
If anyone is responsible for making Ninja succeed out there in the
real world, Peter is due the credit.</p>
<p>The CMake authors eventually took over this integration and I feel bad
about how poorly I supported them; they were very kind and patient
with me but I never really had the time to answer their requests or
concerns.  Brad, if you read this, I am very sorry!  To this day I've
never actually used CMake and I never could find the time to worry
about it.</p>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>Because the motivating project for Ninja was Chrome and Chrome targets
Windows too, we got it working on Windows.  (This was another part of
Ninja that was primarily written by <a href="http://h4ck3r.net/">a
contributor</a>.)</p>
<p>At a technical level, supporting Windows is mostly a big hassle.  In
the places where the Linux code doesn't work as is, it requires either
uninteresting abstractions or major redesigns.  For an example of the
former, spawning processes and capturing their output is very
different between the platforms, but mostly in that you need to learn
a totally different API.  For an example of the latter, Ninja's design
centrally relies on the property that you can get a kernel-cached
file's last modification time quickly, and that is <a href="https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Timing-Numbers">just not true on
Windows</a>.</p>
<p>But Windows is still a huge platform in terms of developers, and those
developers are starved for tools.  The underlying dynamic is that when
someone makes a neat tool for Linux, the impulse is to share it, but
when they do so for Windows, the impulse is to sell it, and so because
of that there aren't as many tools freely available on Windows.</p>
<p>It was a surprise to me how many of the early Ninja users were Windows
users, but in retrospect it is kind of obvious: even if only one in a
hundred Windows developers cared about Ninja, there are so many people
on Windows that they would eventually show up.  (Sometimes in the
Linux Chrome early days we talked about it this way: even if we got
~all desktop Linux users using Chrome, in terms of total humans that's
only like getting an additional 5% of Windows users.  You can disagree
with the specific value of that number but hopefully you get my
point.)</p>
<h2>Related work</h2>
<p>I mentioned that I stumbled through Ninja's design.  I regret not
spending more time researching before building, but I intended the
whole project as just a weekend demo hack, not a serious thing.
(Relatedly, please forgive me for the embarrassing name.)  Since then
I have come to appreciate how important it is to actually understand
the design space when building a thing.  I now find myself noticing
how rare it is for programmers to discuss related work and it now
drives me mad.</p>
<p>The term I used above ("action graph") is not how I thought about it
in Ninja, but is instead taken from Google's build system
("blaze"/"bazel").  In bazel, they explicitly talk about how there's a
graph of targets (higher-level user concepts like "library" and
"binary") and how that generates a <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-overview.html#how-does-bazel-work">graph of actions
(commands)</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote above a bit about how the command-line text can be viewed as
an 'input' to commands in the same way that files are.  This is a
specific instance of the broader concept of incremental computation,
which covers not only build systems but also incrementality in UI.  My
friend <a href="https://twitter.com/radokirov">Rado</a> has been reading the
research in this area for the past year or so(!) and is working on a
series of blog posts that attempt to summarize it; watch for it.  The
Jane Street blog has had <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/introducing-incremental/">some work on summarizing this area
too</a>; as you can
see there, there's even a connection to our recent renaissance in UI
construction as found in React.</p>
<p>The fantastic paper <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/build-systems-final.pdf">"Build Systems à la
Carte"</a>
discusses incremental computation in the context of build systems.  I
wish this paper had existed before I wrote Ninja.</p>
<h2>Open source</h2>
<p>I'd like to wrap this up by talking a bit about being an open source
maintainer.  As you might have read elsewhere, it ends up not being
especially fun.  (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_4EX4dPppA">This talk "The Hard Parts of Open
Source"</a> is worth your
time.)</p>
<p>When I try to take stock of my overall feelings about the project, it
is a mixture of the occasional pride when I see someone on proggit or
HN say something nice about it and a larger overall sense of
disappointment.</p>
<p>I made this thing that I thought was cool and I gave it away, and what
I got back were occasionally friendly people who nicely requested
things from me, but more often angry users who demanded things of me,
and rarely anyone saying thanks.  People repeatedly threatened to fork
the project when I didn't agree to their demands, never once
considering the possibility that I had more context on the design
space than they did.</p>
<p>A different source of sadness were the friendly and intelligent people
who made reasonable-seeming contributions that conflicted with my
design goals, where I wanted to repay their effort with a thorough
explanation about why I was turning them down, and doing that was
itself exhausting.</p>
<p>I got into programming via free software, and I wrote code with the
desire to give back to the people who gave me so much.  (If you are
reading this post then I predict you are benefiting from one or more
one of my free software contributions.)  But today I see
that free software is not really about sharing between equals anymore;
people instead think of themselves as customers and treat authors as
if they can go complain to the manager.</p>
<p>Another way of saying this is that today I am motivated by just trying
to impress or live up to the ~ten hackers that I admire, people like
apenwarr or agl or bradfitz or graydon, and while it's occasionally
cool to meet someone and have the reputation of my software precede
me, I think a lot of "succeeding" was mostly just kind of a burden.  I
think I could have learned about as much with a much smaller fraction
of the success.</p>
<h2>Final acknowledgements</h2>
<p>I mentioned a few people already in this post, but I'd like to also
specifically thank Nico Weber, both for being a careful collaborator
and for taking on maintainership of Ninja for years, and also Jan
Niklas Hasse, who took over after Nico and whom I don't know at all
but who seems to be doing a fine job.  And finally, thanks to the many
other <a href="https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/graphs/contributors">authors of
Ninja</a>.</p>

<p>At a glance, the variety of these designs can be overwhelming, but it's clear that some of these interfaces look far more chaotic than others. Most interfaces in our world contain a blend of digital screens and analog inputs like switches and dials. These LEGO panels are no different.</p>

<p>Plotting the panels across these two axes reveals a few different clusters. Screens with an accompanying row of buttons sit in the top left. A small cluster of very organised switch panels lies to the far right. The centre bottom is occupied by some wild concepts that are hard to understand, even after several glances.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/positioning.jpg" alt="Design positioning with LEGO, in LEGO" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Design positioning with LEGO, in LEGO</figcaption></figure>

<p>Designing a complex machine interface is a juggling act of many different factors from ergonomics to engineering. But we can break down the problem into two key questions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>How can we <strong>differentiate</strong> between the function of different inputs?</li>
	<li>How can we <strong>organise</strong> the many inputs and outputs so that we understand how they relate to each other?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's take a deeper look at tackling these two challenges in LEGO.</p>

<h2>Differentiating inputs</h2>

<p>What could cause 400 WWII pilots to raise the landing gear on their B-17 bomber just before touchdown? Catastrophic pilot error, or something more fundamental?</p>

<p>It was the psychologist Alphonse Chapanis who first suggested that the high rate of crash landings might be the fault of poor interface design. The adjacent landing gear and flap control knobs were identically shaped. The pilots never stood a chance.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/landing.jpg" alt="B-17 belly landing, and the shape coding that helped to eradicate the problem. Source: Wikipedia" loading="lazy"><figcaption>B-17 belly landing, and the shape coding that helped to eradicate the problem. Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure>

<p>His temporary solution was to glue differently shaped strips of rubber to each switch, enabling blind operation by touch alone. This gave rise to the idea of shape coding and a system of differentiation still being followed in aircraft cockpits today.</p>

<p>We can compare the three interfaces below to see this in action. Ignore the overall layout, it's the differences between individual switches that matter here. Imagine trying to feel for one of these buttons without looking. The left panel ("Slope 45 2 x 2 with 12 Buttons") would require careful hand-eye co-ordination. The right panel ("Aircraft Multiple Flight Controls") clearly distinguishes between the throttle (large, linear vertical movement), toggle switches (round vertical flick) and the push buttons (square push-in). </p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/differentiation.jpg" alt="Left to right: terrible, poor and better input differentiation" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Left to right: terrible, poor and better input differentiation</figcaption></figure>

<p>Differentiation like this is a still a very real problem today. In 2015, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2015/01/06/autos/ford-push-button-ignition-recall/index.html">Ford recalled 13,500 Lincoln SUVs</a> because drivers speeding down the motorway were mistakenly shutting off the engine when they tried to activate sport mode. See if you can spot why:</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/ford-lincoln.jpg" alt="Ford Lincoln MKC before the Engine start/stop button was moved. Source: CNN" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Ford Lincoln MKC before the Engine start/stop button was moved. Source: CNN</figcaption></figure>

<p>Shape coding is one approach to differentiation, but there are many others. Colour coding is perhaps the only one to break into our everyday vocabulary, but we can add four more: size, texture, position and operation coding. Together these six are our allies in the design of error-proof interfaces.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/codings.jpg" alt="The 6 basic codings. Notice that many of these examples actually combine multiple codings in one." loading="lazy"><figcaption>The 6 basic codings. Notice that many of these examples actually combine multiple codings in one.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Size, shape and colour-coding are the fundamentals: quick-wins that can fix a lot of interface problems. Texture is also a great differentiator for blind operation, particularly on small dials requiring precise control.</p>

<p>Position-coding is seemingly straightforward but is often under used. Products with a clear default ergonomic position (like binoculars or a gaming console) can exploit the natural position of the hand to differentiate between primary and secondary actions.</p>

<p>Finally, operation-coding ascribes different types of movements (like a twist or vertical slide) to different inputs. This can be immensely powerful when the switch motion reinforces the operation behind it, e.g. a crane lever which raises the crane when the lever is raised.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/lego-codings.jpg" alt="The six different codings in use in the LEGO interfaces: size, shape, colour, texture, position, operation" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The six different codings in use in the LEGO interfaces: size, shape, colour, texture, position, operation</figcaption></figure>

<p>Differentiation is a good first step that will avoid confusion between adjacent switches. But its only with organisation that we can create a clear and accurate mental model of the interface for the user.</p>

<h2>Organising inputs</h2>

<p>Compare the three panels below. Identical layouts, but the blue one is much clearer than the white. This is the <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/blog/gestalt-principles">gestalt principles</a> at work, identifying related items with a common region.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/gestalt.jpg" alt="Basic differentiation by clustering" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Basic differentiation by clustering</figcaption></figure>

<p>Easy. But how are you going to decide which inputs to cluster together?</p>

<p>I like to use <a href="http://blog.presentandcorrect.com/27986-2">Soviet control panels</a> as a starting point. These beautiful walls of nonsensical dials and levers are brought to life when arranged in a giant factory schematic.  It would be hard to find a more literal organisation of the information.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/soviet-control-panels.jpg" alt="Soviet control panels in action. Source: Present and Correct" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Soviet control panels in action. Source: Present and Correct</figcaption></figure>

<p>These panels are what I'd called a consolidated interface. Every piece of input and feedback has been moved onto the same panel. This is the approach that <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/33847/the-defunct-dyson-evs-steering-wheel-looks-like-it-was-made-by-vacuum-cleaner-people">Dyson took with their car</a>. Now imagine the opposite, moving each of those lights and switches to the actual location of that valve in the factory. Sounds ludicrous, but these <a href="https://deeptread.com/blog/2016/11/21/audi-tt-air-vent-design">air vents in the Audi TT</a> show that this distributed approach can also be a great win for user experience. I wrote a lot more about these <a href="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/2018/Interfaces/">distributed interfaces last year</a>.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/distributed.jpg" alt="Lego vehicle dashboard: distributed (left) vs. consolidated (right)" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Lego vehicle dashboard: distributed (left) vs. consolidated (right)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Back to the Soviet factories. Those interface panels were great for answering the question "does this valve let water into tank Б?". But they're very poor for answering "are all water valves closed?" or "where are all the switches I need to prepare for the shift changeover?".</p>

<p>LEGO use the Soviet schematic approach for their <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=3298pb005&amp;in=S">fantasy</a> <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=3298px10&amp;in=S">orientated</a> designs, because schematics are superb at providing a mental model of the inner workings of an alien system. However for everyday use, there are some other approaches that work better.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/alien-interfaces.jpg" alt="LEGO Insectoid and UFO interfaces. I wonder what these buttons actually do?" loading="lazy"><figcaption>LEGO Insectoid and UFO interfaces. I wonder what these buttons actually do?</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Feature</strong> based organisation is the most common, perhaps even the "default" design philosophy. Group together all the inputs and outputs for each product feature. This <a href="https://www.cambridgeconsultants.com/press-releases/building-life-saving-ventilator-lightning-speed">COVID-19 ventilator from Cambridge Consultants</a> is a wonderful example but we also see this a lot in cars, with a cluster of switches for the airflow control and all of the lights on one control stick.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/covid-ventilator.jpg" alt="COVID-19 ventilator by Cambridge Consultants with clear feature-based organisation. Source: Cambridge Consultants" loading="lazy"><figcaption>COVID-19 ventilator by Cambridge Consultants with clear feature-based organisation. Source: Cambridge Consultants</figcaption></figure>

<p>Organising by <strong>operation</strong> means putting all the switches that function in a certain way in the same place. I've no idea what all the valves in the picture below do, but I bet they don't all open things that relate to each other. Anytime you see a row of switches that look and function the same, but control disparate parts of the system, you've come across organisation by operation.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/valves.jpg" alt="Source: Twitter @aglushko" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Source: Twitter @aglushko</figcaption></figure>

<p>Today most interfaces are effectively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly-by-wire">fly-by-wire</a>, but historically the levers that you pulled in, say, a tractor cabin would literally move the hydraulic pistons beneath the seat to a new position. Routing all these different electrical, mechanical and hydraulic systems efficiently can severely compromise your interface clustering, leading to organisation by <strong>technology</strong>.</p>

<p>The modern equivalent of this is surprisingly common. Any touchscreen with buttons by the side exhibits this technology-based split. In a <a href="https://www.chrisharrison.net/index.php/Research/PneumaticDisplays">future</a> <a href="https://vimeo.com/343640141">world</a>, SpaceX might embed <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-dragon-touchscreen-astronaut-thoughts.html">these physical controls</a> right inside the screen next to the information they affect, but for now they sit awkwardly by the side as if nothing is wrong.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/spacex-dragon.jpg" alt="Bob and Doug in the SpaceX Dragon capsule. Source: SpaceX" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Bob and Doug in the SpaceX Dragon capsule. Source: SpaceX</figcaption></figure>

<p>In LEGO we find the feature based organisation in the "Monitor with -19° pattern". Two clear clusters, perhaps one for temperature control and another for vital signs monitoring. In the second panel below, I don't know what all those switches do, but they seem to be clustered based on their operation, not because of what they will operate.</p>

<p>There are many LEGO panels with a technology split like the SpaceX Dragon capsule, but I like to imagine that this early 90s police control unit was forced to divide the audio and video playback because the newer tape reel technology was incompatible with the older analog phone line system. This is organisation by technology in action.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/organisation.jpg" alt="L-to-R: organisation by feature, operation, technology and use case" loading="lazy"><figcaption>L-to-R: organisation by feature, operation, technology and use case</figcaption></figure>

<p>All of our approaches so far: organisation by features, operation or technology, have been grounded in properties of the system, not of the user. Organisation by <strong>use-case</strong> is the antidote to this, a clustering based on the daily routines and tasks of the user.</p>

<p>Imagine arriving for work each day at the LEGO body scanner factory. Grouping the switches by task (prepare machine, load body, process scan...) would mean splitting up the radiation and scanner buttons into many different regions. More complex for the computer, but more streamlined for the operator. As the designer, only you and your users will be the judge of what works best.</p>

<h2>But George, which is the best interface?</h2>

<p>I often say there's no such thing as the best interface, but there are plenty of examples of the worst interface.</p>

<p>However I do have three favourites. Beautiful, visual layouts with clearly differentiated inputs and simple, clean organisation. I'd be proud to sit behind the console of any of them.</p>

We want to make things more balanced.</p><p>I may know one of the culprits -- whom I will leave unnamed here.  But the company, who is fairly popular, built out their own CDN via putting a bunch of nginx caching proxies on various Hetzner servers around the world.  It apparently was really cheap and very effective.  Given that they were bootstrapped and this was prior to Cloudflare really being that popular, it was a great strategy.  This was true like 8 years ago, so maybe it has changed in the meantime.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>I think culprits is a poor choice of words since it means someone suspected of a misdeed. I could perhaps understand using it for example for someone that tried to store a petrabyte of storage on a consumer unlimited storage plan. But in this case Hetzner set a specific data usage amount you are paying for so using that amount is not a misdeed.</p>

                  <p>Sounds like a completely legitimate use though.  Hetzner were widely telling people about that 20TB limit, so why would they be surprised when people use them as CDN boxes?</p>

                  <p>I was curious and checked if they are still using Hetzner.  It appears not, so I can share who it was.  It was <a href="https://artstation.com/" rel="nofollow">https://artstation.com</a>.  Basically heavily oriented towards serving static images, so the CDN could have been really expensive.  Doing a reverse IP lookup on cdn.artstation.com servers now resolves to Cloudflare and it has cloudflare headers on the response.</p>

									<p><span itemprop="articleBody"><p>When the witty and wry English fantasy novelist Terry Pratchett interviewed Bill Gates for <em>GQ </em>in 1995, only 39% of Americans had access to a home computer. According to the Pew Research Center, the number who were connected to the internet was a paltry 14%. At the dawn of the internet age, when optimistic bromides about the information superhighway to the 21st century were replete in politics and culture, the author of the “Discworld” series was less sanguine.</p><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p>
<p>While talking to the CEO of Microsoft, Pratchett asked what would happen if a writer disseminated on the internet something atrocious and libelous, say a pseudo-academic work of Holocaust denial. “There’s a kind of parity of esteem of information on the net,” said Pratchett, “there’s no way of finding out whether this stuff has any bottom to it or whether someone has just made it up.” Predictably, Gates denied the threat of any sort of epistemological collapse. Without offering any mechanism for doing so, the billionaire told the author that “you will have authorities on the net… The whole way that you can check somebody’s reputation will be so much more sophisticated.” Google was three years into the future—Facebook would be founded in nine years—Twitter in eleven. If Pratchett seemed sardonic and cynical in 1995, then Gates’ pollyannish, Panglossian exuberance appears positively psychotic three decades later.</p>
<span>What’s been sacrificed is not reading in the most prosaic sense, but the particular experience of a certain type of reading.</span>
<p>Pratchett’s warning may have been lonely during that distant age of unbridled tech-enthusiasm, but he wasn’t the only Cassandra warning about reality through a smartphone screen darkly. Astrophysicist Carl Sagan predicted in his 1995 <em>The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</em>&nbsp;that “when awesome technological powers are in the hands of the very few… [and] when the people have lost their ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority” the nation would “slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.”</p>
<p>For many readers in the previous century’s last decade, after the vanquishing of Soviet communism and the seemingly never-ending ascendancy of the American experiment, the arc of the moral universe had turned in part because of the supposedly liberatory power of technology. What Pratchett and Sagan prophesized, however, was a coming tumultuousness, not an end of history but rather the demise of truth. Less of a computer revolution than a computer apocalypse.</p>
<p>Before Pratchett or Sagan—before social media and the smart phone, bot farms and artificial intelligence—there was Sven Birkerts’s damning <em>The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age. </em>Released thirty years ago on December 1, Birkerts challenged the coming digital transformation when it was still a gleam in the eye of men like Gates (and long before Zuckerberg or Musk). As a manifesto, <em>The Gutenberg Elegies </em>was in opposition to the prevailing utopianism of the ‘90s, seeing in the denigration of physical books an irreparable harm.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p>In the author’s estimation, the ceding of material books to the ephemeral gauze of the online posed a threat to our attention, to the ability of immersing ourselves within complex narrative or engaging in the almost-transcendent flow of reading. “Everything in contemporary society discourages interiority,” writes Birkerts. “More and more of our exchanges take place via circuits, and in their very nature those interactions are such as to keep us hovering in the virtual now, a place away from ourselves.” If true in 1994, how much more accurate today? As an antidote to the virtual obliteration of the self, Birkerts returns to literature, arguing that in the “slow and meditative possession of a book,” what he calls “deep reading,” we are able to “keep alive the dangerous and exhilarating idea that life is not sequence of lived moments, but a destiny.”</p>
<p>Many critics disparaged Birkerts as a fussy Luddite. The anonymous reviewer at Kirkus denounced Birkerts as an “inveterate bookworm,” a “curmudgeon” who offered a “simplistic and unconvincing jeremiad.” Wen Stephenson at the <em>Chicago Review </em>claimed that the medium is not the message, describing how he experienced no difference in parsing Seamus Heaney on the page as opposed to the screen, asking “does it matter that it is transmitted to me, voice and word, through a computer? …the question is beginning to bore me by now.” Dean Blobaum of the University of Chicago Press castigated how <em>The Gutenberg Elegies </em>makes electronic media the “whipping boy for the ills of western society,” claiming that Birkerts’ argument is too all-encompassing, blaming computers for the “Decline in education, literacy, and literate culture.” Here’s the thing some thirty years later, however—Birkerts was right.</p>
<p>Central to the negative reviews was a misunderstanding of just how different information hashed through the internet would be when compared with the physical codex, that venerable two-millennia old technology. The Kirkus reviewer, for example, imagines a straw-Birkets at various hinge moments in the past, who inveighs against the “ballpoint, the typewriter, the printing press.” What this critique misses are that those were technologies of production, but the internet is also a technology of reception. The frenetic, interconnected, hypertext-permeated universe of digital reading is categorically a different experience. Even more importantly, a physical book on a shelf is a cosmos unto-itself, while that dimension of interiority and introspection—of privacy—is obscured in the virtual domain.</p>
<p>“If anything has changed about my reading over the years, it is that I value the state a book puts me in more than I value the specific contents,” argued Birkerts, and perhaps that seemed precious three decades ago, but it strikes me as invaluable today. After all, <em>reading </em>itself remains literally central to our existence, maybe more so now than at anytime in history. Our digital lives are mediated through words, whether the tumult of Twitter or the doom-scrolling of Reddit, the ever-present ping of texts and the flux of Facebook. Yet this is an estimably different experience than the immersion in <em>Wuthering Heights </em>or <em>Moby-Dick, Mrs. Dalloway </em>and <em>Ulysses. </em>What’s been sacrificed is not reading in the most prosaic sense, but the particular experience of a certain type of reading, perilously endangered among all of us attracted to the alluring siren-call of the smartphone ping.</p>
<p>Readerly “flow” allows for a submersion in another way of being, an expansion of possibilities and consciousness. It would be foolish to make that hackneyed, didactic argument that great literature produces good people—too many Nazis read Goethe and Schiller, after all—but to abandon deep reading is to jettison something intrinsic, precious, and singular. “I read novels to indulge in a concentrated and directed inner activity that parallels—and thereby tunes up, accentuates—my own inner life,” writes Birkerts. As much drawn to the digital void as is anybody else alive right now, I’ve had to focus my attention on reading, to prepare myself for dwelling amidst these strange places called novels, and that conscious dedication of time has made immeasurable difference.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p>Without that dedication—which is simply exercised desire—I’d have not recently ambled through the centuries-old haunted house that is the main character in Daniel Mason’s <em>North Woods </em>nor would I have been dizzied to be in the unreliable consciousness of the spy Sadie Smith in Rachel Kushner’s <em>Creation Lake, </em>travelled across the immeasurable expanse of Eurasia in the years after the Great War with Pinto in Aleksander Hemon’s <em>The World and All that it Holds, </em>or become familiar with the dozens of very human characters in Andrew O’Hagan’s <em>Caledonian Road, </em>from beleaguered Gen-X art history professors to human trafficked Polish immigrants, British Lords to East London hip-hop artists, a universe in its entirety, contained between two covers of stiff cardboard and eternalized on 624 pages. Books are capable of altering Birkerts’ vaunted interiority, of bending the space-time continuum. As Katya Apekina writes in <em>Mother Doll, </em>another universe I visited this year, “Time does not exist…but it’s interminable.”</p>
<span>A printed book is a living animal with flesh of paper and ink of blood, so that compared to turning pages, mere scrolling is anemic.</span>
<p>Birkerts isn’t necessarily a print mystic, but I am. Mine is an estimably materialist variety of mysticism though, for meaning is the ghost within the machine of the book. Appropriate that Gutenberg, that German gold-miner by training, was inspired to create the matrix of movable print after seeing a similar mechanism used to press grapes into wine, both contraptions intended to distill spirits of-a-sort. The ephemerality of the internet is attractive to entropy, for how much of what’s been written over the past few decades has all but vanished, our prodigious output a daily burning of the Library of Alexandria, while stone, papyrus, vellum, and paper can endure for centuries. A printed book is a living animal with flesh of paper and ink of blood, so that compared to turning pages, mere scrolling is anemic.</p>
<p>The internet is, regardless of the encomiums of its most fervent supporters, also a physical realm. Despite being composed of silicon and copper, soldering and circuit boards, the internet is still described as an ethereal, disembodied, spiritual realm. This fallacy has been present for nearly a third-of-a-century and embraced with disturbing zealousness by Silicon Valley’s most cracked digital occultists. But mere affectation doesn’t draw me to the book, but that it’s superior at what it does. The codex on which the architecture of the book is still defined remains an essential technology.</p>
<p>Irene Vallelejo in <em>Papyrus: The Invention of Books in the Ancient World </em>quips that the codex is the rare device that a time traveling classical Roman would recognize, the book included alongside shovels and axes in basically appearing the same over the centuries. What makes the book perfect, and thus not in need of change, isn’t its appearance (they can be both beautiful and ugly), their price (they’re both expensive and cheap), or their sturdiness (some last forever, others not so much), but rather their ability to <em>disconnect. </em>That is the source of the interiority that Birkerts describes, that books are not mired in the cacophony of the internet.</p>
<p>Among the most poignant scenes in contemporary literature, ever pertinent today, is Winston Smith in George Orwell’s <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four </em>cradling his paper diary out of view of the panopticon of his telescreen and privately writing down his opinions. Except the telescreen isn’t all-seeing, it’s downright primitive compared to contemporary surveillance capitalism, where Big Brother doesn’t eavesdrop but Alexa does. By contrast, printed books are a zone of resistance against the neon god of the algorithm since tinkering with code can’t delete their contents, as hackers recently did with the Internet Archive. There is a safety to books, where Smith is able to enter the private realm of literature simply by sitting a bit off camera. That’s a freedom which, I fear, will become increasingly rare.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p>When we speak of twentieth-century totalitarianism we often due so with a sense of naivety, as if the worst of the past was safely ensconced there, mistaking technological progress with liberty. Now, consider what the Nazis were able to do with flimsy IBM punch cards, and the difference today, the sheer amount of data concerning all of us, saved on servers owned by the very people now enabling authoritarianism. “If literature is to survive,” wrote Birkerts, “it must become dangerous”—it increasingly is. More importantly, if we’re to survive, then we must become literate, again.</p>

<p><strong>Collective Intelligence for AI and Human Consensus</strong></p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Conversational Game Theory</strong> is a formal game of messaging, replies and tagging between human or AI agents that addresses qualitative, reasoning-intensive challenges while synthesizing multiple perspectives through high stakes conflict resolution and consensus building through narrative structures and feedback loops.</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-14.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-14.jpg 960w, https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-14-300x169.jpg 300w, https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-14-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></figure>



<p>This functions as a <a href="https://aikiwiki.com/conversational-game-theory-cgt-a-meta-system-of-collaborative-intelligence/" data-type="page" data-id="630">collective intelligence messaging and composition system</a> designed to handle subjective truths, conflict, collaboration, and complex human-AI interactions in consensus building that is interoperable with any system through an API layer.</p>



<p>As a complete system, Conversational Game Theory identifies a dynamic equilibrium between computational, cognitive and psychological states.</p>



<p>While traditional game theory focuses on strategies between rational agents–Conversational Game Theory is designed for rational and irrational participants or perspectives.</p>



<p>It utilizes a computer interface and a computational system to publish articles from conversations between agents and humans that we’ve recently piloted to success on parley.aikiwiki.com</p>

<p>We propose <strong>AI for Global Conflict Resolution</strong> as a public good that functions as an enhancement layer for LLMs, social media or governance platforms.</p>



<h2>Global Conflict Resolution and Consensus Library (Systems 1)</h2>



<p>Our ability to train AI Agents to play <strong>Conversational Game Theory</strong> from all possible perspectives means we can take any conflict in the world, train AI on all possible perspectives in the conflict, and publish transparent consensus resolutions to those conflicts. The system is immutable to subversion from bad faith actors. </p>



<p><a href="https://aikiwiki.com/conversational-game-theory-cgt-a-collaborative-consensus-building-game/">Humans can join in at anytime.</a></p>



<h2>AI Agent training protocol (Systems 2)</h2>



<p>This Global Library of Consensus Articles acts as <a href="https://aikiwiki.com/contextual-completeness-benchmark-testing-for-llms/">an enhancement layer for chain of thought reasoning for LLMs</a>, as well as a Systems 2 playground to train <a href="https://aikiwiki.com/intelligence-agents-for-a-collaborative-digital-future/" data-type="page" data-id="655">AI agents to play Conversational Game Theory.</a></p>



<h3>Perfect conversations are made possible through <strong>Conversational Game Theory.</strong></h3>



<p>Conversational Game Theory (CGT) engages conflict, debate, disagreement, contradiction, and questioning to <a href="https://aikiwiki.com/conversational-game-theory-cgt-a-collaborative-consensus-building-game/" data-type="link" data-id="https://aikiwiki.com/conversational-game-theory-cgt-a-collaborative-consensus-building-game/">evolve consensus to its best possible state.</a> </p>



<p>CGT makes both humans and AI <em>smarter.</em></p>



<p><strong>CGT achieves large transparent consensus <em>without</em> voting algorithms, enhancing dialogue <em>without </em>censoring any perspective.</strong></p>



<p>Conversely, <em>bad conversations yield bad results</em>.  <em>Bad conversations can make both humans and AI dumber</em>.</p>



<p><strong>While there’s fear that AI and Large Language Models might harm society, perhaps that damage has already occurred due to web 2.0.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>However, AI and LLMs can solve this problem that web2.0 created and make the web great again using <strong>Conversational Game Theory.</strong></p>



<p>We’ve<a href="https://aikiwiki.com/how-to-parley-aiki-wiki/"> demonstrated</a> that LLMs and AI agents can be trained to play <strong>Conversational Game Theory</strong> from all perspectives, embrace contradictions, explore misunderstandings, and produce superior benchmark scores, i.e. <em>CGT makes AI smarter!</em></p>

	It was a scene ripped from a John le Carré novel.</p>



<p>
	According to firsthand accounts and court documents, a man is told to go to the front desk of the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Manhattan and say the phrase “banana peel.” The concierge then hands him an envelope with orders to circle the block twice before receiving further instructions. He returns, is shuffled into a secret elevator — one that isn’t even used for celebrities, only visiting dignitaries deemed assassination risks — and brought to the penthouse suite.</p>



<p>
	After 15 minutes, Sun Lijun enters the room and lights a cigarette. The man recognizes Sun, not merely because he is the third-highest-ranking official in China. In fact, they had met during a trip the man took to Hong Kong in which Chinese Communist Party officials confiscated his passport, blindfolded him and drove him into mainland China. Sun doesn’t greet the man sitting on a plush couch at the Four Seasons. Instead, the CCP bigwig pulls out an email from Attorney General Jeff Sessions regarding three American hostages being held in China. One is a pregnant woman. Sun asks the man what should be done about the woman. He suggests that in an act of good faith, she should be released. Sun makes a call, and after a few minutes, shows the man an itinerary — proof that the woman will be freed and flown back to the United States. A week later, at the tail end of 2018, the feds close in on the man as he walks into Lure, his favorite SoHo haunt.

	</p>






<p>
	But here’s the part that le Carré’s editors would have rejected as wildly implausible. The man is <a href="https://variety.com/t/pras-michel/" id="auto-tag_pras-michel" data-tag="pras-michel">Pras Michél</a>, founder of the legendary hip-hop band the <a href="https://variety.com/t/fugees/" id="auto-tag_fugees" data-tag="fugees">Fugees</a>. And his life is about to descend into chaos as he becomes the highest profile target in a labyrinthine criminal corruption case stemming from one of the world’s biggest financial scandals — the $4.5 billion looting of Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund known as 1MDB.

	</div>




<p>
	“I don’t know if subconsciously it was a bit exciting for me too,” Michél recalls in his first interview since being convicted in that case. “I like spy movies, but I never wanted to be a spy. I don’t think that’s sexy. But a part of it felt like that.”</p>



<p>
	If there was one red flag that something was off that night, Michél says it was the elevator. As a celebrity who has performed before crowds of 100,000, Michél was familiar with being whisked in and out of hotels by security. This was … different.

	</p>




<p>
	“I’m going to tell you what was weird to me: the fact that the Four Seasons has a private elevator. I never knew that. They have a private elevator for just certain people,” he says. “But my life leading up to that point felt surreal, so part of that night felt natural.”</p>



<p>
	Last April, a jury convicted Michél on 10 counts, including violating campaign finance laws during Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection bid and illegally lobbying the Donald Trump administration in 2017. The circus-like D.C. trial lasted three weeks and featured Leonardo DiCaprio testifying for the prosecution and everyone from Kim Kardashian to Martin Scorsese name-checked during testimony.</p>



<p>
	“Michél played a central role in a wide-ranging conspiracy to improperly influence top government officials, including the then-president [Trump] and the then-attorney general [Sessions],” said Department of Justice special agent in charge Harry Lidsky. Likewise, Luis Quesada, assistant director of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division, claimed that Michél “brazenly conspired to help a foreign national launder millions of dollars in illegitimate campaign contributions into the 2012 U.S. presidential election.”</p>



<p>
	In short, the government dubbed Michél a Chinese spy, and a jury agreed. He now faces 22 years in federal prison.</p>



<p>
	“Technically, I’m a foreign agent,” he says.</p>



<p>
	How a Yale-educated musical prodigy who made up one-third of a Grammy-winning group got caught up in this mess makes it one of the most riveting celebrity sagas in years. At the center of the tale is Jho Low, the wild-spending financier who burst onto the scene in 2013 by backing “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Scorsese and DiCaprio’s $100 million look at financial fraud and bacchanalian excess. As Low’s influence in Hollywood grew, scores of celebrities partied on his private jet, drank his Cristal and accepted his lavish gifts (DiCaprio landed a $3.2 million Picasso and a $9 million Basquiat), at least until his elaborate embezzlement scheme unraveled and he became a fugitive. For his part, Michél entered Low’s circle after the two were connected in 2006 via a party promoter who caters to the rich and shameless.</p>



<p>
	Low’s world extended beyond Hollywood to include political operatives — like Democrat Frank White Jr., a relation of Michelle Obama by marriage, and Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy — who did his bidding. White has never been charged, while Trump later pardoned Broidy. Michél says he and Low were never friends, but he connected the deep-pocketed newcomer to other VIPs. He remains the only one in Low’s orbit to face real consequences.</p>



<p>
	“The government needed a prize. They needed a head, and he was the low-hanging fruit,” says Robert Meloni, a litigator on Michél’s team.</p>



<p>
	On an overcast September day in New York, Michél, now 52, takes me down the rabbit hole. We meet in his sparsely furnished 4,500-square-foot SoHo apartment with floor-to-ceiling views of lower Manhattan — a maroon couch, a baby grand piano and a shelf showcasing his Grammys are the only signs of occupancy. The walls are completely bare save for a giant TV. You might assume the government confiscated Michél’s furnishings. But you’d be wrong.

	</p>




<p>
	“I’m a minimalist,” he explains.</p>



<p>
	Wearing a gray Dolce &amp; Gabbana T-shirt with “Love Is King” emblazoned on the front, jeans, pink socks and sandals, Michél exudes a post-yoga-class calm despite a looming sentencing date in January.</p>



<p>
	“I’m going to fight, and I’m going to appeal, but there’s a possibility that I’m going <em>in</em> while I’m fighting,” he says. “It’s just the reality.”</p>



<p>
	Michél was charged under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a once rare maneuver. From 1967 to 2018, the feds only brought forward 12 criminal cases under FARA. But there has been a newfound zeal over the past six years, particularly against members of the Trump administration. Michél says the feds even threatened to use the Logan Act against him. Only two people have ever been indicted under the Logan Act. Adding to his woes, the government seized roughly $80 million from him. In the initial indictment, officials accused him and Low of illegally trying to “obtain foreign access to, and influence with, high-ranking United States government officials for financial benefit.”</p>



<p>
	“Every aspect of my life has been disrupted. I can’t bank anywhere, been kicked out of 13 banks,” Michél says.</p>



<p>
	Still, there are hints of wealth on display. A vintage Patek Philippe watch adorns one of Michél’s wrists, and Cartier and Tiffany bracelets hang on the other. Michél insists that he was never motivated by money. Instead, after the Fugees disbanded in 1997, he continued to land Grammy nominations as the artist behind the seminal “Ghetto Supastar (That Is What You Are),” but he also became a documentarian who traveled to dangerous locations to make gonzo films like “Skid Row” (embedding in L.A.’s homeless community) and “Sweet Micky for President” (which chronicled Michel Martelly’s bid for Haiti’s presidency amid civil unrest unleashed by the 2010 earthquake). He got comfortable being uncomfortable.</p>



<p>
	“I love being able to go stay at the penthouse in the Ritz-Carlton and then being in some fucking locked-up dungeon in Somalia eating rice with my hands,” he says. “When I was kidnapped [there], they were about to sell me to Al-Shabaab, the terrorist group. We were trying to do a documentary. I remember my director was freaking out. He was going crazy. He’s like, ‘Yo, you have a death wish on you, Pras. I should have never listened to you.’ I said, ‘Well, look at it like this. You shot some stuff. Maybe the footage would get back to the States. If we die, at least we got to tell a great story.’ He’s like, ‘What the fuck? What you mean a great story?’ And obviously State Department came and got us out.”</p>

	Perhaps that’s why he was unfazed by Low’s cartoonish grandiosity and the strange asks he began to make. Low threw money around like a sultan, hosting Vegas birthday bashes and Cannes blowouts. But in 2012, as the feds closed in, Low struggled to keep his fraud operation from being exposed. The Malaysian financier tried to leverage his White House ties. He turned to Michél, an Obama fundraiser, and offered him $20 million for a photograph with the president. Michél obliged and kept most of the money. His thinking was rich people will spare no expense to meet famous people.

	</p>




<p>
	“I know people like [Low] who legitimately have money, and they’re wild,” he explains. “If they want something, they’re going to go through all means to get it because they have the resources to. People say, ‘People do crazy things,’ but they haven’t actually witnessed it. I’ve witnessed it.”</p>



<p>
	Case in point, the billionaire who lives on the top floor of his SoHo building.</p>



<p>
	“This guy wanted a statue. They literally shut down this whole block for a whole day, had to bring a crane, had to literally do a hole in the roof to bring the statue he wanted in, and then they redid the roof. He paid for it, obviously. But the roof is not his. It’s for the building. But he’s a billionaire, so it’s like … ,” he says with a shrug.</p>



<p>
	And Low’s spending kept him on the government’s radar. As his house of cards teetered, he tapped his political connections and turned to Michél again. With the turnover from Obama to Trump, Low hoped the new administration would go easy on him and unfreeze his assets. That’s where the Chinese government fit in. During the Hong Kong trip Michél took with Low, the CCP conveyed that it wanted the United States to extradite a fugitive named Guo Wengui. In exchange, it would release three U.S. prisoners, including the pregnant woman. The scheme faced obstacles, namely that Guo happened to be a Steve Bannon pal and a member at Donald Trump’s club, Mar-a-Lago.</p>



<p>
	By the time of the Four Seasons meeting, which Low orchestrated, Michél was already in the feds’ crosshairs. When the FBI began asking him questions, the rapper never requested a lawyer, believing that his actions were legal. After all, he was being advised by George Higginbotham, a senior congressional affairs specialist at the Department of Justice.</p>



<p>
	“The one person that I relied on, especially legally, didn’t give me the best advice,” Michél says. “That’s his job. I’m an artist. There’s a reason why you rely on your legal counsel. They’re the one that’s going to sit here and tell you, ‘Nah. OK, if you want to do this, do it this way so you don’t have any exposure.’ So if my representative is sanctioning what I’m doing and my representative coincidentally works for the DOJ, I am not going to sit here and think I’m wrong, right?” (Higginbotham did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>



<p>
	The prosecution claimed that Michél netted more than $100 million from his association with Low. When I ask if that figure is accurate, he declines to comment. In 2020, a year after Michél was charged, the feds offered him a plea deal. But he turned it down, maintaining that he did nothing wrong. Still, the Trump administration’s DOJ never moved forward with the case. Despite his Obama ties, the Biden administration did.</p>



<p>
	“All the real players escaped,” says a high-profile attorney who followed the case. “Pras was the little guy who took the fall.”</p>



<p>
	For his part, Higginbotham pleaded guilty to conspiracy to deceive U.S. banks about millions of dollars in foreign lobbying funds and was sentenced to three months’ probation. He testified against Michél. As for some of the other characters in the sprawling narrative, Guo was convicted in the U.S. of defrauding investors and supporters of $1 billion.

	</p>




<p>
	“When the feds went into his $30 million apartment on Park Avenue, the apartment was remotely blown up. Did you know that?” Michél says, awestruck. “I guess all the evidence was in the apartment. Whatever. Allegedly, it wasn’t him [who detonated the bomb], but somebody blew the apartment up remotely while the feds were coming in.” (The FBI and the New York Fire Department reportedly were investigating a mysterious 2023 fire that broke out as authorities entered the luxury abode.)</p>



<p>
	Meanwhile, a court in China sentenced Sun to death in 2022 for taking bribes, with the chance that the sentence be reduced to life in prison without parole. Low escaped the United States and is believed to be living in China.</p>



<p>
	“He has as much freedom as someone in a phone booth,” Michél says of the man who turned his life upside down. “Without getting too philosophical about it, it was about me being at the right place at the wrong time. Or the wrong place at the right time.”</p>



<p>
	By the time Michél’s trial began, it appeared as though he had hired the wrong attorney in David Kenner, best known for representing Suge Knight in his 2015 murder case. He had little experience with white-collar crime. He allowed Michél to testify, an unorthodox move that rarely helps a defendant. In an absurd twist, Kenner reportedly used an AI-generated closing argument. “The court has adjudicated those three issues, and they have been denied,” Kenner says. (Earlier this year, Kenner pleaded guilty to misdemeanor criminal contempt and was sentenced to one year of probation over his handling of discovery materials in Michél’s case.)</p>



<p>
	Michél is now represented by Peter Zeidenberg. “We continue to believe that Mr. Michél was not afforded a fair trial, and that the jury’s verdict should be overturned,” Zeidenberg says. “We plan to appeal this verdict and believe that Mr. Michél will, ultimately, be fully exonerated.”</p>



<p>
	The story seems ripe for the Hollywood treatment, and at least three books on the subject are already in the works. Idris Elba has also approached Michél’s camp about acquiring his life rights, and there will be a documentary centering on Michél’s Zelig-like involvement in the surreal story. Director Ben Patterson unveiled footage of the project during a secret screening at the Toronto Film Festival in September. The audience sat in stunned silence, he says. Some of it was shot by Michél, who was brave (or crazy) enough to keep his camera on during the meeting with Sun in China.</p>



<p>
	“There’s so many people that were connected to this,” Patterson says. “It just is surprising and appalling that Pras is the one that gets singled out to the extent that he has. But in doing so, he exposed a lot about how government, celebrity and global finance are all intertwined.”</p>



<p>
	As Michél sits inside the place that he will call home for at least a few more months, he reflects on the people who abandoned him. No publicist would touch him or his case, fearing that they, too, would become entangled in a criminal investigation. Erica Dumas, a crisis publicist with D.C. ties who once worked for Sen. John Kerry, was the only one who would agree to work with him. Friends also began to keep their distance.

	</p>




<p>
	In 2020, right before the pandemic hit, two federal agents visit the L.A. home of one of his closest buddies, who is married with three daughters.</p>



<p>
	“Look, you get a call, FBI show up to your place, I don’t care who you are, your heart is going up your throat,” he says. “They’re like, ‘Hey, we just got a couple of questions for you. So can we come in?’ Who’s going to say no? So he let them in. The wife comes, sits in the living room, don’t know what’s going on, but she’s scared. And at some point, one of the agents goes, ‘What’s that? Do you smell that?’ The wife defecated on herself. She was that scared. And the wife later told my friend, ‘If you ever speak to Pras again, I’ll take my three daughters and you’ll never see us again.’”</p>

<p>
	And though he doesn’t say their names, it’s apparent that his former Fugees bandmates Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean are among those who ghosted him.</p>



<p>
	“I’m done with that. They’re going to Europe [to tour]. I can’t go, so,” he says of the conditions of his bail that prevent him from leaving the country. “It’s what it is. You can’t give people that kind of energy. So you could be frustrated, you could be disappointed, but I really believe in my path and in my journey, and I believe what’s mine, no one’s going to be able to take it away from me. So it’s better that you have a small group of people who really believe in you and believe in what you’re doing than to have 100 people around you, and the minute something happens — boom. People just disappear.”</p>



<p>
	A few weeks after our meeting, Michél files a blistering lawsuit against Hill, accusing her of fraud and breach of contract over the Fugees’ 2023 reunion tour that ended abruptly this year amid a slew of canceled concerts. It left little doubt about his feelings toward his former colleague. (In the shade-filled complaint, he claimed Hill showed “arrogance” for “unilaterally” rejecting a $5 million offer to play Coachella, alleging her “ego was bruised” because No Doubt got top billing over the Fugees. Hill hit back, calling the lawsuit “baseless” and “full of false claims and unwarranted attacks.”)</p>



<p>
	Michél makes his way to the baby grand. He’s thinking about his 6-year-old daughter. For most of our interview, he speaks flatly, seeming both resigned and exhausted. But he grows animated as he begins talking about the girl he calls “my joy.” She lives part of the year in Italy, making it difficult to see her given that he has to stay in the U.S. But she traveled to Los Angeles with her mother recently, giving him renewed hope. Over the past few days, a song lodged in his head like an earworm. He didn’t know how to play it, so he taught himself.</p>



<p>
	As the midday sun breaks through the clouds, Michél begins tapping out an unmistakable melody on the piano. It’s the Jackson 5’s “I’ll Be There.”

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://proot-me.github.io/">https://proot-me.github.io/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42262308">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div xmlns="" id="description"><h2>Description</h2><p>PRoot is a user-space implementation of <tt>chroot</tt>, <tt>mount --bind</tt>,
and <tt>binfmt_misc</tt>.  This means that users don't need any privileges
or setup to do things like using an arbitrary directory as the new
root filesystem, making files accessible somewhere else in the
filesystem hierarchy, or executing programs built for another CPU
architecture transparently through QEMU user-mode.  Also, developers
can use PRoot as a generic Linux process instrumentation engine thanks
to its extension mechanism, see <a href="https://proot-me.github.io/care">CARE</a> for an example.  Technically
PRoot relies on <tt>ptrace</tt>, an unprivileged system-call available in
every Linux kernel.</p><p>The new root file-system, a.k.a <em>guest rootfs</em>, typically contains a
Linux distribution.  By default PRoot confines the execution of
programs to the guest rootfs only, however users can use the built-in
<em>mount/bind</em> mechanism to access files and directories from the actual
root file-system, a.k.a <em>host rootfs</em>, just as if they were part of
the guest rootfs.</p><p>When the guest Linux distribution is made for a CPU architecture
incompatible with the host one, PRoot uses the CPU emulator QEMU
user-mode to execute transparently guest programs.  It's a convenient
way to develop, to build, and to validate any guest Linux packages
seamlessly on users' computer, just as if they were in a <em>native</em>
guest environment.  That way all of the cross-compilation issues are
avoided.</p><p>PRoot can also <em>mix</em> the execution of host programs and the execution
of guest programs emulated by QEMU user-mode.  This is useful to use
host equivalents of programs that are missing from the guest rootfs
and to speed up build-time by using cross-compilation tools or
CPU-independent programs, like interpreters.</p><p>It is worth noting that the guest kernel is never involved, regardless
of whether QEMU user-mode is used or not.  Technically, when guest
programs perform access to system resources, PRoot translates their
requests before sending them to the host kernel.  This means that
guest programs can use host resources (devices, network, ...) just as
if they were "normal" host programs.</p></div><div xmlns="" id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2><p>In the following examples the directories <tt>/mnt/slackware-8.0</tt> and
<tt>/mnt/armslack-12.2/</tt> contain a Linux distribution respectively made
for x86 CPUs and ARM CPUs.</p><div id="chroot\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> equivalent</h3><p>To execute a command inside a given Linux distribution, just give
<tt>proot</tt> the path to the guest rootfs followed by the desired
command.  The example below executes the program <tt>cat</tt> to print the
content of a file:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/ cat /etc/motd

Welcome to Slackware Linux 8.0</pre><p>The default command is <tt>/bin/sh</tt> when none is specified. Thus the
shortest way to confine an interactive shell and all its sub-programs
is:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ cat /etc/motd
Welcome to Slackware Linux 8.0</pre></div><div id="mount\ --bind\ equivalent"><h3><tt>mount --bind</tt> equivalent</h3><p>The bind mechanism enables one to relocate files and directories.  This is
typically useful to trick programs that perform access to hard-coded
locations, like some installation scripts:</p><pre>proot -b /tmp/alternate_opt:/opt

$ cd to/sources
$ make install
[...]
install -m 755 prog "/opt/bin"
[...] # prog is installed in "/tmp/alternate_opt/bin" actually</pre><p>As shown in this example, it is possible to bind over files not even
owned by the user.  This can be used to <em>overlay</em> system configuration
files, for instance the DNS setting:</p><pre>ls -l /etc/hosts
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 675 Mar  4  2011 /etc/hosts</pre><pre>proot -b ~/alternate_hosts:/etc/hosts

$ echo '1.2.3.4 google.com' &gt; /etc/hosts
$ resolveip google.com
IP address of google.com is 1.2.3.4
$ echo '5.6.7.8 google.com' &gt; /etc/hosts
$ resolveip google.com
IP address of google.com is 5.6.7.8</pre><p>Another example: on most Linux distributions <tt>/bin/sh</tt> is a symbolic
link to <tt>/bin/bash</tt>, whereas it points to <tt>/bin/dash</tt> on Debian
and Ubuntu.  As a consequence a <tt>#!/bin/sh</tt> script tested with Bash
might not work with Dash.  In this case, the binding mechanism of
PRoot can be used to set non-disruptively <tt>/bin/bash</tt> as the default
<tt>/bin/sh</tt> on these two Linux distributions:</p><pre>proot -b /bin/bash:/bin/sh [...]</pre><p>Because <tt>/bin/sh</tt> is initially a symbolic link to <tt>/bin/dash</tt>, the
content of <tt>/bin/bash</tt> is actually bound over this latter:</p><pre>proot -b /bin/bash:/bin/sh

$ md5sum /bin/sh
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/sh
$ md5sum /bin/bash
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/bash
$ md5sum /bin/dash
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/dash</pre><p>In most cases this shouldn't be a problem, but it is still possible to
strictly bind <tt>/bin/bash</tt> over <tt>/bin/sh</tt> -- without dereferencing
it -- by specifying the <tt>!</tt> character at the end:</p><pre>proot -b '/bin/bash:/bin/sh!'

$ md5sum /bin/sh
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/sh
$ md5sum /bin/bash
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/bash
$ md5sum /bin/dash
c229085928dc19e8d9bd29fe88268504  /bin/dash</pre></div><div id="chroot\ +\ mount\ --bind\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> + <tt>mount --bind</tt> equivalent</h3><p>The two features above can be combined to make any file from the host
rootfs accessible in the confined environment just as if it were
initially part of the guest rootfs.  It is sometimes required to run
programs that rely on some specific files:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ ps -o tty,command
Error, do this: mount -t proc none /proc</pre><p>works better with:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/ -b /proc

$ ps -o tty,command
TT       COMMAND
?        bash
?        proot -b /proc /mnt/slackware-8.0/
?        sh
?        ps -o tty,command</pre><p>Actually there's a bunch of such specific files, that's why PRoot
provides the option <tt>-R</tt> to bind automatically a pre-defined list of
recommended paths:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ ps -o tty,command
TT       COMMAND
pts/6    bash
pts/6    proot -R /mnt/slackware-8.0/
pts/6    sh
pts/6    ps -o tty,command</pre></div><div id="chroot\ +\ mount\ --bind\ +\ su\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> + <tt>mount --bind</tt> + <tt>su</tt> equivalent</h3><p>Some programs will not work correctly if they are not run by the
"root" user, this is typically the case with package managers.  PRoot
can fake the root identity and its privileges when the <tt>-0</tt> (zero)
option is specified:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/ -0

# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) [...]

# mkdir /tmp/foo
# chmod a-rwx /tmp/foo
# echo 'I bypass file-system permissions.' &gt; /tmp/foo/bar

I bypass file-system permissions.</pre><p>This option is typically required to create or install packages into
the guest rootfs.  Note it is <em>not</em> recommended to use the <tt>-R</tt>
option when installing packages since they may try to update bound
system files, like <tt>/etc/group</tt>.  Instead, it is recommended to use
the <tt>-S</tt> option.  This latter enables the <tt>-0</tt> option and binds
only paths that are known to not be updated by packages:</p><pre>proot -S /mnt/slackware-8.0/

architecture incompatible with the host one.  From users'
point-of-view, guest programs handled by QEMU user-mode are executed
transparently, that is, just like host programs.  To enable this
feature users just have to specify which instance of QEMU user-mode
they want to use with the option <tt>-q</tt>:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm

$ cat /etc/motd
Welcome to ARMedSlack Linux 12.2</pre><p>The parameter of the <tt>-q</tt> option is actually a whole QEMU user-mode
command, for instance to enable its GDB server on port 1234:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q "qemu-arm -g 1234" emacs</pre><p>PRoot allows one to mix transparently the emulated execution of guest
programs and the native execution of host programs in the same
file-system namespace.  It's typically useful to extend the list of
available programs and to speed up build-time significantly.  This
mixed-execution feature is enabled by default when using QEMU
user-mode, and the content of the host rootfs is made accessible
through <tt>/host-rootfs</tt>:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm

$ file /bin/echo
[...] ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM [...]
$ /bin/echo 'Hello world!'
Hello world!

$ file /host-rootfs/bin/echo
[...] ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64 [...]
$ /host-rootfs/bin/echo 'Hello mixed world!'
Hello mixed world!</pre><p>Since both host and guest programs use the guest rootfs as <tt>/</tt>,
users may want to deactivate explicitly cross-filesystem support found
in most GNU cross-compilation tools.  For example with GCC configured
to cross-compile to the ARM target:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm

$ export CC=/host-rootfs/opt/cross-tools/arm-linux/bin/gcc
$ export CFLAGS="--sysroot=/"   # could be optional indeed
$ ./configure; make</pre><p>As with regular files, a host instance of a program can be bound over
its guest instance.  Here is an example where the guest binary of
<tt>make</tt> is overlaid by the host one:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm -b /usr/bin/make

$ which make
/usr/bin/make
$ make --version # overlaid
GNU Make 3.82
Built for x86_64-slackware-linux-gnu</pre><p>It's worth mentioning that even when mixing the native execution of
host programs and the emulated execution of guest programs, they still
believe they are running in a native guest environment.  As a
demonstration, here is a partial output of a typical <tt>./configure</tt>
script:</p><pre>checking whether the C compiler is a cross-compiler... no</pre></div></div><div xmlns="" id="downloads"><h2>Downloads</h2><div id=""><h3>PRoot</h3><p>The source code for PRoot and CARE are hosted in the same repository on <a href="https://github.com/proot-me/proot">GitHub</a>.
