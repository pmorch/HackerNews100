<p>Imagine a skill-chart of qualities of technology: screen, audio, performance, build, tactility, touch-interaction, efficiency, size, and so many more. At the balancing point of all these qualities is the laptop. To that end, let’s build a laptop that hits as many qualities of a modern commercial thin &amp; light laptop—while trying to do as much from scratch as possible.</p>

<p><em>General system overview</em></p>
<h2 id="fermionic-analysis">Fermionic Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="choosing-the-chip">Choosing <em>the</em> chip</h3>
<p>I looked towards single-board computer SoCs, as board manufacturers commonly release schematics for reference. In many aspects, the Rockchip RK3588 is the fastest consumer-procurable chip on the market. Despite the spotty software support, the hardware documentation has lots of developer resources and <a href="https://wiki.friendlyelec.com/wiki/images/1/15/CM3588_NAS_SDK_2309_SCH.PDF" target="_blank">reference schematics</a> from SBC manufacturers.</p>
<p>Some quick specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quad core A76 and quad core A55</li>
<li>Mali-G10 GPU</li>
<li>6TOPs NPU</li>
<li>8K@60FPS decoder</li>
<li>I/O: 8K display, dual USB3.1, PCIe 3.0 x 4, HDMI2.1/eDP 1.4, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>With only a few months to work on this project, an SoM (system on module) like the Raspberry Pi CM5 presented the best option for its hardware compatibility and a high likelihood of a snug integration. Choosing an SoM also alleviates memory and other high-speed signaling concerns. Looking around for a RK3588 SoM, I came across the CM3588 by FriendlyElec. Cheap, well-documented, and easily procurable. Sounds good!</p>
<img src="https://www.byran.ee/img/cm3588.jpg">
<p><em>FriendlyElec CM3588 SoM</em></p>
<h3 id="display">Display</h3>
<p>I hopped on <a href="https://www.panelook.com/" target="_blank">panelook.com</a> and filtered by size and resolution. I’ve always been a sucker for high pixel density, so I went with a 4K AMOLED 13.3” display. Cross referencing stock availability on Taobao (Chinese domestic Aliexpress), the <a href="https://www.panelook.com/ATNA33TP11_Samsung_13.3_OLED_parameter_59424.html" target="_blank">ATNA33TP11</a> seemed to be the one with most <em>brand-new</em> stock since OLED risked burn-in.</p>
<p>A highlight: during display evaluation, switching out a connector and shortening the board by 2mm improved signal integrity <em>just enough</em> for the 1.5GHz x 4 signals go pass through. Getting the display running on Linux meant finding system logs from Asus laptops that have this display, reverse-engineering the values, and tuning the power-on timings amongst other things <em>just right</em>. TLDR; getting a 4K AMOLED eDP display running on non-mainline Linux was a heck of a journey, so read <a href="">this if you’re interested</a> (coming soon).</p>

<h3 id="powertrain">Powertrain</h3>
<p>The cells had to be 6mm thin and four packs lined up should take roughly half of the entire chassis volume. Chinese manufacturers don’t stock batteries readily, and shipping them to the US would be a pain. Thus, I looked on the American side. I stumbled upon with <a href="https://www.batteryspace.com/polymerli-ionmodule37v4250mah157wh85arate-prewiredwithpcbpl5467100.aspx" target="_blank">these batteries</a> from AA Portable Power Corp. or batteryspace.com. or Powerizer. Doing the power calculations, we get: 4.250Ah <em>3.7V</em> 4S = 62.9 Wh with max 8A (so max 134.4W discharge)! Solid.</p>
<p>The total voltage is 4.2V (peak) * 4S = 16.8V. The system’s designed for up to 20V USB-C (AKA 100W) and passed into the <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/BQ25713" target="_blank">BQ25713</a> charging IC. The batteries are balanced with the <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/BQ77915" target="_blank">BQ77915</a> to ensure safe charging, and the power is tracked with an <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/products/ltc2943.html" target="_blank">LTC2943</a> to calculate a state-of-charge percentage. I popped in an ESP32-S3 module as the controller for everything, and set it to production.</p>
<p>After writing drivers and sitting on the undecipherable datasheets for days, I had the batteries charging. I successfully <a href="https://a.co/d/3b8R9mN" target="_blank">load tested</a> it to around 5A and powered the full system. There’s still a lot of quiescent current (about ~50mA), but I haven’t had the time to optimize the firmware.</p>
<p>The USB of the ESP32 connects to the internal USB on the motherboard to feed the power telemetry over UART. A Python script and kernel module in the OS forwards it to the battery service in the kernel to display it natively.</p>

<h3 id="mainboard">Mainboard</h3>
<p>With those decisions made up, I aimed for &gt;90mm motherboard width based on a prelim CAD from the batteries and display dimensions.</p>
<p>On the physical I/O side, I settled on dual USB3.1 Type-C ports, a USB2.0 Type-A port, a headphone jack, and a microSD card slot. Internally, the M.2 E-key connects to an <a href="https://a.co/d/4lJDnwX" target="_blank">RTL8852BE</a> WiFi 6 (802.11ax) + BT5.2 wireless card and the M.2 M-key accommodates up to an 2242-sized NVMe SSD. A full size NVMe SSD can fit with some modifications of the chassis too.</p>
<p>Tangent over, this leaves me with around ~90mm of board height. Implementing all the features on the final mainboard would stretch this writeup too long, so read <a href="">this if you’re interested</a> (coming soon).</p>

<p><em>Detailed hardware overview</em></p>
<h3 id="operating-on-a-system">Operating on a System</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Riek/ubuntu-rockchip" target="_blank">Joshua Riek’s ubuntu-rockchip</a> kernel/distro combined an out-of-the-box experience with lots of optimizations. Using Armbian’s kernel (I believe it’s still off Rockchip’s kernel) meant that it offered nearly all the features of the RK3588 on a developer-ready kernel configuration.</p>
<p>Since nearly all the work I needed to do was abstracted in the DeviceTree (DTS) hardware configuration language implemented with U-boot, the bootloader, I took advantage of their system-agnostic nature to speed up my trial-and-error process having never done any Linux work.</p>
<p>Instead of developing and compiling code on the RK3588 itself, I used my daily driver MacBook and Visual Studio Code. Once I made a change in the DTS, I’d use Orbstack (virtualization software) running Ubuntu 24.04 (shared filesystem and kernel with macOS) and compile the DeviceTree there.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="txt"><code><span><span>DTSI, DTS, and DTS Overlay Files (some for SoC, some for other ICs, etc.) -&gt; dtcpp binary (preprocessing &amp; linking various DeviceTree definitions) -&gt; dtc binary (DeviceTree compilation) -&gt; anyon_e.dtb (compiled DeviceTree binary!)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Pointing U-Boot to a custom compiled DTB (devicetree binary), I <code>scp</code>’ed the compiled <code>anyon_e.dtb</code> to the OS. A <code>u-boot-update</code> regenerates the bootloader configurations, and a reboot updates the changes.</p>
<p>That’s how I did the hardware bringup—display configurations, PCIe, USB, and other low-level system tweaks. The rest is just a standard install of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with Linux Kernel 6.1.</p>

<p><em>In-depth software overview</em></p>
<h3 id="peripherals">Peripherals</h3>
<p>Imagine being able to just pull out your laptop’s keyboard and use it as just another wireless keyboard for literally anything! Just me? Maybe.</p>
<p>Being a mechanical keyboard addict with quite a few <a href="https://zmk.dev/" target="_blank">ZMK keyboards</a> designed, I chose the <a href="https://github.com/pashutk/Cherry_MX_ULP" target="_blank">Cherry MX ULP mechanical switches</a> for the best feel. Of course, a battery and fully mechanical switches add <em>a lot</em> of height. I used a 1mm thin <a href="https://www.powerstream.com/thin-lithium-ion.htm" target="_blank">200mAh battery</a> and a custom battery protection board that sticks up between two rows of keys to cut down on ~1.6mm (PCB height). The nRF52840 SoC running ZMK Firmware is right underneath the spacebar. A sandwich of PLA and 6061 aluminum from Fabworks crammed everything under ~7mm.</p>
<p>Since the keycaps aren’t easily procurable, I got a <a href="https://www.printedsolid.com/products/e3d-revo-nozzles?srsltid=AfmBOopKMJDs7gFpzrJg3kHQ-aJLDFTjeFO0ZJAYf1hADzy5iurNlkLB" target="_blank">0.15mm nozzle</a> for my Bambu Lab X1C and printed them with PLA. It got me down a rabbit hole of tungsten nozzles, and I got quoted ~$400 for 20x 0.15mm nozzles. I’ve been thinking of trying that out too. But alas, printing out all the keycaps and assembling for the last time, the keyboard was done.</p>
<p>Moving on to the trackpad, it was quite quick. I knew from the start that I wanted a good trackpad, so making my own with zero capacitive tracking experience is a no-go. Searching online, I came across the Azoteq <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Azoteq/PXM0057-401-S?qs=t7xnP681wgVkp9ZZYy6TPA%3D%3D" target="_blank">PXM0057-401</a> evaluation module on Mouser. It had it all—glass surface, multi-touch, and worked over USB. And, it was only 35 bucks or so. However, the trackpad has ceased production without many alternatives.</p>
<p>With the keyboard and trackpad working, it was time to put on the finishing touches.</p>

<h3 id="mechanical">Mechanical</h3>
<p>Roughly the same time I began the system design, I sent a few CNC aluminum blocks off to JLC for evaluation with different anodization finishes. The dark gray anodization felt “best”, but I preferred the look of the matte black, so I settled on that.
Using PTC OnShape, I (attempted) CAD’ed a robust and minimalistic look and a blend of my two favorite laptop lineup designs, the Razer Blade and the MacBook Pro. Because of the removable keyboard, the bottom has no screws. Instead, the palm rest screws into the bottom chassis. <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a18bb6df7dbba66df24a7ec8/w/967d921e60c207e3b6f5cf7b/e/1f78a9387b17c2d178742295?renderMode=0&amp;uiState=678da20d5bee0d1ad2dd55f1" target="_blank">CAD Link here.</a></p>
<p>The hardest part about the chassis was the hinge. I used <a href="https://frame.work/products/display-hinge-kit?v=FRANFB0001" target="_blank">Framework’s 13.3” hinge</a> because it has a 3D model. I constrained it in OnShape so I can see the exact closing angles.</p>
<p>The chassis layout is fairly simple: batteries on the bottom, the power board on the right, motherboard on the left, and the hinge mechanism on top. Oh, and a transparent PETG FDM printed power button that lights up on a custom PCB. To balance out the asymmetric hinge (caused by the mainboard being too wide), a little <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/2153T11/" target="_blank">carbon fiber rod</a> lines up on the left side too.</p>
<img src="https://www.byran.ee/img/chassis_empty.jpg">
<p><em>Chassis test fitting</em></p>
<p>It was a battle to get the screen assembly to not hit anything while also covering
Although I started considering thermals way in advance, hence the gap here for the heatpipe to go through, I still had difficulty fitting everything in. The distance between the bottom of the keyboard and the top of the heatsink is less than a half a millimeter. The cooling system is really constrained because I don’t have the resources to make a custom heatpipe and fin solution. So, I made a full copper CNC heatsink (from JLCCNC) and a heatpipe connected to a fan. It’s all connected with <a href="https://www.lttstore.com/products/ptm7950-phase-change-thermal-pad" target="_blank">PTM7950</a>.</p>
<p>I also added <a href="https://puiaudio.com/product/speakers-and-receivers/as04004mo-sp40" target="_blank">these</a> PUI audio speakers on either side. The audio from the CM3588’s DAC didn’t work and I ran out of debugging time, so I made a USB to audio converter board separately and shot it through an Class-D amplifier. I would’ve also made the amp, but I ran out of time.</p>
<p>As I reached final assembly, I used a mix of JLC’s selective laser sintering (SLS) of nylon powder and FDM printed PA6-CF for smaller structural parts. Putting it all together with the matte black CNC aluminum chassis, I finally had my laptop.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>The hardest class I’ve taken so far was quantum mechanics in my junior spring term. A few months before spending hours solving time-independent and dependent Schrödinger equations, I was on the squash bus (the sport, not the vegetable). My friend suggested I make a laptop for my senior project—and that was all.
I came up with the name anyon_e in June, after I finished the quantum course.</p>
<p>Making this laptop was hard. Mentally pressured with a deadline, and a constant inter-disciplinary challenge across electrical, software, and mechanical systems. Summing up everything I’ve ever done. It took up most of my mind from May until now.</p>
<p>Inspired by open-source projects like <a href="https://zmk.dev/" target="_blank">ZMK</a>, <a href="https://www.kicad.org/" target="_blank">KiCAD</a>, <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>, and countless <a href="https://certification.oshwa.org/basics.html" target="_blank">OSHW</a> projects, I want to do my own little part. To put power in people’s hands in creation, innovation, imagination, or whatever else. To attempt the impossible.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-{{post-slug}}">


	
		
<div>
  <p><em>I work from home everyday, I am susceptible to eye strain, eye pain, and dizziness. Having a working environment that’s as easy on my eyes as possible is of critical importance. I hope that by sharing what I've learned, it can be helpful to you if you work from home, and like many, have experienced WFH eye strain.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: I'm not an ergonomist or optometrist. These tips are intended to help improve your work from home comfort based on my own personal experience.</em></p></div><h2><strong>TLDR</strong></h2><div>
  <ol><li>An even, diffused lighting environment is best for the eyes</li><li>When it comes to light brightness, too much is just as problematic as too little</li><li>Use natural light wherever possible&nbsp;</li><li>Quality of artificial light matters</li><li>The best lighting for camera, is not necessarily the best lighting for ergonomics</li><li>Even the perfect lighting environment will fatigue you — take breaks, and take care of yourself</li></ol></div>

<hr><h2>What is it about computer screens that makes them fatiguing?</h2><h6>Monitor flicker</h6>
<p>Most monitors have some level of flicker. This flickering is generally not visually noticeable, but can still be fatiguing. Monitors at lower brightness levels exhibit more flicker - as they use PWM dimming (Pulse Width Modulation). In some monitors this is done by changing the ON/OFF intervals, increasing OFF timing, and lowering ON timing — while maintaining the same brightness! This creates an awful strobe-effect, and can be very exhausting — especially when working in an environment where the monitor is the sole light source.</p><h6>High contrast lighting</h6>
<p>High contrast lighting can exist in a few different formats. It can exist as <strong>glare</strong> — that is for example light coming in from a window, into a dark room, illuminating a part of your desk. This glare is fatiguing on your eyes because they are accommodating for two levels of brightness simultaneously, while also trying to conduct tasks on a computer monitor — such as reading. High contrast can also exist in a room with bright light on the left, and darkness on the right. This is fatiguing for your eyes to compensate for.</p><h6>Fixed focal distance</h6>
<p>When working at a computer, most of the time <em>we, </em>and the <em>monitor </em>don't move significantly. We focus at the same distances for long periods of time. This causes our eye muscles to get tight and overworked. This can cause our eyes to get tired, spasm, or sometimes even make it very hard to relax our eyes. Although improved office lighting can help with this, the main way to solve for this problem is to take breaks practicing the 20/20/20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look up from your screen and focus on something approximately 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.</p>
<hr><h2>My setup before</h2><h4>Daytime</h4>
<p>Light in the office primarily comes in from the sun. The direct light causes glare, and because of the lack of diffusion, makes for dark corners in the room. Even with a light overhead, it's not enough to equal the amount from outside. This results in high contrast, dark spots behind the monitor, and harsh shadows. Blackout curtains are of little help because they only serve to reduce the size of the light coming in, as opposed to aiding with diffusion. Anytime it's dark outside, it's like working at night. Not fun.</p>

    Daylight is harsh and direct, creating glare or harsh shadows. The lack of diffused light makes for dark spots in the office.  </figcaption>

<hr><h4>Nighttime</h4>
<p>Light primarily comes from above. Because of this single light source, it makes for harsh shadows, dark spots, and high contrast. The contrast issue is particularly apparent with the monitor, which although can be dimmed, creates a bright monitor, which also self-shades the wall behind resulting in a dark background.</p>

    Light levels are now much more balanced, with less blown out light, and less harsh shadows.

Backlighting and desk-lighting help to create a relaxing, low contrast task environment.  </figcaption>

<hr><h3>What's changed</h3><h5>Window light sources, and filtering light</h5>
<div><p>Windows now have light-filtering curtains, which helps to not only reduce the amount of light on bright days, but also to heavily diffuse the light coming in, which makes for a beautiful glow in the room. In addition, I've installed wood-blinds (not shown) behind the curtains which helps to further control the amount of light entering the office on very bright days.</p><p><em>Products used: Sheer curtains • Wood Blinds</em></p></div><h5>Wall &amp; ceiling lighting</h5>
<div>
  <p>Each corner of the room now has a torchiere lamp, which helps to create an even lighting environment. These lamps point directly up and light the room indirectly through reflections off of the walls and ceiling. In the center of the ceiling, a fabric wrapped light fixture provides  diffused lighting. This light is dimmable and can be adjusted to match the amount of light from the standing lamps. </p><p><em>Products used: IKEA NOT Lamp (Discontinued but </em><a href="https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/tagarp-floor-uplighter-black-white-60464049/"><em>TAGARP is comparable</em></a><em>) • </em><a href="https://www.homedepot.ca/product/philips-ultradefinition-led-a19-e26-60w-equivalent-light-bulb-dimmable-soft-white-2700k-2-pack/1001664067?eid=PS_GO_140203__ALL_PLA-526641&amp;eid=ds_ads_van_27772_FY24%20%7C%20MS%20%7C%20Always%20on%20%7C%20Google%20Shopping&amp;pid=1001664067&amp;store=7158&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=vantage&amp;utm_campaign=25029&amp;utm_content=26766&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAxea5BhBeEiwAh4t5K7JuMnZCfX-pH8h00lhpixTdd7IHwLgyH18hfcewKmL6MXn-lSnxUhoCPCUQAvD_BwE#reviews"><em>Philipps Ultra Definition LED Soft White (Glass)</em></a></p></div><h5>Desk lighting</h5>
<div>
  <p>The desk now has even lighting. The brightness of the monitor is now matched by a dimmable flicker-free backlight, which makes working at the display less fatiguing. In addition, a monitor lightbar (not shown), provides indirect light to the desk, reflected off the surface which is completely dimmable and flicker-free. These two lights together help to make for an even lighting environment during the day, and a calm and cozy environment at night. In addition to the two lights, the Apple Studio display has an ambient light sensor, which adjusts the brightness to match the ambient light, which is a game changer for light sensitive people. </p><p><em>Products used: </em><a href="https://www.benq.com/en-ca/lighting/monitor-light/screenbar-plus.html" target="_blank" title="BenQ Screenbar Plus"><em>BenQ ScreenBar Plus</em></a><em> • Warm White LED Strips • </em><a href="https://store.waveformlighting.com/products/filmgrade-flicker-free-dimmer-for-led-strip#:~:text=Waveform%20Lighting's%20innovative%20flicker%2Dfree,an%20existing%20LED%20system%20setup." title="Waveform Flicker-Free LED Dimmer"><em>WaveForm Flicker-Free </em></a><a href="https://store.waveformlighting.com/products/filmgrade-flicker-free-dimmer-for-led-strip#:~:text=Waveform%20Lighting's%20innovative%20flicker%2Dfree,an%20existing%20LED%20system%20setup." target="_blank" title="Waveform Flicker-Free LED Dimmer"><em>LED</em></a><a href="https://store.waveformlighting.com/products/filmgrade-flicker-free-dimmer-for-led-strip#:~:text=Waveform%20Lighting's%20innovative%20flicker%2Dfree,an%20existing%20LED%20system%20setup." title="Waveform Flicker-Free LED Dimmer"><em> Dimmer</em></a></p></div>
<hr><h2>Takeaways</h2>
<div>
  <ol><li><p><strong>An even, diffused lighting environment is best for the eyes. </strong>Try to balance out dark/light spots with additional lighting, and diffusing strong light sources — like the sun.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>When it comes to light brightness, too much is just as problematic as too little. </strong>When dealing with too little light, add additional light sources which provide indirect, and reflective lights — such as up-lights, or torchieres, or lights that have a shade. When dealing with too much light — use blinds, sheer curtains, or light filtering curtains. If you have too much light from an artificial source, use lower wattage bulbs, or consider adding a dimmer switch.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Use natural light wherever possible. </strong>If you've got natural light, use it to your advantage. Natural light is healthier than artificial light — there's no flicker, and it can provide us with much needed vitamin D. For rooms with small windows, use mirrors to help reflect natural light and fill the room. <br></p></li><li><p><strong>Quality of Artificial Light Matters. </strong>Wherever possible seek out high quality lighting that is dimmable and flicker-free. Spending a few extra dollars for these products is worth it, and it will result in less fatigue. For regular bulbs, I recommend <a href="https://www.homedepot.ca/product/philips-ultradefinition-led-a19-e26-60w-equivalent-light-bulb-dimmable-soft-white-2700k-2-pack/1001664067?eid=PS_GO_140203__ALL_PLA-526641&amp;eid=ds_ads_van_27772_FY24%20%7C%20MS%20%7C%20Always%20on%20%7C%20Google%20Shopping&amp;pid=1001664067&amp;store=7158&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=vantage&amp;utm_campaign=25029&amp;utm_content=26766&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAxea5BhBeEiwAh4t5K7JuMnZCfX-pH8h00lhpixTdd7IHwLgyH18hfcewKmL6MXn-lSnxUhoCPCUQAvD_BwE#reviews"><em>Philipps Ultra Definition LED Soft White</em></a><em> </em>bulbs which have low flicker rates, glass enclosures, high color rendering index, and a relatively inexpensive pricepoint.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>The best lighting for camera, is not necessarily the best lighting for ergonomics. </strong>When working from home, we spend a lot of time on video calls, and it's natural to want to look our best. Studio lights that attach to our desks, or facing a window outdoor will result in great lighting on camera, but can also cause fatigue. Consider reserving this lighting for calls, or see if generally better room lighting can result in a similar light quality on camera.<strong><br></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Even the perfect lighting environment will fatigue you — take breaks, and think beyond lighting! </strong>Having a great lighting environment will help you with stamina, but having good work habits like the 20/20/20 rule, and changing up posture and working environments are important in order to take the best care of your eyes, and your body. Think beyond lighting when considering ergonomics, such as room humidity (to limit dry eye), posture, chair position, and stay moving to keep blood flowing.<br></p></li></ol></div>

<p>We’re in the process of porting a significant portion of the network I/O code
            in EdgeDB from Python to Rust, and we’ve been learning a lot of very
            interesting lessons in the process.</p>
<div data-section-id="the-crash-that-only-happened-on-arm64" id="the-crash-that-only-happened-on-arm64">

<p>We’ve been working on a new HTTP fetch feature for EdgeDB, using <code>reqwest</code>
                as our HTTP client library. Everything was going smoothly: the feature
                worked locally, passed tests on x86_64 CI runners, and seemed stable.
                But then we noticed something strange: the tests started failing
                intermittently on our ARM64 CI runners.</p>
<p>At first glance, it looked like a deadlock. The test runner would start,
                hang indefinitely, and then the CI job would time out. The logs showed no
                errors—just a test spinning forever. And then, after a few hours, the job
                would fail with a timeout error.</p>
<p>Here’s what the CI output looked like:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>Current runner version: '2.321.0'
Runner name: '&lt;instance-id&gt;'
Runner group name: 'Default'

(... 6 hrs of logs ...)

still running:

still running:
test_immediate_connection_drop_streaming (pid=451) for 19877.78s

Shutting down test cluster...</span></pre></div>
<p>Not much to go on here. It looked like a deadlock causing an async task to
                improperly block to us at first. It turns out we were wrong.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="initial-theories" id="initial-theories">

<p>Why just ARM64? This didn’t make a lot of sense to us in the beginning.
                Our first theories were in the difference of memory models between Intel and
                ARM64. Intel has a fairly strict memory model—while some unusual behaviors
                can happen, memory writes have a total order that all processors agree on
                (<a href="https://www.msully.net/blog/2015/02/25/the-x86-memory-model/">[1]</a>, <a href="https://research.swtch.com/hwmm">[2]</a>, <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/weakmemory/x86tso-paper.tphols.pdf">[3]</a>).
                ARM has a much more weakly-ordered memory model <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1353522.1353528">[4]</a>, where
                (among other things) writes may appear in different orders to different
                threads.</p>
<p>Since Sully’s Ph.D. thesis was on this stuff <a href="https://www.msully.net/thesis/">[5]</a>,
                this is when he got pulled in to take a look.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="debugging-on-the-ci-machine" id="debugging-on-the-ci-machine">

<p>Our nightly CI machines run on Amazon AWS, which has the advantage of giving
                us a real, uncontainerized root user. While you can connect github runners via
                ssh <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ssh-to-github-action-runner">[6]</a>, it’s
                nice to have the ability to connect as the true root user to get access to
                dmesg and other system logs.</p>
<p>To figure out what was going on, we (Sully and Matt) decided to connect
                directly to the ARM64 runner and see what was happening under the hood.</p>
<p>First, we SSH’d into the CI machine to try and find that hung process
                to connect to it:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>$ aws ssm start-session --region us-west-2 --target i-&lt;instance-id&gt;
$ ps aux | grep "451"
&lt;no output&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p>Oh, that’s right! We run the build in a Docker container and it has its own
                process namespace:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>$ sudo docker exec -it &lt;container-id&gt; /bin/sh
# ps aux | grep "451"
&lt;no output&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p>Wait, hold on. The hung process isn’t there either.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a deadlock — the process had crashed.</p>
<p>It turns out our test runner failed to detect this—but that’s fine, and a fix
                for another day. We can see if the process left a coredump. Since a Docker
                container is just a process namespace, the core dump gets passed to the Docker
                host itself. We can try to find that from outside the container with
                <code>journalctl</code>:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>$ sudo journalctl
systemd-coredump: Process 59530 (python3) of user 1000 dumped core.
                  Stack trace of thread &lt;tid&gt;:
                  ...</span></pre></div>
<p>Aha! We found it. And the core for that process lives in
                <code>/var/lib/systemd/coredump/</code> as expected. Note that we see a different pid
                here because of process namespaces: the pid outside of the container (59530)
                is different than the one inside (1000).</p>
<p>We loaded the core dump into <code>gdb</code> to see what happened. Unfortunately,
                we were greeted with a number of errors:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>$ gdb

Backtrace stopped: not enough registers or memory available to unwind further</span></pre></div>
<p>Ack. That’s not useful. We don’t have the necessary files outside of the
                container, and our containers are quite minimal and don’t allow us to easily
                install <code>gdb</code>.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to copy the relevant libraries out of the container,
                and tell <code>gdb</code> where the <code>.so</code> files live:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span># mkdir /container
# docker cp &lt;instance&gt;:/lib /container
# docker cp &lt;instance&gt;:/usr /container

<p>Much better!</p>
<p>But rather than a crash in our new HTTP code, the backtrace revealed
                something unexpected:</p>

 End of assembler dump.</span></pre></div>
<p>Huh, so it’s crashing when loading a byte while scanning for the environment
                variable of interest.</p>
<p>We can dump the current state of all the registers:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>(gdb) info reg
...
x19            0x220               544
x20            0x248b5000          613109760

pc             0xffff805a3e90      0xffff805a3e90</span></pre></div>
<p>So <code>getenv</code> was crashing trying to load from an invalid memory location
                (<code>0x220</code> – a clearly invalid memory value). But how?</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="what-was-happening" id="what-was-happening">

<p>At first, we were stumped. The crash was happening deep inside <code>libc</code>.
                We suspected something to do with environment variable corruption, given
                the call to <code>getenv</code>, but there wasn’t enough information to go on.</p>
<p>We started inspecting the environment block using <code>gdb</code>.</p>
<p>As a refresher, <code>environ</code> is defined as a <code>char **</code> by the POSIX
                standard <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/environ.7.html">[8]</a>, and is effectively an list of pointers to environment
                strings, with the end of the list marked as a <code>NULL</code> pointer.</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>(gdb) x/s ((char**) environ)[0]
0xffffddd95e6a: "GITHUB_STATE=/github/file_commands/save_state_0e5b7bd6-..."

(gdb) x/s ((char**) environ)[68]
0x0:    &lt;error: Cannot access memory at address 0x0&gt;
&lt;etc&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p>But it didn’t make sense—we were seeing a load from a space of memory that
                should not be possible, and the environment here seems to be completely valid
                and consistent. And exactly why were we calling <code>getenv</code> here?</p>
<p>And then Yury dropped in with a comment and link to an old blog post:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>&lt;yury&gt; Some file IO related operation seem to error out,
       and Python attempts to construct an exception from
       errno with PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilenameObjects

&lt;yury&gt; which probably checks on gettext (translation hook?)
       which goes into getenv

&lt;yury&gt; this could be why -- getenv isn't threadsafe

<h2 id="the-real-culprit-setenv-and-getenv">The Real Culprit: setenv and getenv</h2>
<p><code>setenv</code> is not a safe function to call in a multithreaded environment.
                This is often a problem, and occasionally rediscovered as developers like us
                hit weird crashes in libc’s <code>getenv</code>
<a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/setenv-is-not-thread-safe.html">[9]</a>, <a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2017/01/30/env/">[10]</a>,
                <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/63567">[11]</a>, <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2018/02/28/on-setenv-and-explosions/">[12]</a>.</p>
<p>This seemed like a possible cause, but given the lack of symbols here,
                we couldn’t understand how the threads that were running could contribute
                to that crash.</p>
<p>Reading the disassembly, and cross-referencing it with the C code, we
                determined that the register <code>x20</code> corresponded with the variable <code>ep</code>,
                the pointer used to walk through the <code>environ</code> array. But <code>x20</code>
                was <code>0x248b5000</code>, and <code>environ</code> was <code>0x28655750</code>, almost
                60 megabytes later in memory.</p>
<p>Since <code>x20</code> is the pointer being used to read the old environment,
                we could look at the surrounding memory to see if anything sensible
                is still there, and could then compare that to the current <code>environ</code>.</p>

<p>Interesting! The pointer values in the two areas of memory are very similar!
                And where do they start to differ? The final entries at <code>0x0000ffff6401f0b0</code>
                and <code>0x0000ffff6401f8d0</code>: corresponding to <code>SSL_CERT_FILE=...</code>
                and  <code>SSL_CERT_DIR=...</code>!</p>
<p>This was a clear hint that the race condition idea was right, and another
                thread was moving <code>environ</code> as part of a call to <code>setenv</code>! Looking at
                <code>setenv</code>, it seemed that the space of memory holding the environment block
                is too small, and it might have been reallocated to fit the new variables
                <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.17.90/source/stdlib/setenv.c#L33">[13]</a>.</p>
<p>That still left us with the question of how to find what code is calling
                <code>setenv</code>. It seemed like it could be possible that OpenSSL and/or one of
                <code>reqwest</code>’s other TLS-related dependencies (<code>rust-native-tls</code>) was
                causing the crash, but how?</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="the-connection-to-openssl-probe" id="the-connection-to-openssl-probe">

<p>A google search for those environment variables in concert with
                <code>rust-native-tls</code> pulled up an old issue: <a href="https://github.com/sfackler/rust-native-tls/issues/154">[14]</a>. And hidden in one of
                the comments was this:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>Not sure about openssl. It looks like it currently
loads the system certs by using openssl-probe to set
the SSL_CERT_FILE and SSL_CERT_DIR environment variables,
and then relies on SslConnector::builder to call
ctx.set_default_verify_paths, which looks at those
environment variables. Given that the environment variables
are set globally once, it might be best to just try to clear
the store afterwards. This seemed to work for me locally:</span></pre></div>
<p>Interesting. So <code>openssl-probe</code> sets those variables. And sure enough,
                we’re using the <code>rust-native-tls</code>
<code>openssl</code> backend on Linux which calls
                into these functions!</p>

<p>And that’s how we ended up with a crash, caused by <code>unsafe</code>-free Rust
                code badly interacting with the use of <code>libc</code> elsewhere in the program.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="an-aside-what-even-is-risc" id="an-aside-what-even-is-risc">

<p>While we both had experience with reverse engineering, our aarch64 assembly
                skills were either rusty (Matt) or nonexistent (Sully), and so we spent
                some time confused about one of the main loops in the assembly. The code
                seemed to expect <code>x20</code> to be changing, and it was the clearest candidate
                to be the register representing <code>ep</code>, but it didn’t appear on the left
                hand side of any instruction.</p>
<p>Then we noticed a curious exclamation mark:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>0x0000ffff805a3e88 &lt;+164&gt;:   ldr     x19, [x20, #8]!</span></pre></div>
<p>It turns out this is the “pre-index” address mode, which behaves like
                <code>x19 = *(x20 + 8); x20 = x20 + 8</code>
<a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102374/0102/Loads-and-stores---addressing">[16]</a>.</p>
<p>This is a cute little operator, but we are old enough to remember being told
                that auto-increment address modes were a legacy of old-school CISC machines
                like the VAX, eschewed even by more modern CISC machines like x86, and certainly
                by the elegant and simple RISC designs. Everything old is new again, I suppose.</p>

<div data-section-id="so-why-only-arm64-linux" id="so-why-only-arm64-linux">

<p>Because this crash is caused by a memory-moving <code>realloc</code>, triggered by
                <code>setenv</code> which happens at the same time another thread is calling <code>getenv</code>,
                it requires a lot of pieces to fall into the right place. The number of
                environment variables needs to be just right to cause a realloc.
                An unrelated I/O failure picked up by <code>asyncio</code> needs to call <code>getenv</code> to
                retrieve the <code>LANGUAGE</code> environment variable at exactly the same time.</p>
<p>The value <code>0x220</code> looks suspiciously close to the size of the old environment
                in 64-bit words <code>(0x220 / 8 = 68)</code>, and this value was written over the
                terminating <code>NULL</code> of the environment block before it was moved, likely to
                indicate the size of the free block to the system malloc but convenienty
                providing an improper invalid pointer landmine for use-after-free victims
                to hit.</p>
<p>Given all these preconditions, we were pretty lucky that it was even mostly
                reproducible on a single platform.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="the-fix" id="the-fix">

<p>In the end, we decided that we’re going to migrate away from <code>reqwest</code>’s
                <code>rust-native-tls</code>/<code>openssl</code> backend to <code>rustls</code> on Linux. Our original
                thinking behind using the native TLS backend was that we’d get to avoid
                shipping two TLS engines as we continue to port Python code to Rust.
                With this issue popping up, we decided that shipping two engines would be OK
                in the short term.</p>
<p>Another option would have been to arrange to call <code>try_init_ssl_cert_env_vars</code>
                for the first time with Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (the dreaded GIL) held.
                Rust has an internal lock to prevent races between Rust code reading and writing
                the environment at the same time, but it doesn’t prevent code in other languages
                from using <code>libc</code> directly. Holding the GIL would prevent us from racing with
                our Python threads, at least.</p>
<p>The Rust project has already identified this as an issue, and has planned
                on making the environment-setter functions unsafe in the 2024 edition
                <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/124866">[17]</a>. The glibc project has also
                (very) recently added more thread-safety to <code>getenv</code>, by avoiding the
                <code>realloc</code> and leaking the older environments <a href="https://github.com/bminor/glibc/commit/7a61e7f557a97ab597d6fca5e2d1f13f65685c61">[18]</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>The payment card giant <strong>MasterCard</strong> just fixed a glaring error in its domain name server settings that could have allowed anyone to intercept or divert Internet traffic for the company by registering an unused domain name. The misconfiguration persisted for nearly five years until a security researcher spent $300 to register the domain and prevent it from being grabbed by cybercriminals.</p>
<div id="attachment_70128"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70128" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/akamne.png" alt="" width="667" height="478"></p><p id="caption-attachment-70128">A DNS lookup on the domain az.mastercard.com on Jan. 14, 2025 shows the mistyped domain name a22-65.akam.ne.</p></div>
<p>From June 30, 2020 until January 14, 2025, one of the core Internet servers that MasterCard uses to direct traffic for portions of the mastercard.com network was misnamed. MasterCard.com relies on five shared Domain Name System (DNS) servers at the Internet infrastructure provider <strong>Akamai </strong>[DNS acts as a kind of Internet phone book, by translating website names to numeric Internet addresses that are easier for computers to manage].</p>
<p>All of the Akamai DNS server names that MasterCard uses are supposed to end in “akam.net” but one of them was misconfigured to rely on the domain “<strong>akam.ne</strong>.”</p>
<p>This tiny but potentially critical typo was discovered recently by <strong>Philippe Caturegli</strong>,&nbsp;founder of the security consultancy <a href="https://www.seralys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seralys</a>. Caturegli said he guessed that nobody had yet registered the domain akam.ne, which is under the purview of the top-level domain authority for the West Africa nation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Niger</a>.</p>
<p>Caturegli said it took $300 and nearly three months of waiting to secure the domain with the registry in Niger. After enabling a DNS server on akam.ne, he noticed hundreds of thousands of DNS requests hitting his server each day from locations around the globe. Apparently, MasterCard wasn’t the only organization that had fat-fingered a DNS entry to include “akam.ne,” but they were by far the largest.</p>
<p>Had he enabled an email server on his new domain akam.ne, Caturegli likely would have received wayward emails directed toward mastercard.com or other affected domains. If he’d abused his access, he probably could have <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/08/local-networks-go-global-when-domain-names-collide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obtained website encryption certificates (SSL/TLS certs)</a> that were authorized to accept and relay web traffic for affected websites. He may even have been able to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/02/dangerous-domain-corp-com-goes-up-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passively receive Microsoft Windows authentication credentials</a> from employee computers at affected companies.</p>
<p>But the researcher said he didn’t attempt to do any of that. Instead, he alerted MasterCard that the domain was theirs if they wanted it, copying this author on his notifications. A few hours later, MasterCard acknowledged the mistake, but said there was never any real threat to the security of its operations.</p>
<p>“We have looked into the matter and there was not a risk to our systems,” a MasterCard spokesperson wrote. “This typo has now been corrected.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Caturegli received a request submitted through <strong>Bugcrowd</strong>, a program that offers financial rewards and recognition to security researchers who find flaws and work privately with the affected vendor to fix them. The message suggested his public disclosure of the MasterCard DNS error via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7285038365236682753/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a post on LinkedIn</a> (after he’d secured the akam.ne domain) was not aligned with ethical security practices, and passed on a request from MasterCard to have the post removed.</p>
<div id="attachment_70126"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70126" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mastercard-response.png" alt="" width="708" height="855"></p><p id="caption-attachment-70126">MasterCard’s request to Caturegli, a.k.a. “Titon” on infosec.exchange.</p></div>
<p>Caturegli said while he does have an account on Bugcrowd, he has never submitted anything through the Bugcrowd program, and that he reported this issue directly to MasterCard.</p>
<p>“I did not disclose this issue through Bugcrowd,” Caturegli wrote in reply. “Before making any public disclosure, I ensured that the affected domain was registered to prevent exploitation, mitigating any risk to MasterCard or its customers. This action, which we took at our own expense, demonstrates our commitment to ethical security practices and responsible disclosure.” <span id="more-70117"></span></p>
<p>Most organizations have at least two authoritative domain name servers, but some handle so many DNS requests that they need to spread the load over additional DNS server domains. In MasterCard’s case, that number is five, so it stands to reason that if an attacker managed to seize control over just one of those domains they would only be able to see about one-fifth of the overall DNS requests coming in.</p>
<p>But Caturegli said the reality is that many Internet users are relying at least to some degree on public traffic forwarders or DNS resolvers like <strong>Cloudflare</strong> and <strong>Google</strong>.</p>
<p>“So all we need is for one of these resolvers to query our name server and cache the result,” Caturegli said. By setting their DNS server records with a long TTL or “Time To Live” — a setting that can adjust the lifespan of data packets on a network — an attacker’s poisoned instructions for the target domain can be propagated by large cloud providers.</p>
<p>“With a long TTL, we may reroute a LOT more than just 1/5 of the traffic,” he said.</p>
<p>The researcher said he’d hoped that the credit card giant might thank him, or at least offer to cover the cost of buying the domain.</p>
<p>“We obviously disagree with this assessment,” Caturegli wrote in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7285038365236682753?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7285038365236682753%2C7285289297706909697%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287285289297706909697%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7285038365236682753%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a follow-up post</a> on LinkedIn regarding MasterCard’s public statement. “But we’ll let you judge— here are some of the DNS lookups we recorded before reporting the issue.”</p>
<div id="attachment_70125"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70125" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mastercard-domains.png" alt="" width="790" height="561" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mastercard-domains.png 790w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mastercard-domains-768x545.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mastercard-domains-782x555.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mastercard-domains-100x70.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-70125">Caturegli posted this screenshot of MasterCard domains that were potentially at risk from the misconfigured domain.</p></div>
<p>As the screenshot above shows, the misconfigured DNS server Caturegli found involved the MasterCard subdomain <strong>az.mastercard.com</strong>. It is not clear exactly how this subdomain is used by MasterCard, however their naming conventions suggest the domains correspond to production servers at Microsoft’s <strong>Azure</strong> cloud service. Caturegli said the domains all resolve to Internet addresses at Microsoft.</p>
<p>“Don’t be like Mastercard,” Caturegli concluded in his LinkedIn post. “Don’t dismiss risk, and don’t let your marketing team handle security disclosures.”</p>
<p>One final note: The domain akam.ne has been registered previously — in December 2016 by someone using the email address um-i-delo@yandex.ru. The Russian search giant Yandex reports this user account belongs to an “Ivan I.” from Moscow. Passive DNS records from <a href="https://www.domaintools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DomainTools.com</a> show that between 2016 and 2018 the domain was connected to an Internet server in Germany, and that the domain was left to expire in 2018.</p>

<p>Figure 1: the SimpleCPU processor</p>



<p>Welcome to the world of tomorrow (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiwA0JrGfjA">Link</a>), the past and the present of computer architectures, with a small sprinkling of flashing LEDs. All good computers have to have banks of flashing lights. This web site was inspired by an article by Alan Clements (<a href="http://alanclements.org/teachingarchitecture.html">Link</a>), in this he discusses the pressures faced in teaching computer architectures. After teaching this topic for about 20 years i also came to the same conclusions, although being an electronic engineer i still embrace the power of ICs, wires and LEDs as teaching tools :). Therefore, to hopefully support computer architectures teaching i have created the resources below.</p>

<p>For those who have not taught computer architectures before this may seem an outdated, or redundant topic i.e. why do students need to know what happens inside a CPU, very few students will go on design one? To me this way of thinking highlights the misunderstanding of the purpose of teaching computer architectures. To steal a quote from Alan:</p>

<p><i>"Computer architecture is awash with concepts that are fundamental to computer science generally and which do not appear in other parts of the undergraduate curriculum. A course in computer architecture can provide a suitable forum for incorporating fundamental principles in the CS curriculum." </i></p>

<p>Computer architectures for me was never really about hardware design (although its the bit i enjoy the most), its about understanding the complete system, software and hardware. How the software we write is translated into results we can use. I'm a great believer in that you don't truly understand something until you can build it yourself and use it to solve a real world problem. To often i find students that are taught computer science at A-level know the words, but have not had the opportunity of apply this knowledge, therefore, have not had the chance to make those all important final steps to upstanding what the words really mean. Therefore, i designed the SimpleCPU architecture. Over a series of labs students design and implement this architecture using Xilinx's ISE schematic tools, so that you see the wires, not HDL :), configure FPGA boards and program these systems using assembler and macros to solve image processing problems e.g. find Bob the Bug, shown below.</p>

<p><a href="http://simplecpudesign.com/Images/bob.jpg"><img src="http://simplecpudesign.com/Images/bob_tmb.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Figure 2 : Bob</p>

<p>To me this is how computer architectures should be taught, a journey from being to end, no hidden details, just simple fundamental computer science, that hopefully everyone can understand. To conclude, i'm not saying that every student has to be able to understand Intels latest and greatest beasts (architectures) to use them, but if you don't have a basic understanding of how data is represented, or how instructions are processed, very strange things can happen when you try to run your code. At best it may just take a little longer to execute, at worst it can take down the whole machine.</p>

<h2>A Simple CPU</h2>

<p>Below are a series of blog type discussions on the development of the SimpleCPU processor, their aim is to give an insight into the design decisions made when implementing these machines. To often when discussing computer architectures we use adjectives such as complex, simple e.g. CISC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">Link</a>) and RISC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">Link</a>). I've grownup with this machine evolution, programmed them and designed a few, so i can place these words into a software and hardware context. For people new to this topic these are just words. What is simple? What is complex? How do you measure/compare these design philosophies? To me this disconnect is a problem. Therefore, being an engineer the only valid solution to teach people these ideas is: build it. In the past building your own processor was a little on the tricky side, but with the advent of programmable logic devices it now a possibility. I hope the source files and discussions below will be the starting point for people wanting to design their own processors and machine languages. These are not intended to be a complete set of notes on computer architectures, rather an introduction to this topic through the implementation of this processor in either SPLD or FPGA devices. A starting point, a foot on the road to CPU design, hopefully highlighting questions about computer architectures people have not considered before. Have fun and don't under estimate he power of the flashing LED, there is nothing more satisfying than convincing a processor to do what you tell it to :).</p>

<h2>Networking</h2>

<p>In addition to teaching an introductory module on basic computer architectures i now also teach an introductory module on basic networking, starting to forgot what my specialism is :). As always the only way to understand anything is to build it, get hand on experience of "real" networks, well as real as i can make them given security considerations. This module is designed around a collection of different Raspberry Pi based systems, giving students the opportunity to get hands on experience of designing and building actual networks, and the real world joys that come with networking :). Confess, when i think about networking i'm always reminded of an old  nursery rhyme, to paraphrase: when it is good, its very, very good, but when it is bad it is horrid. Tracking down network faults are an adventure into the world of "but it should work", a multidimensional puzzle, but very rewarding when the pieces fall into place and it just works. Below are a series of blog type discussions on the development of this hardware, as with the SimpleCPU their aim is give an insight into the design decisions made when implementing these machines. Supporting these web pages are a series of related videos on my Youtube channel, links below.</p>

            <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 15:05:34 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/21/1110260/openai-ups-its-lobbying-efforts-nearly-seven-fold/">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/21/1110260/openai-ups-its-lobbying-efforts-nearly-seven-fold/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42793567">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div> <p>OpenAI spent $1.76 million on government lobbying in 2024 and $510,000 in the last three months of the year alone, according to a new disclosure filed on January 22—a significant jump from 2023, when the company spent just $260,000 on Capitol Hill. </p>  <p>The company also disclosed a new in-house lobbyist, Meghan Dorn, who worked for five years for Senator Lindsey Graham and started at OpenAI in October. The filing also shows activity related to two new pieces of legislation in the final months of the year: the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9497/text">House’s</a> AI Advancement and Reliability Act, which would set up a government center for AI research, and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4178/text">Senate’s</a> Future of Artificial Intelligence Innovation Act, which would create shared benchmark tests for AI models.&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>OpenAI did not respond to questions about its lobbying efforts.</p>  <p>But perhaps more important, the disclosure is a clear signal of the company’s arrival as a political player, as its first year of serious lobbying ends and Republican control of Washington begins. While OpenAI’s lobbying spending is still dwarfed by its peers’—Meta tops the list of Big Tech spenders, with more than $24 million in 2024—the uptick comes as it and other AI companies have helped redraw the shape of AI policy.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>For the past few years, AI policy has been something like a whack-a-mole response to the risks posed by deepfakes and misinformation. But over the last year, AI companies have started to position the success of the technology as pivotal to national security and American competitiveness, arguing that the government must therefore support the industry’s growth. As a result, OpenAI and others now seem poised to gain access to cheaper energy, lucrative national security contracts, and a more lax regulatory environment that’s unconcerned with the minutiae of AI safety.</p>  <p>While the big players seem more or less aligned on this grand narrative, messy divides on other issues are still threatening to break through the harmony on display at President Trump’s inauguration this week.</p> 
 <p>AI regulation really began in earnest after ChatGPT launched in November 2022. At that point, “a lot of the conversation was about responsibility,” says Liana Keesing, campaigns manager for technology reform at Issue One, a democracy nonprofit that tracks Big Tech’s influence.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Companies were asked what they’d do about sexually abusive <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/13/1064810/how-it-feels-to-be-sexually-objectified-by-an-ai/">deepfake images</a> and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/15/1073019/catching-bad-content-in-the-age-of-ai/">election disinformation</a>. “Sam Altman did a very good job coming in and painting himself early as a supporter of that process,” Keesing says.&nbsp;</p>  <p>OpenAI started its official lobbying effort around October 2023, hiring Chan Park—a onetime Senate Judiciary Committee counsel and Microsoft lobbyist—to lead the effort. Lawmakers, particularly then Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, were vocal about wanting to curb these particular harms; OpenAI hired Schumer’s former legal counsel, Reginald Babin, as a lobbyist, according to data from OpenSecrets. This past summer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/technology/openai-chris-lehane.html">the company hired the veteran political operative Chris Lehane</a> as its head of global policy.&nbsp;</p>  <p>OpenAI’s previous disclosures confirm that the company’s lobbyists subsequently focused much of last year on legislation like the No Fakes Act and the Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act. The bills did not materialize into law. But as the year went on, the regulatory goals of AI companies began to change. “One of the biggest shifts that we’ve seen,” Keesing says, “is that they’ve really started to focus on energy.”&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>In September, Altman, along with leaders from Nvidia, Anthropic, and Google, visited the White House and pitched the vision that US competitiveness in AI will depend on subsidized energy infrastructure to train the best models. Altman proposed to the Biden administration the construction of multiple five-gigawatt data centers, which would each consume as much electricity as New York City.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Around the same time, companies like Meta and Microsoft started to say that nuclear energy will provide the path forward for AI, announcing deals aimed at <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/16/1110016/new-nuclear-power/">firing up new nuclear power plants</a>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>It seems likely OpenAI’s policy team was already planning for this particular shift. In April, the company hired lobbyist Matthew Rimkunas, who worked for Bill Gates’s sustainable energy effort Breakthrough Energies and, before that, spent 16 years working for Senator Graham; the South Carolina Republican serves on the Senate subcommittee that manages nuclear safety.&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>This new AI energy race is inseparable from the positioning of AI as essential for national security and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/21/1110269/there-can-be-no-winners-in-a-us-china-ai-arms-race/">US competitiveness</a> with China. OpenAI laid out its position in a blog post in October, writing, “AI is a transformational technology that can be used to strengthen democratic values or to undermine them. That’s why we believe democracies should continue to take the lead in AI development.” Then in December, the company went a step further and reversed its policy against working with the military, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/04/1107897/openais-new-defense-contract-completes-its-military-pivot/">announcing</a> it would develop AI models with the defense-tech company Anduril to help take down drones around military bases.&nbsp;</p> 

 <p>That same month, Sam Altman said during an <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sam-altman-openai-feud-with-elon">interview</a> with<em> The Free Press</em> that the Biden administration was “not that effective” in shepherding AI: “The things that I think should have been the administration’s priorities, and I hope will be the next administration’s priorities, are building out massive AI infrastructure in the US, having a supply chain in the US, things like that.”</p>  <p>That characterization glosses over the CHIPS Act, a $52 billion stimulus to the domestic chips industry that is, at least on paper, aligned with Altman’s vision. (It also preceded an executive order Biden issued just last week, to lease federal land to host the type of gigawatt-scale data centers that Altman had been asking for.)</p>  <p>Intentionally or not, Altman’s posture aligned him with the growing camaraderie between President Trump and Silicon Valley. Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Sundar Pichai all sat directly behind Trump’s family at the inauguration on Monday, and Altman also attended. Many of them had also made sizable donations to Trump’s inaugural fund, with Altman personally <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sam-altman-donald-trump-openai-3b7a87037f3718eb3edc73e94be8a61a">throwing</a> in $1 million.</p>  <p>It’s easy to view the inauguration as evidence that these tech leaders are aligned with each other, and with other players in Trump’s orbit. But there are still some key dividing lines that will be worth watching. Notably, there’s the clash over H-1B visas, which allow many noncitizen AI researchers to work in the US. Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy (who is, as of this week, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/20/doge-musk-helped-eject-ramaswamy-00199487">no longer</a> a part of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency) have been pushing for that visa program to be expanded. This sparked backlash from some allies of the Trump administration, perhaps most loudly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/10/h-1b-visas-bannon-sanders-musk-trump">Steve Bannon</a>.&nbsp;</p> </div><div><p>Another fault line is the battle between open- and closed-source AI. Google and OpenAI prevent anyone from knowing exactly what’s in their most powerful models, often arguing that this keeps them from being used improperly by bad actors. Musk has sued OpenAI and Microsoft over the issue, alleging that closed-source models are antithetical to OpenAI’s hybrid nonprofit structure. Meta, whose Llama <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/18/1076479/metas-latest-ai-model-is-free-for-all/">model</a> is open-source, recently <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/elon-musk-open-ai-lawsuit-response-c1f415f8">sided</a> with Musk in that lawsuit. Venture capitalist and Trump ally Marc Andreessen echoed these criticisms of OpenAI on <a href="https://x.com/pmarca/status/1881614440174678339">X</a> just hours after the inauguration. (Andreessen has also <a href="https://www.schumer.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Marc%20Andreessen.pdf">said</a> that making AI models open-source “makes overbearing regulations unnecessary.”)&nbsp;</p>  <p>Finally, there are the battles over bias and free speech. The vastly different approaches that social media companies have taken to moderating content—including Meta’s recent <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/13/1109954/mark-zuckerberg-and-the-power-of-the-media/">announcement</a> that it would end its US fact-checking program—raise questions about whether the way AI models are moderated will continue to splinter too. Musk has lamented what he calls the “wokeness” of many leading models, and Andreessen said on Tuesday that “Chinese LLMs are much less censored than American LLMs” (though that’s not quite true, given that many Chinese AI models have government-mandated <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/leonardlin/chinese-llm-censorship-analysis">censorship</a> in place that forbids particular topics). Altman has been more equivocal: “No two people are ever going to agree that one system is perfectly unbiased,” he told <em>The Free Press.</em></p>  <p>It’s only the start of a new era in Washington, but the White House has been busy. It has repealed many executive orders signed by President Biden, including the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/30/1082678/three-things-to-know-about-the-white-houses-executive-order-on-ai/">landmark order on AI</a> that imposed rules for government use of the technology (while it appears to have kept Biden’s order on leasing land for more data centers). Altman is busy as well. OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-announces-private-sector-ai-infrastructure-investment/">reportedly</a> plan to spend up to $500 billion on a joint venture for new data centers; the project was announced by President Trump, with Altman standing alongside. And according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/19/ai-superagent-openai-meta"><em>Axios</em></a>, Altman will also be part of a closed-door briefing with government officials on January 30, reportedly about OpenAI’s development of a powerful new AI agent. </p></div></div></div>]]></description>

          earliest version of this article was given as a talk at a conference
          called by the Southern Female Rights Union, held in Beulah, Mississippi
          in May 1970. It was written up for <u>Notes from the Third Year</u> (1971),
          but the editors did not use it. It was then submitted to several movement
          publications, but only one asked permission to publish it; others did
          so without permission. The first official place of publication was
          in Vol. 2, No. 1 of <u>The Second Wave</u> (1972). This early version
          in movement publications was authored by Joreen. Different versions
          were published in the <u>Berkeley Journal of Sociology</u>, Vol. 17,
          1972-73, pp. 151-165, and <u>Ms.</u> magazine, July 1973, pp. 76-78,
          86-89, authored by Jo Freeman. This piece spread all over the world.
          Numerous people have edited, reprinted, cut, and translated "Tyranny" for
          magazines, books and web sites, usually without the permission or knowledge
          of the author. The version below is a blend of the three cited here. </span></p></div>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">During 
        the years in which the women's liberation movement has been taking shape, 
        a great emphasis has been placed on what are called leaderless, structureless 
        groups as the main -- if not sole -- organizational form of the movement. 
        The source of this idea was a natural reaction against the over-structured 
        society in which most of us found ourselves, and the inevitable control 
        this gave others over our lives, and the continual elitism of the Left 
        and similar groups among those who were supposedly fighting this overstructuredness.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The 
        idea of "structurelessness," however, has moved from a healthy 
        counter to those tendencies to becoming a goddess in its own right. The 
        idea is as little examined as the term is much used, but it has become 
        an intrinsic and unquestioned part of women's liberation ideology. For 
        the early development of the movement this did not much matter. It early 
        defined its main goal, and its main method, as consciousness-raising, 
        and the "structureless" rap group was an excellent means to 
        this end. The looseness and informality of it encouraged participation 
        in discussion, and its often supportive atmosphere elicited personal insight. 
        If nothing more concrete than personal insight ever resulted from these 
        groups, that did not much matter, because their purpose did not really 
        extend beyond this.<br>

          basic problems didn't appear until individual rap groups exhausted
          the virtues of consciousness-raising and decided they wanted to do
          something more specific. At this point they usually foundered because
          most groups were unwilling to change their structure when they changed
          their tasks. Women had thoroughly accepted the idea of "structurelessness" without
          realizing the limitations of its uses. People would try to use the "structureless" group
          and the informal conference for purposes for which they were unsuitable
          out of a blind belief that no other means could possibly be anything
          but oppressive.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">If
          the movement is to grow beyond these elementary stages of development,
          it will have to disabuse itself of some of its prejudices about organization
          and structure. There is nothing inherently bad about either of these.
          They can be and often are misused, but to reject them out of hand because
          they are misused is to deny ourselves the necessary tools to further
          development. We need to understand why "structurelessness" does
      not work.</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FORMAL 
        AND INFORMAL STRUCTURES</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Contrary 
        to what we would like to believe, there is no such thing as a structureless 
        group. Any group of people of whatever nature that comes together for 
        any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure itself in 
        some fashion. The structure may be flexible; it may vary over time; it 
        may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources over the 
        members of the group. But it will be formed regardless of the abilities, 
        personalities, or intentions of the people involved. The very fact that 
        we are individuals, with different talents, predispositions, and backgrounds 
        makes this inevitable. Only if we refused to relate or interact on any 
        basis whatsoever could we approximate structurelessness -- and that is 
        not the nature of a human group.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">This 
        means that to strive for a structureless group is as useful, and as deceptive, 
        as to aim at an "objective" news story, "value-free" 
        social science, or a "free" economy. A "laissez faire" 
        group is about as realistic as a "laissez faire" society; the 
        idea becomes a smokescreen for the strong or the lucky to establish unquestioned 
        hegemony over others. This hegemony can be so easily established because 
        the idea of "structurelessness" does not prevent the formation 
        of informal structures, only formal ones. Similarly "laissez faire" 
        philosophy did not prevent the economically powerful from establishing 
        control over wages, prices, and distribution of goods; it only prevented 
        the government from doing so. Thus structurelessness becomes a way of 
        masking power, and within the women's movement is usually most strongly 
        advocated by those who are the most powerful (whether they are conscious 
        of their power or not). As long as the structure of the group is informal, 
        the rules of how decisions are made are known only to a few and awareness 
        of power is limited to those who know the rules. Those who do not know 
        the rules and are not chosen for initiation must remain in confusion, 
        or suffer from paranoid delusions that something is happening of which 
        they are not quite aware.<br>

          everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and
          to participate in its activities the structure must be explicit, not
          implicit. The rules of decision-making must be open and available to
          everyone, and this can happen only if they are formalized. This is
          not to say that formalization of a structure of a group will destroy
          the informal structure. It usually doesn't. But it does hinder the
          informal structure from having predominant control and make available
          some means of attacking it if the people involved are not at least
          responsible to the needs of the group at large. "Structurelessness" is
          organizationally impossible. We cannot decide whether to have a structured
          or structureless group, only whether or not to have a formally structured
          one. Therefore the word will not be used any longer except to refer
          to the idea it represents. Unstructured will refer to those groups
          which have not been deliberately structured in a particular manner.
          Structured will refer to those which have. A Structured group always
          has formal structure, and may also have an informal, or covert, structure.
          It is this informal structure, particularly in Unstructured groups,
          which forms the basis for elites.</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE 
        NATURE OF ELITISM</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">"Elitist" 
        is probably the most abused word in the women's liberation movement. It 
        is used as frequently, and for the same reasons, as "pinko" 
        was used in the fifties. It is rarely used correctly. Within the movement 
        it commonly refers to individuals, though the personal characteristics 
        and activities of those to whom it is directed may differ widely: An individual, 
        as an individual can never be an elitist, because the only proper application 
        of the term "elite" is to groups. Any individual, regardless 
        of how well-known that person may be, can never be an elite.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Correctly, 
        an elite refers to a small group of people who have power over a larger 
        group of which they are part, usually without direct responsibility to 
        that larger group, and often without their knowledge or consent. A person 
        becomes an elitist by being part of, or advocating the rule by, such a 
        small group, whether or not that individual is well known or not known 
        at all. Notoriety is not a definition of an elitist. The most insidious 
        elites are usually run by people not known to the larger public at all. 
        Intelligent elitists are usually smart enough not to allow themselves 
        to become well known; when they become known, they are watched, and the 
        mask over their power is no longer firmly lodged.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Elites 
        are not conspiracies. Very seldom does a small group of people get together 
        and deliberately try to take over a larger group for its own ends. Elites 
        are nothing more, and nothing less, than groups of friends who also happen 
        to participate in the same political activities. They would probably maintain 
        their friendship whether or not they were involved in political activities; 
        they would probably be involved in political activities whether or not 
        they maintained their friendships. It is the coincidence of these two 
        phenomena which creates elites in any group and makes them so difficult 
        to break.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">These 
        friendship groups function as networks of communication outside any regular 
        channels for such communication that may have been set up by a group. 
        If no channels are set up, they function as the only networks of communication. 
        Because people are friends, because they usually share the same values 
        and orientations, because they talk to each other socially and consult 
        with each other when common decisions have to be made, the people involved 
        in these networks have more power in the group than those who don't. And 
        it is a rare group that does not establish some informal networks of communication 
        through the friends that are made in it.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Some 
        groups, depending on their size, may have more than one such informal 
        communications network. Networks may even overlap. When only one such 
        network exists, it is the elite of an otherwise Unstructured group, whether 
        the participants in it want to be elitists or not. If it is the only such 
        network in a Structured group it may or may not be an elite depending 
        on its composition and the nature of the formal Structure. If there are 
        two or more such networks of friends, they may compete for power within 
        the group, thus forming factions, or one may deliberately opt out of the 
        competition, leaving the other as the elite. In a Structured group, two 
        or more such friendship networks usually compete with each other for formal 
        power. This is often the healthiest situation, as the other members are 
        in a position to arbitrate between the two competitors for power and thus 
        to make demands on those to whom they give their temporary allegiance.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The 
        inevitably elitist and exclusive nature of informal communication networks 
        of friends is neither a new phenomenon characteristic of the women's movement 
        nor a phenomenon new to women. Such informal relationships have excluded 
        women for centuries from participating in integrated groups of which they 
        were a part. In any profession or organization these networks have created 
        the "locker room" mentality and the "old school" ties 
        which have effectively prevented women as a group (as well as some men 
        individually) from having equal access to the sources of power or social 
        reward. Much of the energy of past women's movements has been directed 
        to having the structures of decision-making and the selection processes 
        formalized so that the exclusion of women could be confronted directly. 
        As we well know, these efforts have not prevented the informal male-only 
        networks from discriminating against women, but they have made it more 
        difficult.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Because 
        elites are informal does not mean they are invisible. At any small group 
        meeting anyone with a sharp eye and an acute ear can tell who is influencing 
        whom. The members of a friendship group will relate more to each other 
        than to other people. They listen more attentively, and interrupt less; 
        they repeat each other's points and give in amiably; they tend to ignore 
        or grapple with the "outs" whose approval is not necessary for 
        making a decision. But it is necessary for the "outs" to stay 
        on good terms with the "ins." Of course the lines are not as 
        sharp as I have drawn them. They are nuances of interaction, not prewritten 
        scripts. But they are discernible, and they do have their effect. Once 
        one knows with whom it is important to check before a decision is made, 
        and whose approval is the stamp of acceptance, one knows who is running 
        things.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Since 
        movement groups have made no concrete decisions about who shall exercise 
        power within them, many different criteria are used around the country. 
        Most criteria are along the lines of traditional female characteristics. 
        For instance, in the early days of the movement, marriage was usually 
        a prerequisite for participation in the informal elite. As women have 
        been traditionally taught, married women relate primarily to each other, 
        and look upon single women as too threatening to have as close friends. 
        In many cities, this criterion was further refined to include only those 
        women married to New Left men. This standard had more than tradition behind 
        it, however, because New Left men often had access to resources needed 
        by the movement -- such as mailing lists, printing presses, contacts, 
        and information -- and women were used to getting what they needed through 
        men rather than independently. As the movement has charged through time, 
        marriage has become a less universal criterion for effective participation, 
        but all informal elites establish standards by which only women who possess 
        certain material or personal characteristics may join. They frequently 
        include: middle-class background (despite all the rhetoric about relating 
        to the working class); being married; not being married but living with 
        someone; being or pretending to be a lesbian; being between the ages of 
        twenty and thirty; being college educated or at least having some college 
        background; being "hip"; not being too "hip"; holding 
        a certain political line or identification as a "radical"; having 
        children or at least liking them; not having children; having certain 
        "feminine" personality characteristics such as being "nice"; 
        dressing right (whether in the traditional style or the antitraditional 
        style); etc. There are also some characteristics which will almost always 
        tag one as a "deviant" who should not be related to. They include: 
        being too old; working full time, particularly if one is actively committed 
        to a "career"; not being "nice"; and being avowedly 
        single (i.e., neither actively heterosexual nor homosexual).<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Other 
        criteria could be included, but they all have common themes. The characteristics 
        prerequisite for participating in the informal elites of the movement, 
        and thus for exercising power, concern one's background, personality, 
        or allocation of time. They do not include one's competence, dedication 
        to feminism, talents, or potential contribution to the movement. The former 
        are the criteria one usually uses in determining one's friends. The latter 
        are what any movement or organization has to use if it is going to be 
        politically effective.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The 
        criteria of participation may differ from group to group, but the means 
        of becoming a member of the informal elite if one meets those criteria 
        art pretty much the same. The only main difference depends on whether 
        one is in a group from the beginning, or joins it after it has begun. 
        If involved from the beginning it is important to have as many of one's 
        personal friends as possible also join. If no one knows anyone else very 
        well, then one must deliberately form friendships with a select number 
        and establish the informal interaction patterns crucial to the creation 
        of an informal structure. Once the informal patterns are formed they act 
        to maintain themselves, and one of the most successful tactics of maintenance 
        is to continuously recruit new people who "fit in." One joins 
        such an elite much the same way one pledges a sorority. If perceived as 
        a potential addition, one is "rushed" by the members of the 
        informal structure and eventually either dropped or initiated. If the 
        sorority is not politically aware enough to actively engage in this process 
        itself it can be started by the outsider pretty much the same way one 
        joins any private club. Find a sponsor, i.e., pick some member of the 
        elite who appears to be well respected within it, and actively cultivate 
        that person's friendship. Eventually, she will most likely bring you into 
        the inner circle.<br>

          of these procedures take time. So if one works full time or has a similar
          major commitment, it is usually impossible to join simply because there
          are not enough hours left to go to all the meetings and cultivate the
          personal relationship necessary to have a voice in the decision-making.
          That is why formal structures of decision making are a boon to the
          overworked person. Having an established process for decision-making
          ensures that everyone can participate in it to some extent.<br>

          has been critical in perspective, it is not made in the belief that
          these informal structures are inevitably bad -- merely inevitable.
          All groups create informal structures as a result of interaction patterns
          among the members of the group. Such informal structures can do very
          useful things But only Unstructured groups are totally governed by
          them. When informal elites are combined with a myth of "structurelessness," there
          can be no attempt to put limits on the use of power. It becomes capricious.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">This
          has two potentially negative consequences of which we should be aware.
          The first is that the informal structure of decision-making will be
          much like a sorority -- one in which people listen to others because
          they like them and not because they say significant things. As long
          as the movement does not do significant things this does not much matter.
          But if its development is not to be arrested at this preliminary stage,
          it will have to alter this trend. The second is that informal structures
          have no obligation to be responsible to the group at large. Their power
          was not given to them; it cannot be taken away. Their influence is
          not based on what they do for the group; therefore they cannot be directly
          influenced by the group. This does not necessarily make informal structures
          irresponsible. Those who are concerned with maintaining their influence
          will usually try to be responsible. The group simply cannot compel
      such responsibility; it is dependent on the interests of the elite.</span></p>

        THE "STAR" SYSTEM</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The 
        idea of "structurelessness" has created the "star" 
        system. We live in a society which expects political groups to make decisions 
        and to select people to articulate those decisions to the public at large. 
        The press and the public do not know how to listen seriously to individual 
        women as women; they want to know how the group feels. Only three techniques 
        have ever been developed for establishing mass group opinion: the vote 
        or referendum, the public opinion survey questionnaire, and the selection 
        of group spokespeople at an appropriate meeting. The women's liberation 
        movement has used none of these to communicate with the public. Neither 
        the movement as a whole nor most of the multitudinous groups within it 
        have established a means of explaining their position on various issues. 
        But the public is conditioned to look for spokespeople.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">While 
        it has consciously not chosen spokespeople, the movement has thrown up 
        many women who have caught the public eye for varying reasons. These women 
        represent no particular group or established opinion; they know this and 
        usually say so. But because there are no official spokespeople nor any 
        decision-making body that the press can query when it wants to know the 
        movement's position on a subject, these women are perceived as the spokespeople. 
        Thus, whether they want to or not, whether the movement likes it or not, 
        women of public note are put in the role of spokespeople by default.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">This 
        is one main source of the ire that is often felt toward the women who 
        are labeled "stars." Because they were not selected by the women 
        in the movement to represent the movement's views, they are resented when 
        the press presumes that they speak for the movement. But as long as the 
        movement does not select its own spokeswomen, such women will be placed 
        in that role by the press and the public, regardless of their own desires.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">This 
        has several negative consequences for both the movement and the women 
        labeled "stars." First, because the movement didn't put them 
        in the role of spokesperson, the movement cannot remove them. The press 
        put them there and only the press can choose not to listen. The press 
        will continue to look to "stars" as spokeswomen as long as it 
        has no official alternatives to go to for authoritative statements from 
        the movement. The movement has no control in the selection of its representatives 
        to the public as long as it believes that it should have no representatives 
        at all. Second, women put in this position often find themselves viciously 
        attacked by their sisters. This achieves nothing for the movement and 
        is painfully destructive to the individuals involved. Such attacks only 
        result in either the woman leaving the movement entirely-often bitterly 
        alienated -- or in her ceasing to feel responsible to her "sisters." 
        She may maintain some loyalty to the movement, vaguely defined, but she 
        is no longer susceptible to pressures from other women in it. One cannot 
        feel responsible to people who have been the source of such pain without 
        being a masochist, and these women are usually too strong to bow to that 
        kind of personal pressure. Thus the backlash to the "star" system 
        in effect encourages the very kind of individualistic nonresponsibility 
        that the movement condemns. By purging a sister as a "star," 
        the movement loses whatever control it may have had over the person who 
        then becomes free to commit all of the individualistic sins of which she 
      has been accused.</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">POLITICAL 
        IMPOTENCE</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Unstructured 
        groups may be very effective in getting women to talk about their lives; 
        they aren't very good for getting things done. It is when people get tired 
        of "just talking" and want to do something more that the groups 
        flounder, unless they change the nature of their operation. Occasionally, 
        the developed informal structure of the group coincides with an available 
        need that the group can fill in such a way as to give the appearance that 
        an Unstructured group "works." That is, the group has fortuitously 
        developed precisely the kind of structure best suited for engaging in 
        a particular project. <br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">While working in this kind of group is a very heady experience, it is also rare 
        and very hard to replicate. There are almost inevitably four conditions 
        found in such a group;<br>
      </span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">1)<i> 
        It is task oriented</i>. Its function is very narrow and very specific, 
        like putting on a conference or putting out a newspaper. It is the task 
        that basically structures the group. The task determines what needs to 
        be done and when it needs to be done. It provides a guide by which people 
        can judge their actions and make plans for future activity.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">2) 
        <i>It is relatively small and homogeneous</i>. Homogeneity is necessary 
        to insure that participants have a "common language" for interaction. 
        People from widely different backgrounds may provide richness to a consciousness-raising 
        group where each can learn from the others' experience, but too great 
        a diversity among members of a task-oriented group means only that they 
        continually misunderstand each other. Such diverse people interpret words 
        and actions differently. They have different expectations about each other's 
        behavior and judge the results according to different criteria. If everyone 
        knows everyone else well enough to understand the nuances, these can be 
        accommodated. Usually, they only lead to confusion and endless hours spent 
        straightening out conflicts no one ever thought would arise.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">3) 
        <i>There is a high degree of communication</i>. Information must be passed 
        on to everyone, opinions checked, work divided up, and participation assured 
        in the relevant decisions. This is only possible if the group is small 
        and people practically live together for the most crucial phases of the 
        task. Needless to say, the number of interactions necessary to involve 
        everybody increases geometrically with the number of participants. This 
        inevitably limits group participants to about five, or excludes some from 
        some of the decisions. Successful groups can be as large as 10 or 15, 
        but only when they are in fact composed of several smaller subgroups which 
        perform specific parts of the task, and whose members overlap with each 
        other so that knowledge of what the different subgroups are doing can 
        be passed around easily.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">4) 
        <i>There is a low degree of skill specialization</i>. Not everyone has 
        to be able to do everything, but everything must be able to be done by 
        more than one person. Thus no one is indispensable. To a certain extent, 
        people become interchangeable parts.<br>
      </span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">While 
        these conditions can occur serendipitously in small groups, this is not 
        possible in large ones. Consequently, because the larger movement in most 
        cities is as unstructured as individual rap groups, it is not too much 
        more effective than the separate groups at specific tasks. The informal 
        structure is rarely together enough or in touch enough with the people 
        to be able to operate effectively. So the movement generates much motion 
        and few results. Unfortunately, the consequences of all this motion are 
        not as innocuous as the results' and their victim is the movement itself.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Some 
        groups have formed themselves into local action projects if they do not 
        involve many people and work on a small scale. But this form restricts 
        movement activity to the local level; it cannot be done on the regional 
        or national. Also, to function well the groups must usually pare themselves 
        down to that informal group of friends who were running things in the 
        first place. This excludes many women from participating. As long as the 
        only way women can participate in the movement is through membership in 
        a small group, the nongregarious are at a distinct disadvantage. As long 
        as friendship groups are the main means of organizational activity, elitism 
        becomes institutionalized.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">For 
        those groups which cannot find a local project to which to devote themselves, 
        the mere act of staying together becomes the reason for their staying 
        together. When a group has no specific task (and consciousness raising 
        is a task), the people in it turn their energies to controlling others 
        in the group. This is not done so much out of a malicious desire to manipulate 
        others (though sometimes it is) as out of a lack of anything better to 
        do with their talents. Able people with time on their hands and a need 
        to justify their coming together put their efforts into personal control, 
        and spend their time criticizing the personalities of the other members 
        in the group. Infighting and personal power games rule the day. When a 
        group is involved in a task, people learn to get along with others as 
        they are and to subsume personal dislikes for the sake of the larger goal. 
        There are limits placed on the compulsion to remold every person in our 
        image of what they should be.<br>

          end of consciousness-raising leaves people with no place to go, and
          the lack of structure leaves them with no way of getting there. The
          women the movement either turn in on themselves and their sisters or
          seek other alternatives of action. There are few that are available.
          Some women just "do their own thing." This can lead to a
          great deal of individual creativity, much of which is useful for the
          movement, but it is not a viable alternative for most women and certainly
          does not foster a spirit of cooperative group effort. Other women drift
          out of the movement entirely because they don't want to develop an
          individual project and they have found no way of discovering, joining,
          or starting group projects that interest them.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Many
          turn to other political organizations to give them the kind of structured,
          effective activity that they have not been able to find in the women's
          movement. Those political organizations which see women's liberation
          as only one of many issues to which women should devote their time
          thus find the movement a vast recruiting ground for new members. There
          is no need for such organizations to "infiltrate" (though
          this is not precluded). The desire for meaningful political activity
          generated in women by their becoming part of the women's liberation
          movement is sufficient to make them eager to join other organizations
          when the movement itself provides no outlets for their new ideas and
          energies. Those women who join other political organizations while
          remaining within the women's liberation movement, or who join women's
          liberation while remaining in other political organizations, in turn
          become the framework for new informal structures. These friendship
          networks are based upon their common nonfeminist politics rather than
          the characteristics discussed earlier, but operate in much the same
          way. Because these women share common values, ideas, and political
          orientations, they too become informal, unplanned, unselected, unresponsible
          elites -- whether they intend to be so or not.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">These
          new informal elites are often perceived as threats by the old informal
          elites previously developed within different movement groups. This
          is a correct perception. Such politically oriented networks are rarely
          willing to be merely "sororities" as many of the old ones
          were, and want to proselytize their political as well as their feminist
          ideas. This is only natural, but its implications for women's liberation
          have never been adequately discussed. The old elites are rarely willing
          to bring such differences of opinion out into the open because it would
          involve exposing the nature of the informal structure of the group.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Many
          of these informal elites have been hiding under the banner of "anti-elitism" and "structurelessness." To
          effectively counter the competition from another informal structure,
          they would have to become "public," and this possibility
          is fraught with many dangerous implications. Thus, to maintain its
          own power, it is easier to rationalize the exclusion of the members
          of the other informal structure by such means as "red-baiting," "reformist-baiting," "lesbian-baiting," or "straight-baiting." The
          only other alternative is to formally structure the group in such a
          way that the original power structure is institutionalized. This is
          not always possible. If the informal elites have been well structured
          and have exercised a fair amount of power in the past, such a task
          is feasible. These groups have a history of being somewhat politically
          effective in the past, as the tightness of the informal structure has
          proven an adequate substitute for a formal structure. Becoming Structured
          does not alter their operation much, though the institutionalization
          of the power structure does open it to formal challenge. It is those
          groups which are in greatest need of structure that are often least
          capable of creating it. Their informal structures have not been too
          well formed and adherence to the ideology of "structurelessness" makes
          them reluctant to change tactics. The more Unstructured a group is,
          the more lacking it is in informal structures, and the more it adheres
          to an ideology of "structurelessness," the more vulnerable
          it is to being taken over by a group of political comrades.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Since
          the movement at large is just as Unstructured as most of its constituent
          groups, it is similarly susceptible to indirect influence. But the
          phenomenon manifests itself differently. On a local level most groups
          can operate autonomously; but the only groups that can organize a national
          activity are nationally organized groups. Thus, it is often the Structured
          feminist organizations that provide national direction for feminist
          activities, and this direction is determined by the priorities of those
          organizations. Such groups as NOW, WEAL, and some leftist women's caucuses
          are simply the only organizations capable of mounting a national campaign.
          The multitude of Unstructured women's liberation groups can choose
          to support or not support the national campaigns, but are incapable
          of mounting their own. Thus their members become the troops under the
          leadership of the Structured organizations. The avowedly Unstructured
          groups have no way of drawing upon the movement's vast resources to
          support its priorities. It doesn't even have a way of deciding what
          they are.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The
          more unstructured a movement it, the less control it has over the directions
          in which it develops and the political actions in which it engages.
          This does not mean that its ideas do not spread. Given a certain amount
          of interest by the media and the appropriateness of social conditions,
          the ideas will still be diffused widely. But diffusion of ideas does
          not mean they are implemented; it only means they are talked about.
          Insofar as they can be applied individually they may be acted on; insofar
          as they require coordinated political power to be implemented, they
          will not be.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">As
          long as the women's liberation movement stays dedicated to a form of
          organization which stresses small, inactive discussion groups among
          friends, the worst problems of Unstructuredness will not be felt. But
          this style of organization has its limits; it is politically inefficacious,
          exclusive, and discriminatory against those women who are not or cannot
          be tied into the friendship networks. Those who do not fit into what
          already exists because of class, race, occupation, education, parental
          or marital status, personality, etc., will inevitably be discouraged
          from trying to participate. Those who do fit in will develop vested
          interests in maintaining things as they are.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The
          informal groups' vested interests will be sustained by the informal
          structures which exist, and the movement will have no way of determining
          who shall exercise power within it. If the movement continues deliberately
          to not select who shall exercise power, it does not thereby abolish
          power. All it does is abdicate the right to demand that those who do
          exercise power and influence be responsible for it. If the movement
          continues to keep power as diffuse as possible because it knows it
          cannot demand responsibility from those who have it, it does prevent
          any group or person from totally dominating. But it simultaneously
          insures that the movement is as ineffective as possible. Some middle
          ground between domination and ineffectiveness can and must be found.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">These
          problems are coming to a head at this time because the nature of the
          movement is necessarily changing. Consciousness-raising as the main
          function of the women's liberation movement is becoming obsolete. Due
          to the intense press publicity of the last two years and the numerous
          overground books and articles now being circulated, women's liberation
          has become a household word. Its issues are discussed and informal
          rap groups are formed by people who have no explicit connection with
          any movement group. The movement must go on to other tasks. It now
          needs to establish its priorities, articulate its goals, and pursue
          its objectives in a coordinated fashion. To do this it must get organized
      -- locally, regionally, and nationally.</span></p>

      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Once 
        the movement no longer clings tenaciously to the ideology of "structurelessness," 
        it is free to develop those forms of organization best suited to its healthy 
        functioning. This does not mean that we should go to the other extreme 
        and blindly imitate the traditional forms of organization. But neither 
        should we blindly reject them all. Some of the traditional techniques 
        will prove useful, albeit not perfect; some will give us insights into 
        what we should and should not do to obtain certain ends with minimal costs 
        to the individuals in the movement. Mostly, we will have to experiment 
        with different kinds of structuring and develop a variety of techniques 
        to use for different situations. The Lot System is one such idea which 
        has emerged from the movement. It is not applicable to all situations, 
        but is useful in some. Other ideas for structuring are needed. But before 
        we can proceed to experiment intelligently, we must accept the idea that 
        there is nothing inherently bad about structure itself -- only its excess 
        use.<br>

                  engaging in this trial-and-error process, there are some principles
                  we can keep in mind that are essential to democratic structuring
                  and are also politically effective:<br>
              </span></p>
              <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">1) 
                <u>Delegation</u> of specific authority to specific individuals 
                for specific tasks by democratic procedures. Letting people assume 
                jobs or tasks only by default means they are not dependably done. 
                If people are selected to do a task, preferably after expressing 
                an interest or willingness to do it, they have made a commitment 
                which cannot so easily be ignored.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">2) 
                Requiring all those to whom authority has been delegated to be 
                <u>responsible</u> to those who selected them. This is how the 
                group has control over people in positions of authority. Individuals 
                may exercise power, but it is the group that has ultimate say 
                over how the power is exercised.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">3) 
                <u>Distribution</u> of authority among as many people as is reasonably 
                possible. This prevents monopoly of power and requires those in 
                positions of authority to consult with many others in the process 
                of exercising it. It also gives many people the opportunity to 
                have responsibility for specific tasks and thereby to learn different 
                skills.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">4) 
                <u>Rotation</u> of tasks among individuals. Responsibilities which 
                are held too long by one person, formally or informally, come 
                to be seen as that person's "property" and are not easily 
                relinquished or controlled by the group. Conversely, if tasks 
                are rotated too frequently the individual does not have time to 
                learn her job well and acquire the sense of satisfaction of doing 
                a good job.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">5) 
                <u>Allocation</u> of tasks along rational criteria. Selecting 
                someone for a position because they are liked by the group or 
                giving them hard work because they are disliked serves neither 
                the group nor the person in the long run. Ability, interest, and 
                responsibility have got to be the major concerns in such selection. 
                People should be given an opportunity to learn skills they do 
                not have, but this is best done through some sort of "apprenticeship" 
                program rather than the "sink or swim" method. Having 
                a responsibility one can't handle well is demoralizing. Conversely, 
                being blacklisted from doing what one can do well does not encourage 
                one to develop one's skills. Women have been punished for being 
                competent throughout most of human history; the movement does 
                not need to repeat this process.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">6) 
                <u>Diffusion of information</u> to everyone as frequently as possible. 
                Information is power. Access to information enhances one's power. 
                When an informal network spreads new ideas and information among 
                themselves outside the group, they are already engaged in the 
                process of forming an opinion -- without the group participating. 
                The more one knows about how things work and what is happening, 
                the more politically effective one can be.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">7) 
                <u>Equal access to resources</u> needed by the group. This is 
                not always perfectly possible, but should be striven for. A member 
                who maintains a monopoly over a needed resource (like a printing 
                press owned by a husband, or a darkroom) can unduly influence 
                the use of that resource. Skills and information are also resources. 
                Members' skills can be equitably available only when members are 
                willing to teach what they know to others.<br>
              </span></p>
              <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">When 
                these principles are applied, they insure that whatever structures 
                are developed by different movement groups will be controlled 
                by and responsible to the group. The group of people in positions 
                of authority will be diffuse, flexible, open, and temporary. They 
                will not be in such an easy position to institutionalize their 
                power because ultimate decisions will be made by the group at 
                large. The group will have the power to determine who shall exercise 
                authority within it.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a few months since I deleted a lot of apps on my phone and instead installed many restrictive apps to control my insatiable <em>scrolling</em> addiction.</p>
<h2>Fighting the interconnected reality</h2>
<p>There are simply too many means to escapism in one's electronic devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Content apps: Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, etc.
</li>
<li>
Work apps: Slack, Workplace, etc
</li>
<li>
All these apps have moderate web apps, so no getaway while you have an easily accessible browser on your phone
</li>
<li>
You can easily login to these websites on your work laptop
</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is hyper-connected and available at all times to occupy us. Wouldn't people prone to procrastination, such as myself, naturally choose to enter the rabbit hole if everything is at their fingertips? I think they would. At least, I did so.</p>
<h2>Do I need all these means of viewing content and scrolling at all times?</h2>
<p>Probably not. Let's experiment.</p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Delete content apps
<ul>
<li>
Entertainment: YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Reddit
</li>
<li>
Information databases: GoodReads, StoryGraph, IMDB
</li>
<li>
Messaging: Gmail, Slack
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete the browser from the phone
<ul>
<li>
Chrome, or rather disable it, because deleting it is not an option on my Android phone
</li>
<li>
Google, a super-app on Android phones with the browsing feature
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete personal profile/browser from the work laptop
<ul>
<li>
I used to have "Arc" browser on my work laptop with my personal Google account profile
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some early-stage issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Sharing a link/content from the work laptop to a personal space got more difficult. However, it's not a frequent problem.
</li>
<li>
I lost access to some services I used with my personal account. It was more convenient to do a simple task while working on my corporate laptop. Again, a problem that one can get used to.
</li>
<li>Deleting Chrome browser and Google apps caused worse problems
<ul>
<li>
I didn't even realize until then that some separate apps rely on the Google super-app. Like the weather app or some functionalities of the translation app! I lost access to these functionalities with disabling the super-app.
</li>
<li>
In some rare cases, the web app is better than the native Android app. I lost the ability to use them because I didn't have a browser anymore.
</li>
<li>
Some bank transfers need the browser page for authentication. Rarely, some other operations get blocked too without a browser.
</li>
<li>
Some quick, simple tasks don't need a whole Android app, a browser can handle them. But without a browser, those simple tasks become cumbersome.
</li>
<li>
Without the Email app, it's difficult to quickly access a ticket or receipt when you need it outdoors, away from your laptop.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Current Situation</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Deleting the personal account browser from the work laptop was successful. After a while, I got used to the minor inconveniences. More importantly, I removed some easily accessible procrastination tools from my professional workflow. No more checking personal emails, running quick online errands, or look something up.
</li>
<li>
Deleting work feeds from my phone was also successful. I realized I don't really need Slack, Gmail and Workplace apps all the time. It helped me set healthy boundaries with work. Now I only check my messages when I'm behind my desk and I'm not busy with focused, deep work.
</li>
<li>
Deleting content apps from my phone was another successful attempt. I've tried this method now and then. This time, I stuck with it once and for all.
</li>
<li>Deleting the browser apps from my phone proved more problematic, though. It impeded some daily operations with my phone.
<ul>
<li>
Some actions became impossible, as I mentioned in the previous part
</li>
<li>
To resolve that, I had to return to having browser apps on my phone, but with new restrictions.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Later modifications</h4>
<p>To resolve the complications of not having a browser on my phone, I took these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimal launch UI to break my habits:
<ul>
<li>
The new UI is a simplistic black screen with no widgets or app icons
</li>
<li>This app can restrict other apps or hide an app from the view
<ul>
<li>
For example, I use this feature to enable the Google super-app, but hide it completely. So it's difficult for me to open it directly.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A more advanced website blocker and set restrictions on social media and browsing websites
<ul>
<li>
An interesting method I found in this app was to block distracting websites based on the location. I set them to be blocked at home, where I spend most of my focused time.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A new browser instead of Chrome
<ul>
<li>
Doing this helped me break some old habits I've formed over the years with a browser I'm used to. For example, the Google ecosystem knew me too well and constantly recommended articles to me to click on. A new browser without this historical data helped me to focus on the task at hand instead of getting distracted by the shiny, new, but useless information online.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>After a few months of making the above changes and applying some adjustments, I'm seeing its effects. I still procrastinate, however, my devices can't lure me into the rabbit hole anymore. I have more control over what's available to me and I have an easier time choosing the alternatives over infinite scrolling.</p>
<p>These days when I spend time on my phone, I usually play "Spelling Bee," a game I enjoy and it has a daily "end" state unlike the infinite content apps. When I reach that point, I know that there isn't much to do with my phone. I always wanted to expand my reading time but never got to do that with the constant exposure to easy content. It's been a while that I'm able to choose to read when I'm looking for something to do besides work and chores.</p>
<p>I constantly need to find new ways to constrain my media consumption addictions, but I'm happy with my efforts. When it works, I feel saner and calmer and I do what I actually enjoy doing with my time. And if not, at least I'm doing what I need to do.</p>

<p>On the day of Trump’s second presidential inauguration, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/21/instagram-democrat-hashtags-blocked-search">Instagram censored search results</a> for the most popular hashtags associated with American Democrats, like “#Democrat”, “#PresidentBiden”, “#VoteBlue”, “#MichelleObama”, “#Kamala”, and dozens more. This ban lasted for 9 total hours and affected users worldwide, regardless of their content settings. During that same time, Instagram was displaying full search results for “#Republican”, “#Trump”, “#VoteRed”, “#PresidentTrump”, and every other popular Republican hashtag I tried. I found about 50 censored political tags related to Democrats, but every Republican tag was still working fine. </p>



<figure><a href="https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden-1024x576.jpg" alt="Search results for #Biden on Instagram have no results, while search for #Trump shows a full collection of photos and videos." srcset="https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden-300x169.jpg 300w, https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden-768x432.jpg 768w, https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden-480x270.jpg?crop=1 480w, https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden.jpg 1828w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>The removal of these pro-Democrat hashtags started on the evening of January 20th, 2025, coincidentally a few hours after Trump signed the “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/">Restoring Freedom Of Speech</a>” executive act. These censored results lasted for about 9 hours, then went back to normal at around 5 am PST. I want to state again that these words were censored for all Instagram users on the website and app regardless of that user’s content settings or their location.</p>



<figure><a href="https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-21-at-11.12.08%E2%80%AFAM.png"><img decoding="async" width="515" height="207" src="https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-21-at-11.12.08%E2%80%AFAM.png" alt="A screenshot from man-vs-spider on Reddit that says &quot;
I haven’t been able to get it to work for #democrat or #dnc at all. I’ve changed my settings to allow more “sensitive” content and still it’s not working&quot;" srcset="https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-21-at-11.12.08 https://docpop.org/2025/01/the-day-instagram-blocked-democracy/AM.png 515w, https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-21-at-11.12.08 https://docpop.org/2025/01/the-day-instagram-blocked-democracy/AM-300x121.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px"></a></figure>



<p>Meta claimed this was a technical “error” affecting hashtags “across the political spectrum,” but this is demonstrably false. I searched through the most popular hashtags used by Democrats and Republicans last night and found that the majority of Democrat terms were being censored, while none of the popular Republican tags were affected. This selective censorship is a scary look into Meta’s updated content moderation practices and its potential alignment with the new administration.</p>



<p>The following hashtags were actively blocked by Instagram on the first day of Trump’s second presidency. While they are now searchable again, I personally confirmed all of these hashtags were inaccessible last night:</p>



<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Barack</li>



<li>BarackObama</li>



<li>Bernie</li>



<li>BernieSanders</li>



<li>Biden</li>



<li>Constitution</li>



<li>Democrat</li>



<li>Democrats</li>



<li>DNC</li>



<li>Fascism</li>



<li>FuckTrump </li>



<li>Insurrection</li>



<li>Jan6th</li>



<li>JohnOliver</li>
</ul>
</div>



<div>
<ul>
<li>JoeBiden</li>



<li>Kamala</li>



<li>Leftist</li>



<li>Liberal</li>



<li>Liberals</li>



<li>MichelleObama</li>



<li>Obama</li>



<li>OccupyDemocrats</li>



<li>PresidentBiden</li>



<li>PresidentObama</li>



<li>Queer</li>



<li>ReproductiveRights</li>



<li>VoteBlue</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>



<p>And those were just the ones I could find yesterday. I’m sure there are many more. Instagram is still blocking other hashtags like ProChoice, GeorgeConway (a writer critical of Trump), JackSmith (the special counsel against Trump), 14thAmendment, and Drumpf. It’s possible those words were already being censored before Trump’s inauguration, so I didn’t include them on the list above.</p>



<p>During that same 9-hour window, I confirmed the following words were <strong>not</strong> being censored on IG:</p>



<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>AltRight</li>



<li>DonaldJTrump</li>



<li>DonaldTrump</li>



<li>FuckObama</li>



<li>FuckBiden</li>



<li>FuckKamala</li>



<li>LetsGoBrandon</li>
</ul>
</div>



<div>
<ul>
<li>MelaniaTrump</li>



<li>PresidentTrump</li>



<li>Republican</li>



<li>RNC</li>



<li>Trump</li>



<li>VoteRed</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>



<p>Those words all worked. You couldn’t search for FuckTrump, but you could search for FuckObama or FuckBiden. Trump was searchable, but Biden, Kamala, Bernie, and Obama were not. You could search for MelaniaTrump, but not MichelleObama. PresidentTrump still showed millions of results, while discussions of PresidentBiden were marked as “sensitive content”. </p>



<p>We don’t know what caused Meta to censor these words, but we do know this was not affecting “both sides.”. This was an extremely targeted list of censored words.</p>



<p>As a contrast, I saw several claims on Threads and IG that TikTok was also heavily censoring content. I tested it out for myself and was still fully able to search for words like “Fascist,” “Fascism,” “Democrat,” and “Trump”. I was also able to post pro-Palestinian content like “Free Palestine” without having the post removed. If TikTok is censoring content, they are being more clever about it than Instagram is. </p>



<p>Though we can prove that Instagram was censoring certain hashtags last night, we can’t say why they were doing it. It’s possible this really was a computer error with no human oversight, but I’ve never heard of a computer bug that only affects people based on their political affiliation. </p>



<p>To understand why this happened, take a look at the context surrounding it. Last year, Trump accused Zuckerberg of election interference and threatened <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-once-threatened-jail-112328545.html">to lock Mark up “for life”</a>. After Trump won the election, Zuckerberg started a series of regular visits to Mar-a-Lago for private meetings with the President-Elect. Last week, Zuckerberg announced big changes to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-instagram-meta-changes-dei-fact-checkers-dana-white-rcna187370">Meta’s content moderation team</a> and added Dana White (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-dana-white-ufc-trump-ally-meta-board-zuckerbeg-2025-1">a Trump loyalist</a>) to Meta’s board. Yesterday, Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-inaugural-brings-worlds-billionaire-elites-en-masse-dc-2025-01-21/">attended Trump’s inauguration along with</a> Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai, Shou Zi Chew, and several other of the richest tech oligarchs. </p>



<p>With all of that in mind, I find it unlikely that an Instagram error selectively silencing Trump’s political opponents would coincidentally occur on the first day of his second presidency. Given the state of *gestures broadly at everything around me*, I believe that Meta has many systems in place to quickly silence Trump’s political opponents, and last night we saw one of those systems being used. If Meta really did have an “error” yesterday, it was probably that they activated that system too early. </p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 exceeds the performance of standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPAs memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>The number zero was invented against a backdrop of numbering systems which don't have placeholders.  So instead of "nothing in the tens place" they would just omit that place entirely and provide a different kind of thing instead.  Roman numerals do this, they just make 10 and 100 fundamentally different by using X or C instead.</p>
<p>Along these lines, <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2022-12-20/knots-representing-numbers-the-mathematics-of-the-incas.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">knots have been used</a> as a system of accounting.  The idea is that you'd have a container full of things, and tied to it would be a string.  Knots on that string would tell you how many things are in there, which might be easier than cracking the lid and counting, especially if it's something like cups of rice.</p>
<p>My point is that when you're doing this kind of accounting, you physically group the objects into recognizable shapes (likely rectangles of consistent side length).  But then if you're using a numbering system with 0 in it, you don't directly correspond the shapes to symbols, you have to count the number of same-type shapes you have.  So you end up asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how <strong>many</strong> of that shape do I have?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there's this implicit potential for "many", even if it might turn out that there's only one in your particular case. I imagine a proponent of the new system, explaining it to one of the old guard.  They would have them group the objects into piles of certain shapes/sizes and at some point say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don't have 1 or 2 or 3 ... or 9 ten<strong>s</strong> then you put a zero here.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/assumed-audiences.html">Assumed audience</a>:</b> Software developers who want to improve at their craft. Assumes a bit of background about programming in general, and also just a <em>little</em> bit of background knowledge about Rust and TypeScript. (You’ll be just fine if you know no more of either than that they exist and roughly what they are.)</p><p>As a bit of a prelude, consider this extended quote from Fred Hebert, <a href="https://ferd.ca/complexity-has-to-live-somewhere.html">Complexity Has to Live Somewhere</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fighting complexity is a recurring theme of software development I’ve seen repeat itself over and over again. It’s something I keep seeing debated at all levels: just how much commenting should go on in functions and methods? What’s the ideal amount of abstraction? When does a framework start having<span></span> <span>“</span>too much magic”? When are there too many languages in an organisation?</p>
<p>We try to get rid of the complexity, control it, and seek simplicity. I think framing things that way is misguided. Complexity has to live somewhere.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When we adopt something like microservices, we try to make it so that each service is individually simple. But unless this simplicity is so constraining that your actual application inherits it and is forced into simplicity, it still has to go somewhere. If it’s not in the individual microservices, then where is it?</p>
<p>Complexity has to live somewhere. If you are lucky, it lives in well-defined places. In code where you decided a bit of complexity should go, in documentation that supports the code, in training sessions for your engineers. You give it a place without trying to hide all of it. You create ways to manage it. You know where to go to meet it when you need it. If you’re unlucky and you just tried to pretend complexity could be avoided altogether, it has no place to go in this world. But it still doesn’t stop existing.</p>
<p>With nowhere to go, it has to roam everywhere in your system, both in your code and in people’s heads. And as people shift around and leave, our understanding of it erodes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s more, and it’s good, so <a href="https://ferd.ca/complexity-has-to-live-somewhere.html">read the whole thing</a>! And as you do, you might consider how it pairs with the quote from Peter Naur <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/notes/two-quotes-on-software-engineering/">I shared yesterday</a>. Now — </p>
<p>Hebert applies this to microservices, I think appropriately. I think it also applies to <em>types</em>. The types always exist; the complexity they represent always exists. The question is first of all whether we have written them down anywhere — that is, whether we have a contract about them that can be enforced, and if so what can enforce them. Secondarily, then, the expressiveness of a type system is a measure of what kinds of the program’s complexity we <em>can</em> write down as types.</p>
<p>People who are a bit allergic to types often feel constrained by them, but those of us who like robust types see that relationship the other way around. As <a href="https://dfreeman.io/">Dan Freeman</a> put it to me recently: types are a tool, just like tests, but you have to <em>use</em> that tool. Types do provide constraints, much as tests do — but they are only the types <em>we choose to impose</em>. That is, they are knowledge we are encoding into the program.</p>
<p>The same basic thesis applies to our tests, which represent a different set of knowledge than our types. This is the benefit of<span></span> <span>“</span>test-driven development”, particularly in the red-green cycle: it is a way of encoding knowledge into the program. Test expressiveness works in different ways than type expressiveness, but it is a useful way of evaluating different kinds of and different approaches to testing.</p>
<p>This is why I like Rust. The complexity of correctly <a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/temporal-spatial-memory-safety/">spatial and temporal safety</a> has to live somewhere. Rust pushes the majority of that complexity into its type system, and particularly the famed borrow checker. The rest of the complexity it isolates in <code>unsafe</code> blocks. Mind: <code>unsafe</code> allows you to know where the complexity lives, but it does not tell you where your getting that complexity wrong will <em>surface</em>. But the combination of the borrow checker and the isolation that <code>unsafe</code> offers <em>does</em> allow us to <em>control</em> the complexity. We cannot get rid of it. We can only isolate it.</p>
<p>A garbage collector gives you memory safety and not having to think explicitly about memory allocation and deallocation, but the complexity is still not gone — it has moved to the implementation, to weird performance cliffs, and to difficult-to-debug leaks of memory or other resources. That trade is very often worth it, though!</p>
<p>Whether with Rust or with a garbage collector, isolating the temporal and spatial safety means we don’t have to keep it in our heads <em>most of the time</em>, and that allows us to focus on other problems. This is why there are so many developer tools for JavaScript and Python being written in Rust: not because people didn’t want fast tools before, but because for many developers, keeping all the safety issues in their heads as they would have had to do with C or C++ was more than they felt they could reasonably do <em>and also ship the thing they cared about</em>. Rust’s borrow checking opens that door to many more people, because it has isolated that complexity, and thereby provided a more usable tool.</p>
<p>This exact dynamic is also why I like TypeScript, even including some of the wilder types I ended up writing for Ember and LinkedIn in years past. The complexity was always there — often far more than anyone realized before we started trying to write down types that actually accurately represented the system. TypeScript did not create the complexity, much as people sometimes <em>felt</em> like it added complexity to the code we were looking at. No, it merely shone a light on the existing complexity, and gave us the opportunity — and a tool with which — to <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/is-typescript-good/#:~:text=In%20software%2C%20the,of%20the%20system.">start grappling with it</a>.</p>
<p>Isolating complexity is useful. As Hebert says,<span></span> <span>“</span>If you are lucky, it lives in well-defined places.” It is not always possible to isolate complexity — we are not always lucky — , but when isolating complexity <em>is</em> possible, it is glorious, because isolating complexity is the essence of successful abstractions.</p>

<p dir="auto">We present Hunyuan3D 2.0, an advanced large-scale 3D synthesis system for generating high-resolution textured 3D assets.
This system includes two foundation components: a large-scale shape generation model - Hunyuan3D-DiT, and a large-scale
texture synthesis model - Hunyuan3D-Paint.
The shape generative model, built on a scalable flow-based diffusion transformer, aims to create geometry that properly
aligns with a given condition image, laying a solid foundation for downstream applications.
The texture synthesis model, benefiting from strong geometric and diffusion priors, produces high-resolution and vibrant
texture maps for either generated or hand-crafted meshes.
Furthermore, we build Hunyuan3D-Studio - a versatile, user-friendly production platform that simplifies the re-creation
process of 3D assets. It allows both professional and amateur users to manipulate or even animate their meshes
efficiently.
We systematically evaluate our models, showing that Hunyuan3D 2.0 outperforms previous state-of-the-art models,
including the open-source models and closed-source models in geometry details, condition alignment, texture quality, and
e.t.c.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Architecture</h3><a id="user-content-architecture" aria-label="Permalink: Architecture" href="#architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Hunyuan3D 2.0 features a two-stage generation pipeline, starting with the creation of a bare mesh, followed by the
synthesis of a texture map for that mesh. This strategy is effective for decoupling the difficulties of shape and
texture generation and also provides flexibility for texturing either generated or handcrafted meshes.</p>

The numerical results indicate that Hunyuan3D 2.0 surpasses all baselines in the quality of generated textured 3D assets
and the condition following ability.</p>
