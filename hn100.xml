<div><p><em>Academic journals, archives, and repositories are seeing an increasing number of questionable research papers clearly produced using generative AI. They are often created with widely available, general-purpose AI applications, most likely ChatGPT, and mimic scientific writing. Google Scholar easily locates and lists these questionable papers alongside reputable, quality-controlled research. Our analysis of a selection of questionable GPT-fabricated scientific papers found in Google Scholar shows that many are about applied, often controversial topics susceptible to disinformation: the environment, health, and computing. The resulting enhanced potential for malicious manipulation of society’s evidence base, particularly in politically divisive domains, is a growing concern.</em></p></div>

<h2>Research Questions</h2>



<ul>
<li>Where are questionable publications produced with generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) that can be found via Google Scholar published or deposited?</li>



<li>What are the main characteristics of these publications in relation to predominant subject categories?</li>



<li>How are these publications spread in the research infrastructure for scholarly communication?</li>



<li>How is the role of the scholarly communication infrastructure challenged in maintaining public trust in science and evidence through inappropriate use of generative AI?</li>
</ul>



<h2>research note Summary</h2>



<ul>
<li>A sample of scientific papers with signs of GPT-use found on Google Scholar was retrieved, downloaded, and analyzed using a combination of qualitative coding and descriptive statistics. All papers contained at least one of two common phrases returned by conversational agents that use large language models (LLM) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Google Search was then used to determine the extent to which copies of questionable, GPT-fabricated papers were available in various repositories, archives, citation databases, and social media platforms.</li>



<li>Roughly two-thirds of the retrieved papers were found to have been produced, at least in part, through undisclosed, potentially deceptive use of GPT. The majority (57%) of these questionable papers dealt with policy-relevant subjects (i.e., environment, health, computing), susceptible to influence operations. Most were available in several copies on different domains (e.g., social media, archives, and repositories).</li>



<li>Two main risks arise from the increasingly common use of GPT to (mass-)produce fake, scientific publications. First, the abundance of fabricated “studies” seeping into all areas of the research infrastructure threatens to overwhelm the scholarly communication system and jeopardize the integrity of the scientific record. A second risk lies in the increased possibility that convincingly scientific-looking content was in fact deceitfully created with AI tools and is also optimized to be retrieved by publicly available academic search engines, particularly Google Scholar. However small, this possibility and awareness of it risks undermining the basis for trust in scientific knowledge and poses serious societal risks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implications</h2>



<p>The use of ChatGPT to generate text for academic papers has raised concerns about research integrity. Discussion of this phenomenon is ongoing in editorials, commentaries, opinion pieces, and on social media (Bom, 2023; Stokel-Walker, 2024; Thorp, 2023). There are now several lists of papers suspected of GPT misuse, and new papers are constantly being added.<sup data-mfn="1" data-mfn-post-scope="000000005b026c12000000004dba4ff5_13165">1</sup><span id="mfn-content-000000005b026c12000000004dba4ff5_13165-1" role="tooltip" tabindex="0" data-mfn="1">See for example Academ-AI, <a href="https://www.academ-ai.info/">https://www.academ-ai.info/</a>, and Retraction Watch, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/papers-and-peer-reviews-with-evidence-of-chatgpt-writing/">https://retractionwatch.com/papers-and-peer-reviews-with-evidence-of-chatgpt-writing/</a>.</span> While many legitimate uses of GPT for research and academic writing exist (Huang &amp; Tan, 2023; Kitamura, 2023; Lund et al., 2023), its undeclared use—beyond proofreading—has potentially far-reaching implications for both science and society, but especially for their relationship. It, therefore, seems important to extend the discussion to one of the most accessible and well-known intermediaries between science, but also certain types of misinformation, and the public, namely Google Scholar, also in response to the legitimate concerns that the discussion of generative AI and misinformation needs to be more nuanced and empirically substantiated&nbsp; (Simon et al., 2023).</p>



<p>Google Scholar, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">https://scholar.google.com</a>, is an easy-to-use academic search engine. It is available for free, and its index is extensive (Gusenbauer &amp; Haddaway, 2020). It is also often touted as a credible source for academic literature and even recommended in library guides, by media and information literacy initiatives, and fact checkers (Tripodi et al., 2023). However, Google Scholar lacks the transparency and adherence to standards that usually characterize citation databases. Instead, Google Scholar uses automated crawlers, like Google’s web search engine (Martín-Martín et al., 2021), and the inclusion criteria are based on primarily technical standards, allowing any individual author—with or without scientific affiliation—to upload papers to be indexed (Google Scholar Help, n.d.). It has been shown that Google Scholar is susceptible to manipulation through citation exploits (Antkare, 2020) and by providing access to fake scientific papers (Dadkhah et al., 2017). A large part of Google Scholar’s index consists of publications from established scientific journals or other forms of quality-controlled, scholarly literature. However, the index also contains a large amount of gray literature, including student papers, working papers, reports, preprint servers, and academic networking sites, as well as material from so-called “questionable” academic journals, including paper mills. The search interface does not offer the possibility to filter the results meaningfully by material type, publication status, or form of quality control, such as limiting the search to peer-reviewed material.</p>



<p>To understand the occurrence of ChatGPT (co-)authored work in Google Scholar’s index, we scraped it for publications, including one of two common ChatGPT responses (see Appendix A) that we encountered on social media and in media reports (DeGeurin, 2024). The results of our descriptive statistical analyses showed that around 62% did not declare the use of GPTs. Most of these GPT-fabricated papers were found in non-indexed journals and working papers, but some cases included research published in mainstream scientific journals and conference proceedings.<sup data-mfn="2" data-mfn-post-scope="000000005b026c12000000004dba4ff5_13165">2</sup><span id="mfn-content-000000005b026c12000000004dba4ff5_13165-2" role="tooltip" tabindex="0" data-mfn="2">Indexed journals mean scholarly journals indexed by abstract and citation databases such as Scopus and Web of Science, where the indexation implies journals with high scientific quality. Non-indexed journals are journals that fall outside of this indexation.</span> More than half (57%) of these GPT-fabricated papers concerned policy-relevant subject areas susceptible to influence operations. To avoid increasing the visibility of these publications, we abstained from referencing them in this research note. However, we have made the data available in the Harvard Dataverse repository.</p>



<p>The publications were related to three issue areas—health (14.5%), environment (19.5%) and computing (23%)—with key terms such “healthcare,” “COVID-19,” or “infection”for health-related papers, and “analysis,” “sustainable,” and “global” for environment-related papers. In several cases, the papers had titles that strung together general keywords and buzzwords, thus alluding to very broad and current research. These terms included “biology,” “telehealth,” “climate policy,” “diversity,” and “disrupting,” to name just a few.&nbsp; While the study’s scope and design did not include a detailed analysis of which parts of the articles included fabricated text, our dataset did contain the surrounding sentences for each occurrence of the suspicious phrases that formed the basis for our search and subsequent selection. Based on that, we can say that the phrases occurred in most sections typically found in scientific publications, including the literature review, methods, conceptual and theoretical frameworks, background, motivation or societal relevance, and even discussion. This was confirmed during the joint coding, where we read and discussed all articles. It became clear that not just the text related to the telltale phrases was created by GPT, but that almost all articles in our sample of questionable articles likely contained traces of GPT-fabricated text everywhere.</p>



<p><em>Evidence hacking and backfiring effects</em></p>



<p>Generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) can be used to produce texts that mimic scientific writing. These texts, when made available online—as we demonstrate—leak into the databases of academic search engines and other parts of the research infrastructure for scholarly communication. This development exacerbates problems that were already present with less sophisticated text generators (Antkare, 2020; Cabanac &amp; Labbé, 2021). Yet, the public release of ChatGPT in 2022, together with the way Google Scholar works, has increased the likelihood of lay people (e.g., media, politicians, patients, students) coming across questionable (or even entirely GPT-fabricated) papers and other problematic research findings. Previous research has emphasized that the ability to determine the value and status of scientific publications for lay people is at stake when misleading articles are passed off as reputable (Haider &amp; Åström, 2017) and that systematic literature reviews risk being compromised (Dadkhah et al., 2017). It has also been highlighted that Google Scholar, in particular, can be and has been exploited for manipulating the evidence base for politically charged issues and to fuel conspiracy narratives (Tripodi et al., 2023). Both concerns are likely to be magnified in the future, increasing the risk of what we suggest calling <em>evidence hacking</em>—the strategic and coordinated malicious manipulation of society’s evidence base.</p>



<p>The authority of quality-controlled research as evidence to support legislation, policy, politics, and other forms of decision-making is undermined by the presence of undeclared GPT-fabricated content in publications professing to be scientific. Due to the large number of archives, repositories, mirror sites, and shadow libraries to which they spread, there is a clear risk that GPT-fabricated, questionable papers will reach audiences even after a possible retraction. There are considerable technical difficulties involved in identifying and tracing computer-fabricated papers (Cabanac &amp; Labbé, 2021; Dadkhah et al., 2023; Jones, 2024), not to mention preventing and curbing their spread and uptake.</p>



<p>However, as the rise of the so-called anti-vaxx movement during the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing obstruction and denial of climate change show, retracting erroneous publications often fuels conspiracies and increases the following of these movements rather than stopping them. To illustrate this mechanism, climate deniers frequently question established scientific consensus by pointing to other, supposedly scientific, studies that support their claims. Usually, these are poorly executed, not peer-reviewed, based on obsolete data, or even fraudulent (Dunlap &amp; Brulle, 2020). A similar strategy is successful in the alternative epistemic world of the global anti-vaccination movement (Carrion, 2018) and the persistence of flawed and questionable publications in the scientific record already poses significant problems for health research, policy, and lawmakers, and thus for society as a whole (Littell et al., 2024). Considering that a person’s support for “doing your own research” is associated with increased mistrust in scientific institutions (Chinn &amp; Hasell, 2023), it will be of utmost importance to anticipate and consider such backfiring effects already when designing a technical solution, when suggesting industry or legal regulation, and in the planning of educational measures.</p>



<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>



<p>Solutions should be based on simultaneous considerations of technical, educational, and regulatory approaches, as well as incentives, including social ones, across the entire research infrastructure. Paying attention to how these approaches and incentives relate to each other can help identify points and mechanisms for disruption. Recognizing fraudulent academic papers must happen alongside understanding how they reach their audiences and what reasons there might be for some of these papers successfully “sticking around.” A possible way to mitigate some of the risks associated with GPT-fabricated scholarly texts finding their way into academic search engine results would be to provide filtering options for facets such as indexed journals, gray literature, peer-review, and similar on the interface of publicly available academic search engines. Furthermore, evaluation tools for indexed journals<sup data-mfn="3" data-mfn-post-scope="000000005b026c12000000004dba4ff5_13165">3</sup><span id="mfn-content-000000005b026c12000000004dba4ff5_13165-3" role="tooltip" tabindex="0" data-mfn="3">Such as LiU Journal CheckUp, <a href="https://ep.liu.se/JournalCheckup/default.aspx?lang=eng">https://ep.liu.se/JournalCheckup/default.aspx?lang=eng</a>.</span> could be integrated into the graphical user interfaces and the crawlers of these academic search engines. To enable accountability, it is important that the index (database) of such a search engine is populated according to criteria that are transparent, open to scrutiny, and appropriate to the workings of &nbsp;science and other forms of academic research. Moreover, considering that Google Scholar has no real competitor, there is a strong case for establishing a freely accessible, non-specialized academic search engine that is not run for commercial reasons but for reasons of public interest. Such measures, together with educational initiatives aimed particularly at policymakers, science communicators, journalists, and other media workers, will be crucial to reducing the possibilities for and effects of malicious manipulation or evidence hacking. It is important not to present this as a technical problem that exists only because of AI text generators but to relate it to the wider concerns in which it is embedded. These range from a largely dysfunctional scholarly publishing system (Haider &amp; Åström, 2017) and academia’s “publish or perish” paradigm to Google’s near-monopoly and ideological battles over the control of information and ultimately knowledge. Any intervention is likely to have systemic effects; these effects need to be considered and assessed in advance and, ideally, followed up on.</p>



<p>Our study focused on a selection of papers that were easily recognizable as fraudulent. We used this relatively small sample as a magnifying glass to examine, delineate, and understand a problem that goes beyond the scope of the sample itself, which however points towards larger concerns that require further investigation. The work of ongoing whistleblowing initiatives<sup data-mfn="4" data-mfn-post-scope="000000005b026c12000000004dba4ff5_13165">4</sup><span id="mfn-content-000000005b026c12000000004dba4ff5_13165-4" role="tooltip" tabindex="0" data-mfn="4">Such as Academ-AI, <a href="https://www.academ-ai.info/">https://www.academ-ai.info/</a>, and Retraction Watch, <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/papers-and-peer-reviews-with-evidence-of-chatgpt-writing/">https://retractionwatch.com/papers-and-peer-reviews-with-evidence-of-chatgpt-writing/</a>.</span>, recent media reports of journal closures (Subbaraman, 2024), or GPT-related changes in word use and writing style (Cabanac et al., 2021; Stokel-Walker, 2024) suggest that we only see the tip of the iceberg. There are already more sophisticated cases (Dadkhah et al., 2023) as well as cases involving fabricated images (Gu et al., 2022). Our analysis shows that questionable and potentially manipulative GPT-fabricated papers permeate the research infrastructure and are likely to become a widespread phenomenon. Our findings underline that the risk of fake scientific papers being used to maliciously manipulate evidence (see Dadkhah et al., 2017) must be taken seriously. Manipulation may involve undeclared automatic summaries of texts, inclusion in literature reviews, explicit scientific claims, or the concealment of errors in studies so that they are difficult to detect in peer review. However, the mere possibility of these things happening is a significant risk in its own right that can be strategically exploited and will have ramifications for trust in and perception of science. Society’s methods of evaluating sources and the foundations of media and information literacy are under threat and public trust in science is at risk of further erosion, with far-reaching consequences for society in dealing with information disorders. To address this multifaceted problem, we first need to understand why it exists and proliferates.</p>



<h2>Findings</h2>



<p><em>Finding 1: 139 GPT-fabricated, questionable papers were found and listed as regular results on the Google Scholar results page. Non-indexed journals dominate.</em></p>



<p>Most questionable papers we found were in non-indexed journals or were working papers, but we did also find some in established journals, publications, conferences, and repositories. We found a total of 139 papers with a suspected deceptive use of ChatGPT or similar LLM applications (see Table 1). Out of these, 19 were in indexed journals, 89 were in non-indexed journals, 19 were student papers found in university databases, and 12 were working papers (mostly in preprint databases). Table 1 divides these papers into categories. Health and environment papers made up around 34% (47) of the sample. Of these, 66% were present in non-indexed journals.</p>

<p><em>Finding 2: GPT-fabricated, questionable papers are disseminated online, permeating the research infrastructure for scholarly communication, often in multiple copies. Applied topics with practical implications dominate.</em></p>



<p>The 20 papers concerning health-related issues are distributed across 20 unique domains, accounting for 46 URLs. The 27 papers dealing with environmental issues can be found across 26 unique domains, accounting for 56 URLs.&nbsp; Most of the identified papers exist in multiple copies and have already spread to several archives, repositories, and social media. It would be difficult, or impossible, to remove them from the scientific record.</p>



<p>As apparent from Table 2, GPT-fabricated, questionable papers are seeping into most parts of the online research infrastructure for scholarly communication. Platforms on which identified papers have appeared include ResearchGate, ORCiD, Journal of Population Therapeutics and Clinical Pharmacology (JPTCP), Easychair, Frontiers, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer (IEEE), and X/Twitter. Thus, even if they are retracted from their original source, it will prove very difficult to track, remove, or even just mark them up on other platforms. Moreover, unless regulated, Google Scholar will enable their continued and most likely unlabeled discoverability.</p>

However, as can be seen in Figure 1, it also reveals overlap and sub-areas. The y-axis shows word prominences through word positions and font sizes, while the x-axis indicates semantic similarity. In addition to a certain amount of overlap, this reveals sub-areas, which are best described as two distinct events within the word rain. The event on the left bundles terms related to the development and management of health and healthcare with “challenges,” “impact,” and “potential of artificial intelligence”emerging as semantically related terms. Terms related to research infrastructures, environmental, epistemic, and technological concepts are arranged further down in the same event (e.g., “system,” “climate,” “understanding,” “knowledge,” “learning,” “education,” “sustainable”). A second distinct event further to the right bundles terms associated with fish farming and aquatic medicinal plants, highlighting the presence of an aquaculture cluster.&nbsp; Here, the prominence of groups of terms such as “used,” “model,” “-based,” and “traditional” suggests the presence of applied research on these topics. The two events making up the word rain visualization, are linked by a less dominant but overlapping cluster of terms related to “energy” and “water.”</p>

<p><em>Finding 3: Google Scholar presents results from quality-controlled and non-controlled citation databases on the same interface, providing unfiltered access to GPT-fabricated questionable papers.</em></p>



<p>Google Scholar’s central position in the publicly accessible scholarly communication infrastructure, as well as its lack of standards, transparency, and accountability in terms of inclusion criteria, has potentially serious implications for public trust in science. This is likely to exacerbate the already-known potential to exploit Google Scholar for evidence hacking (Tripodi et al., 2023) and will have implications for any attempts to retract or remove fraudulent papers from their original publication venues. Any solution must consider the entirety of the research infrastructure for scholarly communication and the interplay of different actors, interests, and incentives.</p>



<h2>Methods</h2>



<p>We searched and scraped Google Scholar using the Python library Scholarly (Cholewiak et al., 2023) for papers that included specific phrases known to be common responses from ChatGPT and similar applications with the same underlying model (GPT3.5 or GPT4): “as of my last knowledge update” and/or “I don’t have access to real-time data” (see Appendix A). This facilitated the identification of papers that likely used generative AI to produce text, resulting in 227 retrieved papers. The papers’ bibliographic information was automatically added to a spreadsheet and downloaded into Zotero.<sup data-mfn="6" data-mfn-post-scope="000000005b026c12000000004dba4ff5_13165">6</sup><span id="mfn-content-000000005b026c12000000004dba4ff5_13165-6" role="tooltip" tabindex="0" data-mfn="6">An open-source reference manager, <a href="https://zotero.org/">https://zotero.org</a>.</span> </p>



<p>We employed multiple coding (Barbour, 2001) to classify the papers based on their content. First, we jointly assessed whether the paper was suspected of fraudulent use of ChatGPT (or similar) based on how the text was integrated into the papers and whether the paper was presented as original research output or the AI tool’s role was acknowledged. Second, in analyzing the content of the papers, we continued the multiple coding by classifying the fraudulent papers into four categories identified during an initial round of analysis—health, environment, computing, and others—and then determining which subjects were most affected by this issue (see Table 1). Out of the 227 retrieved papers, 88 papers were written with legitimate and/or declared use of GPTs (i.e., false positives, which were excluded from further analysis), and 139 papers were written with undeclared and/or fraudulent use (i.e., true positives, which were included in further analysis). The multiple coding was conducted jointly by all authors of the present article, who collaboratively coded and cross-checked each other’s interpretation of the data simultaneously in a shared spreadsheet file. This was done to single out coding discrepancies and settle coding disagreements, which in turn ensured methodological thoroughness and analytical consensus (see Barbour, 2001). Redoing the category coding later based on our established coding schedule, we achieved an intercoder reliability (Cohen’s kappa) of 0.806 after eradicating obvious differences.</p>



<p>The ranking algorithm of Google Scholar prioritizes highly cited and older publications (Martín-Martín et al., 2016). Therefore, the position of the articles on the search engine results pages was not particularly informative, considering the relatively small number of results in combination with the recency of the publications. Only the query “as of my last knowledge update” had more than two search engine result pages. On those, questionable articles with undeclared use of GPTs were evenly distributed across all result pages (min: 4, max: 9, mode: 8), with the proportion of undeclared use being slightly higher on average on later search result pages.</p>



<p>To understand how the papers making fraudulent use of generative AI were disseminated online, we programmatically searched for the paper titles (with exact string matching) in Google Search from our local IP address (see Appendix B) using the googlesearch<em>–</em>python library(Vikramaditya, 2020). We manually verified each search result to filter out false positives—results that were not related to the paper—and then compiled the most prominent URLs by field. This enabled the identification of other platforms through which the papers had been spread. We did not, however, investigate whether copies had spread into SciHub or other shadow libraries, or if they were referenced in Wikipedia.</p>



<p>We used descriptive statistics to count the prevalence of the number of GPT-fabricated papers across topics and venues and top domains by subject. The pandas software library for the Python programming language (The pandas development team, 2024) was used for this part of the analysis. Based on the multiple coding, paper occurrences were counted in relation to their categories, divided into indexed journals, non-indexed journals, student papers, and working papers. The schemes, subdomains, and subdirectories of the URL strings were filtered out while top-level domains and second-level domains were kept, which led to normalizing domain names. This, in turn, allowed the counting of domain frequencies in the environment and health categories. To distinguish word prominences and meanings in the environment and health-related GPT-fabricated questionable papers, a semantically-aware word cloud visualization was produced through the use of a word rain (Centre for Digital Humanities Uppsala, 2023) for full-text versions of the papers. Font size and y-axis positions indicate word prominences through TF-IDF scores for the environment and health papers (also visualized in a separate bar chart with raw term frequencies in parentheses), and words are positioned along the x-axis to reflect semantic similarity (Skeppstedt et al., 2024), with an English Word2vec skip gram model space (Fares et al., 2017). An English stop word list was used, along with a manually produced list including terms such as “https,” “volume,” or “years.”</p>

      Having your photo taken at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) headquarters in
      Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, has become a standard ritual for those hikers intending
      on walking the entire A.T. One of the functions of the ATC, as the lead organization in
      managing and protecting the A.T., is to maintain the official 2,000-miler registry of
      all those who have completed the A.T. Therefore, having a photo taken here makes many
      hikers feel as though their hikes have gained official recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to a generous grant from the Quimby Family Foundation and the work of dedicated
      volunteers of the A.T. Museum under the leadership of Terry Harley Wilson, both scanned
      versions of the earlier Polaroid photos and the more recent digital photos can now be
      viewed on-line from anywhere in the world. When the A.T. Museum opened in Pennsylvania's
      Pine Grove Furnace State Park in 2010, digital versions of the photos became available
      there too.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’m the first to admit that I don’t live in the real (electronic) world. As the late Jim Kloss pointed out during one of his broadcasts, we (and probably you) live in a part of the Web with ad blockers (as the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221221">FBI recommends</a>), limited JavaScript, password managers, and a (mostly) finely-tuned sense of what is a scam and what is legitimate (that was a lot of brackets).</p>
<p>Most people don’t live like this. I’d posit the <em>vast majority</em> don’t. And it’s worth a reality check sometimes.</p>
<p>Here’s a shockingly-common login process I witness:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get to a login page</li>
<li>Click “I forgot my password”</li>
<li>Go to their email</li>
<li>Click the recovery link</li>
<li>Type a throwaway password they won’t retain</li>
<li>Rinse, and repeat</li>
</ol>
<p>When I ask people why they do this, they either don’t have an answer, or respond with “huh, I never thought about why”. And that’s interesting to me.</p>
<p>Enough has been written (including here) about the need for password managers, the risks of identity theft, two-factor and multi-factor authentication, and whether the entire concept of a username/password is antiquated and in bad need of replacement. If you’re a reader of my silly blog here, you likely already know all this.</p>
<p>What I’m interested in here is the fact people have come up with that above process <em>in the first place</em>. How do you decide that using “I forgot my password” as authentication makes sense to you? Or more specifically, the <em>most</em> sense to you, out of all possible options?</p>
<p>I think people can’t answer why they do this because it’s not a concious decision. They don’t wake up in the morning and decide <em>yes, this is how I’m going to interact with online accounts today!</em> Instead, this is a process that has coalesced over time and become rote. It offers a guaranteed, repeatable, low-effort solution (of sorts) to passphrases they don’t need to think about (there’s those brackets again).</p>
<p>It makes me wonder if we’re looking at a bunch of these issues backwards, and whether we can take advantage of people’s tendencies towards learned behaviour like this. What if we could somehow design systems so that the people who use them evolve to use them in <em>better</em> ways? Because I do empathise with people that often improved security comes with more barriers and friction, not fewer.</p>

<article id="post-1245">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		
<p>I got an email the other day from mathematician Bogdan Grechuk, whose book <em>Polynomial Diophantine Equations: A Systematic Approach</em> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-62949-5">https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-62949-5</a>) was recently released. This is to my mind a rather remarkable book. The blurb starts: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>This book proposes a novel approach to the study of Diophantine equations: define an appropriate version of the equation’s size, order all polynomial Diophantine equations by size, and then solve the equations <strong>in order.</strong> [emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The book really does do this systematically. The start of the book solves extremely easy examples, but pays close attention to the process, so that it can identify classes of equations that this method will apply to. And as a new method of solution is provided, hence solving a new class of equations, this class of equations is removed from considerations going forward. Grechuk, halfway through the book (&gt;400 pages in!) takes stock and provides an outline of the algorithm built up over the four chapters to that point. It has approximately 21 main cases, of increasing difficulty, spread over pages, referring constantly back through the book to various methods and algorithms for different cases. As the equations keep getting harder, the problem of solution shifts focus: from “describe all solutions parametrically”, to “write down a family of polynomials (or rational functions) that give all solutions”, to “find a recurrence relation to describe solutions”, to “determine if there are finitely or infinitely many solutions”, to “determine if there is any one solution”. The methods start out wholly elementary, and by the end the discussion uses the cutting edge of current techniques for attacking number-theoretic problems of this sort, for instance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Chabauty">Chabauty</a> methods. </p>



<p>Long-time readers of the blog may recall the post <a href="https://thehighergeometer.wordpress.com/2021/07/27/diophantine-fruit/">Diophantine fruit</a>. which was inspired by a MathOverflow question of Grechuk on the problem of “the smallest unsolved Diophantine equation”. This blog post led to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?query=%22fruit+diophantine%22&amp;searchtype=title">chain of papers</a> using the phrase “fruit equations” by authors wholly unconnected with me, with the first solving what was at the time an open problem on Grechuk’s list. So it’s worth consulting the companion paper <em>A systematic approach to Diophantine equations: open problems</em> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08518">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08518</a>) if you have any particular hankering to solve an equation (in any of the various ways: from parametrising a family of solutions to just finding one single solution) and have the honour of being the <em>first person ever</em> (modulo the problem of finding some equation equivalent to it buried in the literature) to solve a hard equation. The book ends with a summary that is a line-in-the-sand version of the just-cited arXiv preprint, stating the earliest/smallest/shortest equations that the various types of solutions are not known. And the last open problem is this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What is the smallest (in H) equation for which the existence of integer solutions (Problem 7.1) is a problem which is independent from the standard axioms of mathematics (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice)?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here “H” refers to the function that gives the “size” of a polynomial Diophantine equation, that allows a systematic ordering. Other natural orderings are given in the book, which end up being more-or-less comparable, if not the same, and the above problem is also posed for these orderings. From the MDRP solution to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_tenth_problem">Hilbert’s Tenth Problem</a> we know that at some point equations whose solvability is unprovable in ZFC will turn up. By work of Zhi-Wei Sun (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03504">https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03504</a>) we know that the unsolvability result (that is, there is no algorithm that can solve in integers all equations in a given class) is true taking even just Diophantine equations with no more than 11 variables. But identifying an explicit equation, let alone the smallest one, seems very hard. Moreover, trying to optimise to find a small ZFC-undecidable equation, rather than an algorithmically unsolvable one, is another whole kettle of fish; compare how the value BB(745) of the Busy Beaver function is <a href="https://www.ingo-blechschmidt.eu/assets/bachelor-thesis-undecidability-bb748.pdf">not possible to calculate in ZFC</a>, through a line of work whose current endpoint is by Johannes Riebel’s 2023 Bachelor thesis. (ADDED: I just now found that in fact BB(636) is known to uncalculable in ZFC, by <a href="https://github.com/CatsAreFluffy/metamath-turing-machines/commits/master/zf2.nql">very recent work of Rohan Ridenour</a> in the past two months)</p>



<hr>



<p>Just as Grechuk’s book starts small and tries to find the smallest so-far unsolved Diophantine equations, here is an example of one such equation, but one that is far from small:</p>



<pre><code>y^2 + xy = x^3 - 27006183241630922218434652145297453784768054621836357954737385x + 55258058551342376475736699591118191821521067032535079608372404779149413277716173425636721497</code></pre>



<p>(source: <a href="https://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/~duje/tors/rk29.html">https://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/~duje/tors/rk29.html</a>). This equation defines an elliptic curve, and it has the largest-known number of solutions in rational numbers of any such equation. By “largest-known” I mean that there is a copy of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5E%7B29%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5E%7B29%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5E%7B29%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\mathbb{Z}^{29}"> in the set of rational solutions (where we are in fact finding solutions in the projective plane, not just in affine coordinates as presented). That is, there are 29 rational solutions (shown at the previous link) that are linearly-idependent (over the integers) under the abelian group operation on the rational points. It is not proved that there are no other linearly independent solutions (this number is known as the <em>rank</em> of the elliptic curve described by the equation). The announcement of the result as well as a summary of how much more is known is given in the email:</p>



<ul>
<li>N. D. Elkies and Z. Klagsbrun, <em><strong>Z</strong><sup>29</sup> in E(<strong>Q</strong>)</em>, Number Theory Listserver, Aug 2024. (<a href="https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;b9d018b1.2409&amp;S=">https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;b9d018b1.2409&amp;S=</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>The above elliptic curve has been proved to have rank exactly 29 using the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis  for zeta functions of number fields, which is very far from being known (the usual Riemann Hypothesis is the special case of taking the number field to be the rationals). So the specific two-variable cubic equation above is an example of a polynomial Diophantine equation whose complete solution—and I haven’t even mentioned the possible (finite) torsion subgroup of the elliptic curve—requires knowing a the resolution of a conjecture that is wholly out of reach of current mathematics.</p>

<p>Before modern air travel and first-class suites, the grandest thing in luxury air travel was the German Zeppelin airship.</p>
<p>The Hindenburg was designed to ferry passengers across the Atlantic in serenity, with the dirigible floating smoothly through the clouds. The airship was considered the longest class of flying machine and the largest airship by envelope volume.</p>
<p>During the 1930s, airships like the Hindenburg class were widely considered the future of air travel, and the lead ship of the class, LZ 129 Hindenburg, established a regular transatlantic service. The airship’s destruction in a <span><a href="https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/hindenburg-disaster-pictures/">highly publicized accident</a></span> was the end of these expectations.</p>
<div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NQBLuOeM1xM/WxiUeOHDIhI/AAAAAAAAQPg/S4Z56tKVGacoO8B71ASkuizCI4MfPct7QCLcBGAs/s1600/Hindenburg_Disaster%2B%252817%2529.jpg" width="1400"></p><p>The Hindenburg floats over Manhattan Island in New York City on May 6, 1937, just hours from disaster in nearby New Jersey.</p></div>
<p>Hindenburg had a duralumin structure, incorporating 15 Ferris wheel-like main ring bulkheads along its length, with 16 cotton gas bags fitted between them.</p>
<p>The bulkheads were braced to each other by longitudinal girders placed around their circumferences. The airship’s outer skin was of cotton doped with a mixture of reflective materials intended to protect the gas bags within from radiation, both ultraviolet (which would damage them) and infrared (which might cause them to overheat).</p>
<p>The gas cells were made by a new method pioneered by Goodyear using multiple layers of gelatinized latex rather than the previous goldbeater’s skins.</p>

<p>Hindenburg’s interior furnishings were designed by Fritz August Breuhaus, whose design experience included Pullman coaches, ocean liners, and warships of the German Navy.</p>
<p>The upper “A” Deck contained 25 small two-passenger cabins in the middle flanked by large public rooms: a dining room to port and a lounge and writing room to starboard.</p>
<p>The pictures collected in this article reveal what luxury air travel looked like aboard the airship Hindenburg in the mid-1930s. The photos are part of the <span><a href="https://www.airships.net/" rel="nofollow ">Airship.net collection</a></span> by Dan Grossman.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each cabin had call buttons to summon a steward or stewardess, a small fold-down desk, a wash basin made of lightweight white plastic with taps for hot and cold running water, and a small closet covered with a curtain in which a limited number of suits or dresses could be hung; other clothes had to be kept in their suitcases, which could be stowed under the lower berth.</p>
<p>None of the cabins had toilet facilities; male and female toilets were available on B Deck below, as was a single shower, which provided a weak stream of water “more like that from a seltzer bottle” than a shower, according to Charles Rosendahl.</p>

<p>Paintings on the dining room walls portrayed the Graf Zeppelin’s trips to South America. A stylized world map covered the wall of the lounge.</p>
<p>Long slanted windows ran the length of both decks. The passengers were expected to spend most of their time in the public areas, rather than their cramped cabins.</p>
<p>The lower “B” Deck contained washrooms, a mess hall for the crew, and a smoking lounge. Yes, you heard it right, one of the most surprising areas aboard a hydrogen airship was the smoking room.</p>
<p>However, it was kept at higher than ambient pressure, so in case of a leak, the hydrogen couldn’t enter the room. Furthermore, its associated bar was separated from the rest of the ship by a double-door airlock. There was one electric lighter since no open flames were allowed aboard the ship.</p>
<p>Harold G. Dick, an American representative from the Goodyear Zeppelin Company, recalled<em> “The only entrance to the smoking room, which was pressurized to prevent the admission of any leaking hydrogen, was via the bar, which had a swiveling air lock door, and all departing passengers were scrutinized by the bar steward to make sure they were not carrying out a lit cigarette or pipe.”</em></p>

<p>The Hindenburg’s bar was a small ante-room between the smoking room and the air-lock door leading to the corridor on B-Deck.</p>
<p>This is where Hindenburg bartender Max Schulze served up LZ-129 Frosted Cocktails (gin and orange juice) and Maybach 12 cocktails (recipe lost to history), but more importantly, it is where Schulze monitored the air-lock to ensure that no one left the smoking room with burning cigarettes, cigars, or pipes.</p>

<p>Hindenburg made 17 round trips across the Atlantic in 1936—its first and only full year of service—with ten trips to the United States and seven to Brazil.</p>
<p>The flights were considered demonstrative rather than routine in schedule. The first passenger trip across the North Atlantic left Frankfurt on 6 May with 56 crew and 50 passengers, arriving in Lakehurst on 9 May.</p>
<p>As the elevation at Rhein-Main’s airfield lies at 111 m (364 ft) above sea level, the airship could lift 6 tonnes (13,000 lb) more at takeoff there than she could from Friedrichshafen, which was situated at 417 m (1,368 ft).</p>

<p>The airship was said to be so stable a pen or pencil could be balanced on end atop a tablet without falling. Launches were so smooth that passengers often missed them, believing the airship was still docked to the mooring mast.</p>
<p>A one-way fare between Germany and the United States was US$400 (equivalent to $7,811 in 2021); Hindenburg passengers were affluent, usually, entertainers, noted sportsmen, political figures, and leaders of the industry.</p>
<p>Hindenburg was used again for propaganda when it flew over the Olympic Stadium in Berlin on August 1 during the opening ceremonies of the 1936 Summer Olympic Games.</p>

<p>In 1936, Hindenburg had a Blüthner aluminium grand piano placed on board in the music salon, though the instrument was removed after the first year to save weight</p>
<p>Over the winter of 1936–37, several alterations were made to the airship’s structures. The greater lift capacity allowed nine passenger cabins to be added, eight with two beds and one with four, increasing passenger capacity to 70.</p>
<p>These windowed cabins were along the starboard side aft of the previously installed accommodations, and it was anticipated for the LZ 130 to also have these cabins. Additionally, the Olympic rings painted on the hull were removed for the 1937 season.</p>
<p>After making the first South American flight of the 1937 season in late March, Hindenburg left Frankfurt for Lakehurst on the evening of 3 May, on its first scheduled round trip between Europe and North America that season.</p>

<p>The now known as the <span><a href="https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/hindenburg-disaster-pictures/" rel="nofollow ">Hindenburg disaster</a></span> occurred on May 6, 1937, in Manchester Township, New Jersey, United States. The passenger airship caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst.</p>
<p>The accident caused 35 fatalities (13 passengers and 22 crewmen) from the 97 people on board (36 passengers and 61 crewmen), and an additional fatality on the ground.</p>
<p>The disaster was the subject of newsreel coverage, photographs, and Herbert Morrison’s recorded radio eyewitness reports from the landing field, which were broadcast the next day.</p>
<p>A variety of theories have been put forward for both the cause of ignition and the initial fuel for the ensuing fire. The publicity shattered public confidence in the giant, passenger-carrying rigid airship and marked the abrupt end of the airship era.</p>
