	<h3><em>Software Gems: The Computer History Museum Historical Source Code Series</em></h3>
<div><h3> pho·to·shop, transitive verb, often capitalized ˈfō-(ˌ)tō-ˌshäp to alter (a digital image) with Photoshop software or other image-editing software especially in a way that distorts reality (as for deliberately deceptive purposes) </h3><h4>— Merriam-Webster online dictionary, 2012</h4></div>
<p>When brothers Thomas and John Knoll began designing and writing an image editing program in the late 1980s, they could not have imagined that they would be adding a word to the dictionary.</p>



<div id="attachment_9140"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9140" src="https://computerhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photoshop-source-code-thomas-knoll.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="300"></p><p id="caption-attachment-9140">Thomas Knoll</p></div> <div id="attachment_9133"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9133" src="https://computerhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photoshop-source-code-john-knoll.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="300"></p><p id="caption-attachment-9133">John Knoll</p></div>




<p>Thomas Knoll, a PhD student in computer vision at the University of Michigan, had written a program in 1987 to display and modify digital images. His brother John, working at the movie visual effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic, found it useful for editing photos, but it wasn’t intended to be a product. Thomas said, “We developed it originally for our own personal use…it was a lot a fun to do.”</p>
<p>Gradually the program, called “Display”, became more sophisticated. In the summer of 1988 they realized that it indeed could be a credible commercial product. They renamed it “Photoshop” and began to search for a company to distribute it. About 200 copies of version 0.87 were bundled by slide scanner manufacturer Barneyscan as “Barneyscan XP”.</p>
<p>The fate of Photoshop was sealed when Adobe, encouraged by its art director Russell Brown, decided to buy a license to distribute an enhanced version of Photoshop. The deal was finalized in April 1989, and version 1.0 started shipping early in 1990.</p>
<p>Over the next ten years, more than 3 million copies of Photoshop were sold.</p>



<div id="attachment_9132"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9132" src="https://computerhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photoshop-source-code-box-and-disk.jpg" alt="" width="789" height="369"></p><p id="caption-attachment-9132">The box and disk for the original version of Photoshop on Mac.</p></div>




<p>That first version of Photoshop was written primarily in Pascal for the Apple Macintosh, with some machine language for the underlying Motorola 68000 microprocessor where execution efficiency was important. It wasn’t the effort of a huge team. Thomas said, “For version 1, I was the only engineer, and for version 2, we had two engineers.” While Thomas worked on the base application program, John wrote many of the image-processing plug-ins.</p>

<p>With the permission of Adobe Systems Inc., the Computer History Museum is pleased to make available, for non-commercial use, the source code to the 1990 version 1.0.1 of Photoshop. All the code is here with the exception of the MacApp applications library that was licensed from Apple. There are 179 files in the zipped folder, comprising about 128,000 lines of mostly uncommented but well-structured code. By line count, about 75% of the code is in Pascal, about 15% is in 68000 assembler language, and the rest is data of various sorts.</p>
<p>To download the code you must agree to the terms of the license, which permits only non-commercial use and does not give you the right to license it to third parties by posting copies elsewhere on the web.</p>

<h2>Commentary on the source code</h2>
<p>Software architect Grady Booch is the Chief Scientist for Software Engineering at IBM Research Almaden and a trustee of the Computer History Museum. He offers the following observations about the Photoshop source code:</p>
<ul>
	<li>“Opening the files that constituted the source code for Photoshop 1.0, I felt a bit like Howard Carter as he first breached the tomb of King Tutankhamen. What wonders awaited me?</li>
	<li>I was not disappointed by what I found. Indeed, it was a marvelous journey to open up the cunning machinery of an application I’d first used over 20 years ago.</li>
	<li>Architecturally, this is a very well-structured system. There’s a consistent separation of interface and abstraction, and the design decisions made to componentize those abstractions – with generally one major type for each combination of interface and implementation – were easy to follow.</li>
	<li>The abstractions are quite mature. The consistent naming, the granularity of methods, the almost breathtaking simplicity of the implementations because each type was so well abstracted, all combine to make it easy to discern the texture of the system.</li>
	<li>Having the opportunity to examine Photoshop’s current architecture, I believe I see fundamental structures that have persisted, though certainly in more evolved forms, in the modern implementation. Tiles, filters, abstractions for virtual memory (to attend to images far larger than display buffers or main memory could normally handle) are all there in the first version. Yet it had just over 100,000 lines of code, compared to well over 10 million in the current version! Then and now, much of the code is related to input/output and the myriad of file formats that Photoshop has to attend to.</li>
	<li>There are only a few comments in the version 1.0 source code, most of which are associated with assembly language snippets. That said, the lack of comments is simply not an issue. This code is so literate, so easy to read, that comments might even have gotten in the way.</li>
	<li>It is delightful to find historical vestiges of the time: code to attend to Andy Herzfield’s software for the Thunderscan scanner, support of early TARGA raster graphics file types, and even a few passing references to Barneyscan lie scattered about in the code. These are very small elements of the overall code base, but their appearance reminds me that no code is an island.</li>
	<li>This is the kind of code I aspire to write.”</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is the kind of code we all can learn from. Software source code is the literature of computer scientists, and it deserves to be studied and appreciated. Enjoy a view of Photoshop from the inside.</p>

<p>What if you set out to make the worst website you possibly could? So poorly designed and full of frustrating patterns that users would not only hate the experience of using this website, but would also come to hate your company. Could we make a web experience so terrible that it would express how much our company hated our users? </p><p>As a long-time Internet addict, I've encountered my fair share of terrible websites. Instagram where now half my feed is advertisements for stupid t-shirts and the other half is empty black space. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="604" height="758" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image.png 604w"><figcaption><span>Who in the fuck would ever wear this</span></figcaption></figure><p>Or ARNGREN.net which is like if a newspaper ad threw up on my screen. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="816" height="684" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-1.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-1.png 816w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>But Instagram still occasionally shows me pictures of people I follow and ultimately the stuff on ARNGREN is so cool I still want to buy it regardless of the layout. </p><p>No, I believe it is the crack team at Broadcom that have nailed it for the worst website in existence. </p><h3 id="lured-in-with-free-vmware">Lured in with free VMware </h3><p>So through social media I discovered this blog post from VMware announcing that their popular virtualization software is free for personal use now. <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud-foundation/2024/05/14/vmware-desktop-hypervisor-pro-apps-now-available-for-personal-use/" rel="noreferrer">You can read that here. </a> Great, I used VMware Fusion before and it was ok and maybe it will let me run Windows on an ARM Mac. Probably not but let's try it out and see. </p><blockquote>This means that everyday users who want a virtual lab on their Mac, Windows or Linux computer can do so <strong><em>for free</em></strong> simply by registering and downloading the latest build from the new download portal located at <a href="http://support.broadcom.com/">support.broadcom.com</a>. With the new commercial model, we have reduced our product group offerings down to a single SKU (VCF-DH-PRO) for users who require commercial use licensing. This simplification eliminates 40+ other SKUs and makes quoting and purchasing VMware Desktop Hypervisor apps, Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro, easier than ever. The new Desktop Hypervisor app subscription can be purchased from any Broadcom Advantage partner.</blockquote><p>I don't want to register at support.broadcom.com but it looks like I don't have a choice as this is the screen on the VMware site. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1118" height="453" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-2.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/image-2.png 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-2.png 1118w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now this is where alarm bells start going crazy in my head. Nothing about this notice makes sense. "The store will be moving to a new domain". So it's...not...down for maintenance but actually is just gone? Or is it actually coming back? Because then you say "store will be shutdown" (just a quick note, you want "the store" and "will be shutting down on April 30th 2024"). Also why don't you just redirect to the new domain? What is happening here?</p><h3 id="broadcom">Broadcom</h3><p>So then I go to support.broadcom.com which is where I was told to register and make an account. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1552" height="1039" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-3.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/image-3.png 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-3.png 1552w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Never a <em>great sign</em> when there's a link to an 11 page PDF of how to navigate your website. That's the "Learn how to navigate Broadcom Support" link. You can download that killer doc here: <a href="https://support.broadcom.com/documents/d/ecx/broadcom-support-portal-getting-started-guide">https://support.broadcom.com/documents/d/ecx/broadcom-support-portal-getting-started-guide</a></p><p> Alright let's register. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1373" height="746" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-4.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/image-4.png 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-4.png 1373w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>First the sentence "Enhance your skills through multiple self-service avenues by creating your Broadcom Account" leaps off the page as just pure corporate nonsense. I've also never seen a less useful CAPTCHA, it looks like it is from 1998 and any modern text recognition software would defeat it. In fact the Mac text recognition in Preview defeats 3 of the 4 characters with no additional work:</p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="412" height="173"></figure><p>So completely pointless and user hostile. Scoring lots of points for the worst website ever. I'm also going to give some additional points for "Ask our chatbot for assistance", an idea so revolting normally I'd just give up on the entire idea. But of course I'm curious, so I click on the link for the "Ask our chatbot" and.....</p><p><strong>It takes me back to the main page. </strong></p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1471" height="1026" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-6.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/image-6.png 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-6.png 1471w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Slow clap Broadcom. Imagine being a customer that is so frustrated with your support portal that you actually click "Ask a chatbot" and the web developers at Broadcom come by and karate chop you right in the throat. Bravo. Now in Broadcom's defense in the corner IS a chatbot icon so I kinda see what happened here. Let's ask it a question. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="349" height="595"></figure><p>I didn't say hello.

Why did you make a chatbot if all you do is select a word from a list and it returns the link to the support doc? Would I like to "Type a Query"??

I have 1Password so this won't be a problem. It's not letting me copy/paste from 1Password into this field but if I do Command + \ it seems to let me insert.

Did I....wrong you in some way? I don't understand what is happening. Ok well I refresh the page, try again and it works this time. Except I can't copy/paste into the Confirm Password field. </p><p>I mean they can't expect me to type out the impossibly complicated password they just had me generate right? Except they have and they've added a check to ensure that I don't disable Javascript and treat it like a normal HTML form. </p><p>Hey front-end folks, just a quick note. Never ever ever ever ever mess with my browser. It's not yours, it's mine. I'm letting you use it for free to render your bloated sites. Don't do this to me. I get to copy paste whatever I want whenever I want. When you get your own browser you can do whatever you want but while you are living in my house under my rules I get to copy/paste whenever I goddamn feel like it. </p><h3 id="quickly-losing-enthusiasm-for-the-idea-of-vmware">Quickly losing enthusiasm for the idea of VMware</h3><p>So after pulling up the password and typing it in, I'm treated to this absolutely baffling screen. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-12.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="459" height="982"></figure><p>Do I need those?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Proteins in the blood could warn people of cancer more than seven years before it is diagnosed, according to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48017-6" data-link-name="in body link">research</a>.</p><p>Scientists at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/oxforduniversity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">University of Oxford</a> studied blood samples from more than 44,000 people in the UK Biobank, including over 4,900 people who subsequently had a cancer diagnosis.</p><p>They compared the proteins of people who did and did not go on to be diagnosed with cancer and identified 618 proteins linked to 19 types of cancer, including colon, lung, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and liver.</p><p>The study, funded by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Cancer</a> Research UK and published in Nature Communications, also found 107 proteins associated with cancers diagnosed more than seven years after the patient’s blood sample was collected and 182 proteins that were strongly associated with a cancer diagnosis within three years.</p><p>​The authors concluded that some of these proteins could be used to detect cancer much earlier and potentially provide new treatment options, though further research was needed.​</p><p>Dr Keren Papier, a senior nutritional epidemiologist at <a href="https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/" data-link-name="in body link">Oxford Population Health</a> at the University of Oxford and joint first author of the study, said: “To save more lives from cancer, we need to better understand what happens at the earliest stages of the disease … [and] how the proteins in our blood can affect our risk of cancer. Now we need to study these proteins in depth to see which ones could be reliably used for prevention.”</p><p>A second linked study looking at genetic data from more than 300,000 cancer cases <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46834-3." data-link-name="in body link">found 40 proteins in the blood</a> that influenced someone’s risk of getting nine types of cancer. While altering these proteins may increase or decrease the chances of someone developing cancer, in some cases this could lead to unintended side-effects, the authors found.</p><p>Mark Lawler, the chair in translational cancer genomics and professor of digital health at Queen’s University Belfast, said: “The data are impressive – finding evidence of cancer before it has manifested itself clinically provides a critical window of opportunity to treat with a greater chance for success, or even more importantly to achieve the holy grail of preventing cancer before it can even occur. More work to be done, but an important step forward in a disease that affects one in two of UK citizens during their lives.”</p><p>​Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick, said the findings were another step towards identifying markers of increased cancer risk as well as those aiding early cancer diagnosis.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-9">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-9" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>“Determining protein changes that precede the development of cancer is not only important in identifying high-risk individuals but could also provide insights into factors responsible for causing cancer.”​</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Despite its 1996 release, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/Nintendo-64-Console-HTPC-Intel-Atom-Nvidia-Ion,11445.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/Nintendo-64-Console-HTPC-Intel-Atom-Nvidia-Ion,11445.html">Nintendo 64</a>'s original hardware and games have both remained relatively hot-button in enthusiast circles here into 2024. Now, the next frontier of high-end N64 gameplay may be through recompiled PC ports instead of emulation, courtesy of Mr-Wiseguy on GitHub. Wiseguy is responsible for the release of both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp" data-url="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">N64Recomp</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/Zelda64Recomp" data-url="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/Zelda64Recomp" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Zelda64Recomp</a>, a project that ports <em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</em> to PC with N64Recomp's graphical and QoL improvements, as screenshotted above and highlighted by YouTuber Nerrel below.</p><div data-nosnippet=""><p><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ywWwUuWRgsM" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p>So, what makes crazy graphical improvements like real ray-tracing, uncapped FPS, and proper ultrawide support possible for N64 games? If you've been in the Nintendo 64 enthusiast scene for a long time, you may recall the waves made when a completely decompiled <em>Super Mario 64 </em>PC Port dropped in 2020 and allowed for features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChqP2ecA8qE" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChqP2ecA8qE" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">real ray-tracing</a>, full model replacements, and so on. It still gets mods to this day.</p><p>Recompiled ports aren't quite the same as decompiled ports like the SM64 PC port in this context, but both will run natively on PC and thus be able to <em>truly</em> maximize performance and effect accuracy to the original hardware while still providing the PC-expected enhancements that come with emulation. &nbsp;N64Recomp is basically the best of both worlds, and since manually decompiling N64 games takes years of labor from one or more people, a tool to more efficiently recompile them into a quickly playable-on-PC state is a godsend for preservationists everywhere.</p><p>A tool like this also ensures that old classics that aren't currently receiving the attention of big mainstream hits remain playable well into the future in an ideal state. A Twitter post by Dario, who makes the RT64 plugin leveraged by N64Recomp and some N64 emulators, highlights this.</p><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My friend Wiseguy's been working in secret for a year on a tool to make PC ports of N64 games without complete decompilations. The result doesn't include assets and only requires a ROM to play.He's managed to run games like Banjo-Kazooie, Rocket Robot and even Superman 64. pic.twitter.com/sKGuViEsJZ<a href="https://twitter.com/dariosamo/status/1789049134709678500" data-url="https://twitter.com/dariosamo/status/1789049134709678500" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">May 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Even as we speak, advancements like this aren't the only huge boons we're seeing for fans of the Nintendo 64's library or even original hardware.

(They also took saliva samples to keep students honest.) The programs themselves lasted for 12 weeks.</span></p><p><span>In the Emotion program, students did things like:</span></p></div><ul><li><p>Compliment each other to improve their self-esteem</p></li><li><p>Set goals for themselves and think about how drugs interfere with those goals</p></li><li><p>Learn strategies for emotion regulation like deep breathing and muscle relaxation</p></li><li><p>Practice being assertive and saying no to drugs in role-plays</p></li><li><p>Make a videotaped commitment to stay drug-free</p></li></ul><div><p><span>Some of this stuff seems a bit dated now, sure, and the video thing sounds a little creepy.

Students who did the Emotion program ended up smoking </span><em>more </em><span>cigarettes and </span><em>more </em><span>weed and drinking </span><em>more </em><span>alcohol than students who received no program at all.

But that’s okay—making iPhones is also hard, and we seem to have nailed that one.</span></p><p><span>What really screws us is that it’s </span><em>surprisingly </em><span>hard to change people. We cook up schemes that seem like they should definitely work, then they don’t work, and this doesn’t chasten us or dim our enthusiasm for future schemes. Hansen et al., after accidentally causing seventh-graders to smoke, don’t end their paper with a long reverie on their hubris. They write a few self-exculpatory paragraphs and move on to the next project.</span></p><p><span>The problem is that our </span><a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/on-the-importance-of-staring-directly" rel="">illusion of explanatory depth</a><span> is so deep when it comes to human behavior that we never realize how little we understand, which prevents us from ever learning more. Nobody thinks they can whip up an iPhone in their garage over the weekend, but most people think they know how to save the children, fix the schools, reform the prisons, overhaul healthcare, repair politics, restore civility, and bring about world peace. Perhaps that’s why we have iPhones and we don’t have any of those other things.</span></p></div><div><p><span>This myth of the easily-malleable human is so widespread and so deeply believed that it borders on delusion. Once you see it, though, it can make sense of some things that otherwise seem psychotic.</span></p><p><span>For example, in the US, anybody who does academic research on humans or animals has to undergo ethics training first. That sounds reasonable, until you realize the “training” is just PowerPoint slides that you click through as fast as you can, and then you get asked questions like:</span></p><p><strong><span>Which of these represents responsible treatment of research subjects?</span><br></strong><span>A) Poking them in the eye</span><br><span>B) Using the internet to discover their weaknesses</span><br><span>C) Running them over with a forklift</span><br><span>D) Treating them with respect</span></p><p><span>And then there are a few questions like:</span></p><p><strong><span>Subsection 41b.46 of the 1972 Research Reform Act stipulates which of the following?</span><br></strong><span>A) Paragraph 17 of the 1971 Research Reform Act is null and void</span><br><span>B) Principal Investigators are not allowed to be listed as Co-Principal Investigators</span><br><span>C) Conflicts of interest must be reported on Form 99-F</span><br><span>D) Any research expenditures greater than $100 must be done via certified check</span></p><p><span>If you fail the exam, you just retake it until you pass. So this “ethics” test is actually a test of whether you can read at a sixth-grade level.</span></p><p><span>Most workplace trainings look like this.

Like when a conservative Christian senator sponsors a bill that’s like “Let’s Make It Illegal to Be Horny” and then gets caught at a brothel wearing a diaper and nipple clamps. That’s the level of hypocrisy we’re dealing with here. If you claim to care about preventing sexual harassment and then you’re out here asking whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a “county” law, you </span><em>do not </em><span>care about preventing sexual harassment.</span></p><p><span>I understand these trainings exist solely for the purposes of ass-covering. If you get sued because one of your employees, say, </span><a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/1/7/professor-accused-of-rules-violation-professor/" rel="">sticks a research participant with a dirty needle</a><span>, you can go, “Hey, don’t blame us! We made them do an ethics training!”</span></p><p><span>But why does this ass-covering work? I don’t mean legally; I don’t care if this is all because of Subsection 31a of the Let’s Make Things Worse Act of 1986, or because of the Supreme Court decision in </span><em>Buttmunch v.

So far, they have </span><a href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&amp;sid=acc5cec4-865f-434f-916e-99f043d57352%40redis" rel="">failed</a><span> to do that. And they’ve tried lots of stuff:</span></p><ul><li><p>Helping people set a goal to not be biased</p></li><li><p>Lecturing them about how great multiculturalism is</p></li><li><p>Telling them a story that counters their stereotypes (“Imagine a White guy attacks you and throws you in his trunk, and then a Black guy shows up and saves the day!”)</p></li><li><p>Making people play a virtual dodgeball game where all of their teammates are courteous Black players and all of their opponents are mean nasty White players</p></li><li><p>Showing them a bunch of pictures of Black faces with the word “GOOD” written next to them</p></li></ul><p>Some of these interventions changed people’s biases in the moment, but none of the effects lasted beyond 24 hours. And of course they didn’t! As soon as participants leave the lab, they go right back into the world that massaged those biases into the folds of their brains in the first place. You can’t permanently change implicit biases with 15 minutes of screentime, just like you can’t spray someone with a hose and expect them to stay wet forever.</p><p><span>This is part of why changing people is so surprisingly hard—no matter how much you focus on the person in front of you, you’ll never appreciate the million tiny influences that made them who they are and that keep them that way. If you really want to make someone different, you might have to change the TV they watch, the music they listen to, the things they learn in school, the friends they hang out with, the role models they look up to, etc., and if you do all that, congratulations, you’ve started what we call a </span><em>cult</em><span>. Which, unlike social scientists, do have a pretty good track record of changing people.</span></p><p>Most people’s theories of human behavior are just never gonna be tested, and so their hypotheses can be both wrong and immortal. For example, if you think the solution to political polarization is to drug Congress with magic mushrooms, then a) nobody’s ever going to prove you wrong, and b) I think I know which anti-drug program you got in high school.</p><p>On top of this, we’re all running our own tiny-N, p-hacked studies and then slathering the results in confirmation bias:</p><ul><li><p><span>“My kid does better when we feed him raw beef and read him </span><em>Ulysses</em><span>, so that’s what all schools should do, and the fact that this also happens to fit my personal and political aesthetics is merely a coincidence.”</span></p></li><li><p>“I gave my religion’s holy book to a person who was struggling and now they’re doing better, which is proof my religion is true.”</p></li><li><p>“Some famous CEOs were mean to their employees and got good results, so I should do that too, which is convenient because I am a jerk.”</p></li></ul><p>These itsy-bitsy confounded little pseudo-studies are more convincing to us than any “official” experiments precisely because they unfold before our own eyes. On the one hand, that’s fair—“official” experiments are so poor on average that you should consider them guilty until proven innocent. But doing low-quality uncontrolled social science in your own backyard is a good way to increase your convictions without increasing your evidence.</p><p><span>Even when there is reasonably good data, our hypotheses about how humans work are often so vague that they can withstand any attempts at falsification. Okay, so </span><em>this </em><span>emotions-based anti-drug intervention didn’t succeed, but maybe that’s because the instructors weren’t motivated enough, or it didn’t go on long enough, or they used the wrong kind of deep breathing technique, or they should have targeted fifth-graders instead of seventh-graders, etc., on and on, forever. If you can only think of all these critiques and exceptions after the fact, however, you at least have to admit you didn’t really know what you were talking about in the first place.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-144595148" href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/how-to-get-7th-graders-to-smoke#footnote-3-144595148" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p><span>The philosopher Michael Strevens </span><a href="https://www.strevens.org/scientia/" rel="">argues</a><span> that science requires humans to adopt an “alien mindset”—you have to ignore common sense, the wisdom of the ancients, the literal word of God, etc. Why would anyone toss out everything they know and instead try to learn things by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Redi" rel="">putting rotten meat in a jar</a><span>? Science took so long to develop, Strevens says, because it seemed </span><em>stupid</em><span>.</span></p><p>I say: we must become even stupider. If all of our intuitions, theories, and knowledge cause us to run programs that make tweens do more drugs—well, then, we oughta ditch our intuitions, theories, and knowledge!</p><div><p><span>Sufficiently stupid people would look at </span><a href="http://sexualharassmenttraining.com/" rel="">SexualHarassmentTraining.com</a><span> and ask, “Wait, how does this work? You show people walls of text and then ask them multiple choice questions and then they don’t sexually harass each other anymore?” They would wonder whether an imaginary dodgeball game could really make people less racist. They might question whether a couple deep-breathing exercises are enough to stop seventh graders from doing shots at a party.</span></p><p><span>It’s important to cultivate that kind ignorance, because every single person on Earth is at least a part-time people-changer. We want to raise our kids to be kind. We want to earn our boss’s respect. We would like our spouse to stop playing the “road trip playlist” that’s just a 10-hour loop of “Dreams” by The Cranberries and “Dreams” by Fleetwood Mac. We’ll never have large-N, preregistered, multi-site RCTs that can tell us how to do these things. We have to make our best guesses, but we also have to treat those guesses with enough skepticism that we notice when we guess wrong, so we can guess differently next time.</span></p><p><span>Some people are supposed to be </span><em>professional</em><span> people-changers, and so they carry a greater burden of proof and a sacred set of responsibilities. When you have the power to compel people to do things, you should be able to prove that your compulsions make people better off. It’s not enough to say, “Hey, I’m just doing stuff that everybody would agree is intuitive and reasonable,” because, as we’ve seen, intuitive and reasonable stuff often </span><em>hurts people</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>We can’t expect every well-meaning program to work. We know so little about how to help people that sometimes we’re going to screw it up, in which case our responsibility is to figure out what we did wrong. What we cannot do is accidentally turn tweens into binge-drinkers and then keep right on going as if nothing happened.</span></p><p><span>This is a thorny problem, but I know exactly how to solve it. I’m just waiting for the IRB to approve my application to run people over with a forklift.</span></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="content:encoded"><p>
	CORVALLIS, Ore. – Today’s rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide increase is 10 times faster than at any other point in the past 50,000 years, researchers have found through a detailed chemical analysis of ancient Antarctic ice.</p>
<p>
	The findings, just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provide important new understanding of abrupt climate change periods in Earth’s past and offer new insight into the potential impacts of climate change today.</p>
<p>
	“Studying the past teaches us how today is different. The rate of CO2 change today really is unprecedented,” said Kathleen Wendt, an assistant professor in Oregon State University’s College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences and the study’s lead author.</p>
<p>
	“Our research identified the fastest rates of past natural CO2 rise ever observed, and the rate occurring today, largely driven by human emissions, is 10 times higher.”</p>
<p>
	Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is a greenhouse gas that occurs naturally in the atmosphere. When carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, it contributes to warming of the climate due to the greenhouse effect. In the past, the levels have fluctuated due to ice age cycles and other natural causes, but today they are rising because of human emissions.</p>
<p>
	Ice that built up in Antarctic over hundreds of thousands of years includes ancient atmospheric gasses trapped in air bubbles. Scientists use samples of that ice, collected by drilling cores up to 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) deep, to analyze the trace chemicals and build records of past climate. The U.S. National Science Foundation supported the ice core drilling and the chemical analysis used in the study.</p>
<p>
	Previous research showed that during the last ice age, which ended about 10,000 years ago, there were several periods where carbon dioxide levels appeared to jump much higher than the average. But those measurements were not detailed enough to reveal the full nature of the rapid changes, limiting scientists’ ability to understand what was occurring, Wendt said.</p>
<p>
	“You probably wouldn’t expect to see that in the dead of the last ice age,” she said. “But our interest was piqued, and we wanted to go back to those periods and conduct measurements at greater detail to find out what was happening.”</p>
<p>
	Using samples from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ice core, Wendt and colleagues investigated what was occurring during those periods. They identified a pattern that showed that these jumps in carbon dioxide occurred alongside North Atlantic cold intervals known as Heinrich Events that are associated with abrupt climate shifts around the world.</p>
<p>
	“These Heinrich Events are truly remarkable,” said <a href="https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/people/christo-buizert">Christo Buizert</a>, an associate professor in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences and co-author of the study. “We think they are caused by a dramatic collapse of the North American ice sheet. This sets into motion a chain reaction that involves changes to the tropical monsoons, the Southern hemisphere westerly winds and these large burps of CO2 coming out of the oceans.”</p>
<p>
	During the largest of the natural rises, carbon dioxide increased by about 14 parts per million in 55 years. And the jumps occurred about once every 7,000 years or so. At today’s rates, that magnitude of increase takes only 5 to 6 years.</p>
<p>
	Evidence suggests that during past periods of natural carbon dioxide rise, the westerly winds that play an important role in the circulation of the deep ocean were also strengthening, leading to a rapid release of CO2 from the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>
	Other research has suggested that these westerlies will strengthen over the next century due to climate change. The new findings suggest that if that occurs, it will reduce the Southern Ocean’s capacity to absorb human-generated carbon dioxide, the researchers noted.</p>
<p>
	“We rely on the Southern Ocean to take up part of the carbon dioxide we emit, but rapidly increasing southerly winds weaken its ability to do so,” Wendt said.</p>
<p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container" itemprop="articleBody"><p>We continue our work on formal verification of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust</a> programs with our tool <a href="https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-rust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coq-of-rust</a>, to translate Rust code to the formal proof system <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coq</a>. One of the limitation we had was the handling of primitive constructs from the standard library of Rust, like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/option/enum.Option.html#method.unwrap_or_default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Option::unwrap_or_default</a> or all other primitive functions. For each of these functions, we had to make a Coq definition to represent its behavior. This is both tedious and error prone.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, we worked on the translation of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">core</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alloc</a> crates of Rust using <code>coq-of-rust</code>. These are very large code bases, with a lot of unsafe or advanced Rust code. We present what we did to have a "best effort" translation of these crates. The resulting translation is in the following folders:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-rust/blob/main/CoqOfRust/alloc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoqOfRust/alloc</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-rust/blob/main/CoqOfRust/core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoqOfRust/core</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="initial-run-">Initial run 🐥<a href="#initial-run-" aria-label="Direct link to Initial run 🐥" title="Direct link to Initial run 🐥">​</a></h2>
<p>An initial run of <code>coq-of-rust</code> on the <code>alloc</code> and <code>core</code> crates of Rust generated us two files of a few hundred thousands lines of Coq corresponding to the whole translation of these crates. This is a first good news, as it means the tool runs of these large code bases. However the generated Coq code does not compile, even if the errors are very rare (one every few thousands lines).</p>
<p>To get an idea, here is the size of the input Rust code as given by the <code>cloc</code> command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>alloc</code>: 26,299 lines of Rust code</li>
<li><code>core</code>: 54,192 lines of Rust code</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that this code uses macros that we expand in our translation, the actual size that we have to translate is even bigger.</p>

<p>The main change we made was to split the output generated by <code>coq-of-rust</code> with one file for each input Rust file. This is possible because our translation is insensitive to the order of definitions and context-free. So, even if there are typically cyclic dependencies between the files in Rust, something that is forbidden in Coq, we can still split them.</p>
<p>We get the following sizes as output:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>alloc</code>: 54 Coq files, 171,783 lines of Coq code</li>
<li><code>core</code>: 190 Coq files, 592,065 lines of Coq code</li>
</ul>
<p>The advantages of having the code split are:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is easier to read and navigate in the generated code</li>
<li>it is easier to compile as we can parallelize the compilation</li>
<li>it is easier to debug as we can focus on one file at a time</li>
<li>it is easier to ignore files that do not compile</li>
<li>it will be easier to maintain, as it is easier to follow the diff of a single file</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fixing-some-bugs-">Fixing some bugs 🐞<a href="#fixing-some-bugs-" aria-label="Direct link to Fixing some bugs 🐞" title="Direct link to Fixing some bugs 🐞">​</a></h2>
<p>We had some bugs related to the collisions between module names. These can occur when we choose a name for the module for an <code>impl</code> block. We fixed these by adding more information in the module names to make them more unique, like the <code>where</code> clauses that were missing. For example, for the implementation of the <code>Default</code> trait for the <code>Mapping</code> type:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>#[derive(Default)]</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>Mapping</span><span>&lt;</span><span>K</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>V</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>// ...</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>we were generating the following Coq code:</p>

<p>We prove that it is equivalent to the simpler functional code:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Definition</span><span> unwrap_or_default </span><span>{</span><span>T </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Set</span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>{</span><span>_</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> core</span><span>.</span><span>simulations</span><span>.</span><span>default</span><span>.</span><span>Default</span><span>.</span><span>Trait T</span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>(</span><span>self </span><span>:</span><span> Self T</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    T </span><span>:=</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>match</span><span> self </span><span>with</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> None </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> core</span><span>.</span><span>simulations</span><span>.</span><span>default</span><span>.</span><span>Default</span><span>.</span><span>default </span><span>(</span><span>Self </span><span>:=</span><span> T</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> Some x </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> x</span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>end</span><span>.</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This simpler definition is what we use when verifying code. The proof of equivalence is in <a href="https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-rust/blob/main/CoqOfRust/core/proofs/option.v" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoqOfRust/core/proofs/option.v</a>. In case the original source code changes, we are sure to capture these changes thanks to our proof. Because the translation of the <code>core</code> library was done automatically, we trust the generated definitions more than definitions that would be done by hand. However, there can still be mistakes or incompleteness in <code>coq-of-rust</code>, so we still need to check at proof time that the code makes sense.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>We can now work on the verification of Rust programs with more trust in our formalization of the standard library. Our next target is to simplify our proof process, which is still tedious. In particular, showing that simulations are equivalent to the original Rust code requires doing the name resolution, introduction of high-level types, and removal of the side-effects. We would like to split these steps.</p>

<p><strong>The following analysis was performed on a S8 data line locator which replied to the hidden SMS command for version query (<code>*3646655*</code>) with:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Ver=MTK6261M.T16.17.01.10
build=2017/01/10 17:33</code></pre>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A while back Joe Fitz tweeted about the <em>S8 data line locator</em><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. He referred to it as “Trickle down espionage” due to its reminiscence of NSA spying equipment.</p>
<p>The <em>S8 data line locator</em> is a GSM listening and location device hidden inside the plug of a standard USB data/charging cable. It supports the 850, 900, 1800 and 1900 MHz GSM frequencies.</p>
<p>Its core idea is very similar to the COTTONMOUTH product line by the NSA/CSS <span>[1]</span> in which an RF device is hidden inside a USB plug. Those hidden devices are referred to as implants.</p>
<p>The device itself is marketed as a location tracker usable in cars, where a thief would not be able to identify the USB cable as a location tracking device. Its malicious use-cases can, however, not be denied. Especially since it features no GPS making its location reporting very coarse (1.57 km deviation in my tests). It can, e.g., be called to listen to a live audio feed from a small microphone within the device, as well as programmed to call back if the sound level surpasses a 45 dB threshold. The fact that the device can be repackaged in its sliding case, after configuring it, i.e.&nbsp;inserting a SIM, without any noticeable marks to the packaging suggests its use-case: covert espionage.</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/00_packaging.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/00_packaging.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator sliding case packaging."></a></p>
<h2 id="s8-data-line-locator-capabilities">S8 data line locator capabilities</h2>
<p>The S8 data line locator has several eavesdropping, espionage and spying capabilities. A SMS message log could look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/10_00_cmds.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/10_00_cmds.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator hidden commands."></a></p>
<h3 id="listen-in">Listen in</h3>
<p>Calling the S8 data line locator for 10 seconds establishes a call and allows you to listen to the microphone feed from the device.</p>
<h3 id="call-back">Call back</h3>
<p>Sending <code>1111</code> via SMS to the device enables voice activated call back. It is acknowledged via the following SMS reply:</p>
<pre><code>DT: Set voice monitoring, voice callback and sound sensitivity:400</code></pre>
<p>Once the audio level goes above 40 dB the device calls back the number that send the <code>1111</code> command.</p>
<p>Sending <code>0000</code> disables the audio triggered call back. It is replied by:</p>
<pre><code>DT: Voice monitoring cancelled successfully.</code></pre>
<h3 id="query-location">Query location</h3>
<p>Accoding to the manual sending ‘dw’ via SMS to the device yields a reply SMS with the location. This reply is in the form:</p>
<pre><code>Loc:Street, ZIP City, Country
http://gpsui.net/u/xxxx Battery: 100%</code></pre>
<p>The ‘xxxx’ are replaced with characters ‘0-9,A-Z,a-z’ and the <code>Street, ZIP City, Country</code> line with the appropriate street, ZIP, city and country. The link to http://gpsui.net can be accessed without authorization. It forwards to Google maps.</p>
<p>The location was never more accurate than 1.57 km off.</p>
<p><strong>During the query the device will use a mobile data connection to an unknown endpoint (presumably gpsui.net). This is confirmed by a “MMS/Internet” charge by my provider. My provider does not discern MMS and Internet, but it is save to assume there is an Internet connection established during location query.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This issue was the stepping stone for this analysis. Because the device sends unknown data to an unknown third party it can not - at least with a clear conscious - be used in, e.g., a penetration test. You simply can not use a potentially pre-owned tool.</strong></p>
<p>I therefore tried to analyze and eliminate this phone-home “feature”.</p>

<p>To gain access to the devices innards we first tear of the metal shield of the USB connector: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/04_00_teardown.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/04_00_teardown.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator removing USB connector shield."></a></p>
<p>Next, we remove the plastic cover: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/04_03_teardown.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/04_03_teardown.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator removing USB connector shield."></a></p>
<h2 id="chips">Chips</h2>
<p>After opening the device we can identify the chips:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/06_02_chipid.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/06_02_chipid.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator board with MT6261MA and RDA 6625e chips."></a></p>
<p>It features:</p>
<ul>
<li>MediaTek MT6261MA: Low budget chip often used in cheap Chinese smartwatches. No official documentation nor information about the chip is available from MediaTek.</li>
<li>RDA 6626e: “a high-power, high-efficiency quad-band front-end Module […] designed for GSM850, EGSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900 handheld digital cellular equipment.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="connections">Connections</h2>
<p>So far I could identify 3 different avenues to connect to the device:</p>
<h3 id="usb-passthrough">USB (passthrough)</h3>
<p>The USB A-connector and the Micro-B cable are not connected to the MT6261MA. They merely pass the signal from one to the other:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/07_00_meter.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/07_00_meter.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator USB passthrough."></a></p>
<h3 id="uart">UART</h3>
<p>The next connection is a UART:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/07_02_meter.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/07_02_meter.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator UART."></a></p>
<p>Interfacing with it yields, approximately 3 seconds after booting the device:</p>

<p>However, the output stops there. Input to the device is ignored.</p>
<p>It is likely there exist a different firmware version that accepts AT modem commands<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. The boot banner of that alternate firmware references “ZhiPu”<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> (some file names of the FAT12 in the firmware flash of my device contain this string as well, so the device firmware is likely related to that other firmware).</p>

<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/07_01_meter.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/07_01_meter.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator MTK USB."></a></p>
<p>Next, a USB cable must be soldered to these connectors as follows:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/09_usb.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/09_usb.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator MTK USB soldered."></a></p>
<p>The device will then be recognized as an MediaTek phone USB endpoint with the following data:</p>
<p><code>ID 0e8d:0003 MediaTek Inc. MT6227 phone</code></p>
<p>This is often called the “MTK boot repair”, “MTK DM DP flash”, etc. It will allow us to interface with the device and dump the firmware ROM and flash.</p>
<h2 id="dumping-firmware">Dumping firmware</h2>
<p>To dump the firmware I use the open source Fernvale research OS <span>[2]</span>. It was initially targeted for the MT6260 processor. It has, however, been ported to the MT6261 and also works on the MT6261MA.</p>
<h2 id="obtaining-and-building-fernlys-mt6261-branch">Obtaining and building fernly’s MT6261 branch</h2>
<p>A suitable fork of fernly by Urja “urjaman” Rannikko can be obtained and build as follows:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/urjaman/fernly
git clone https://github.com/robertfoss/setup_codesourcery.git
sudo setup_codesourcery/setup.sh
/usr/local/bin/codesourcery-arm-2014.05.sh
cd fernly
git checkout fernly6261
make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi-
exit
cp 95-fernvale-simple.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/.</code></pre>
<h2 id="dumping-rom">Dumping ROM</h2>
<p>To dump the flash we run:</p>
<pre><code>echo "data = [" &gt; rom.py
fernly/build/fernly-usb-loader /dev/fernvale fernly/build/dump-rom-usb.bin &gt;&gt; rom.py
echo "
]
f = open('rom.bin','wb')
for s in data:
  f.write(chr(int(s,16)))
f.close()
" &gt;&gt; rom.py
python rom.py</code></pre>
<p>The file <code>rom.bin</code> will now (at least according to the fernly repository documentation) contain the devices ROM.</p>
<h2 id="dumping-flash">Dumping flash</h2>
<p>To dump the flash of the device we need to patch flashrom as follows:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/flashrom/flashrom
cd flashrom/
git checkout c8305e1dee66cd69bd8fca38bff2c8bf32924306
patch -p0 &lt; ../fernly/flashrom-fernvale.patch
# manually fix Makefile.rej to complete patching</code></pre>
<p>The patch does not cleanly apply so you need to fix the rejected <code>Makefile</code> (<code>Makefile.rej</code>) manually yourself.</p>
<p>Once this was done we can first load the fernly firmware into the devices RAM via:</p>
<pre><code>fernly/build/fernly-usb-loader -w /dev/fernvale fernly/build/stage1.bin fernly/build/firmware.bin</code></pre>
<p>Next, we can use the <code>fernvale_spi</code> programmer we patched into flashrom.</p>
<p>We first let it recognize the flash via:</p>
<pre><code>flashrom/flashrom --programmer fernvale_spi:dev=/dev/fernvale</code></pre>
<p>And then read the flash via:</p>
<pre><code>flashrom/flashrom --programmer fernvale_spi:dev=/dev/fernvale -c "MX25L3205(A)" --read flash.dat</code></pre>
<p><code>flash.dat</code> will now contain the devices flash memory.</p>
<h2 id="writing-flash-attempt">Writing flash attempt</h2>
<p>Writing the flash can be performed via:</p>
<pre><code>flashrom/flashrom --programmer fernvale_spi:dev=/dev/fernvale -c "MX25L3205(A)" --write flash.dat</code></pre>
<p>However, the flash seems to be block protected and the block protect bits can not be disabled by flashrom. I have not (yet) found a way to disable the block protect.</p>
<h4 id="alternative-device">Alternative device</h4>
<pre><code>$ flashrom/flashrom --programmer fernvale_spi:dev=/dev/fernvale

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Mostly for my personal education I did some more analysis then the obligatory firmware dump.</p>
<h2 id="sim-sniffing-via-simtrace">SIM sniffing (via SIMtrace)</h2>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/02_simtrace.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/02_simtrace.jpg" alt="SIM sniffing against S8 data line locator via SIMtrace."></a></p>
<p>First, I sniffed the communication between the device and the SIM. Interestingly, it accessed all records of the telephone book and SMS storage. More specifically it accesses the following files, which are not needed to provide the services rendered by the device itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>ADF
<ul>
<li>EF(ECC)</li>
<li>EF(EXT2)</li>
<li>EF(SMS)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DF(TELECOM)
<ul>
<li>DF(PHONEBOOK)
<ul>
<li>EF(ADN)</li>
<li>EF(ANRA1)</li>
<li>EF(SMS)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Other SIM accesses seems to be normal.</p>
<p>This is probably not an elaborate scheme to harvest phone numbers and send them to China, but rather the way the default manufactured SIM code was implemented and it was never trimmed down to the needs of this device. Nevertheless, I found it interesting seeing how the device is accessing virtually everything on the SIM.</p>
<h2 id="gprs-sniffing-attempt-via-openbts">GPRS sniffing attempt (via OpenBTS)</h2>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/03_000_openbts.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/03_000_openbts.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator connected to OpenBTS."></a></p>
<p>Next, I tried to sniff the Internet traffic to figure out what is send to whom via the mobile data connection. To this end, I used a Ettus B100 with OpenBTS.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the S8 data line locator did not connect to the GPRS. This caused the following alternative response to the <code>dw</code> location command:</p>
<pre><code>Loc:Please link:http://gpsui.net/smap.php?lac=1000&amp;cellid=10&amp;c=901&amp;n=70&amp;v=7100 Battery:67%</code></pre>
<h2 id="flash-contents">Flash contents</h2>
<p>The most interesting things could be found in the dumped flash.</p>
<h3 id="os">OS</h3>
<p>Strings in the <code>flash.dat</code> suggest the device is probably running Nucleus RTOS:</p>

<h3 id="fat12-filesystems">FAT12 filesystems (?)</h3>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> In my original write up I missed the flash translation layer, hence the FAT12 filesystem was corrupted. Thanks to Bjoern Kerler (<a href="https://twitter.com/viperbjk">@viperbjk</a>) for pointing this out to me. I will work on descrambling the flash and update once I have it working.</p>
<p>For the time being here is my original try at extracting the files from the file system:</p>
<p>Searching the <code>flash.dat</code> for the FAT12 file systems that are supposedly present in on MediaTek phones, we get:</p>

<p>However, two of the partitions do not appear to be valid FAT12 file systems:</p>
<pre><code>$ fls -o 5646 flash.dat -f fat12

$ fls -o 5826 flash.dat -f fat12

$ fls -o 5853 flash.dat -f fat12

<p>And the middle FAT12 block seems to be corrupted as well, i.e.&nbsp;only orphan files:</p>
<pre><code>$ fls -o 5826 flash.dat -rp -f fat12

<p>An attempt was made to extract the files:</p>
<pre><code>fls -o 5826 flash.dat -Frp -f fat12 | while read line; do
    path=$(echo "$line" | awk -F':' '{print $2}')
    mkdir -p $(dirname $path);
    icat -o 5826 flash.dat $(echo "$line" | grep -oE "[0-9]+" | head -n1) &gt; $path
done</code></pre>
<p>But most files are empty. The results are also very inconsistent, i.e., when changing SIM cards there are significant changes to the files listed by The Sleuthkit. This indicates that those are either not FAT12 partitions or a modified FAT12 variant.</p>
<p>Again as stated at the start of this section I’m missing the flash translation layer (FTL). There are proprietary tools which can do the FTL descrambling for you.</p>
<p>But to keep this whole writeup open source, further analysis was done using hexdump.</p>
<h3 id="configuration-data">Configuration data</h3>
<p>The flash also contained some configuration data. First, the IMSI of the inserted SIM and the number that is used to remote control the device could be found in the flash:</p>

<p>In the above flash segment you can also see a reference to <code>gpsui.net</code>. This is presumably the remote server which is contacted to turn the MCC, MNC, LAI and CID codes into street, city and country information as well as the link to gpsui.net which forwards to Google maps. However, because writing to the flash could not be achieved this hypothesis could not be confirmed.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-commands">Hidden commands</h3>
<p>Eventually, there was a small find potentially making this effort worthwhile. Searching the <code>flash.dat</code> for the <code>dw</code>,<code>1111</code> and <code>0000</code> commands reveals more hidden commands:</p>

<p>However, most of those commands do not function correctly. It seems the devices firmware is shared among several such location tracking and listening devices, e.g., there are commands referring to LEDs and a TF card, both of which this device do no feature, however, other devices available online do.</p>
<p>An incomplete list of the found commands and there replies is:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>help</code>: replies with the following commands:
<ul>
<li><code>dw</code>: Locate</li>
<li><code>qqq</code>: Device binding</li>
<li><code>1111</code>: Sound Alarm Monitor on</li>

<li><code>*reboot*</code>: reboots the device</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly the reply strings could not be found in the flash in plaintext. This suggests that some of the data is compressed.</p>
<p>The message log of me trying some of the found hidden commands to populate the above list is as follows:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/10_01_cmds.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/10_01_cmds.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator hidden commands."></a></p>
<p>It seems that we can use <code>esioaddr</code> to change the address used to lock up the location information. However, no connection to a given domain nor IP is actually made. The device will simply report <code>the addr invalid</code> in the location report.</p>
<p>The <code>server</code> command sets a different server. Changing it does not result in <code>the addr invalid</code> responses, as can be seen from this second message log:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/10_14_cmds.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/10_14_cmds.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator hidden commands."></a></p>
<h2 id="provider-call-logs-and-itemized-bill">Provider call logs and itemized bill</h2>
<p>Because the GPRS sniffing failed I resort to the billing of my provider to further analyze the communication habits of the S8 data line locator.</p>
<p>Obviously reply SMS are billed. More interesting is the Internet access patterns.</p>
<h3 id="dw-or-loc-commands-and-during-idle"><code>dw</code> or <code>loc</code> commands and during idle</h3>
<p>During location queries the device will use “MMS/Internet” service. The following is a segment in which first repeated location queries were performed, then the devices was left idle:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/11_00_provider_logs.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/11_00_provider_logs.jpg" alt="Provider call logs and itemized bill during location queries."></a></p>
<p>Even during idle the device sometimes uses the “MMS/Internet” service.</p>
<p>Even though I deactivated all tracking features that I may have activated during my previous testing, I can not be 100 % sure that this is not something that I activated, maybe while stumbling through the gpsui.net website. However, I regardless of whether I activated this “feature” or not, I do not want it and would like to know what data is actually send and how to deactivate it.</p>
<h2 id="gpsui.net">gpsui.net</h2>
<p>Going deeper into the gpsui.net website would probably result in a new writeup in itself. It is a very big surveillance hub, just replace the xxxx in http://gpsui.net/u/xxxx with some letters and numbers and you can see random people’s locations.</p>
<p>The website also makes a reference to ZhiPu:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/12_gpsui.net.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/12_gpsui.net.jpg" alt="gpsui.net"></a></p>
<p>It seems this is the company that makes these trackers.</p>
<p>You can get your credentials for login by texting <code>aqb</code> to your S8 data line monitor. The username as well as the password are 6 digit numbers. They are also located in the flash right before the IMSI.</p>
<p>The web interface allows access to several features, which may or may not work as I’m not interested in them and hence not tested all of them:</p>
<h3 id="interface">Interface</h3>
<p>The plain interface after login looks like this: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_00_interface.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_00_interface.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: Interface"></a></p>
<p>I panned the map into the ocean to hide my location. The location is pinpointed on the map by a little car and a pop up containing the GPS data and date of the last location update.</p>
<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
<p>You can change various settings: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_01_setting.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_01_setting.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: settings"></a></p>
<h3 id="alarms">Alarms</h3>
<p>You can setup alarms: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_02_alarm.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_02_alarm.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: alarms"></a></p>
<h3 id="real-time-location-tracking">Real time location tracking</h3>
<p>You can enable real time location tracking: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_03_rtloc.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_03_rtloc.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: real time location"></a></p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>Interestingly, the web interface allows to playback past location queries, as can be seen here: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_04_history.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_04_history.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: history"></a></p>
<p>I find this particularity disturbing because in the original manual of the S8 data line locator there is no mention of the login credentials nor a way to get them. Also I did not expect a location query history to be stored somewhere.</p>
<h3 id="fence">Fence</h3>
<p>It also allows to set a geo fence: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_05_fence.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_05_fence.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: fence"></a></p>
<h3 id="push-commands">Push commands</h3>
<p>Next, it allows you to push command to the device: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_06_push_cmd.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_06_push_cmd.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: push commands"></a></p>
<p>This means anyone with access to your gpsui.net login credentials can control your device. A device which original packaging nor manual make any reference to said website.</p>
<h3 id="management">Management</h3>
<p>You can also add your fleet of devices into one account for simplified management: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_07_mgnmt.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_07_mgnmt.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: management"></a></p>
<h3 id="vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>After publishing this write up, Vangelis Stykas (<a href="https://twitter.com/evstykas">@evstykas</a>) found a bunch of Insecure Direct Object References with Authorization bypass through user-controlled key vulnerabilities leading to Horizontal escalation of privilege (one user can view/modify information of all other 615,817 accounts) in gpsui.net.</p>
<p>So my initial suspicions about gpsui.net were correct: you do not want your data to be send there.</p>
<p>We then also looked at some other (GPS) location tracking web services. What we found was mildly concerning and you can read about it here: <a href="https://0x0.li/trackmageddon/">https://0x0.li/trackmageddon/</a></p>
<p>I just want to point out here that a normal user is (at least as far as I know) never informed about the login credentials to the above website.</p>
<p>Neither is the user informed that the location queries are logged and stored there. Nor that the device can be remote controlled from there.</p>
<h2 id="detection">Detection</h2>
<p>When sending data the S8 data line locator can be detected with a CC308+ (a cheap Chinese RF detector):</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/01_cc308+.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/01_cc308+.jpg" alt="CC308+ detecting the S8 data line locator."></a></p>
<p>The S8 data line locator seems to be badly shielded. A location request via the <code>dw</code> command causes noticeable electronic noise by the device. It seems in general to cause all sorts of RF interference.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>
<p>While I did not (yet) succeed with my original goal to disable the mobile data phone home “feature’, it was nevertheless a fun exercise and hopefully someone finds this useful or at least educational.</p>
<p>Future work needs to be done on several things:</p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<p>I was not able yet to write new firmware via flashrom because I was not able to disable block protection on the flash, yet. Maybe a different avenue for flashing new firmware could be the SPFlash tool<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and/or the Flash tool. However, that would not be open source. <strong>If you are able to flash your S8 data line locator please contact me with details!</strong></p>
<p>Further, I tried to capture the GPRS data connection of the device, but was unable to do so. It would not use GPRS when connected to my network. Currently, I do not know how the APN is configured. The SIM trace does not indicate that the EF(ACL) is ever accessed. However, as I found the correct APN configuration stored in the devices flash, this suggests the device acquires this information via a setup SMS by the service provider.</p>
<h2 id="ideas">Ideas</h2>
<p>Dremel the board smaller, e.g., you don’t need the USB connector. This way the S8 data line locator could be turned into a “modular” bug that could be placed where ever there is a 5 V 1 A power source.</p>
<h2 id="other-people-working-on-this">Other people working on this</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dmxinajeansuit">@dmxinajeansuit</a>: <a href="http://n0.lol/em/s8">http://n0.lol/em/s8</a></p>
<h2 id="appendix-fuck-up">Appendix: Fuck up</h2>
<p>No writeup would be complete without at least one fuck up. So here it is:</p>
<p>While using the S8 data line locator with OpenBTS I provisioned imaginary numbers. When switching SIM cards I forgot to turn of the voice activated callback.</p>
<p>So long story short, some guy with the number 3333333 listend in on me for 2 minutes:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/11_01_provider_logs.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/11_01_provider_logs.jpg" alt="Provider call log fail."></a></p>
<p>The number appears to be some sort of “service” number, hence it was an expensive call. But more importantly I did not notice this until I reviewed the logs!</p>
<p>So my resume on these little hardware espionage implants: <strong>They are stealthy and dangerous as fuck!</strong></p>
<h2 id="appendix-video">Appendix: Video</h2>

			<p><span data-contrast="auto">What comes after repealing parking mandates? Lots of newly legal homes. Studies from two cities observed that in the years following reform, </span><span data-contrast="auto">60 to 70 percent of new homes would previously have been illegal to build.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The new data add to the heap of evidence that parking mandates—local rules that ban new homes and businesses unless they have a pre-determined number of off-street parking spaces—are a binding constraint on housing construction. While only a few buildings opted out of providing parking entirely, most new homes in the studies ultimately benefited from the increased flexibility.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“It isn’t surprising,” said researcher C. J. Gabbe, who authored one of the studies. According to Gabbe, homebuilders have been saying for a long time that demand for off-street parking was lower than what zoning rules required.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The results suggest that across jurisdictions, the majority of potential future homes are being held back, in part, by parking mandates.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Cities of all types stand to benefit from undoing constraining parking policies of the past,” researchers from Buffalo wrote in their findings.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Both of these cities’ policy changes provided a natural experiment for measuring the effects of parking policy.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“It’s impossible, really, to tie a specific code change to changes in the market,” explained Brennan Staley, a strategic advisor for Seattle’s Office of Planning and Community Development. Other local regulations, housing prices, and international finance markets all play a part in the real estate market. Michael Hubner, who works on long range planning in Seattle, agreed: “It’s very difficult to point to a causal relationship.”&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What is clear to Hubner is that the market chose to use the flexibility the city began offering. Not just on the margins, but by a lot. During the first five years after Seattle’s reform, a total of 35,388 new homes in Seattle ended up benefiting from the freedom to not build excess parking. Today, those homes account for 9.4 percent of the city’s entire housing stock.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Staley pointed out other benefits of the flexible code. “It’s not just the supply of those units that may be increased, but also that there are cheaper units because they didn’t have parking,” he said. One parking space can add </span><a href="https://www.reinventingparking.org/2015/06/how-much-does-one-parking-spot-add-to.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">over $200</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to monthly rents.

Seattle researchers estimated that at $30,000 per parking space, builders collectively saved $537 million in expenses that would have been passed on to future tenants.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

Both of these buildings included on-site parking, but at lower ratios than what the city had required.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Buffalo, like many other cities, let builders request special permission to deviate from city-determined parking ratios.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In Seattle, whose reforms were concentrated in the most urban parts of the city, new buildings provided 40 percent less parking than would have been required before the reform.&nbsp;While that sounds like a dramatic drop, the change merely right-sized parking to match existing demand. In fact, it was exactly in line with a separate 2012 study that had observed 40 percent of the parking spaces in King County, where Seattle is located, </span><a href="https://metro.kingcounty.gov/programs-projects/right-size-parking/pdf/rsp-final-report-8-2015.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">never get used</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The 2020 study of Seattle also found reason to believe that parking flexibility would be useful in other parts of town, too. Forty-three percent of buildings in Seattle still subject to parking mandates built the minimum number of spaces required, suggesting that these projects might have opted to build more homes per parking space if allowed. That also suggests that an unknown number of homes would exist today if not for the parking mandates still in place.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">For most cities, the chilling effects of parking mandates remain largely invisible. Few builders end up taking on the risk and expense of requesting a variance from zoning codes. But thanks to these vanguard cities, the significance of parking reform is finally coming to light.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Far from affecting just a handful of buildings, these studies suggest that a wide array of housing projects would use flexibility around parking minimums if given the opportunity. For cities and states searching for solutions to their own housing shortages, eliminating parking mandates is a simple action that seems likely to help create a lot of new homes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-experiment="{&quot;widget&quot;:true}">Since Renee’s work is for artistic purposes, it shouldn’t technically go against Google’s guidelines. Wired also reports that Renee is not alone in getting blocked from sharing her work. </p>

<p data-experiment="{&quot;widget&quot;:true}">Similar incidents were reported back in 2017, when Google started locking users out of their content for violating its policy. </p>

<p>I discovered a genius online. Just look at <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=%22Jodie+Chiffey%22">all her accomplishments</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Jodie is a cross-functional 3D designer and blogger. She has special interests in open source 3D printing for R&amp;D and has spent a lot of time at different projects across the globe to learn more about 3D printing. Most of what she has learned is from hands-on experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie Chiffey is a blogger, and mom who loves nothing more than testing out the latest grills, gadgets, and outdoor cooking tech. As passionate about food as she is about family, Jodie loves spending time outdoors and is always the one found hovering over the grill at parties, camping trips, and local community events.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie discovered her passion for grilling when she realized how much filler she was able to eliminate from her diet by grilling. So, she began to devote herself to learning more about grilling and mastering her grilling technique. Now, she spends most of her time outdoors grilling non-processed foods and enjoying fresh food on her plate.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie Chiffey - Mellifluent Performer at Guitar Space - Jodie fell in love with the guitar at a young age, but has hit a lot of bumps in the road with her journey. She knows all of the frustrations that come with learning the instrument without any formal lessons. But, she pushed through all of those challenges and she’s now here to teach other people too. If you’re looking for advice that’ll stick with you for a lifetime, Jodie’s here to share everything she knows. (mattnote: also lol at “Mellifluent” —&nbsp;ESL spam disease slipping in there)</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie Chiffey loves the outdoors. If you aren’t sure where to find her, check the nearest dirt trail. She loves being outdoors and spends a good deal of time reviewing products like clothing, footwear, and other outdoor gear.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie is a full-time blogger who reviews a lot of the products for us. She writes many of our backpacking gear reviews, outdoor skills advice, and information, and helps visitors find the best destinations for backpacking, camping, hiking, and a lot more.</p></li>
<li><p>If Jodie’s friends have a travel or outdoors question, they know who to ask and that’s why we featured on our website. Now you can get the same great advice her friends enjoy, so you know where to go and what gear to take with you.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie Chiffey - Travel Lover at RV Pioneers- Jodie Chiffey enjoys the outdoors. She goes mountain biking and loves spending time in nature and what better way to get there than to go in an RV? She shares her information here on RV Pioneers.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie knows quite a bit about beer and brewing it. From different types of hops and how they will affect your brew to her own opinion on various craft brews on the market. Jodie isn’t afraid to bring you her opinion on a new brew here at Beertannica, along with helping you decide if an ingredient or beer is the one for you. Her comprehensive guides will answer all your questions and more!</p></li>
<li><p>As a fellow business owner and business strategist, Jodie shares valuable insight into the strategies and tactics business owners can use to increase their growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie’s run through a lot of shoes. After all, she’s a competitive racer! She understands all of the important features of an ideal running shoe and the biomechanics of the feet of different kinds of runners. You’ll be surprised to learn that Jodie doesn’t have a degree or diploma in athletic shoes; she’s just passionate about them and owns more than fifty pairs of running shoes herself. She’s dedicated her life to studying athletic shoes in detail and writing about them.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie has been a certified personal trainer for several years now and has a passion for wellness, health, fitness like no other. She’s been educating herself on nutrition since she was in high school. His boyfriend is a professional herbalist and food healer, so she takes the health and wellness discussions into the homefront. She uses and tests health products, protein supplements personally and shares her insights on topics such as protein, diets, muscle recovery, muscle building, supplements, and naturally-sourced products.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie is a nutrition and health expert who owns over 50 pairs of athletic shoes and puts them to good use. She is always looking for a new healthy recipe, loves juicing and tests new products at home, and reports back to us here at Alt Protein. Jodie’s articles and recipes can also be found on her successful blog called The Juice Chief.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie Chiffey understands how frustrating it can be to sort your way through long pieces of boring content just to try to get a simple explanation of the digital topic you’re looking to learn about. That’s why she’s here to break down all of the complex topics, to help you learn, understand, and grow in your own digital life. She wants to be there to give you all of the information you need to know to make your own personal decisions in regards to the digital topics you’re bringing into your life!</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie Chiffey - Jodie is an avid traveler who loves camping and hiking. Why do you love mountain biking? I’ve had two separate passions for quite a long time - cycling and hiking. Whenever I was planning to spend some time outdoors, I had to decide which one to choose. It all made perfect sense when I discovered mountain biking, a beautiful blend of both of my favorite activities with the added value of adrenaline. What is your budget bike pick? If I were looking for a budget-friendly bike these days, I would undoubtedly go with GT Aggressor Expert. It’s super comfortable and lots of fun to ride. Nevertheless, Giant has some great entry-level mountain bikes these days too. What is your splurge bike pick? If I had an endless budget, I would probably buy a Santa Cruz 5010 - ideally in the exclusive X01 AXS RSV Carbon CC configuration. It’s one of the best bicycles I have had the chance to ride so far. What’s your favorite trail that you’ve ridden? Last summer, I enjoyed some tremendous single trails in the Austrian Alps around Nassfeld. Short but spicy Yannick Trail was probably my favorite. It was pretty demanding, and the views were truly priceless.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie Chiffey - Jodie Chiffey spends a lot of time helping people figure out how to get the perfect yard. With so many variants from climate, soil type, to the amount of rainfall, she researches and helps Turf and Till readers choose the best products for their needs. Why are you giving advice on Turf and Till? After spending three and a half years transforming my yard from a generic underestimated wasteland into the green haven of my dreams, I have felt two contradictory emotions: relief and sadness. I have realized that I will miss all the research, consideration, and hard work and started looking for new ways to approach this topic and make it a permanent part of my life. That was when I started helping others to fulfill their landscape-related dreams too. Since then, I have worked on numerous exciting projects and gained valuable experience. I see writing for Turf and Till as a natural continuation of my work in this field. Moreover, it is also an excellent opportunity to give back to the online community that has taught me a lot in my beginnings. What is your favorite part of landscaping? My favorite part is turning a blueprint into a reality. I am a huge overthinker, so planning is the most exciting yet also the most demanding and frustrating part of every project for me. When I am finally satisfied with the plan and can watch it turn into a real landscape, someone’s garden, or yard, it is the most gratifying moment I know. If you had to give one piece of advice to someone fixing up their yard, what would it be? Don’t be afraid to think big. There is always space for downgrades and compromises later, but don’t settle with any of it before you even start. If I earned a dollar for each “impossible” idea I have seen turning into a reality, I would be very rich by now.</p></li>

<p>of course it’s just a huge affiliate link bot farm network. There are a dozen sites with “Jodie Chiffey” as primary author each with dozens of pages about “The Top 10 X For Y!” each with low effort summaries and affiliate links everywhere polluting tons of search results.</p>
<p>also, these “media companies” are two examples out of hundreds or thousands operating to manipulate global search results at scale for low-effort-low-return pennies-per-click ad or affiliate revenue. We’re going to need cryptographically authenticated proof-of-utility to be indexed by search engines fairly soon (or maybe not? who cares? google is happy to <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/">pollute the world with search garbage</a> because more garbage means more ads means more google revenue and google is nothing without its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/alphabet-issues-first-ever-dividend-70-billion-buyback.html">$70 billion per year stock buyback program</a>).</p>
<p>Also if you haven’t searched for tech help over the past couple years, there are hundreds of fake “tech blog” sites doing the same thing: a site appearing as if it’s “a personal blog,” but having thousands of “helpful” pages in 300 different topic areas half scraped from github issues and half auto-generated. Also, by pure coincidence I’m sure, each page has 50 google ads or it bounces direct to spyware install sites when you navigate away. Each one of those sites is an “expert” in 100 different projects, platforms, programming languages, and strategies, yet they all are written from a first person “it’s just my blog lol!” point of view.</p>
<p>Curiously, each of these sites has the exact same layout, looks driven from the same CMS, has the same headers and footers, has the same navigation everywhere, has the same vapid FAQs (“Mountain Biking Tips: WEAR A HELMET!!”), all copied across thousands of sites all ranking in the top results for common queries to every day questions…</p>
<p>of course, this garbage is also flooding youtube as well with new emotionless and storyless and zero-personality autogenerated near-human voices all over the place:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oknB7TihO5A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oknB7TihO5A</a></li>

</ul>
<p>people talk a lot about “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6L07VdZO4o">dead internet theory</a>” and how everything is becoming bots and scams and advertising bait, but those aren’t automatic outcomes. The “dead internet” is a process of <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ClicBot/comments/1chlcnk/from_debt_to_wealth_my_personal_finance_success/">direct information platform exploitation</a> by manipulative people operating on unchecked-and-unauthenticated platforms drawn to running scams due to their life circumstances (we’re ignoring the other branch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_web_brigades">politically controlled “information warfare”</a> scams for now). Bot/scam/advertising/affiliate manipulation is born from usually living in low income societies where the most logical upward trajectory is just exploiting and manipulating high income people and societies who aren’t their own people (much like how a good way to stop spyware is changing your windows locale to russia because russian spyware firms don’t attack their own). Who cares if you make a million fake websites and destroy the information coherency of the planet if it earns you a passive $3 per day?</p>
<p>The only future of the internet is, sadly, proof-of-person and proof-of-residence on every public network interaction. There’s no going back to “high trust anonymous internet” when half the world is willing to exploit the other half. We end up with real time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82KJWFdWZw">global access</a> from “low trust low income max exploitation because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ScammerPayback/videos">who is going to stop us</a>” wankers to “high trust high income low questioning” societies and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/whats-a-pig-butchering-scam-heres-how-to-avoid-falling-victim-to-one">everything falls apart</a>.</p>
<p>the net of a million million lies is upon us and only you can prevent information fires.</p>
<p>Welcome to the future of the entire Internet. Jodie the full time 3d-printing expert, grill master, expert guitarist, marketing wonder, brewqueen, personal trainer, avid camper, certified nutritionist, professional hiker, marathon runner, constant traveler, yard work enthusiast, mountain biker, rv driver, sportshoe expert, and mommy blogger welcomes you too.</p>

<p>If you had to make predication about what the least commonly used 4-digit PIN is, what would be your guess?</p>

<p>This tangentially relates to the XKCD cartoon.  In Randall’s cartoon, the perpetrator’s plan backfired because his selected license plate was so unique that it was very memorable.  What is the least memorable license plate?  Ask any spy you know (snigger) what the best way to blend into a crowd is.  Their answer will be not stand out, to appear “normal”, and not be notable in any way.</p>

<p>This article is <b>not</b> intended to be a hacker bible, or to be used as a utility, resource, or tool to help would-be thieves perform nefarious actions.  I will only disclose data sufficient to make my points, and will try to avoid giving specific data outside of the obvious examples.  I do not want to be an enabler for script-kiddies.   Please do not email me asking for the database I used; if you do, you will be wasting your time as I’m not going to respond.

<p>Obviously, I don’t have access to a credit card PIN number database.  Instead I’m going to use a proxy.  I’m going to use data condensed from released/exposed/discovered password tables and security breaches.</p>

<h3>Soap Box – Password Database Exposures</h3>
<table>
<tbody><tr>

<p>Over the years, there have been numerous password table security breaches:  Some very high profile, some low profile, but all embarrassing (and many exceedingly expensive; both in direct fines and indirect loss of business through erosion of trust and reputation). </p>
<p>Fool me once, well, no, even that’s not really acceptable, but fool me twice …  I’ll go even further: <b>Any</b> developer who stores the password table of their database in clear text  should be so mortified by this lack of security that they should not be sleeping at night until they fix it.  Ignoring the fact that you should never have ever coded it this way, you have an <u>obligation</u> to learn from these past breaches.</p>
<p>If you work for a company and are knowledgeable that your customer database is <i>“protected”</i> by such lightweight security then run, don’t walk, to your CEO/Presidents office, pound on the door and insist (s)he puts out a mandate to fix the matter with extreme prejudice.  Don’t leave until you get an affirmative response. Badger, badger then badger them again. Make yourself a proverbial thorn in their side.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to sell my services as a consultant here (though if you are interested, my rates are very reasonable compared to the cost of legal defense, potential FTC sanctions, class action suits, shareholder backlash,  fines, loss of reputation and business …)  There are plenty of security experts in the industry who can help you (if you need help filtering them and don’t have referrals, someone who has CISSP qualifications is a good place to start).</p>
<p><span><span color="black">&nbsp;<b>Bottom line</b>&nbsp;</span></span> Security strengthens with layers, and the simple application of encryption on your database table can help protect your customer’s data if this table is exposed.  It does not defend against all possible attacks, but it does nothing but good things.  What possible reason is there store things in clear-text? </p>

<p>By combining the exposed password databases I’ve encountered, and filtering the results to just those rows that are exactly four digits long <span color="gold">[0-9]</span> the output is a database of all the four digit character combinations that people have used as their account passwords.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p>Given that users have a free choice for their password, if users select a four digit password to their online account, it’s not a stretch to use this as a proxy for four digit PIN codes.</p>

<h2>The Data</h2>

<p>I was able to find almost <i>3.4 million</i> four digit passwords.   Every single one of the of the 10,000 combinations of digits from <span color="gold">0000</span> through to <span color="gold">9999</span> were represented in the dataset.</p>

<p>The next most popular 4-digit PIN in use is <span>&nbsp;1111&nbsp;</span>  with over 6% of passwords being this.</p>
<p>In third place is <span>&nbsp;0000&nbsp;</span> with almost 2%.</p>
<p>A table of the top 20 found passwords in shown at the right.  A staggering <span color="gold">26.83%</span> of all passwords could be guessed by attempting these 20 combinations!</p>

<p>(Statistically, with 10,000 possible combination, if passwords were uniformly randomly distributed, we would expect the these twenty passwords to account for just 0.2% of the total, not the 26.83% encountered)</p>

<p>Looking more closely at the top few records, all the usual suspects are present <span>&nbsp;1111&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;2222&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;3333&nbsp;</span> … <span>&nbsp;9999&nbsp;</span> as well as <span>&nbsp;1212&nbsp;</span> and (snigger) <span>&nbsp;6969&nbsp;</span>.</p>
<p>It’s not a surprise to see patterns like <span>&nbsp;1122&nbsp;</span> and <span>&nbsp;1313&nbsp;</span> occurring high up in the list, nor <span>&nbsp;4321&nbsp;</span> or <span>&nbsp;1010&nbsp;</span>.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;2001&nbsp;</span> makes an appearance at #19. <span>&nbsp;1984&nbsp;</span> follows not far behind in position #26, and James Bond fans may be interested to know <span>&nbsp;0007&nbsp;</span> is found between the two of them in position #23 (another variant <span>&nbsp;0070&nbsp;</span> follows not much further behind at #28).</p>

<p>The first “puzzling” password I encountered was <span>&nbsp;2580&nbsp;</span> in position #22.   What is the significance of these digits? Why should so many people select this code to make it appear so high up the list?</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td rowspan="2"><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/keypad.png"></td>
<td colspan="2">
<p>Then I realized that <span>&nbsp;2580&nbsp;</span>is a straight down the middle of a telephone keypad!</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p> (Interestingly, this is very compelling evidence confirming the hypothesis that a 4-digit password list is a great proxy for a PIN number database.  If you look at the numeric keypad on a PC-keyboard you’ll see that 2580 is slightly more awkward to type on the PC than a phone because the order of keys on a keyboard is the inverted.  Cash machines and other terminals that take credit cards use a phone style numeric pads.  It appears that many people have an easy to type/remember PIN number for their credit card and are re-using the same four digits for their online passwords, where the <i>"straight down the middle"</i> mnemonic no longer applies).</p></td>

<p>(Another fascinating piece of trivia is that people seem to prefer even numbers over odd, and codes like <span>&nbsp;2468&nbsp;</span> occur higher than a odd number equivalent, such as <span>&nbsp;1357&nbsp;</span>).</p>

<h2>Cumulative Frequency</h2>

<p>As noted above, the more popular password selections dominate the frequency tables.  The most popular PIN code of <span>&nbsp;1234&nbsp;</span> is more popular than the <i>lowest 4,200 codes combined!</i></p>
<p>That's right, you might be able to crack over 10% of all codes with one guess!  Expanding this, you could get 20% by using just five numbers!</p>
<p>Below is a cumulative frequency graph:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/c.png"></p><p>Statistically, <i>one third</i> of all codes can be guessed by trying just 61 distinct combinations!</p>
<p>The 50% cumulative chance threshold is passed at just 426 codes (far less than the 5,000 that a random uniformly distribution would predict).  Paranoid yet?</p>

<p>OK, we've investigated most frequently used PINS and found they tend to be predictable and easy to remember, let's turn for a second to the bottom of the pile.</p>

<p>In my dataset the answer is <span>&nbsp;8068&nbsp;</span> with just 25 occurrences in 3.4 million (this equates to 0.000744%, far, far fewer than random distribution would predict, and five orders of magnitude behind the most popular choice).</p>

<h2>Memorable Years</h2>

<p>Many of the high frequency PIN numbers can be interpreted as years, <i>e.g.</i>  <span>&nbsp;1967&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;1956&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;1937&nbsp;</span> … It appears that many people use a year of birth (or possibly an anniversary) as their PIN. This will certainly help them remember their code, but it greatly increases its predictability.</p>

<p>Just look at the stats: Every single <span>&nbsp;19??&nbsp;</span> combination can be found in the <i>top fifth</i> of the dataset!</p>
<p>Below is a plot of this in graphical format.  In this chart, each <span color="yellow">yellow</span> line represents a PIN number that starts <span>&nbsp;19??&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/c2.png"></p><p>If all the passwords were uniformly distributed, there should be no significant difference between the frequency of occurrence of, <i>for instance</i>, <span>&nbsp;1972&nbsp;</span> and any other PIN ending in seventy two <span>&nbsp;??72&nbsp;</span>.  However, as we shall see, this is not the case at all.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;1972&nbsp;</span> occurs in ordinal position #76 (with a frequency 0.099363%).  Here’s a histogram for the occurrences of all <span>&nbsp;??72&nbsp;</span> probabilities.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/r.png"></p><p>You can clearly see the spike at <span>&nbsp;1972&nbsp;</span> (with smaller spikes at <span>&nbsp;7272&nbsp;</span>  and <span>&nbsp;1472&nbsp;</span>)</p>
<p>If you calculate the ratio of the peak of <span>&nbsp;1972&nbsp;</span> to the average of all the other <span>&nbsp;??72&nbsp;</span> PINS you get the ratio of <span color="gold">&nbsp;<b>22:1</b></span></p>
<p>PINS starting with <span>&nbsp;19??&nbsp;</span> are much more likley to occur. Of course, it’s not just 1972.  Here is plot of the ratio of <span color="gold">19</span> to <span color="gold">non-19</span> for all hundred combinations.  Along the x-axis are all the combinations of last two digits �XX, and for each of these the ratio of the 19XX to average of all the other ??XX occurrences has been calculated.  Here’s the chart:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/r2.png"></p><p>It's a pretty good approximation for a demographic chart! (suggested by the red-dashed trend line) which would probably allow a fair estimation of the ages (years of birth) of the people using the various websites. (Of course, hackers invert this strategy and use the age of a target to try and give information to guess a user's PIN.  Looking at this graph, this might give them up to a <i>40x</i> advantage!)</p>
<p>Just about all the ratios are above <span color="gold">1.0</span>.  The noteable exceptions are <span>&nbsp;??34&nbsp;</span> and <span>&nbsp;??00&nbsp;</span> (which are easy to explain, since the massive popularity of <span>&nbsp;1234&nbsp;</span> and <span>&nbsp;0000&nbsp;</span> dwarf <span>&nbsp;1934&nbsp;</span> and <span>&nbsp;1900&nbsp;</span>respectively).  Simiarly <span>&nbsp;33&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;44&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;55&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;66&nbsp;</span> … are lower than expected as the quad codes like <span>&nbsp;3333&nbsp;</span> mask out even the <span>&nbsp;1933&nbsp;</span> boost.</p>
<p>There are also spikes in the graph corresponding to the popular PINS of <span>&nbsp;1919&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;1984&nbsp;</span> and <span>&nbsp;1999&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I love pretty ways to graphically vizualize data.  Pictures really do paint thousands of words.</p>
<p>Another interesting way to visualize the PIN data is in this grid plot of the distribution.  In this heatmap, the x-axis depicts the left two digits from <span color="gold">[00]</span> to <span color="gold">[99]</span> and the y-axis depicts the right two digits from <span color="gold">[00]</span> to <span color="gold">[99]</span>.  The bottom left is <span>&nbsp;0000&nbsp;</span> and the top right is <span>&nbsp;9999&nbsp;</span>.</p>
<p>Color is used to represent frequency.  The higher frequency occurences are yellow to white hot, and the lower frequency occurences are red, through dark red to black.</p>

<h2>More than four</h2>

<p>The purpose of this posting was to investigate patterns and frequency of four digit PIN numbers.  However, the database I collected also has <i>all-numeric</i> password of different lengths.  It's worth taking a quick look at these too.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/pl.png"></p><p>I found close to 7 million all-numeric passwords.  Approximately half of these were the four-digit codes we've just examined.</p>
<p>Six digit codes are the next most popular length, followed eight.</p>
<p>I hope, hope that the people who have passwords of nine digits long are <u>not</u> using their Social Security Numbers!</p>
<p>Below are the top 20 passwords for the various lengths, along with their share of their same-size namespace.</p>

<h3>Some interesting observations (and a little speculation)</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;For five digit passwords, users appear to have <i>even less</i> imagination in selecting their codes (22.8% select 12345).  All the usual suspects occur, but a new addition is the puerile addition in position #20 of the concatenation of 420 and 69.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;For six digit password, again 696969 appears highly.  Also of note is 159753 (a "X" mark over the numeric keypad).  James Bond returns with 007007.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;For seven digits, the standby of 1234567 is a much lower frequency (though still the top).  I speculate that this is because many people may be using their telephone number (without area code) as a seven digit password.  Telephone numbers are fairly distinct, and already memorized, so when a seven digit code is needed, they spring to mind easily.  The higher frequency of usage of telephone numbers reduces the need to use imagination (or lack thereof) and select something else.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;Is Jenny there?  The fouth most popular seven digit password is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/867-5309/Jenny">8675309</a> (It's a popular 80's song).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;Eight digit passwords are just as expected.  Lots of pattern, and lots of repetition.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;Common nine digit passwords also follow patterns and repetition. 789456123 appears as an easy <i>"Along the top, middle and bottom of the keypad"</i> 147258369 is related in the vertical direction (and other variants appear high up). Again we get a 420 moment with 420420420, and also the shaken, not stirred, but repeated 007007007 returns.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;Interestingly for ten digits 1029384756 appears (alternating ascending/descending digits), as well as the odd/even 1357924680.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;Hurrah for math!  In position #17 of the ten digit password list we get 3141592654 (The first few digits of <i>Pi</i>)</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>Since publishing this article, it's been brought to my attention that, of course, in addition to anniversary years, many people encapsulate dates in the format MMDD (such as birthdays …) for their PIN codes.</p>
<p>This clearly explains the lower left corner where, if you look at the heatmap, there is a huge contrast change at the height of around 30-31 (the number of days in a month), extending to 12 on the x-axis. (Thanks to <b>zero79</b> for first pointing this out).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/mmdd.png"></p><p>Many people also asked the significance of 1004 in the four character PIN table.  This comes from Korean speakers.  When spoken, "1004" is <i>cheonsa</i> (cheon = 1000, sa=4).</p>
<p>"Cheonsa" also happens to be the Korean word for <i>Angel</i>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>APT 2.9.3 introduces the first iteration of the new solver codenamed
solver3, and now available with the –solver 3.0 option. The new solver
works fundamentally different from the old one.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>Solver3 is a fully backtracking dependency solving algorithm that defers
choices to as late as possible. It starts with an empty set of packages,
then adds the manually installed packages, and then installs packages
automatically as necessary to satisfy the dependencies.</p>
<p>Deferring the choices is implemented multiple ways:</p>
<p>First, all install requests
recursively mark dependencies with a single solution for install, and any
packages that are being rejected due to conflicts or user requests will
cause their reverse dependencies to be transitively marked as rejected,
provided their or group cannot be solved by a different package.</p>
<p>Second, any dependency with more than one choice is pushed to a priority
queue that is ordered by the number of possible solutions, such that we
resolve a|b before a|b|c.</p>
<p>Not <em>just</em> by the number of solutions, though. One important point to
note is that optional dependencies, that is, Recommends, are always
sorting after mandatory dependencies. Do note on that: Recommended
packages do not “nest” in backtracking - dependencies of a Recommended
package themselves are not optional, so they will have to be resolved
before the next Recommended package is seen in the queue.</p>
<p>Another important step in deferring choices is extracting the common
dependencies of a package across its version and then installing them
before we even decide which of its versions we want to install - one
of the dependencies might cycle back to a specific version after all.</p>
<p>Decisions about package levels are recorded at a certain decision level,
if we reach a conflict we backtrack to the previous decision level,
mark the decision we made (install X) in the inverse (DO NOT INSTALL X),
reset all the state all decisions made at the higher level, and restore
any dependencies that are no longer resolved to the work queue.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-sat-solver-design">Comparison to SAT solver design.</h2>
<p>If you have studied SAT solver design, you’ll find that essentially
this is a DPLL solver without pure literal elimination. A pure literal
eliminitation phase would not work for a package manager: First negative
pure literals (packages that everything conflicts with) do not exist,
and positive pure literals (packages nothing conflicts with) we do not want
to mark for install - we want to install as little as possible (well subject,
to policy).</p>
<p>As part of the solving phase, we also construct an implication graph, albeit
a partial one: The first package installing another package is marked as the
reason (A -&gt; B), the same thing for conflicts (not A -&gt; not B).</p>
<p>Once we have added the ability to have multiple parents in the implication
graph, it stands to reason that we can also implement the much more advanced
method of conflict-driven clause learning; where we do not jump back to the
previous decision level but exactly to the decision level that caused the
conflict. This would massively speed up backtracking.</p>
<h2 id="what-changes-can-you-expect-in-behavior">What changes can you expect in behavior?</h2>
<p>The most striking difference to the classic APT solver is that solver3 always keeps
manually installed packages around, it never offers to remove them. We will relax that
in a future iteration so that it can <em>replace</em> packages with new ones, that is, if your
package is no longer available in the repository (obsolete), but there is one that
Conflicts+Replaces+Provides it, solver3 will be allowed to install that and remove the
other.</p>
<p>Implementing that policy is rather trivial: We just need to queue <code>obsolete | replacement</code>
as a dependency to solve, rather than mark the obsolete package for install.</p>
<p>Another critical difference is the change in the autoremove behavior: The new solver
currently only knows the strongest dependency chain to each package, and hence it will
not keep around any packages that are only reachable via weaker chains.
A common example is when <code>gcc-&lt;version&gt;</code> packages accumulate on your system over the
years. They all have <code>Provides: c-compiler</code> and the <code>libtool</code> <code>Depends: gcc | c-compiler</code>
is enough to keep them around.</p>
<h2 id="new-features">New features</h2>
<p>The new option <code>--no-strict-pinning</code> instructs the solver to consider all versions of
a package and not just the candidate version. For example, you could use <code>apt install foo=2.0 --no-strict-pinning</code>
to install version 2.0 of foo and upgrade - or downgrade - packages as needed to satisfy <code>foo=2.0</code> dependencies.
This mostly comes in handy in use cases involving Debian experimental or the Ubuntu proposed pockets, where you
want to install a package from there, but try to satisfy from the normal release as much as possible.</p>
<p>The implication graph building allows us to implement an <code>apt why</code> command, that while not as nicely
detailed as aptitude, at least tells you the exact reason why a package is installed. It will only show
the strongest dependency chain at first of course, since that is what we record.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-left-to-do">What is left to do?</h2>
<p>At the moment, error information is not stored across backtracking in any way, but we generally
will want to show you the first conflict we reach as it is the most natural one; or all conflicts.
Currently you get the last conflict which may not be particularly useful.</p>
<p>Likewise, errors currently are just rendered as implication graphs of the form <code>[not] A -&gt; [not] B -&gt; ...</code>,
and we need to put in some work to present those nicely.</p>
<p>The test suite is not passing yet, I haven’t really started working on it. A challenge is that most
packages in the test suite are manually installed as they are mocked, and the solver now doesn’t remove
those.</p>
<p>We plan to implement the replacement logic such that foo can be replaced by <code>foo2 Conflicts/Replaces/Provides foo</code>
without needing to be automatically installed.</p>
<p>Improving the backtracking to be non-chronological conflict-driven clause learning would vastly
enhance our backtracking performance. Not that it seems to be an issue right now in my limited
testing (mostly noble 64-bit-time_t upgrades). A lot of that complexity you have normally is not
there because the manually installed packages and resulting unit propagation (single-solution
Depends/Reverse-Depends for Conflicts) already ground us fairly far in what changes we can actually make.</p>
<p>Once all the stuff has landed, we need to start rolling it out and gather feedback. On Ubuntu I’d like
automated feedback on regressions (running solver3 in parallel, checking if result is worse and then
submitting an error to the error tracker), on Debian this could just be a role email address to send
solver dumps to.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can also incrementally start rolling this out. Like phased updates in Ubuntu,
we can also roll out the new solver as the default to 10%, 20%, 50% of users before going to the
full 100%. This will allow us to capture regressions early and fix them.</p>

  PaliGemma is a lightweight open <i>vision-language model</i> (VLM) inspired by
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09199">PaLI-3</a>,
  and based on open components like the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15343">SigLIP
  vision model</a> and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08295">Gemma language
  model</a>. PaliGemma takes both images and text as inputs and can answer questions about
  images with detail and context, meaning that PaliGemma can perform deeper analysis of
  images and provide useful insights, such as captioning for images and short videos,
  object detection, and reading text embedded within images.
</p> <p>
  There are two sets of PaliGemma models, a general purpose set and a research-oriented set:
  </p><ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/paligemma">PaliGemma</a> -
      General purpose pretrained models that can be fine-tuned on a variety of tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/paligemma-ft">PaliGemma-FT</a> -
        Research-oriented models that are fine-tuned on specific research datasets.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Key benefits include:

<p dir="auto">Eink is the brand of a family of paper-like electrophoretic displays. The underlying technology is invented in the MIT Media Lab between 1995 and 1997 by Barrett Comiskey, J.D. Albert, and Joseph Jacobson. They later founded the E Ink Corporation to commercialize this technology.</p>
<p dir="auto">Nowadays they are commonly used on e-readers and electronic shelf labels. You’ve probably seen them on Kindle, or in stores, or maybe in some train stations as well.</p>

<p dir="auto">This section gives an overview of the electrophoretics displays, including the screen panels available and underlying technology. Note this project obviously doesn't and can't support all electrophoretic screens. This documentation also solely focuses on using existing off-the-shelf screen panels rather than the physics or manufacturing process of one.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Basic Theory of Operation</h3><a id="user-content-basic-theory-of-operation" aria-label="Permalink: Basic Theory of Operation" href="#basic-theory-of-operation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the simplest form, you have charged particles with different colors, dispersed in some oil in some transparent container. By applying electric fields the particles can be moved up or down to produce either black or white, or a mixture of that.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/blob/main/assets/eink_carta.gif"><img src="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/raw/main/assets/eink_carta.gif" alt="eink-particle" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">(Source: <a href="https://www.eink.com/tech/detail/How_it_works" rel="nofollow">https://www.eink.com/tech/detail/How_it_works</a> , copyright Eink Corporation)</p>
<p dir="auto">There are multiple technologies based on this basic concept, namely Eink’s micro-capsule display, SiPix (now acquired by Eink)’s micro-cup display, and WFT’s DES display. They differs in specifics ways of confining the particles in containers, but otherwise very similar.</p>
<p dir="auto">The pixels on the screen are typically arranged as a 2D array, driven with TFTs. The pixels are scanned/ driven periodically at a fixed refresh rate, typically ranging from 50Hz to 120Hz. Applying positive voltage on the pixel will typically drive the particles towards the white state, while applying negative voltage will drive the particles towards the black state. This is similar to active matrix TN/IPS LCDs, which also uses 2D TFT arrays and uses electrical fields for changing state. However unlike LCDs, EPDs maintain their state after the electrical field is removed. So unlike LCDs which require continuously refreshing, the EPDs only need to be refreshed till the pixels are fully driven.</p>
<p dir="auto">In terms of driving the screen panel, depending on the pixel value (1 or 0), each pixel would be driven either with a positive voltage or a negative voltage. A global counter can be used to count the frames elapsed, and stop driving the pixels after a predefined period of time (for example, 100ms). Two framebuffers are typically used for determining if the pixel has changed color or not. If not, then the pixel does not need to be driven.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Advantages and Disadvantages</h3><a id="user-content-advantages-and-disadvantages" aria-label="Permalink: Advantages and Disadvantages" href="#advantages-and-disadvantages"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In terms of display quality, EPDs are no match for modern IPS LCDs. The following is a comparison table of key parameterics. Specific number would vary depending on the screen used, but should be within the same ballpack.</p>

<p dir="auto">It has a few advantages. It reflect lights instead of emitting lights, so it generally consumes less power and can be used outdoors, etc. It’s also bistable, means that it retains the image after the power has been removed. Personally, the biggest differentiating factor for me (author of this README) is that it looks like paper.</p>

<p dir="auto">The image above shows a comparison between reflective TFT LCD (SHARP memory LCD in this case) and Eink. The LCD has a mirror-like texture which changes reflectivity drastically in different angles, while the Eink is more paper-like.</p>

<p dir="auto">There are many other reflective or bistable display technologies. They are all interesting displays on their own, but none of them feels like paper (yet).</p>

<p dir="auto">The Eink controller is in some ways similar to the display controller (DC/ CRTC) + timing controller (TCON) in a typical LCD based system. It takes the raw image data and convert it to signals required to drive the screen.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/blob/main/assets/eink_controller.svg"><img src="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/raw/main/assets/eink_controller.svg" alt="eink-controller"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To understand the actual work of an eink controller, start from the basic concept. The color of a pixel can be changed by applying positive or negative voltage for a finite period of time. From the controller’s perspective, depending on the current state of the pixel and the desired state of the pixel, there are 4 possibilities.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Current State</th>
<th>Target State</th>
<th>Action</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Black</td>
<td>Black</td>
<td>No operation</td>

<tr>

<p dir="auto">The controller need to store and maintain the screen state inside of its own buffer memory, so it would typically have a large on-chip SRAM or an off-chip SDRAM controller. The controller should also have a timer to ensure the screen doesn't get overdriven or underdriven.</p>
<p dir="auto">Controller often use the so-called "<a href="#understanding-waveform">waveform</a>" to replace the action colume of the previous table. Instead of hardcoding the action for state transition, the actions are stored into a look-up-table (LUT) which can be modified at runtime to allow higher flexibility.</p>
<p dir="auto">Controllers may also offer more advanced features such as <a href="#dithering">dithering</a> acceleration, multiple region update, automatic LUT selection, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Screen Panel Types</h3><a id="user-content-screen-panel-types" aria-label="Permalink: Screen Panel Types" href="#screen-panel-types"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As discussed in the previous section, an Eink screen need to be coupled to an Eink controller to function. Aside from that, screen also needs high voltage drivers to drive the TFTs and the pixels. Virtually all E-paper panels use either COG (Chip-on-Glass) or TAB (Tape Auto Bonding) to integrate some chips onto the screen panel itself. Most of the screens available today can be divided into two categories based on whether or not the controller is integrated in:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/blob/main/assets/screen_types.svg"><img src="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/raw/main/assets/screen_types.svg" alt="screen-types"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Here is a non-exhaustive list of the type based on their size: (the size or resolution is not related to or limited by the type, it is just for a certain size, the vendors tend to make them the same type.)</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Screens without controller: 4.3", 6.0", 7.8", 8.0", 9.7", 10.3", 13.3", 25.3", 31.2", 42"</li>
<li>Screens with controller: 1.02", 1.54", 2.13", 2.6", 2.9", 3.71", 4.2", 5.65", 5.83", 7.5", 12.48"</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">One may notice that almost all e-readers/ e-ink cellphones use screens without controller, while almost all e-ink electronic shelf labels (ESL) use screens with controller. This gives some hints about the advantages and disadvantages of two types:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Without Controller</th>
<th>With Controller</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>System Cost</td>
<td>High. A dedicated controller or SoC with integrated contoller is usually required. Needs a dedicated power supply.</td>
<td>Low. Virtually any MCUs could drive the screen directly, and the power supply is integrated in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Greyscale Levels</td>
<td>Generally 16 (4bpp), up to 32 (5bpp)</td>
<td>Generally 2 (BW only) or 4 (2bpp), with some hack, up to 16 (4bpp)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Refresh Speed</td>
<td>Generally fast (100ms~300ms) for BW. Depends on the screen used and the system architecture</td>
<td>Generally fast (100ms~300ms) for BW if the partial refresh is enabled. Greyscales much slower, BWR or BWY screens would be even slower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total Update Latency</td>
<td>Generally the same as refresh time. Depends on the system architecture</td>
<td>Slow. Ranging from 100ms to several seconds based on the resolution.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p dir="auto">Please keep in mind the discussion is about off-the-shelf screens you can buy today. These tradeoffs do not necessarily come from the fact the controller is integrated or not.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that I mentioned the refresh speed and total update latency. They are different:</p>
<p dir="auto">The refresh speed refers to the time it takes to start refreshing the screen: from starting seeing screen changing, to the screen finish showing the new content.</p>
<p dir="auto">The total update latency refers to the latency when the processor needs to update the screen, to the screen finish showing the new content. As you could see, this is the biggest issue for screens with controllers. This is the main reason why they are almost never used on e-readers or cellphones or PC monitors.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/blob/main/assets/screen_cntlr.svg"><img src="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/raw/main/assets/screen_cntlr.svg" alt="screen-controller-diagram"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This diagram illustrates the difference between two. It should be noted that the screens without controller have the flexibility to be driven quickly, but the system designer might not architect the system for low latency.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using Screen with Integrated Controller</h3><a id="user-content-using-screen-with-integrated-controller" aria-label="Permalink: Using Screen with Integrated Controller" href="#using-screen-with-integrated-controller"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Screens with integrated controller have almost everything already integrated. Common display panels in this type only need few external capacitors, inductors, and MOSFETs to support the integrated bipolar power supply circuit, then it could be hooked up to MCUs or MPUs using common interfaces like SPI or I2C. There are a lot of driving boards and examples of these screens available online.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using Screen without Integrated Controller</h3><a id="user-content-using-screen-without-integrated-controller" aria-label="Permalink: Using Screen without Integrated Controller" href="#using-screen-without-integrated-controller"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This could get complicated. Note I used a lot of "generally" in the previous comparison table because there are many things one could do to drive them. Some of them would certainly impact the performance. The main issue here the controller chip. There are three solutions to drive these screen:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Using a dedicated controller chip to drive the screen</li>
<li>Using an SoC that has an integrated controller</li>
<li>Using a fast MCU/SoC to emulate the controller with GPIO (software timing controller)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Then, again here is a comparison between them:</p>

</table>
<p dir="auto">When using a dedicated controller, it could accept data from external devices. This allows it to be used in various different types of applications. Ranging from IoT devices, ESLs, to PC monitors with relatively fast refresh rate and low latency.</p>
<p dir="auto">When using SoC or MCU, the display content is generated by the SoC or MCU itself, which ultimately is limited by the capability of the SoC or MCU. Given the current SoCs with E-ink display controllers are usually limited in performance, the application is limited. The same goes for MCU, it does what an MCU could do. You could find ways to stream video data into SoC or MCUs by using USB, camera interface, WiFi, etc., but this might not be optimal.</p>

<p dir="auto">The interface signals and timing are fairly similar to LCDs without controller. Following is the list of signals typically found on EPDs:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>GDOE/ MODE: Gate driver output enable</li>
<li>GDCLK/ CKV: Gate driver clock (like HSYNC in LCD)</li>
<li>GDSP/ SPV: Gate driver start pulse (like VSYNC in LCD)</li>
<li>SDCLK/ XCL: Source driver clock (like PCLK in LCD)</li>
<li>SDLE/ XLE: Source driver latch enable (like HSYNC in LCD)</li>
<li>SDOE/ XOE: Source driver output enable</li>
<li>SDCE/ XSTL: Source driver start pulse (like DE in LCD)</li>
<li>SD: Source driver data (8-bit or 16-bit)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">SD signals goes into the source driver, typically the X direction. GD signals goes into the gate driver, typically the Y direction. It's a 2D array, gate driver selects one line at a time, and the source driver output the voltage for all the pixels in that line.</p>
<p dir="auto">Conceptually, it's like raster scan on a CRT. To send one field of data, both GD and SD are reset to the start position by using the start pulse signal. Data are then transmitted into the source driver 4 or 8 pixel at a time. Once the line has been fully transmitted, the source driver is reset to the beginning position by start pulse signal, and the gate driver moves to the next line by a pulse on the gate driver clock. Once all lines have been scanned, the entire process repeats for the next field.</p>
<p dir="auto">One notable difference with LCD is that each pixel is represented by 2 bits. This, however, doesn't mean each pixel is 2bpp or 4-level greyscale. The 2-bit per pixel is used to encode the voltage applied to the pixel:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>00: No voltage</li>
<li>01: Negative voltage</li>
<li>10: Positive voltage</li>
<li>11: No voltage</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Just like CRT/ LCD, ther are also blanking periods in the entire timing (means it's just waiting without active pixel data being sent). They have identical meaning to CRT/ LCD systems:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Understanding Waveform</h3><a id="user-content-understanding-waveform" aria-label="Permalink: Understanding Waveform" href="#understanding-waveform"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The waveform is a look up table for the eink controller to determine how to drive the pixels, mostly useful for greyscale image display, but generally used for binary image display as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">The look up table has 3 inputs (dimensions): frame number, source grayscale level, destination grayscale level. During the update process, for a certain pixel, the source and destination level stays the same, and the frame number increases each frame. The look up process is done for every pixel every frame. The controller may choose different LUTs depending on the ambient temperature. Mode switching is also implemented by simply switching between different LUTs.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is essentially what typically eink controller does. For each pixel, look up in the table to determine the voltage to use. Repeat this for a couple of frames with an incrementing frame counter, until all pixels are fully driven.</p>
<p dir="auto">It should be obvious that the waveform file itself is independent to the resolution as the waveform only cares about single pixel. With an incorrect or un-optimal waveform, the screen should at least display some recognizable image.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Waveform Example</h4><a id="user-content-waveform-example" aria-label="Permalink: Waveform Example" href="#waveform-example"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are several sample waveform tables provided in the project repo. Take the GC16 (Greyscale clearing 16-level) waveform of GDEW101C01 as an example: <a href="https://github.com/zephray/NekoInk/blob/master/waveform/gdew101_gd/test_M2_T0.csv">https://github.com/zephray/NekoInk/blob/master/waveform/gdew101_gd/test_M2_T0.csv</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Take one line from that file:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>6,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,0</code></p>
<p dir="auto">This means from greyscale level 6 to level 13, it needs to go through the following sequence. Each number means the operation on that frame, 0 is no-operation, 1 is darken, and 2 is lighten. In this case, there are 38 frames, first 9 frames do nothing, then lighten for 1 frame, darken for 10 frames, lighten for 16 frames, and finally darken for 1 frame and no-operation for the last frame. This is the sequence to change a pixel from level 6 to level 13. Such lookup is done for every pixel on every frame.</p>
<p dir="auto">For specifics on waveform file formats, check the <a href="#working-with-waveforms">Working with Waveforms</a> section.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Waveform Modes</h4><a id="user-content-waveform-modes" aria-label="Permalink: Waveform Modes" href="#waveform-modes"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To give system designers more flexibility, Eink controllers often offers multiple "modes", like binary mode, 16-level grayscale mode, 16-level grayscale mode with reduced flashing, 4-level grayscale mode, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">The waveform provided by Eink has many modes. There is a good document from Eink describing the modes:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.waveshare.net/w/upload/c/c4/E-paper-mode-declaration.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.waveshare.net/w/upload/c/c4/E-paper-mode-declaration.pdf</a></p>
<p dir="auto">It provides a good overview of the modes. I am just going to add some comments.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>GC in the GC16 stands for "greyscale clearing". GC does not stands for greyscale. There are 16-level greyscale modes that aren't called GC16.</li>
<li>Officially there is no 32-level greyscale modes (yet). There are 5bit waveforms, which means they internally use 5 bits for each pixel, which potentially allows up to 32-level greyscale, but no such waveform exists (yet).</li>
<li>These is no 16 level greyscale modes without flashing. The DU4 is the only greyscale mode that's non-flashing.</li>
<li>The GL16 mode, as described, only works for black text on white background. When refreshing greyscale images, the GL16 is similar to the GC16.</li>
<li>The GLR16 mode is also called the REGAL mode, and the GLD16 mode is also called as the REGAL-D mode.</li>
<li>Eink doesn't even know if it should be spelled as REAGL or REGAL:  Google search "REAGL site:eink.com" and "REGAL site:eink.com" both returned several results.</li>
<li>Eink provided waveform usually implements all these modes, however it is not always required. The waveform file may also contain waveform tables in other orders.</li>
<li>In terms of the waveform, the waveform for GL16, GLR16, and GLD16 are identical. This is expected, the REGAL requires additional algorithm on the host image processing, and is not a technology based on tweaking the waveform.</li>

<p dir="auto">Some commercial implementations allow users to reduce the frame count and/ or alter the waveform playback speed, so the user can trade between contrast ratio and frame rate.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Greyscale Display</h3><a id="user-content-greyscale-display" aria-label="Permalink: Greyscale Display" href="#greyscale-display"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Other than full white and full black, with appropriate modulation, Eink screens can also display some levels of greyscale (typically 16).</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/blob/main/assets/eink_32g.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/raw/main/assets/eink_32g.jpg" alt="greyscale"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For grayscale display, the basic idea is simple. If the pixel is not fully driven (say only drives for 50ms while it takes 100ms to reach full black/ white), it would stay in a gray state.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are two ways of achieving this modulation:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Modulate the frame time</li>
<li>Modulate the number of frames with constant frame rate</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Both are possible, as described below</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Frame Time Modulation</h4><a id="user-content-frame-time-modulation" aria-label="Permalink: Frame Time Modulation" href="#frame-time-modulation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This method changes the drive time by changing the length of a single frame. The screen would only be driven for 15 or 31 frames for 16-level and 32-level greyscale, but the frame time (thus frame rate) is altered to provide the desired driving time. The LUT would be a one dimension look up table, only containing the incremental time required to drive to the next greyscale level. The source/ gate driver output enable line maybe toggled to achieve the desired driving time.</p>
<p dir="auto">This method doesn't seem to be implemented in any commercial solutions and is significantly slower than the second method. But it certainly works. In fact the 32-level greyscale demo shown in the picture above is achieved using this method.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Frame Count Modulation</h4><a id="user-content-frame-count-modulation" aria-label="Permalink: Frame Count Modulation" href="#frame-count-modulation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This method changes the drive time by changing the number of frames being applied to the screen. The screen is still being driven at a constant frame rate. The following is a simplified hypothetical waveform table for achieving 4-level greyscale:</p>
<table>

<p dir="auto">Note how it alternates between VPOS and VNEG in the beginning. This is often called the "activation phase" to improve contrast ratio. Putting this detail aside, it changes the number of VPOS frames to settle down on different grey levels.</p>
<p dir="auto">Actual grayscale driving sequence used in the commercial implementation is more complex than that, often involving switching the pixel towards black/white a few times before settling. This design is partially due to the limited time control granularity and other temperature/ manufacturing variance related concerns. Some side-effects of such a driving sequence are that the refreshing process is “flashing”, and is slower compared to displaying only 1-bit binary image.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Color Display</h3><a id="user-content-color-display" aria-label="Permalink: Color Display" href="#color-display"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are several different technologies that could be used to build full color EPDs. The 2 most common ways are to use a color-filter-array (CFA) or use a multi pigment color display.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following picture have the multiple pigment color display (ACeP Gallery 3) on the left, and CFA-based color screen (Kaleido Plus) on the right, displaying the same image.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Color Filter Array</h4><a id="user-content-color-filter-array" aria-label="Permalink: Color Filter Array" href="#color-filter-array"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">CFA stands for color filter array, which is basically colored glass/ film on top of the screen pixel. This is also the technology used on most color LCDs. Eink Kaleido, Eink Triton and color DES are based on this technology. The main advantage is that it's relative simple to control, and the low level driving is the same with the greyscale panels. Thus it has the same level of refreshing time (100~200ms), and same level of greyscale (16 level translate to 16^3=4096 colors). The draw back is that the CFA filters out some light (due to its colored nature), the screen reflectivity is negatively affected by the CFA. The screen ends up being quite dark. Up to now, most color E-readers uses CFA-based display. This project supports all three major types of CFA-based EPD screens: color DES screen, Eink Triton, and Eink Kaleido.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Case Study: GDEW101C01 (CFA-based, DES)</h4><a id="user-content-case-study-gdew101c01-cfa-based-des" aria-label="Permalink: Case Study: GDEW101C01 (CFA-based, DES)" href="#case-study-gdew101c01-cfa-based-des"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The GDEW101C01 is a 10.1" color DES screen made by Good Display / WeiFeng Tech. It uses CFA to produce color image. As a result, to the eink controller hardware, it's just a normal greyscale panel with bunch of pixels. But the pixels are colored depending on their location due to the CFA. The coloring of the pixels can be either handled by hardware or software.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h5 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pixel Arragement</h5><a id="user-content-pixel-arragement" aria-label="Permalink: Pixel Arragement" href="#pixel-arragement"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Color DES is a bit different from a typical color TFT LCD in terms of CFA design. Typically on TFT LCDs, one RGB pixel is called a pixel, and each R/G/B component is called as a sub-pixel. On color DES, the sub-pixel is ended up being called as pixel, and each pixel is either red, green, or blue. In display industry, such pixels are more commonly referred as dots.</p>

<p dir="auto">In the above photo, the DES pixel arrangement is the same as the OLPC XO-1.</p>
<p dir="auto">Having no subpixel / each pixel only has 1 color doesn't necessarily mean that the effective resolution needs to be divide by 3. This arrangement is slightly more "efficient" than RGB strip in terms of perceptive resolution. You could find more detailed analysis in the paper Comparing the Effective Resolution of Various RGB Subpixel Layout.</p>

<p dir="auto">If the image is displayed on color DES without any processing, it would look like a greyscale image. This is similar when you just send the same color value to R/G/B components on a color LCD display.</p>
<p dir="auto">To get color, send only the color component that correspond to the pixel color.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/blob/main/assets/PixelLayoutDiagonal.png"><img src="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/raw/main/assets/PixelLayoutDiagonal.png" alt="pixel-layout"></a>
(Source: <a href="https://wiki.laptop.org/go/File:PixelLayoutDiagonal.png" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.laptop.org/go/File:PixelLayoutDiagonal.png</a>, public domain)</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, for pixel 01, the pixel on the screen is green. Then only the green component from the frame buffer should be sent to the screen.</p>
<p dir="auto">To get basic 4096 color image display, this is everything needed. However generally to improve image quality, few more steps are applied:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h5 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Low pass filtering</h5><a id="user-content-low-pass-filtering" aria-label="Permalink: Low pass filtering" href="#low-pass-filtering"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The previous described image displaying process is essentially a down-sampling process for each color components: Only 1/3 of the pixel are sent to the screen. Then this becomes a classic signal processing issue: sampling the signal would cause frequency components above Nyquist to fold back to the low frequency part. Or in simpler words, you would see jagged edges/ aliasing, which are things that wasn't present in the original image. To prevent this, low pass filtering (blurring) needs to applied first to the image to remove these high frequency components. The following diagram from OLPC wiki shows a simple way of implementing a such filter:</p>

<p dir="auto">Another technology for implemneting color EPD is by using a multi-pigment color display. This is a technology developed initially by SiPix, and further improved by Eink. The basic idea is to use ink particles with different colors inside a single pixel. By applying a sequence of voltages, the ink particles can be arranged to display different colors.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/blob/main/assets/eink_spectra6.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/raw/main/assets/eink_spectra6.jpg" alt="spectra6"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">(Source: <a href="https://www.eink.com/tech/detail/How_it_works" rel="nofollow">https://www.eink.com/tech/detail/How_it_works</a> , copyright Eink Corporation)</p>
<p dir="auto">One major advantage of this solution is it can achieve higher resolution (because it doesn't have a CFA, so no resolution reduction), higher reflectivity (because it doesn't have a CFA, so no light loss), and higher color saturation (because it doesn't have a CFA, no need to play the reflectivity vs saturation trade off game).</p>
<p dir="auto">Eink has 2 lines of products using this Technology, Eink Gallery and Eink Spectra. The advantage is it's much brighter compared to CFA based solutions. The disadvantage is it's much more difficult to drive, and quite slow: 1st /2nd gen Eink Gallery screen takes 30s (!) to refresh, and Spectra 6 Plus devices takes 7s to refresh. It's possible to trade-in some color saturation for higher speed, though still much slower than CFA based solutions. The specific product lines will be discussed in <a href="#eink-screen-generations">Eink Screen Generations</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h5 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What Happened To ACeP?</h5><a id="user-content-what-happened-to-acep" aria-label="Permalink: What Happened To ACeP?" href="#what-happened-to-acep"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/04/new-e-ink-gallery-displays-could-finally-make-full-color-e-readers-good/" rel="nofollow">ACeP was supposed to the "next big thing" in ereader</a>. Back in the end 2022, Eink anounnced that <a href="https://www.e-ink-info.com/e-ink-gallery-3-acep-color-epaper-displays-move-mass-production" rel="nofollow">"Gallery 3 has moved into mass production, with customer products from Bigme, BOOX, iFlyTek, iReader, PocketBook, Readmoo, and AOC coming down the pipeline in 2023 and beyond"</a>. But 2023 passed with exactly one product, the Bigme Galy, with mixed receptions. Early 2024, it was announced that <a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/bigme-galy-is-discontinued" rel="nofollow">Bigme Galy has been discontinued</a>, and <a href="https://www.ineltek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EInk_AC073TC1_EOLNoticeLetter_notice_20240401.pdf" rel="nofollow">Eink have announced EOL for certain ACeP based products</a>. It does sound like ACeP is now dead.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following are purely my own speculation. But I see this as 2 separate decisions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>There will be no more multi-pigment based display for eReader market</li>
<li>ACeP (CMYW) is being replaced with Spectra 6 (RYBW) in other markets</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The second one is evident from the EOL noticed linked previously, the 7.3" ACeP screen has a direct replacement of 7.3" Spectra 6 screen. One major drawback of ACeP in digital signage market (as far as I see) is its inability to reproduce the cyan color. This actually means there is no good way to display blue sky on an ACeP screen, not even through dithering, it's simply outside of its color gamut. By changing the base colors used, Eink was able to mitigate this issue in the Spectra 6 product lines.</p>
<p dir="auto">The first one is more or less speculation. I have two clues for that. One is the fact that Eink is doubling down on digital signage for Spectra 6: <a href="https://www.beck-elektronik.de/en/newsroom/news/article/e-ink-spectratm-6-der-hingucker-des-jahres-2024" rel="nofollow">Both 13.3" and 31.5" Spectra 6 screen will have integrated controller</a>. This make them much more interesting for the signage applications, but unsuitable for eReader applications. The other is that <a href="https://www.ereaderpro.co.uk/en/blogs/news/e-ink-news-eink-technology-has-unveiled-the-new-generation-of-colour-e-paper-technology-e-ink-spectra-6-plus-designed-for-retail-tags-and-advertising-billboards" rel="nofollow">the 8" Spectra 6 Plus screen</a>, while using the same backplane as the Gallery 3 ACeP screen, now quote a 7 second refresh time (compared to less than a second on Gallery 3). If Eink still wanted to make a Spectra 6 eReader screen, this 8" backplane would be the one to use given it was used in ACeP product line.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ojectively, ACeP screen on the Bigme Galy pretty much doesn't make any sense anyway. It suffers from poor reflectivity and poor saturation, to a point where it's not much better than Kaleido (see the previous photo). The difference between the Gallery 3 and Gallery Palette (which is supposed to be a lower end product) is also stunning:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/blob/main/assets/gallery3_gallerypalette.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/raw/main/assets/gallery3_gallerypalette.jpg" alt="acep_comparison"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">(Original illustration copyright MiHoYo)</p>
<p dir="auto">The one on the left is the Gallery 3 used on eReaders, the one on the right (brighter and more saturated one) is the Gallery Palette used on ESLs. Though to be honest I hacked the right one a bit to display 512 colors opposed to the stock 7 colors. If the Gallery 3 had the same image quality as previous ACeP/ Gallery screens, it would make sense to trade in response time for better image quality. But it doesn't.</p>
<p dir="auto">So is the ACeP dead? Yes and no. Yes in a sense that we are less likely to see any new ACeP products in the future, and we are also unlikely to see any Spectra 6 based eReader products. No in a sense that ACeP is superseded by Spectra 6, so the technology lives on. Just like how the Pearl replaced the Vizplex, and the Carta replaced the Pearl. Now we have Carta so we don't look back to the older generation of screens. Also, in another sense, there are likely at least thousands of ACeP screens already manufactured but didn't made into the consumer devices. We will probably see these screens in the not too distant future!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dithering</h3><a id="user-content-dithering" aria-label="Permalink: Dithering" href="#dithering"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Eink and DES panels typically only supports up to 16 level of greyscale with the vendor provided waveform. To improve response time, or to avoid flashing image, binary (1-bit, 2-level) display is also used. Dithering could be applied to produce better image (increasing SNR, in signal processing sense).</p>
<p dir="auto">The following is applying dithering to a simple black to white gradient. Note the results are not optimal due to limitations in quantization and incorrect gamma correction. But the idea is the same.</p>

<p dir="auto">As you can see, the non-dithered image loses all the greyscale inbetween, while the dithered version on the right gives illusion of greyscale while only using full black and full white colors.</p>
<p dir="auto">To understand it further, take the following example:</p>
<p dir="auto">Say the source image is 30% brightness (or 0.3). This cannot be displayed on a binary screen which can only display 0% (0.0, black) or 100% (1.0, white) brightness. A simple thresholding process is added to determine if the screen should display 0 or 1 by checking the incoming brightness. If it's less than 0.5 then the display brightness is rounded down to 0, otherwise 1. Because 0.3 is always lower than 0.5, the whole screen displays 0 (black).</p>
<p dir="auto">This is less than ideal. A better way is to set around 30% of the pixel black, while 70% of the pixel white. Different dithering algorithms can be used to achieve this 30/70 distribution. Two common methods used are ordered dithering and error-diffusion dithering, which will be described below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ordered Dithering</h4><a id="user-content-ordered-dithering" aria-label="Permalink: Ordered Dithering" href="#ordered-dithering"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The ordered dithering adds a pre-computed/ fixed texture to the image before the thresholding process. In other words, it basically adds some noise to the image. This may sound weird initially, but it should be easy to see the effect of noise in the example.</p>
<p dir="auto">Using the example of previously described displaying 30% brightness grey on a binary screen. The goal is let the rounding process to end up in 0 for 30% of the time, and 1 for 70% of the time. This could be achived by adding a noise. In the simplist case, a random number with a uniform distribution between [-0.5, 0.5] is added to the incoming brightness. The brightness has a value of 0.3, when adding this number to the random number, the random number now has a uniform distribution between [-0.2, 0.8]. The threshold is still set to 0.5, and now the probability distribution can be seen as below:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/blob/main/assets/dithering_pdf.svg"><img src="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/raw/main/assets/dithering_pdf.svg" alt="pdf"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The pixel now has 30% chance of being rounded up to 1, and 70% chance of being rounded down to 0. Before dithering, it would always be rounded down to 0.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, purely random number is generally not the best noise to use. Bayer dithering matrix and blue noise are more commonly used, with the results as illustrated below. The idea is the same, but instead of adding random numbers, pre-computed number from the bayer dithering matrix (array) or blue noise texture (array) is added to the image.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Error-Diffusion Dithering</h4><a id="user-content-error-diffusion-dithering" aria-label="Permalink: Error-Diffusion Dithering" href="#error-diffusion-dithering"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The basic idea is when rounding down the color (selecting the closest color from the 16-level greyscale from 256-level input), the error value (difference) is calculated and added to neighboring pixels (so these error would be considered when processing these pixels later). The whole process is called error-diffusion.</p>
<p dir="auto">Still using the previous example of 30% brightness image, and assume an extremely simple dither kernel: diffuse all error to the next pixel. Let's see it in action.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the first pixel, 0.3 (image brightness) is less than 0.5 (threshold), so it's displayed as 0 (black). This introduce a 0.3 error: the displayed color is 0.3 darker than the requested color. So 0.3 is being diffused to the next pixel, hoping the next pixel can correct the error.</p>
<p dir="auto">Onto the second pixel. The value is 0.3 (image brightness) + 0.3 (diffused error) = 0.6. It's now larger than 0.5 (threshold), so it's displayed as 1 (white). This introduces a -0.4 error: the displayed color is 0.4 brighter than the requested color. -0.4 will be diffused to the next pixel.</p>
<p dir="auto">The 3rd pixel, the value is now 0.3 - 0.4 = -0.1. This is less than 0.5, and displayed as 0 (black). Error -0.1 is diffused further.</p>
<p dir="auto">And this process just goes on. With enough pixels, eventually it would yields about 30% of white pixels and 70% of dark pixels.</p>
<p dir="auto">Similar to how random value is not the best thing to do in ordered dithering, dithering to the right is also less than ideal. It creates very repetitive patterns. I mentioned the word kernel. Error diffusing uses a diffusion kernel, which specifies the target and percentage of the diffused error. There are many classic kernels, such as Floyd–Steinberg, Stucki, and Sierra etc. commonly used for image dithering. They all diffuse to more than 1 pixels to improve the overall look of the image. As shown below, even just diffuse error to 2 pixels (half of the error goes to the pixel on the right, and the rest half of the error goes to the pixel on the bottom) yields much better result:</p>

<p dir="auto">Ordinary dithering kernels don't work too well on color screens. For example, the error-diffusion dithering process pushes/ diffuses error neighboring pixels without considering their color. Ideally it should push/ diffuse the error only to pixels with the same color. This is fairly easy to fix though, by tweaking the kernel it would achieve good results on CFA-based screens as well. (I am going to shamelessly call it Wenting's kernel)</p>

<p dir="auto">Another thing to consider is gamma. The dithering process involves a step of selecting the closest value. However, selecting the closest numerical value is not necessarily mean the closest color. The image typically is in sRGB space, which is non-linear. This causes the simple rounding to pick the wrong color, also calculating the wrong error value. One solution is to work in the linear space. This is also known as gamma-aware dithering. You could read more related info online, for example here: <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Gamma-Correction" rel="nofollow">https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Gamma-Correction</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The difference is quite evident when dithering down to 1 bit for color screen. Top left is the original image, top right is dithering in the sRGB space, while bottom left is dithering in the linear space.</p>

<p dir="auto">I will let you to decide how to count the generations.</p>
<p dir="auto">For the CFA-based screens, the following generations of screens exist:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Eink Triton: First generation color screen. Uses RGBW glass color filter and square pixel. Underlying screen panel uses Pearl film.</li>
<li>Eink Triton 2: 2nd generation color screen. Uses RGB glass color filter and stripe pixel. Underlying screen panel uses Pearl film.</li>
<li>Eink Kaleido: 3rd or 2nd gen color screen depending on the definition. Uses RGB color filter. Each pixel is still square, but each color covers 3 pixels. Underlying screen panel uses Carta film.</li>
<li>Eink Kaleido Plus: 2nd gen Kaleido. Uses RGB color filter. Each pixel is still square but different configurations exist. Some screens has each color covering 2 pixels, some others have each color covering only 1 pixel. Underlying screen panel uses Carta film.</li>
<li>Eink Kaleido 3: 3rd gen Kaleido. Exists many different configurations, ranging from RGBW filter covering 1 pixel per color, to RGB filter covering 3 pixels per color more like the original Kaleido. Underlying screen panel uses Carta 1000/1200/1250/1300 film depending on the model.</li>
<li>Eink Kaleido 3 Outdoor: Wide temperature version of Kaleido 3.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">As far as I know, all CFA-based color screen panels don't come with integrated controller.</p>
<p dir="auto">For the multiple-pigment color screens based on SiPix technology, the following generations of screens exist:</p>
<p dir="auto">(Color abbreviation: B: black, W: white, R: red, Y: yellow, B: blue, C: cyan, M: magenta)</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Eink Spectra 3000: BWR or BWY 3 color screen.</li>
<li>Eink Spectra 3100: BWRY 4 color screen.</li>
<li>Eink Spectra 3100 Plus：BWRY 4 color screen. Orange display is now possible with driver circuit changes</li>
<li>Eink Spectra 6: RYBW 4 color screen. Can reproduce 6 different colors by mixing colors</li>
<li>Eink Spectra 6 Plus: RYBW 4 color screen. Still reproduce 6 different colors. Allows faster refresh compare to 6 with driver circuit changes</li>
<li>Eink Gallery: CMYW 4 color screen (ACeP).</li>
<li>Eink Gallery Plus: CMYW 4 color screen (ACeP).</li>
<li>Eink Gallery Palette： CMYW 4 color screen (ACeP). Reproduce 7 different colors.</li>
<li>Eink Gallery 3: CMYW 4 color screen (ACeP). Reproduce 12 different colors, much faster than other Gallery screens at the cost of lower saturation and lowr reflectivity</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">There are both integrated-controller Spectra/Gallery screens and controller-less Spectra/Gallery screens.</p>
<p dir="auto">Addtional notes regarding the multi-pigment color screens:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>ACeP, or Advanced Color ePaper refers to the CMYW 4 color screen. Is not a product line on its own</li>
<li>To be honest, I don't know how many colors can be reproduced on Gallery or Gallery Plus screens based on public information. Eink claims 30000 or 60000 colors in their materials, but they also clarified these numbers refers to color gamut. In other words, they represent color saturation rather than number of different colors can be displayed on screen. Dithering is heavily used to display color image on Gallery screens.</li>
<li>It's possible to achieve more colors on Gallery Palette screens. 7 is not a physical limit.</li>

<p dir="auto">This section describes the design specific to the Caster and Glider. The following is an overall block diagram showing both hardware and gateware components in the signal chain:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/blob/main/assets/glider_overall_block_diagram.svg"><img src="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/raw/main/assets/glider_overall_block_diagram.svg" alt="Overall ABlockdiagram"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Gateware Architecture</h3><a id="user-content-gateware-architecture" aria-label="Permalink: Gateware Architecture" href="#gateware-architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The FPGA gateware is divided into multiple modules. The caster.v is the top-level of the EPDC core design, but several additional components are connected under top.v to form a complete image processing system. Different components are generally inter-connected with synchronous or asynchronous (in case of clock domain crossing) FIFOs.</p>
<p dir="auto">The top-level design has 3 major clock domains: clk_vi: Input video clock domain, running at ½ pixel rate. clk_epdc: EPDC clock domain, running at ¼ pixel rate. clk_mem: Memory clock domain, running at ¼ memory transfer rate.</p>
<p dir="auto">To understand how it works, the following is a guided tour around the life cycle of a pixel.</p>
<p dir="auto">Before an incoming pixel can be processed by the controller, the memif module needs to retrieve the local pixel state from the DDR SDRAM. Once the value is retrieved, it’s pushed into the state readout/ input FIFO (bi_fifo). At/ around the same time, input video stream is pushed into the video input FIFO (vi_fifo).</p>
<p dir="auto">The EPDC runs a local Eink timing generator for counting pixels and blankings. This timing should be a slightly delayed version of the incoming video timing. Once the local timing generator determines that it needs to output the pixel soon, the EPDC logic pops out one pair of the video input and state readout and starts processing.
Two values goes through the video processing pipeline:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Stage 1: This pipeline stage waits for the FIFO to output the data.</li>
<li>Stage 2: The 8-bit input image is dithered down to 1-bit and 4-bit at this stage for later use.</li>
<li>Stage 3: The waveform lookup is done at this stage for 16-level grayscale modes</li>
<li>Stage 4: Based on the pixel state, new state and voltage selection value is determined at this stage.</li>
<li>Stage 5: New state is pushed into the state writeback/ out FIFO (bo_fifo) and the voltage selection is sent to the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The memif module later pops out the writeback value from the bo_fifo and writes back to the DDR SDRAM.</p>
<p dir="auto">The EPDC always processes 4 pixels per clock. For screens with different interface width, a rate adapter is added after the EPDC output. Some logic are duplicated 2 or 4 times (such as the waveform RAM or the pixel decision logic), while some are extended and daisy-chained (such as the error diffusion dithering unit) to achieve the 4 pixels per clock throughput.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Firmware Functions</h3><a id="user-content-firmware-functions" aria-label="Permalink: Firmware Functions" href="#firmware-functions"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The MCU manages house-keeping items as described below. It currently doesn’t use any operating system, but rather relying on a main-loop style operation.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>EPD Power Supply: The power supply provides common, source, and gate supply to the EPD panel. In addition to basic on/off switch, the MCU can also adjust the VCOM voltage, and measure the optimal VCOM voltage of the panel installed. The VCOM measurement is done by isolating the VCOM supply from the screen with keeping the gate supply, scan the screen with source = VCOM, and measure the kick-back voltage on VCOM.</li>
<li>FPGA Bitstream Loading: The FPGA doesn’t have its own flash memory, the bitstream is pushed over SPI from the MCU to the FPGA upon powering up. In this way the FPGA bitstream can be easily bundled together with the MCU’s firmware and updated together.</li>
<li>Type-C Negotiation: The on-board USB Type-C port can support video input in addition to powering the board using the USB-C DisplayPort Alt Mode. The MCU runs a USB-C PD stack to communicate this capability to the video source device over standard USB PD protocol. The MCU also controls the Type-C signal mux to remap the lanes to the correct place depending on the cable orientation.</li>
<li>Video decoder initialization: The FPGA used on the board doesn’t have high speed deserializers to interface with common high speed video interface such as DisplayPort or DVI directly. Instead, dedicated video decoder chips are used on the board. They typically needs initialization before use, and the MCU takes care of this. In this specific design the DP decoder chip also handles AUX P/N line flipping based on the Type-C cable orientation.</li>
<li>PC communication: One advantage of the Caster is that update modes and forced update/ clearing can be applied on a per-pixel basis. Software may utilize this to assign different modes to different windows or change update modes depending on the content on the fly. This is done by sending requests to the MCU over USB connection. The MCU runs TinyUSB and present itself as an HID device so it can forward messages between the hos PC and the FPGA.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Low Latency Drive</h3><a id="user-content-low-latency-drive" aria-label="Permalink: Low Latency Drive" href="#low-latency-drive"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Caster implements several techniques for reducing the latency, which will be explained here.</p>
<p dir="auto">As described before, the existing basic driving method employs a global counter for looking up the waveform table. This imposes a limit on the global image update rate: the controller only accepts a new incoming image after the previous update is finished. The update usually takes about 100ms, translating to an image rate of 10Hz. Or, in other words, the user needs to potentially wait up to 100ms before the new image is even processed by the controller.</p>
<p dir="auto">One way to mitigate this issue is by having multiple update regions. For example, imagine the user is typing a and b. In a single region controller design, a is being drawn to the screen immediately, while the b needs to wait 100ms before it gets drawn. If the controller supports multiple regions, it could start drawing the letter b as soon as it’s typed, reducing the latency. This however requires the software to program the controller to correctly set the region to the letter boundary, and re-allocating regions on the fly as the number of regions is generally quite limited (like 4-16).</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/blob/main/assets/caster_pipelined_update.svg"><img src="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/raw/main/assets/caster_pipelined_update.svg" alt="caster-pipelined"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Caster simply treats every pixel as an individual update region, for maximum flexibility and is transparent to the software.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another latency optimization technique the Caster implemented is on the pixel that’s already being updated. For example, if the user types the letter a and deletes it right after. With the basic driving method, the controller needs to wait till the letter a is fully displayed before it can erase it. The previously proposed/ implemented regional update doesn’t help here because in this situation it’s about the same pixel so it has to be in the same region. The second technique is early cancellation. If a pixel changes before it’s fully driven, instead of waiting for it to be fully driven, it’s driven towards the requested input state, and the frame counter is updated depending on the newly calculated driving time.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/blob/main/assets/caster_early_cancel.svg"><img src="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider/raw/main/assets/caster_early_cancel.svg" alt="caster-early-cancel"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">By combining both, it’s then possible to implement low latency binary and 4-level grayscale modes. The tradeoff between framerate and contrast ratio is also no longer relevant. Both high frame rate and high contrast ratio are achieved automatically.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Hybrid Greyscale Mode</h3><a id="user-content-hybrid-greyscale-mode" aria-label="Permalink: Hybrid Greyscale Mode" href="#hybrid-greyscale-mode"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As discussed previously, getting <a href="#greyscale-display">greyscale</a> image on Eink is a sophiscated process, much slower than binary, and shows flashing images during the process. This pose challenges on how to make it useful for the users.</p>
<p dir="auto">On eReaders, the software could switch between fast and slow modes based on the action. The eReader software may also simply not support things that doesn’t work well on the screen. For example, there might be no scrolling but only whole page flipping. What’s being done on existing eink monitors is throwing the problem back to the user. The user simply need to accept that update is slow, latency is long, and the process is flashing.</p>
<p dir="auto">What Caster implemented is allowing it to switch between the fast binary mode and slow greyscale mode automatically on a per pixel basis. When the input image is changed, it switches to binary mode and do the update. When the image hasn’t changed for a while, it re-renders the image in greyscale.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Limitations</h3><a id="user-content-limitations" aria-label="Permalink: Limitations" href="#limitations"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The method does come with downsides: it requires much more memory bandwidth to implement. Taking a 1080P panel as an example (roughly 120 Mp/s (million pixels per second) with reduced blanking). With the traditional method, the controller only needs the old pixel state and the new pixel state (4bpp each) to determine the voltage needed, or 8-bit/ 1-byte memory read per pixel. The bandwidth requirement is then 120Mp/s x 1B/pixel = 120MB/s. One single 16-bit SDR-133 SDRAM is more than enough to handle this. The Caster currently stores 16bit state per pixel (for 2 sets of old pixel values and pixel specific timer counters), and the pixel state needs to be updated per frame, so pixel state buffer alone requires 2-byte read and 2-byte write per pixel. It then takes another 0.5-byte per pixel to read the new image value from memory. 120Mp/s x 4.5B/pixel = 540MB/s. A 16-bit DDR-333 memory is then needed to implement this. The Glider hardware uses a DDR3-800 memory to allow even higher resolution. If the controller is not integrated inside an SoC (like our case, the controller is sitting inside the monitor, not part of your PC’s CPU/GPU), it also needs to use actual low latency video interfaces like DVI or DP, instead of simpler but slower interfaces like USB or I80/SPI. This could drive up cost as well. These techniques also don't help with use cases like reading books, so commercial ereader solutions have little reason to spend the extra trouble to implement these.</p>

<p dir="auto">In general, the screen vendor (Eink, Good Display, etc.) should provide the waveform file.</p>
<p dir="auto">If your screen has a flash chip on it, it's also possible to extract the waveform from a flash dump:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>dd if=somedump.bin of=waveform.wbf bs=1 skip=2182</code></p>
<p dir="auto">If you have access to an application board, it might also be possible to extract the waveform there. For example, if the system uses T1000 controller, the waveform is usually stored in the SPI flash connected to the T1000.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Waveform Formats</h4><a id="user-content-waveform-formats" aria-label="Permalink: Waveform Formats" href="#waveform-formats"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">E-Ink distribute waveforms in the wbf file format. SoC/ Eink controller hardware often require converting the file into vendor-specific file format. Caster/ Glider also uses a specific binary format. This project defines a common human-readable format (Interchangable Waveform Format, IWF) and provides several tools for working with different binary formats and the IWF format.</p>

<p dir="auto">The waveform consists of one descriptor file in iwf extension (ini format) and various lut data files in csv format.</p>
<p dir="auto">The descriptor contains the follwoing required fields:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>VERISON: the version of the descriptor (should be 2.0)</li>
<li>NAME: (optional) original name for the waveform</li>
<li>BPP: (optional, default 4) 4 or 5, representing the internal state count used for waveform</li>

<li>TABLES: total number of LUTs inside the waveform</li>
<li>TBxFC: the frame count for the table, where x is the LUT ID</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">There should be a number of LUTs, saved in the filename like PREFIX_TBx.csv, where x is the LUT ID. Each csv file should contain the a LUT like this: lut[src][dst][frame], which means, to transition from src greyscale level to dst greyscale level, at a certain frame in a frame sequence, what voltage should be applied to the screen (0/3: GND / Keep, 1: VNEG / To black, 2: VPOS / To white). Each line contains the frame sequence for one or more source to destination pairs.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>4,7,1,1,1,0,2</code> means to transition from greyscale level 4 to greyscale level 7, there should be 5 frames, each applying VNEG VNEG VNEG GND VPOS</li>
<li><code>0:14,15,2,2,2</code> means to transition from any greyscale level between 0 and 14 to greyscale level 15, there should be 3 frames, each applying VPOS VPOS VPOS</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">This project only focuses on driving off-the-shelf active matrix electrophoretics displays without integrated controllers. See <a href="#screen-panels">Screen Panels</a> for differences between different types of screen panels available. That's being said, this project is compatible with majority of these panels, including sizes from 4.3" up to 13.3", and potentially supporting panels as large as 42" as well (additional power supply required in that case).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Screen Adapters</h4><a id="user-content-screen-adapters" aria-label="Permalink: Screen Adapters" href="#screen-adapters"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Different screen panels have different connectors. It would take a huge amount of space to have every possible screen connector on the motherboard. Instead, a series of different screen adapters are provided to adapt to screen with different pinouts.</p>
<p dir="auto">The mainboard natives supports certain 40 pin screens, such as:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>10.3" 1872x1404: ED103TC1, ES103TC2</li>
<li>10.1" 2232x1680: GDEW101M01, GDEW101C01</li>

<p dir="auto">Rendering the grayscale requires the screen to be refreshed at 85Hz (85Hz is the Eink supported refresh rate, 60Hz can be made to work with some effort in some cases). Running input refresh rate lower than the internal refresh rate incurs additional processing latency from both source (PC) and monitor due to buffering.</p>

<p dir="auto">This is a list of Eink screens and their key parameters and their compatibilities with Caster/ Glider. The information are gathered from public sources, so they might be incorrect. This is not a complete list of all screens Eink have ever produced or in production. This table is intended for hobbiests buying used screens. If you are designing a product with Eink screen please contact Eink directly.</p>
<p dir="auto">Other than a few exceptions, only screens without integrated TCON are listed here (in other words, SPI screens are generally not included here). These screens are the main focus of this project anyway.</p>
<p dir="auto">Screen size is the first 3 numbers in the model number, so it's not listed separately in the table. For example, ED060SC4 is 6.0", ED097OC1 is 9.7", and ES133UT1 is 13.3".</p>
<p dir="auto">The adapter column refers to the adapter needed for this particular screen, however there is no guarentee that it would work, even if it's listed as tested.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/">https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40358041">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p data-block-key="6gb7v">Veo is our most capable video generation model to date. It generates high-quality, 1080p resolution videos that can go beyond a minute, in a wide range of cinematic and visual styles.</p><p data-block-key="c6nlk">It accurately captures the nuance and tone of a prompt, and provides an unprecedented level of creative control — understanding prompts for all kinds of cinematic effects, like time lapses or aerial shots of a landscape.</p><p data-block-key="a5heq">Our video generation model will help create tools that make video production accessible to everyone. Whether you're a seasoned filmmaker, aspiring creator, or educator looking to share knowledge, Veo unlocks new possibilities for storytelling, education and more.</p><p data-block-key="8rfgr">Over the coming weeks some of these features will be available to select creators through <a href="http://labs.google/videofx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VideoFX</a>, a new experimental tool at labs.google. You can join the <a href="http://labs.google/VideoFX" rel="noopener" target="_blank">waitlist</a> now.</p><p data-block-key="5veag">In the future, we’ll also bring some of Veo’s capabilities to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube Shorts</a> and other products.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="6gb7v">Greater understanding of language and vision</h2><p data-block-key="ecr6v">To produce a coherent scene, generative video models need to accurately interpret a text prompt and combine this information with relevant visual references.</p><p data-block-key="6mpal">With advanced understanding of natural language and visual semantics, Veo generates video that closely follows the prompt. It accurately captures the nuance and tone in a phrase, rendering intricate details within complex scenes.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="penxw">Controls for film-making</h2><p data-block-key="eg3us">When given both an input video and editing command, like adding kayaks to an aerial shot of a coastline, Veo can apply this command to the initial video and create a new, edited video.</p>
</div><div>
  <p data-block-key="40xdi">In addition, it supports masked editing, enabling changes to specific areas of the video when you add a mask area to your video and text prompt.</p><p data-block-key="8tcfm">Veo can also generate a video with an image as input along with the text prompt. By providing a reference image in combination with a text prompt, it conditions Veo to generate a video that follows the image’s style and user prompt’s instructions.</p>
</div><p data-block-key="u0m94">The model is also able to make video clips and extend them to 60 seconds and beyond. It can do this either from a single prompt, or by being given a sequence of prompts which together tell a story.</p><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="hx1qs">Consistency across video frames</h2><p data-block-key="dl81n">Maintaining visual consistency can be a challenge for video generation models. Characters, objects, or even entire scenes can flicker, jump, or morph unexpectedly between frames, disrupting the viewing experience.</p><p data-block-key="77hdm">Veo's cutting-edge latent diffusion transformers reduce the appearance of these inconsistencies, keeping characters, objects and styles in place, as they would in real life.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="t4vz1">Built upon years of video generation research</h2><p data-block-key="5icm9">Veo builds upon years of generative video model work including <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/neural-scene-representation-and-rendering/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Generative Query Network</a> (GQN), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06571" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DVD-GAN</a>, <a href="https://imagen.research.google/video/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Imagen-Video</a>, <a href="https://phenaki.video/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phenaki</a>, <a href="https://walt-video-diffusion.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WALT</a>, <a href="https://sites.research.google/videopoet/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VideoPoet</a> and <a href="https://lumiere-video.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lumiere</a>, and also our <a href="https://research.google/blog/transformer-a-novel-neural-network-architecture-for-language-understanding/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Transformer architecture</a> and <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gemini</a>.</p><p data-block-key="3mt37">To help Veo understand and follow prompts more accurately, we have also added more details to the captions of each video in its training data. And to further improve performance, the model uses high-quality, compressed representations of video (also known as latents) so it’s more efficient too. These steps improve overall quality and reduce the time it takes to generate videos.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="wdxqg">Responsible by design</h2><p data-block-key="conb7">It's critical to bring technologies like Veo to the world responsibly. Videos created by Veo are watermarked using <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/synthid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SynthID</a>, our cutting-edge tool for watermarking and identifying AI-generated content, and passed through safety filters and memorization checking processes that help mitigate privacy, copyright and bias risks.</p><p data-block-key="5bgom">Veo’s future will be informed by our work with leading creators and filmmakers. Their feedback helps us improve our generative video technologies and makes sure they benefit the wider creative community and beyond.</p>
</div><p data-block-key="3s614"><i>Note: All videos on this page were generated by Veo and have not been modified.</i></p><div>

When his <a href="https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2024/01/alabama-still-cant-find-heart-missing-from-prisoners-body.html">body was returned to Dotson’s family, it contained no heart</a>.</p><p id="TZ6UBE5TIJBE7FIE5QDT36PIEM">Like the prison system itself, some would argue.</p><p id="WU4NCETNWRDYBFZ3AZ34QFJ7JY">Kelvin Moore died earlier last year at a prison in – dare I even say it – Harvest, Alabama. When his family got his body <a href="https://andscape.com/features/alabama-prison-kelvin-moore-missing-organs/">it was missing organs, too</a>.</p><p id="H3IHH56BLVGA7MLUVCCFU6QFR4">And when Charles Singleton, incarcerated at the Hamilton Aged and Infirmed prison in north Alabama, died at a hospital in November 2021, his body was returned to family after an autopsy at UAB.</p><p id="A3HN5L3U75E5ZGWMWYURU2H4QQ"><a href="https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2024/02/alabama-prisoners-brain-missing-after-uab-autopsy-says-family.html">It was missing a brain</a>, among other organs.</p><p id="PZOM5UFOGNHR5GGEGA6JKHILUQ">I’d make a Wizard of Oz joke about Alabama missing the courage to address these nightmares, but there is nothing whimsical about this.</p><p id="WDVYABV42BA65DBJ4NFLLO5C2A">Alabama, apparently with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences as its scalpels, is treating its incarcerated people in death the same way it does in life.</p><p id="JPZOQ5E7JZGVPE2XU2AJKZI3EY">As meat. Stripped of humanity, exploited for labor or whim or scientific advancement because – because we can call them criminals instead of people.</p><p id="O3ZF3AVTBJGP7LQTYHXAZH5DRE">It’s as simple as that.</p><p id="E43CROYIDFB7XCV5MCAMRJOKEQ">Oh, the Alabama Department of Corrections can shrug and point vaguely at UAB, and UAB can shrug and point vaguely to legal documents that appear to give it the right to remove organs for study and instruction. And they are probably safe on that. The best medical complex in these parts likely covered its own parts when it took part in taking those parts.</p><p id="OBGKB3BZIVFLHONDGICOR6F5HE">But there were warnings.</p><p id="XI2JUF2VSFAWTM47QIYBNG4DKE">In 2018, UAB medical students worried about the process of extracting organs from people who died in custody and did not give consent. Two of those students, representing a group of 13, went before doctors that September to “seek guidance about the legal and the ethical status of this tissue procurement process and the teaching use of these specimens.”</p><p id="64QDZTC475H2FFLO52IBYWZZDI">The students did not get a lot of satisfaction, according to notes of that meeting filed in federal court.</p><p id="NZQXBTURKVFQFM3DTS5PJIDE5A">The students were told the removal of organs were part of autopsies required by law for prisoners. They were told that using them for teaching future physicians “benefits future patients,” and if organs weren’t used they’d be thrown away and would serve no useful purpose.</p><p id="LCEIYMNBEVFLDKSMU4OYHXWVF4">The students were told that in private autopsies – not the ones involving prisoner deaths – family members can opt out of allowing that sort of organ use. UAB ethicists told those students opting out is extremely rare.</p><p id="ST7DJFC6AJDAROCF7HKBCQHHAI">“Of over 3,000 cases of gross autopsy performed at UAB from 2011 to present, only four families refused to allow the teaching uses of the deceased person’s specimens,” they said.</p><p id="IIZG4JIUMBCITC2TJUJOYPRQNY">But that’s the thing.</p><p id="KO6X2WGG4FEDHDJTJP5VZNSEN4">The families of these inmates had no such opportunity. They got news of their loved ones’ deaths, and bodies returned with pieces missing.</p><p id="TZG6MTTGZBEZZMROKMQG2MV3EY">UAB has insisted it follows the letter of the law. A UAB statement sent recently to <a href="http://al.com/" target="_blank">AL.com</a> said the school “only conducts autopsies after obtaining consent or authorization from the appropriate state official.”</p><p id="Z3C75MI76NGVZDDRDOZEESXIWQ">Whoever that might be.</p><p id="V54TPHWJQZD6FDNN3A56LZKBWM">It went on to say “the ADOC is responsible for obtaining proper authorizations from the appropriate legal representative of the deceased. The authorization forms not only provide permission for the autopsy, but also specifically include consent for the removal of organs or tissues for diagnostic or other testing including final disposition.”</p><p id="VTF476LH3FCQHPXTQOLFWFHF2M">ADOC, in another statement to my colleague Ivana Hrynkiw, said “the ADOC does not authorize or perform autopsies. Once an inmate dies, the body is transported to the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences or UAB for autopsy.”</p><p id="EBQDYS6YNRASTKDKTVUZY5BW6Y">The <a href="https://andscape.com/features/alabama-prison-kelvin-moore-missing-organs/">publication Andscape</a> spoke to a former UAB&nbsp; student about how <a href="https://andscape.com/features/alabama-prison-kelvin-moore-missing-organs/">course instructors explained</a> what happens:</p><p id="4SYHMX7A45FAXEONGRZBYEHVPE">“They shared with us that when the prison warden filled out the autopsy request form, they rarely check the box to opt out of organ use for educational and research purposes,” the student told that publication.</p><p id="P2PUHM52RJAJZFDNZRKGAIDK3Y">That’s been a tug of war, too.</p><p id="DWGSL3B5K5FNRAWTO5FRC7QEH4">In a federal courtroom back and forth over Dotson’s missing heart, Alabama prison officials said they gave the body, intact, to the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, which didn’t have much of an answer for any of it. It was after a second autopsy, ordered by the Dotson family and performed by a private doctor, that no heart was found.</p><p id="5MRVBUBFJRB3ZIUTELDNAG436M">In more ways than one.</p><p id="CZ6OW24UYVAIJARQYL5PPTBLJE">It’s a whole lot of passing the buck. And the bodies.</p><p id="RGTXY4HKZVABRM2VC7J7XBGKXA">Because when prisoners’ families have no opportunity to opt out of organ collection, nobody opts out. ADOC passes to UAB or the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences and UAB takes what it will and passes what’s left of the bodies to the only people who care about them.</p><p id="VNBD6SD3Y5F5TOJCAWIZZDCZDM">And nobody in charge thinks it matters at all.</p><p id="EIJO4PCC75DZ7CSSBSKK4O6YLM">It’s just a body. Just a prisoner.</p><p id="Y2E6ICX6GRG7VJGAUIV7KKPBVU"><i>John Archibald is a two-time Pulitzer winner for AL.com.</i></p></div><p>If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.<span> By using this site, you consent to our <a href="https://www.advancelocal.com/advancelocalUserAgreement/user-agreement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">User Agreement</a> and agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with our <a href="https://www.advancelocal.com/advancelocalUserAgreement/privacy-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy.</a></span></p></div>]]></description>

The service operated much like the original Facebook social network, but let people have separate accounts for their work interactions. Workplace had as many as 7 million total paying subscribers in May 2021.</p><p>“We are discontinuing Workplace from Meta so we can focus on building AI and metaverse technologies that we believe will fundamentally reshape the way we work,” the spokesperson said in a statement. The company said it will help existing customers transition to Zoom Video Communications Inc.’s Workvivo product, a similar enterprise-focused social network, over the next few years.</p><p>TechCrunch first reported on Meta’s plan to shutter Workplace.</p><p>Meta once had ambitious plans for Workplace, and viewed it as a way to make money through subscriptions as well as a chance to extend Facebook’s reach by infusing the product into work and office settings. At one point, Meta touted a list of high-profile customers, including Starbucks Corp., Walmart Inc. and Spotify Technology SA.</p><p>The company will continue to focus on workplace-related products, a spokesperson said, but in other areas, such as the metaverse by building features for the company’s Quest VR headsets.</p><p>Workplace will continue to exist internally at Meta for company employees, who use the product for everyday collaboration with colleagues. Even after Workplace is shut down in August 2025, customers will have access to their data until the end of May 2026, Meta said.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-05-14/the-stock-market-multilevel-marketing-company-for-teens?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">How the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-13/parents-sue-video-game-makers-for-purposely-addicting-their-kids?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-14/china-tensions-drive-spending-at-us-east-coast-ports?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:US East Coast Ports Are Spending Billions to Profit From Asia’s Shifting Exports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">US East Coast Ports Are Spending Billions to Profit From Asia’s Shifting Exports</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-05-11/us-prison-labor-powers-billions-in-corporate-government-revenue?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Cheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-05-10/the-caitlin-clark-effect-is-already-changing-the-wnba?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,’ and It’s Already Changing the WNBA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">‘The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,’ and It’s Already Changing the WNBA</a></p></li></ul><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>]]></description>
