<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Indian Startup 3D Prints Rocket Engine in Just 72 Hours"><p>A rocket featuring the world’s first rocket engine 3D printed as a single piece blasted off from India’s east coast in late May.

What sets Agnikul apart is that its engine is printed in one go, rather than as multiple components that have to then be stitched together, which significantly speeds up manufacturing time.</p><p> On 30 May, the company carried out its first suborbital launch powered by the engine. A single-stage rocket lifted off from the <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/" target="_blank">Indian Space Research Organisation’s</a> Satish Dhawan Space Center on Sriharikota island in Andhra Pradesh, reaching an altitude of 6.5 kilometers before splashing down into the ocean.</p><p><span data-rm-shortcode-id="47c210ba720d4009542b5774c43a4067"><iframe type="lazy-iframe" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3J2Lnck_vgU?rel=0" width="100%" height="auto" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></span><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The launch of Agnibaan SOrTeD</small></p><p> “It performed very successfully,” says cofounder and chief operating officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moin-spm-53a80342/?originalSubdomain=in" target="_blank">Moin SPM</a>. “It met all the objectives of the mission so we have a lot of confidence in the technologies that we have built.”</p><p> The company’s first commercial product will be a two-stage rocket called <a href="https://agnikul.in/#/products" target="_blank">Agnibaan</a>, which will be 18 meters tall, feature eight engines in total and able to carry a 300-kilogram payload to an altitude of around 700 km. The launch vehicle used in May’s test was only 6 meters tall and featured just a single engine, making it roughly equivalent to Agnibaan’s second stage.</p><p> The launch acted as a technology demonstrator to test out all of the key subsystems necessary for an orbital launch. Those included the flight computer, avionics, guidance, and navigation systems, as well as the launchpad itself, which was purpose-built for the mission.</p><p> The team hit its target of 6 kilonewtons of thrust and was able to successfully carry out a wind-biasing maneuver, in which the rockets trajectory is adjusted midflight to account for the affects of wind. Besides validating the technology, SPM says they gained valuable experience in both manufacturing processes and launch operations.</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img id="4f373" data-rm-shortcode-id="bc254dae3e83b0307e0f9c44f06365c2" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-yellowish-metallic-3d-printed-rocket-engine-sits-on-a-table.jpg?id=52436307&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-yellowish-metallic-3d-printed-rocket-engine-sits-on-a-table.jpg?id=52436307&amp;width=980" width="2000" height="2667" alt="A yellowish metallic 3D printed rocket engine sits on a table."><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">This 3D-printed rocket engine was used in Agnikul’s first successful launch.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Agnikul</small></p><p> The launch also vindicated the company’s unconventional manufacturing approach. Constructing a rocket engine using conventional approaches can take months, followed by extensive qualification testing to ensure it meets the required specifications. Using a metal 3D printer from German company <a href="https://www.eos.info/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EOS</a>, Agnikul produced its engine in roughly three days. Agnikul printed the engine out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inconel" target="_blank">inconel</a>, a high-performance alloy of nickel and chromium that can withstand high temperatures and mechanical loads. The machine also automatically outputs a report that details any deviations during printing, removing the need for postfabrication qualification.</p><p> Assembling the rest of the rocket and integrating the engine took roughly two weeks. The company says that opens the door to providing low-cost, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-printed-rockets-india-agnikul" target="_blank">“on-demand”</a> launch services to <a data-linked-post="2650279771" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-small-satellites-are-providing-lowcost-access-to-space" target="_blank">operators of small satellites</a>, which otherwise need to wait for a ride share on a bigger rocket.</p><p> The big challenge now will be going from a single engine to a cluster of seven on Agnibaan’s first stage, says cofounder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/srinath-ravichandran-09679a7/?originalSubdomain=in" target="_blank">Srinath Ravichandran</a>. This raises all kinds of challenges, from balancing thrust across the engines at lift-off to managing engine plume interactions when the engines gimbal to alter the trajectory. “But these are problems that people have figured out,” he says. “We believe that we should just be able to fine-tune it for our mission and go.”</p><p> The company is currently building facilities to carry out ground tests of engine clusters, says Ravichandran, and is targeting its first orbital launch for this time next year.</p><p><em>This post was updated in 12 June to add further detail about the material that Agnikul is using to 3D print its rocket engines.</em><br></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>            We're less than a week away from <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/snapdragon-x/">Qualcomm's Snapdragon X-series</a> laptops hitting shelves, and it's kind of a big deal. There's been an elephant in the room since Apple started using Arm chips for Macs, and this is seen as the launch that will bring Windows to parity with that.
    </p>    
<p>            But there's another elephant in the room, at least depending on your perspective, which is that Arm Holdings and Qualcomm have been locked in a legal battle for some time over these very chips.

<p>            "Arm's claim against Qualcomm and Nuvia is about protecting the Arm ecosystem and partners who rely on our IP and innovative designs, and therefore enforcing Qualcomm's contractual obligation to destroy and stop using the Nuvia designs that were derived from Arm technology," an Arm spokesperson said in a statement to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2024-06-10/analysis-arm-qualcomm-legal-battle-seen-disrupting-ai-powered-pc-wave" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Reuters</a>.
    </p>    
<p>            And there it is. Arm wants all Snapdragon X series chips destroyed. Or does it?
    </p>    
<p>            Firstly, let's be clear about what the company is calling for here. Qualcomm has laid the foundation for Windows on Arm. It's built out the ecosystem since the platform was announced at the end of 2016. Native apps like Chrome, Slack, and a whole bunch of others wouldn't exist if it weren't for <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-windows-on-arm/">Snapdragon PCs</a>. What Arm is calling for is for Qualcomm to be eliminated from the market so that it can swoop in with its own Cortex designs.
    </p>    
<p>            And according to rumors, as well as what I'm hearing from my own sources, there are more Arm vendors coming to the Windows ecosystem. Rumor has it that Nvidia, MediaTek, and AMD all have their eyes on it, and a competitor could be entering the space as soon as CES 2025.
    </p>    
<p>            It's likely that a company like MediaTek would use Arm's own Cortex cores, which would be more lucrative for Arm, of course. It also allows the company to maintain a competitive advantage in a world where both Apple and Qualcomm have both moved on from Cortex designs because Arm wasn't offering what they needed.
    </p>    <h2 id="it-39-s-all-about-licensing">
                        It's all about licensing
               </h2><h3 id="does-qualcomm-have-the-rights-to-make-its-own-arm-chips-no-one-knows">
            Does Qualcomm have the rights to make its own Arm chips? No one knows

<p>            Basically, Arm says that Qualcomm doesn't have a license to make custom Arm chips, and Qualcomm is saying that it does. There are two kinds of Arm licenses. One is for using Cortex cores, which are designed by Arm, essentially as an off-the-shelf part. The other kind of license lets you build whatever you want, as long as it follows the Arm instruction set.
    </p>    
<p>            Apple and Qualcomm are doing the latter.
    </p>    
<p>            Arm has always been pretty public about the fact that it prefers companies to use Cortex cores. Custom chips mean companies like Qualcomm can make a better Arm chip than Arm, and it can't make the old Apple excuse anymore, which was always that it was about optimizing for the full stack from hardware to software.
    </p>    
<p>            Qualcomm bought a company called Nuvia to do this, and it originally used Nuvia's architectural license. Arm's argument is that the Nuvia license was canceled when it was taken over by Qualcomm. A new deal would have to be negotiated if that holds up in court.
    </p>    
<p>            So, there you have it. Arm wants Qualcomm to stop shipping the product it's been contesting, but to be honest, that's not usually how these things end. It's unlikely that any product will be delayed from hitting shelves. These cases tend to end with one company giving a bucket of cash to the other, and everyone moves on.
    </p>    
<p>            Snapdragon X PCs are slated to launch on June 18, with a total of 14 products from seven OEMs, including Microsoft, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, Asus, and even Qualcomm. Acer also has a product ready to go in mid-July.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.blog.tensorwave.com/amds-mi300x-outperforms-nvidias-h100-for-llm-inference/">https://www.blog.tensorwave.com/amds-mi300x-outperforms-nvidias-h100-for-llm-inference/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40667102">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>There has been much anticipation around AMD’s flagship MI300X accelerator. With unmatched raw <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi300x.html">specs</a>, the pressing question remains: Can it outperform NVIDIA’s Hopper architecture in real-world AI workloads? We have some exciting early results to share.</p>



<p>For the past month, <strong><a href="https://tensorwave.com/">TensorWave</a> and <a href="https://mk1.ai/">MK1</a></strong> have worked closely to unlock performance of AMD hardware for AI inference. To start, we focused on Mixture of Expert (MoE) architectures due to their compute efficiency and popularity – notably used by Mistral, Meta, Databricks, and X.ai for their most powerful open-source LLMs.</p>



<p>The initial results are impressive: using MK1’s inference software, the MI300X <strong>achieves 33% higher throughput compared to the H100 SXM</strong> running vLLM on Mixtral 8x7B for a real-world chat use case. Despite NVIDIA’s software ecosystem being more mature, it is clear that AMD is already a formidable competitor in the AI market. When hardware availability and cost are factored in, the MI300X proves to be an attractive option for enterprises running large-scale inference in the cloud. </p>

<p>We invite you to experience the MI300X firsthand at TensorWave, which comes prepackaged with MK1’s inference software. <a href="mailto:alex@tensorwave.com">C</a><a href="mailto:contact@tensorwave.com">ontact us</a> to find out more.</p>



<h2 id="h-inference-benchmarks">Inference Benchmarks</h2>



<p>We conducted extensive offline and online inference tests comparing the MI300X and H100 SXM5 accelerators using the Mixtral 8x7B model.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Offline Tests:</strong> These are standardized and provide insights into the performance of the forward pass across different setups.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Online Tests:</strong> These are more sophisticated and estimate system performance in a real-world setting where multiple users are serviced asynchronously.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong><span>Benchmark Setup</span></strong></p>



<p><strong>AMD</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hardware:</strong> TensorWave node equipped with 8 MI300X accelerators, 2 AMD EPYC CPU Processors (192 cores), and 2.3 TB of DDR5 RAM.</li>



<li><strong>MI300X Accelerator: </strong>192GB VRAM, 5.3 TB/s, ~1300 TFLOPS for FP16</li>



<li><strong>Drivers: </strong>ROCm 6.1.2</li>



<li><strong>Inference Stack: </strong>MK1’s inference engine (Flywheel) v0.9.2 and AMD’s ROCm optimized fork of vLLM (rocm/vllm) v0.4.0.</li>



<li><strong>Configuration: </strong>Tensor parallelism set to 1 (tp=1), since we can fit the entire model Mixtral 8x7B in a single MI300X’s 192GB of VRAM.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>NVIDIA</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Baremetal node with 8 H100 SXM5 accelerators with NVLink, 160 CPU cores, and 1.2 TB of DDR5 RAM.</li>



<li><strong>H100 SXM5 Accelerator: </strong>80GB VRAM, 3.35 TB/s, ~986 TFLOPS for FP16</li>



<li><strong>Drivers: </strong>CUDA 12.2</li>



<li><strong>Inference Stack: </strong>vLLM v4.3<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>



<li><strong>Configuration: </strong>Tensor parallelism set to 2 (tp=2), which is required to fit Mixtral 8x7B in two H100’s 80GB VRAM.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>Notes</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li>All benchmarks are performed using the Mixtral 8x7B model.</li>



<li>All inference frameworks are configured to use FP16 compute paths. Enabling FP8 compute is left for future work.</li>



<li>To make an accurate comparison between the systems with different settings of tensor parallelism, we extrapolate throughput for the MI300X by 2.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-offline-results">Offline Results</h2>



<p>To measure peak throughput for each inference solution, we generate prompts of a fixed size and directly feed them to the model. This method, known as offline batching, enhances hardware efficiency by processing multiple prompts simultaneously. Although larger batch sizes boost throughput, they also increase latency due to more requests being processed. Following standard practice, we constrain requests in a batch to have equal input sizes, and to have equal output sizes.</p>



<p>We assess the throughput of each system by varying the batch size. This was done using a modified version of `benchmark_throughput.py` script in the vLLM repository, refactored to include Flywheel as a backend. Prompts were also randomly generated within a batch to remove caching mechanisms. The performance metrics, detailed in the table below, measure throughput as a function of batch size.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.blog.tensorwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Untitled-design-4-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.blog.tensorwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Untitled-design-4-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.blog.tensorwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Untitled-design-4-300x169.png 300w, https://www.blog.tensorwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Untitled-design-4-768x432.png 768w, https://www.blog.tensorwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Untitled-design-4-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.blog.tensorwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Untitled-design-4.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Notably, our results show that <strong>MI300X running MK1 Flywheel outperforms H100 running vLLM for every batch size</strong>, with an increase in performance ranging from 1.22x to 2.94x.</p>



<h2 id="h-online-results-for-chat-data-distribution">Online Results for Chat Data Distribution</h2>



<p>Moving beyond offline metrics, we designed a series of online benchmarks to simulate a realistic typical chat application. This involves generating responses to user inputs that closely mirror actual usage patterns.</p>



<p>Specifically, we simulate chat traffic by spawning independent workers to send requests to an endpoint. We then sweep the number of workers to increase the number of concurrent requests.</p>



<p>In these experiments, requests were generated using a standard text chat distribution with an average of 573 input tokens and 50 output tokens. Note that our benchmarking tool supports arbitrary data distributions; please reach out if you have a specific use case you’d like to test.</p>



<p>The key metrics of interest are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Throughput (Requests per Second)</strong>: The number of requests the system can handle per second for a given workload.</li>



<li><strong>Average Latency (Seconds)</strong>: The average time taken to generate a full response for each request.</li>



<li><strong>Time Per Output Token (TPOT)</strong>: The time to generate each subsequent token (averaged) after the first token, which impacts the overall speed of generating long responses.</li>
</ul>



<p>For the first benchmark, we tested a non-streaming use case where throughput and latency are measured for servicing the <em>full response</em>.</p>

<p>At a target average latency of 5 seconds, <strong>two MI300X with tp=1 services 33% more requests per second than two H100s with tp=2</strong>. This means you can service the same number of users with similar quality of service using fewer accelerators!</p>



<p>For the second benchmark, we enable streaming and measure throughput and TPOT for individual tokens as they are streamed out.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.blog.tensorwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Throughput-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.blog.tensorwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Throughput-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.blog.tensorwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Throughput-300x169.png 300w, https://www.blog.tensorwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Throughput-768x432.png 768w, https://www.blog.tensorwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Throughput-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.blog.tensorwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Throughput.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Here we observe that the MI300X has higher throughput for every TPOT compared to the H100. This means the <strong>MI300X can generate text faster at higher traffic volumes</strong>, which is crucial for any LLM application.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Our benchmarks demonstrate that AMD's MI300X outperforms NVIDIA's H100 in both offline and online inference tasks for MoE architectures like Mixtral 8x7B. The MI300X not only offers higher throughput but also excels in real-world scenarios requiring fast response times. </p>



<p>Given its impressive performance, competitive cost, and hardware availability, the MI300X with MK1 software is an excellent choice for enterprises looking to scale their AI inference capabilities. We encourage you to explore the capabilities of MI300X at TensorWave and experience these benefits first-hand.

<p>The third generation of Llama models provided fine-tunes (Instruct) versions that excel in understanding and following instructions. However, these models are heavily censored, designed to refuse requests seen as harmful with responses such as "As an AI assistant, I cannot help you." While this safety feature is crucial for preventing misuse, it limits the model's flexibility and responsiveness.</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore a technique called "abliteration" that can uncensor any LLM without retraining. This technique effectively removes the model's built-in refusal mechanism, allowing it to respond to all types of prompts.</p>
<p>The code is available on&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VYm3hOcvCpbGiqKZb141gJwjdmmCcVpR?usp=sharing">Google Colab</a>&nbsp;and in the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/mlabonne/llm-course">LLM Course</a>&nbsp;on GitHub.</p>

		✂️ What is abliteration?
	</span>
</h2>
<p>Modern LLMs are fine-tuned for safety and instruction-following, meaning they are trained to refuse harmful requests. In their <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jGuXSZgv6qfdhMCuJ/refusal-in-llms-is-mediated-by-a-single-direction">blog post</a>, Arditi et al. have shown that this refusal behavior is mediated by a specific direction in the model's residual stream. If we prevent the model from representing this direction, it <strong>loses its ability to refuse requests</strong>. Conversely, adding this direction artificially can cause the model to refuse even harmless requests.</p>
<p>In the traditional decoder-only Llama-like architecture, there are three residual streams we can target: at the start of each block ("pre"), between the attention and MLP layers ("mid"), and after the MLP ("post"). The following figure illustrates the location of each residual stream.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://i.imgur.com/hsdR9e7.png"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/hsdR9e7.png"></a></p>
<p>To uncensor an LLM, we first need to identify the "refusal direction" within the model. This process involves a few technical steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Run the model on a set of harmful instructions and a set of harmless instructions, recording the residual stream activations at the last token position for each.</li>
<li><strong>Mean difference</strong>: Calculate the mean difference between the activations of harmful and harmless instructions. This gives us a vector representing the "refusal direction" for each layer of the model.</li>
<li><strong>Selection</strong>: Normalize these vectors and evaluate them to select the single best "refusal direction."</li>
</ol>
<p>Once we have identified the refusal direction, we can "ablate" it, effectively removing the model's ability to represent this feature. This can be done through an <strong>inference-time intervention</strong> or permanently with <strong>weight orthogonalization</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's talk about inference-time intervention first. For every component that writes to the residual stream (such as an attention head), we calculate the projection of its output onto the refusal direction and subtract this projection. This subtraction is applied at every token and every layer, ensuring that the model never represents the refusal direction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, weight orthogonalization involves modifying the model weights directly. By orthogonalizing the component weights with respect to the refusal direction, it prevents the model from writing to this direction altogether. This is achieved by adjusting the matrices that write to the residual stream, ensuring they do not contribute to the refusal direction.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will implement abliteration with weight orthogonalization.</p>

</h2>
<p>The following implementation of abliteration is based on <a href="https://huggingface.co/failspy/llama-3-70B-Instruct-abliterated/blob/main/ortho_cookbook.ipynb">FailSpy's notebook</a>, which is itself based on the original authors' <a rel="nofollow" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a-aQvKC9avdZpdyBn4jgRQFObTPy1JZw?usp=sharing">notebook</a>. I mostly adapted and simplified it to make it easier to understand. This section is quite code-heavy so you can see what is going on, but you can use FailSpy's <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/FailSpy/abliterator">abliterator library</a> if you're less interested in the technical details (also check his <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/failspy/abliterated-v3-664a8ad0db255eefa7d0012b">collection of abliterated models</a> on Hugging Face).</p>
<p>The code relies on the excellent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens">TransformerLens</a> library (formerly known as EasyTransformer) to do the heavy lifting. It is designed for mechanistic interpretability and is used here to intervene on activations. Thanks to Neel Nanda and Joseph Bloom for creating and maintaining this library.</p>
<p>First, let's install the necessary packages and import them. All these steps are available in this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VYm3hOcvCpbGiqKZb141gJwjdmmCcVpR?usp=sharing">Google Colab notebook</a>.</p>

To make things easier, I repackaged them in two Hugging Face datasets: <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/harmless_behaviors">mlabonne/harmless_behaviors</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlabonne/harmful_behaviors">mlabonne/harmful_behaviors</a>. That way, you can easily replace them with your own datasets.</p>
<p>We will load the instructions and reformat them into a list of dictionaries with "role" and "content" keys. This makes it compatible with the <code>apply_chat_tokenizer()</code> method, which we will use to follow Llama 3's chat template.</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span> <span>reformat_texts</span>(<span>texts</span>):

<p>Now that we have our datasets, we can load the model we want to abliterate. Unfortunately, you can't directly load a custom model using <code>HookedTransformer</code>. Here, I use a trick described in FailSpy's notebook to download a custom model and rename it as <a href="https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct">meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct</a>. Load in <code>torch.float16</code> format if your GPU is not compatible with BF16.</p>
<p>In this example, we'll use <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/Daredevil-8B">mlabonne/Daredevil-8B</a>, a mega-merge created with DARE TIES (see my article about <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/mlabonne/merge-models">model merging</a>) that has the highest MMLU score on the Open LLM Leaderboard in the 8B category.</p>

<p>I evaluated the abliterated and source models from the previous section on the Open LLM Leaderboard and on Nous' benchmark suite. Here are the results:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://i.imgur.com/ECCejII.png"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/ECCejII.png"></a></p>
<p>As you can see, the source model significantly outperforms Llama 3 8B Instruct. However, we observe a performance drop in the ablated version across all benchmarks. The ablation process successfully uncensored it but also degraded the model's quality.</p>
<p>To address this issue, an idea consists of further training our abliterated model to heal it. Like most fine-tuned models, Llama 3 8B Instruct is quite brittle when it comes to supervised fine-tuning. An additional SFT would likely break the model's performance.</p>
<p>Alternatively, preference alignment is quite light and shouldn't lobotomize our abliterated model. DPO is a good candidate here for its ease of use and good track record. To implement it, I used <a rel="nofollow" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TsDKNo2riwVmU55gjuBgB1AXVtRRfRHW?usp=sharing">LazyAxolotl</a> with the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlabonne/orpo-dpo-mix-40k">mlabonne/orpo-dpo-mix-40k</a> dataset.

<p>It automatically uploaded the DPO fine-tuned model, called <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/NeuralDaredevil-8B-abliterated">mlabonne/NeuralDaredevil-8B-abliterated</a>. To see if it fixed our abliterated version, I evaluated it on the same benchmarks:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://i.imgur.com/ChDwx4r.png"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/ChDwx4r.png"></a></p>
<p>We can see that this additional training allowed us to recover most of the performance drop due to abliteration. One area where the model doesn't improve is GSM8K, a math dataset, which could mean the orpo-dpo-mix-40k would benefit from more math samples.</p>
<p>The final model is an uncensored LLM with state-of-the-art performance in the 8B category. I recommend it as an improved version of Llama 3 8B Instruct when you don't need censorship. You can play with quantized versions like GGUF in LM Studio.</p>

		Conclusion
	</span>
</h2>
<p>In this article, we introduced the concept of abliteration. This technique uses the model's activations on harmless and harmful prompts to calculate a refusal direction. It then uses this direction to modify the model's weights and ensure that we stop outputting refusals. This technique also demonstrates the fragility of safety fine-tuning and raises ethical considerations.</p>
<p>We applied abliteration to Daredevil-8B to uncensor it, which also degraded the model's performance. We then healed it using DPO to create the NeuralDaredevil-8B model, a fully uncensored and high-quality 8B LLM. Abliteration is not limited to removing alignment and should be seen as a form of fine-tuning without retraining. Indeed, it can creatively be applied to other goals, like FailSpy's <a href="https://huggingface.co/failspy/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-MopeyMule">MopeyMule</a>, which adopts a melancholic conversational style.</p>

		<p><span>As we continue to focus our AI research and development on solving increasingly complex problems, one of the most significant and challenging shifts we’ve experienced is the sheer scale of computation required to train large language models (LLMs).</span></p>
<p><span>Traditionally, our AI model training has involved a training massive number of models that required a comparatively smaller number of GPUs. This was the case for our recommendation models (e.g., our feed and ranking models) that would ingest vast amounts of information to make accurate recommendations that power most of our products.</span></p>

<p><span>With the advent of generative AI (GenAI), we’ve seen a shift towards fewer jobs, but incredibly large ones. Supporting GenAI at scale has meant rethinking how our software, hardware, and network infrastructure come together.</span></p>
<h2><span>The challenges of large-scale model training</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-LLMs-at-Scale-image-2.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-LLMs-at-Scale-image-2.png 2500w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-LLMs-at-Scale-image-2.png?resize=580,326 580w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-LLMs-at-Scale-image-2.png?resize=916,515 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-LLMs-at-Scale-image-2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-LLMs-at-Scale-image-2.png?resize=1024,576 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-LLMs-at-Scale-image-2.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-LLMs-at-Scale-image-2.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-LLMs-at-Scale-image-2.png?resize=96,54 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-LLMs-at-Scale-image-2.png?resize=192,108 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"></p>
<p><span>As we increase the number of GPUs in a job, the likelihood of an interruption due to a hardware failure also increases. Also, all of these GPUs still need to communicate on the same high-speed fabric to perform optimally. This underscores the importance of four factors:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Hardware reliability</b><span>: Ensuring that our hardware is reliable is important. We need to minimize the chances of a hardware failure interrupting a training job. This involves rigorous testing and quality control measures, and automation to quickly detect and remediate issues.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Fast recovery on failure</b><span>: Despite our best efforts, hardware failures can and do occur. When they do, we need to be able to recover quickly. This involves reducing re-scheduling overhead and fast training re-initialization.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Efficient preservation of the training state</b><span>: In the event of a failure, we need to be able to pick up where we left off. This means we need to regularly checkpoint our training state and efficiently store and retrieve training data.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Optimal connectivity between GPUs:</b><span> Large-scale model training involves transferring vast amounts of data between GPUs in a synchronized fashion. A slow data exchange between a subset of GPUs can compound and slow down the whole job. Solving this problem requires a robust and high-speed network infrastructure as well as efficient data transfer protocols and algorithms.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Innovating across the infrastructure stack</span></h2>
<p><span>Perfecting every layer of our infrastructure stack is important due to the demands of GenAI at scale. This has encompassed developments in a wide range of areas.</span></p>
<h3><span>Training software</span></h3>
<p><span>We enable researchers to use </span><a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/training-production-ai-models/"><span>PyTorch</span></a><span> and other new open source developments, facilitating extremely fast research-to-production development. This includes </span><span>developing new algorithms and techniques for efficient large-scale training and integrating new software tools and frameworks into our infrastructure.</span></p>
<h3><span>Scheduling</span></h3>
<p><span>Efficient scheduling helps ensure that our resources are used optimally. This involves </span><span>sophisticated algorithms that can allocate resources based on the needs of different jobs and dynamic scheduling to adapt to changing workloads.</span></p>
<h3><span>Hardware&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>We need high-performance hardware to handle the computational demands of large-scale model training. Beyond size and scale, many hardware configurations and attributes need to be best optimized for GenAI. Given that hardware development times are traditionally long, we had to adapt existing hardware, and to this end we explored various dimensions including power, HBM capacity and speed, and I/O.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We also pivoted by modifying the </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/18/open-source/ocp-summit-2022-grand-teton/"><span>Grand Teton</span></a><span> platform that was developed using NVIDIA H100 GPUs, increased the TDP of the GPUs to 700W, and moved to HBM3 on the GPUs. Since we did not have time to change the cooling infrastructure, we had to remain in an air-cooled environment. The mechanical and thermal designs had to change to accommodate this, and that triggered a validation cycle to support a large-scale deployment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>All of these hardware-related changes were challenging because we had to find a solution that fit within the existing resource constraints, with a very small degree of freedom to change and meet a tight schedule.</span></p>
<h3><span>Data center deployment</span></h3>
<p><span>Once we’ve chosen a GPU and system, the task of placing them in a data center for optimal usage of resources (power, cooling, networking, etc.) requires revisiting trade-offs made for other types of workloads. Data center power and cooling infrastructure cannot be changed quickly (or easily) and we had to find an optimal layout that allowed maximum compute capability within a data hall. This required relocating supporting services such as readers out of the data hall and packing as many GPU racks as possible to maximize the power and network capability for highest compute density with the largest network cluster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Reliability&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>We need to plan for detection and remediation to minimize downtime during hardware failures. The number of failures scales with the size of the cluster, and having a job that spans the cluster makes it necessary to keep adequate spare capacity to restart the job as soon as possible. In addition, we monitor failures and can sometimes take preventive measures to mitigate downtime.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Some of the most frequent failure modes we have observed are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>GPUs falling off:</b><span> In this case, GPUs are not detected by the host on PCIe. There are several reasons for this failure, but this failure mode is seen more in the early life and settles as the server ages.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>DRAM &amp; SRAM UCE:</b><span> Uncorrectable errors are common in memories, and we monitor and identify repeat offenders, track against thresholds, and initiate RMAs when error rates exceed vendor thresholds.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>HW network cable:</b><span> In the general category of unreachable servers, these failures are also seen most often in the early life of the server.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Network</span></h3>
<p><span>Large-scale model training involves transferring vast amounts of data quickly between GPUs. This requires robust and high-speed network infrastructure as well as efficient data transfer protocols and algorithms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are two leading choices in the industry that fit these requirements: RoCE and InfiniBand fabrics. Both of these options had tradeoffs. On the one hand, Meta had built RoCE clusters for the past four years, but the largest of those clusters only supported 4K GPUs. We needed significantly larger RoCE clusters. On the other hand, Meta had built research clusters with InfiniBand as </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/ai-rsc/"><span>large as 16K GPUs</span></a><span>. However, those clusters were </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> tightly integrated into Meta’s production environment, nor were they built for the latest generation of GPUs/networking. This made for a difficult decision of what fabric to build with.</span></p>
<p><span>So we decided to build both: </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/12/data-center-engineering/building-metas-genai-infrastructure/"><span>two 24k clusters</span></a><span>, one with RoCE and another with InfiniBand. Our intent was to build and learn from the operational experience. These learnings will inform the future direction of GenAI fabrics. We optimized the RoCE cluster for quick build time, and the InfiniBand cluster for full-bisection bandwidth. We used both InfiniBand and RoCE clusters to train </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/"><span>Llama 3</span></a><span>, with the RoCE cluster used for training the largest model. Despite the underlying network technology differences between these clusters, we were able to tune both of them to provide equivalent performance for these large GenAI workloads</span></p>

<p><span>We optimized three aspects of the overall stack to make network communication for GenAI models performant on both clusters:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>We assigned communication patterns resulting from different model, data and pipeline parallelisms to different layers of the network topology so that the network capabilities were effectively exploited.</span></li>
<li><span>We implemented collective communication patterns with network topology awareness so that they can be less latency-sensitive. We do this by changing the default implementation of collectives with custom algorithms such as recursive doubling or halving instead of conventional algorithms like rings.</span></li>
<li><span>Just like ranking jobs, GenAI jobs produce additional fat flows that make it hard to distribute traffic across all possible network paths. This required us to further invest in network load balancing and routing to achieve an optimal distribution of traffic across network resources.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>We spoke in depth about our </span><a href="https://atscaleconference.com/videos/scaling-roce-networks-for-ai-training/"><span>RoCE load-balancing techniques</span></a><span> at </span><a href="https://atscaleconference.com/videos/scaling-roce-networks-for-ai-training/"><span>Networking @Scale 2023</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<h3><span>Storage</span></h3>
<p><span>We need efficient data-storage solutions to store the vast amounts of data used in model training. This involves investing in high-capacity and high-speed storage technologies and developing new data-storage solutions for specific workloads.</span></p>
<h2><span>Looking ahead</span></h2>
<p><span>In the next few years w</span><span>e will be working with hundreds of thousands of GPUs, handling even larger volumes of data, and dealing with longer distances and latencies. We’ll be adopting new hardware technologies—including newer GPU architectures—and evolving our infrastructure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These challenges will push us to innovate and adapt in ways we can’t fully predict yet. But one thing is certain: We are only at the beginning of this journey. As we continue to navigate the evolving landscape of AI, we remain committed to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Japan's parliament enacted Wednesday a law to promote competition in smartphone app stores by restricting tech giants Apple Inc. and Google LLC from limiting third-party companies from selling and operating apps on their platforms.</p>
<p>The law will prohibit the providers of Apple's iOS and Google's Android smartphone operating systems, app stores and payment platforms from preventing the sale of apps and services that directly compete with the native platforms' own.</p>
<p>The change is aimed at stopping the dominant players from gatekeeping and forcing them to engage in price competition with smaller challengers in hopes of benefiting consumers and promoting innovation.</p>
<p>The law will also prohibit the tech giants from giving priority to their own services in internet search results.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://img.kyodonews.net/english/public/images/posts/e12df7bdd2bc87d2b43aeaaaab5d93b4/photo_l.jpg" width="100%"></p><p><em>The House of Councillors convenes a plenary session in parliament in Tokyo on June 12, 2024. (Kyodo)</em></p>
</div>
<p>Violations of the new law will bring a penalty of 20 percent of the domestic revenue of the service found to have breached the rules. The fine can increase to 30 percent if the companies do not cease the anticompetitive practices.</p>
<p>The new penalty is more than triple the existing fine under the antimonopoly law, which imposes fines of 6 percent of revenue gained through services deemed to be using an anticompetitive edge.</p>
<p>The new law, expected to take effect by the end of 2025, follows a similar regulation introduced by the European Union in March.</p>
<p>The technology giants, which will be designated by the Fair Trade Commission, are to be required to submit regulatory compliance reports and will be monitored by the commission to ensure they are following the rules.</p>
<p>The legislation, which was approved by the House of Representatives in May, was enacted after being passed by the House of Councillors on Wednesday.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Swift compiler is notoriously slow due to how types are inferred<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Every June I hope that Apple will announce that they fixed it; sadly this is not that year.</p><p>Here’s an explanation by the creator of Swift, Chris Lattner (From his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ag0fPMmYPQ&amp;t=373s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mojo talk</a>):</p><blockquote><p>My experience with Swift is we tried to make a really fancy bi-directional Hindley-Milner type checker and it’s really great because you can have very beautiful minimal syntax but the problem is that A) compile times are really bad (particularly if you have complicated expressions) and B) the error messages are awful because now you have global constraint systems and when something goes wrong you have to infer what happened and the user can’t know that something over there made it so something over here can’t type check. In my experience it sounds great but it doesn’t work super well.</p></blockquote><p>Let me explain what he means with an example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="swift"><span><span><span>enum</span> <span>ThreatLevel</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> <span>red</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> <span>midnight</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>enum</span> <span>KeyTime</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> <span>midnight</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> <span>midday</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>func</span> <span>setThreatLevel</span><span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>ThreatLevel</span><span>)</span> <span>{...}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>setThreatLevel</span><span>(.</span><span>midnight</span><span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>.midnight</code> on the last line could represent <code>ThreatLevel.midnight</code> or <code>KeyTime.midnight</code>. The Swift compiler has to use the surrounding context of <code>setThreatLevel()</code>, which has the type <code>(ThreatLevel)-&gt;Void</code>, to infer that we mean <code>ThreatLevel.midnight</code>. After the Swift compiler parses code into an abstract syntax tree, child nodes influence their parent’s type <em>and</em> parent nodes influence their children’s types (that’s what Chris means by “bi-directional”). Compare this to the Zig language, in which types are determined without looking at the surrounding code.</p><p>This approach becomes a problem when expressions contain many elements that each need their types inferred, with each affecting the others. This often occurs due to Swift’s operator overloading, and the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/initialization-with-literals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ExpressibleBy protocols</a>. Every literal (string, number, boolean, dictionary, array) and every operator (* / + - etc) multiply the combinations the type checker must consider.</p><p>Here’s an example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="swift"><span><span><span>let</span> <span>address</span> <span>=</span> <span>"127.0.0.1"</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>let</span> <span>username</span> <span>=</span> <span>"steve"</span>

</span></span><span><span>            <span>+</span> <span>"/picture"</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>swiftc</code> spends 42 seconds on these 12 lines on an M1 Pro<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, only to spit out the notorious <code>error: the compiler is unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time; try breaking up the expression into distinct sub-expressions</code>. In the same amount of time, clang can perform a clean build of my 59,000 line C project <em>38 times</em>.</p><p>The issue is caused by using the <code>+</code> operator with the <code>channel</code> Int and a String literal. Thanks to the standard library’s 17 overloads of <code>+</code> and 9 types adopting the <code>ExpressibleByStringLiteral</code> Protocol, the swift compiler can’t rule out that there <em>might</em> be a combination of types and operators that make the expression valid, so it has to try them all. Just considering that the five string literals could be one of the possible nine types results in 59,049 combinations, but I suspect that’s a lower bound, since it doesn’t consider the many overloads of <code>+</code>. It gives up before getting through them all.</p><p>You can fix the code by converting <code>channel</code> to String:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="swift"><span><span><span>let</span> <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>"http://"</span> <span>+</span> <span>username</span>

</span></span><span><span>            <span>+</span> <span>"/picture"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This now successfully compiles in 0.19 seconds!</p><p>Maybe you think strings are complicated or something, so here’s an example that is just math:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="swift"><span><span><span>let</span> <span>offset</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>5.0</span><span>;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Again, we get <code>error: the compiler is unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time; try breaking up the expression into distinct sub-expressions</code>, this time after “only” 8 seconds. The problem is due to <code>index * 5.0</code>, i.e. an int multiplied by a double. Even <a href="https://youtu.be/-eCwBwTbjAI?si=rQ5tHNcBRkmaFV8-&amp;t=1000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toy compilers</a> handle equivalent code quickly, thanks to a context-free type system.</p><p>Both examples are slow because they’re invalid swift and the type checker falls out of the fast path in order to confirm all possible type combinations are invalid. You might think it’s ok for invalid code to take a long time to compile. For me, 42 seconds to produce an “I give up” message is unacceptable. However, there are valid lines of swift that take a long time to compile too. Send me your slow lines (found using <code>-Xfrontend -debug-time-function-bodies</code>) and I’ll add it to this post.</p><p>Swift has come a long way from version 1, but on its 10th birthday it can still be slow. Unfortunately this can’t be completely fixed by optimizing the current approach. It requires a different approach.</p><p>Here’s what I’d do:</p><ol><li>Add a flag to <code>swiftc</code> that makes it infer types using only an expression’s child AST nodes while ignoring the parent AST node. The flag would also disable the <code>ExpressibleBy</code> protocols, which by definition get their type from their context.</li><li>Make a feature that adds type annotations, casts, and enum names to existing code where necessary to compile with the new type checker</li><li>Update all sample code to compile with the flag</li></ol><p>This might be a reasonable stopping point: teams that care about compile times and good error messages could use the flag, and everyone else doesn’t have to. It could go further though:</p><ol start="4"><li>Enable the flag by default for new Xcode projects</li><li>Deprecate the old type inference approach</li></ol><p>With this new approach, you’d have to add type annotations in some places. I’m ok with that. As a result, we’d get faster compilation times and clearer error messages, but the extra verbosity might be too much for the swift community to swallow.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    

    
    <hr>
    <p>The GJK algorithm is a weird way to do a simple thing.
</p><p>We have shape A and shape B, and we'd like to determine if they overlap.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609145754.png" width="500">
</p><p>A shape is a set of infinitely many points. If there exists any point that's a member of both sets, then the shapes overlap.
</p><p>Alternatively, if there exists point <em>a</em> in set A and a point <em>b</em> in set B such that:
</p><p><em>a</em> - <em>b</em> = <strong>0</strong>
</p><p>Then an intersection exists. Note that the <strong>0</strong> here represents a point itself: the origin.
</p><p>To see what this means intuitively, we can take a shift in perspective. Instead of dealing with specific points, let's try subtracting <em>every</em> point within one shape from <em>every</em> point within another, and plotting where they all end up:
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240604163159.png" width="500">
</p><p>We've ended up with a new set that represents the "difference" between A and B. Since it contains the origin, we know that there must be at least one pair of points whose difference is <strong>0</strong>.
</p><p>That's exactly what the GJK algorithm takes advantage of. Instead of directly checking if the sets have an intersection, we subtract them and see if the new set contains the origin.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240604163335.png" width="500">
</p><p>Combining sets like this is known as taking the Minkowski difference. You may see this denoted '⊖' to separate it from the normal notion of a difference.
</p><p>More formally, it's defined as:
</p><p>A ⊖ B = {a - b | a ∊ A, b ∊ B}
</p><p>At first, it doesn't seem like we've made any progress, only rephrased the problem. How are we supposed to subtract infinitely many points? Well, let's find the bare minimum that we <em>need to know</em> about the set A ⊖ B to see if it contains the origin.
</p><p>In 2 dimensions, if a convex set contains the origin, it means we're able to draw a triangle between 3 points on the boundary, which contains the origin. This makes the problem even easier. If we know that A ⊖ B is convex, we only need to deal with the boundary.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240604164614.png" width="500">
</p><p>Luckily, it's easy to ensure A ⊖ B will be convex.
</p><p>The Minkowski difference of any two convex sets is also convex. So, we just need to break down A and B into convex components, which we can work with individually. On a computer, most shapes are already constructed out of convex components, so this process is often extremely easy.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240604182725.png" width="500">
</p><p>By the way, even though I'm explaining in 2D, our problem is fundamentally the same in any dimension. Here, we're looking for a bounding triangle on A ⊖ B. But, more generally, we're looking for a "simplex" in our dimension. An n-dimensional simplex is just the simplest polytope that can enclose an n-dimensional region. For example, a 3D simplex is a tetrahedron, as it has the fewest vertices needed to bound a volume.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240604175314.png" width="500">
</p><p><em></em>With these tools, let's restate the problem.
</p><ul><li>We want to determine if any simplex within A ⊖ B will enclose the origin.
</li></ul><ul><li>We don't want to have to compute the entire boundary of A ⊖ B. We only need to find some 3 points on A and some 3 points on B that will map to the vertices of our bounding simplex.
</li></ul><ul><li>There's no one solution, as infinitely many bounding simplexes might exist. We just need to find any 6 points on A and B that work, or prove that we can't find any.
</li></ul><p>So, from now on, whenever I say "shape", I'm speaking only about the boundary of a given set. We've thrown away all the area, as it's no longer relevant to the problem.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240604192323.png" width="500">
</p><p>Things would be much easier if we had some system to identify points on our shape. The support function (denoted S here) does just that. It takes in a vector, and outputs the furthest point on the shape in that direction. On a convex shape, every boundary point is identifiable using the support function of some direction.
</p><p>In other words, if we rotate a vector <em>d</em> 360 degrees around the origin, S(<em>d</em>) will hit every point. So, finding N points on a shape corresponds to finding N directions.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609121840.png" width="500">
</p><p>The support function is easy to formally define. It's just the point that has the highest dot product of <em>d</em>. 
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609125706.png" width="500">
</p><p>Remember how I previously said we'd need to find 3 points on A, and 3 points on B? Well, we really only need to find 3 points in total. That's because of the following useful property of the Minkowski difference:
</p><p>The support of direction <em>d</em> in A ⊖ B = the support of <em>d</em> in A minus the support of <em>-d</em> in B.
</p><p>Basically, if we sweep across the borders of A and B in opposite directions by rotating <em>d</em>, we'll hit every boundary point on A ⊖ B. This massively narrows down how many possible points we need to search, as our points on A and B will always be dependent on each other. I know the diagrams are getting a bit confusing now, so bear with me.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240603131831.png" width="500">
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240610135637.png" width="500">
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609122623.png" width="500">
</p><p>Put differently, most combinations of points on A and B don't matter, as they won't land us on the border of A ⊖ B. We only need to consider the case where they're in opposite directions. (There's some easy intuition for why this is the case: I'll leave that as an exercise)
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609123441.png" width="500">
</p><p>Alright, the stage has been set for GJK. The goal of the GJK algorithm is to find a simplex on A ⊖ B that contains the origin (or show that none exists), while doing as few operations as possible.
</p><p>Let's appreciate how incredible such an algorithm would be: given <em>any</em> convex shape, as long as it has some defined notion of support points, we can detect collisions. That's unbelievably powerful. 
</p><p>Here's how it works:
</p><p>1) First, find a point on A ⊖ B using a random direction <em>d</em>, which we'll call <em>p</em>. This is just S(<em>d</em>) - S(-<em>d</em>). It's the first point on our simplex.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240603135933.png" width="500">
</p><p>2) Then, let's take the dot product of <em>d</em> and <em>p</em>. If it's positive, we keep going on with the algorithm. If it's negative, that means <em>d</em> and <em>p</em> point in opposite directions. In that case, we terminate the algorithm, as there's no way for B and A to overlap.
</p><p>But why?
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240603151836.png" width="500">
</p><p>It's more clear when we rotate our view to be in line with <em>d</em>. Point <em>a</em> is S(<em>d</em>), and point <em>b</em> is S(-<em>d</em>). Now, point <em>a</em> is the "top" of shape A, and point <em>b</em> is the "bottom" of B. Remember that <em>p</em> = <em>a - b</em>. So, if we project <em>p</em> onto <em>d</em> by taking the dot product, and it's negative, a gap exists between A and B.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609131123.png" width="500">
</p><p>3) Ok, great. We've got one point of our simplex. Now, we need another. From our point <em>p</em>, let's shoot in the direction of the origin. Take the support of that vector <em>-d</em>, and run our check from step 2 on it.
</p><p>If you think about it, we're just finding the point most in the direction of the origin from <em>p</em>. If our shape encloses the origin, then our new point will have to be on the opposite side of it.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240610080829.png" width="500">
</p><p>Remember how we just performed the check from step 2? Well, there's another way to think about it. We're just checking to see if we've crossed the origin. If the origin is within our shape, we'll have to cross it when we take support points in opposite directions.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609152836.png" width="500">
</p><p>4) Now, we're ready to complete the simplex. Let's take the vector perpendicular to our first 2 points in the direction of the origin. The support of that vector is the 3rd point of our simplex.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609133818.png" width="500">
</p><p>I mean, think about it. We've effectively divided the space in half with our first line. We know the origin can't be anywhere on one side of our line, so we continue our search in the opposite direction. That's the efficiency of GJK: we'll keep dividing the space in half, until we find the point.
</p><p>Oh, and as usual, we can run our check from step 2 to see if we've proven that the shapes do not overlap.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609134721.png" width="500">
</p><p>5) Now, let's see if our simplex contains the origin. If it does, we return true. Otherwise, we continue on.
</p><p>To find if the origin is within our triangle, first, let's break down the area surrounding it into the three infinite regions depicted below.
</p><p>The overlapping red, green, and blue regions each divide the space in half: an inside region, and an outside region.
</p><p>We've already eliminated the possibility of the origin being in the red region. So, we just have to check whether it's outside either of the remaining 2 lines.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240610140613.png" width="500">
</p><p>Luckily, we already know how to do this. Just take the dot product perpendicular to a given line to see if the origin is beyond it. If so, we know it must be in the white region.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240610140732.png" width="500">
</p><p>6) Now, it's time to iterate. We repeat from step 4, this time from the line on our simplex closest to the origin. We update our simplex using this new support point, and check if the new simplex contains the origin, as we did in step 5. This time, it does! Our algorithm returns <em>true</em>. If it doesn't, we keep doing this iterative process until it does, or one of our checks fails.
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609142721.png" width="500">
</p><p><img src="https://computerwebsite.net/writing/images/Pasted%20image%2020240609143010.png" width="500">
</p><p>And, that's it. That's the essence of the GJK algorithm. 
</p><p>I've glossed over a few implementation details, but you now have all the intuition you need to develop an in-depth understanding.
</p><p>Personally, I find this algorithm pretty because it's such a tidy example of what makes mathematics so powerful. Through a bunch of subtle shifts in perspective, a complicated problem becomes obvious.
</p><p>There's probably a few things incorrect with what I said. So, take it with the appropriate amount of salt for a high school sophomore's explanation of anything math related.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong>: Take your science skills into the kitchen. Turn ordinary chocolate into an edible optics demo that shows how diffraction works.</p>



<p><strong>Supplies:</strong>&nbsp;Stove, double boiler, heat proof spatula, candy thermometer, diffraction sheets, silicon molds (optional), chocolate bars or melting chocolate</p>



<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> Diffraction is the bending of light. We do not need to look through a diffraction sheet to see the bending. Light can bounce off of fine grooved surfaces to show us how each wavelength of light refracts off of the surface.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>If using molds, cut the diffraction sheets into pieces the size of the bottom of the molds. Place the diffraction pieces, diffraction side up, in the bottom of the mold</li>



<li>Divide your chocolate into thirds, 2/3 are for melting, 1/3 is for the tempering</li>



<li>Different chocolates have different tempering temperature, these temperatures are critical for proper tempering</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Follow this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTi0tM4yQ8">video</a> (starting at minute 20 for chocolate) on how to temper chocolate and create the diffraction pieces</li>



<li>If using molds, chocolate can be poured into molds quite easily</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>How to run the demo:</strong> </p>



<ul>
<li>Pass out the chocolate and explain what they see.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Try this:</strong></p>



<p>Follow the instructions in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTi0tM4yQ8">video</a> (starting at minute 7:40) to make diffractive candy</p>

<p><strong>What’s Happening?</strong></p>



<p>White light can be separated into all seven major colors of the complete spectrum or rainbow by using a diffraction grating. The grating separates light into colors as the light passes through the many fine slits of the grating. Each color travels at a different speed and therefore has a different angle of refraction when it hits the grating. Chocolate makes a reflection gratings. Along with chocolate, a compact disc also makes a good reflection grating. When light passes through a grating it is called a transmission grating. A transmission grating is what is used to make the diffractive chocolate. Diffractive candy is a transmission grating.</p>

I also bought an Insta X4 360 camera which, while a far cry from Apple's immersive content in resolution, can still be a really nice way to relive memories.</p><p>More content: Last year I started 3d scanning (using Scaniverse) sculptures and other art / items that catch my eye during my travels. The AVP makes it really easy to import and place them in my environment. When I'm working I'll often place a favorite sculpture next to me for company &amp; as a reminder of a trip I took.</p><p>Finally, even after 4 months of use, it's still really fun and, from a tech perspective, astounding in terms of image quality, stability, 3D placement, integration in environment, etc. I love it and I can't wait for this tech to get better and better.</p></div></td></tr>

It is entirely possible (and quite easy) to download these UHD videos to a Mac, mount the folder containing the goon material on the Mac as a drive on the Vision Pro (local network drive), and stream the video to the AVP using a 3rd party 3d video player; Moonplayer is the pick of the bunch at the moment.</p><p>I must say the experience is pretty damn good.

But it would be entirely non-immersive because moving your upper body in any walk would immediately break the illusion.

                  <p>No, I returned it. Kinda regretted it, so I picked up a Meta Quest 3 to scratch the VR itch. I use it for watching youtube while I do dishes and laundry. Sometimes I play golf for relaxation or beat saber. I really wish there was an easy way to put the older 3d blu-ray movies on the device to watch movies, because immersive movies are really the next level for entertainment.</p>

                  <p>I like augmented reality stuff, 3d games and immersive videos. I can get all that stuff done on the Quest 3 for a 1/10th of the cost. It's good enough and has a larger ecosystem for games. And strangely, I think controllers are better in a lot of cases than hand tracking.</p>

                  <p>I hadnt been for a month or so (picked it up at launch), but the new beta release of Vision OS 2 looks feels like a massive quality of life improvement. Foveation and implied resolution seem to be massively improved, framerates are much higher too. The new Bora Bora (day + night) environment is fabulous and has moments of "am I actually there", the prior exisiting environments have all had a decent bump in apparent quality too. Apple are slow rolling content and experiences, but I can see this working out in the long run.
P.S. if anyone is still hung up on comfort, the "open face" headstraps do wonders, very much like wearing glasses.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago OpenAI released GPT-4o ushering in a new standard for multimodal, conversational experiences with sophisticated reasoning capabilities.</p>
<p>Several days later, my good friends at <a href="https://poly.ai/">PolyAI</a> announced their Series C fundraising round after tremendous growth in the usage of their enterprise voice assistant.</p>
<p>Amid this news, a former Alexa colleague messaged me: “You’d think voice assistants would have been our forte at Alexa.”</p>
<p>For context, I joined Alexa AI as a research scientist in early 2019. By this time, the Alexa consumer device had existed for 5 years and was already in 100M+ homes throughout the world. </p>
<p>In 2019, Alexa was experiencing a period of hypergrowth. Dozens of new teams sprouted every quarter, huge financial resources were invested, and senior leadership made it clear that Alexa was going to be one of Amazon’s big bets moving forward. </p>
<p>My team was born amidst all this with a simple charter: bring the latest and greatest in AI research into the Alexa product and ecosystem. I’ve often described our group (later dubbed the Conversational Modeling team) as Google Brain meets Alexa AI-SWAT team. </p>
<p>Over the course of the 2.5 years I was there, we grew from 2 to ~20 and tackled every part of the conversational systems stack. </p>
<p>We built the first LLMs for the organization (though back then we didn’t call them LLMs), we built knowledge grounded response generators (though we didn’t call it RAG), and we pioneered prototypes for what it would mean to make Alexa a multimodal agent in your home. </p>
<p>We had all the resources, talent, and momentum to become the unequivocal market leader in conversational AI. But most of that tech never saw the light of day and never received any noteworthy press. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The reality is Alexa AI was riddled with technical and bureaucratic problems.</p>
<h2>Bad Technical Process</h2>
<p>Alexa put a huge emphasis on protecting customer data with guardrails in place to prevent leakage and access. Definitely a crucial practice, but one consequence was that the internal infrastructure for developers was agonizingly painful to work with. </p>
<p>It would take weeks to get access to any internal data for analysis or experiments. Data was poorly annotated. Documentation was either nonexistent or stale. </p>
<p>Experiments had to be run in resource-limited compute environments. Imagine trying to train a transformer model when all you can get a hold of is CPUs. Unacceptable for a company sitting on one of the largest collections of accelerated hardware in the world. </p>
<p>I remember on one occasion our team did an analysis demonstrating that the annotation scheme for some subset of utterance data was completely wrong, leading to incorrect data labels. </p>
<p>That meant for months our internal annotation team had been mislabeling thousands of data points every single day. When we attempted to get the team to change their annotation taxonomy, we discovered it would require a herculean effort to get even the smallest thing modified. </p>
<p>We had to get the team’s PM onboard, then their manager’s buy-in, then submit a preliminary change request, then get that approved (a multi-month-long process end-to-end). </p>
<p>And most importantly, there was no immediate story for the team’s PM to make a promotion case through fixing this issue other than “it’s scientifically the right thing to do and could lead to better models for some other team.” No incentive meant no action taken.</p>
<p>Since that wasn’t our responsibility and the lift from our side wasn’t worth the effort, we closed that chapter and moved on. </p>
<p>For all I know, they could still be mislabeling those utterances to this day.</p>
<h2>Fragmented Org Structures</h2>
<p>Alexa’s org structure was decentralized by design meaning there were multiple small teams working on sometimes identical problems across geographic locales. </p>
<p>This introduced an almost Darwinian flavor to org dynamics where teams scrambled to get their work done to avoid getting reorged and subsumed into a competing team. </p>
<p>The consequence was an organization plagued by antagonistic mid-managers that had little interest in collaborating for the greater good of Alexa and only wanted to preserve their own fiefdoms. </p>
<p>My group by design was intended to span projects, whereby we found teams that aligned with our research/product interests and urged them to collaborate on ambitious efforts. The resistance and lack of action we encountered was soul-crushing. </p>
<p>I remember on one occasion we were coordinating a project to scale out the large transformers model training I had been leading. This was an ambitious effort which, if done correctly, could have been the genesis of an Amazon ChatGPT (well before ChatGPT was released). </p>
<p>Our Alexa team met with an internal cloud team which independently was initiating similar undertakings. While the goal was to find a way to collaborate on this training infrastructure, over the course of several weeks there were many half-baked promises made which never came to fruition. </p>
<p>At the end of it, our team did our own thing and the sister team did their own thing. Duplicated efforts due to no shared common ground. With no data, infrastructure, or lesson sharing, this inevitably hurt the quality of produced models.</p>
<p>As another example, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/alexa-skills/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=13727921011">Alexa skills ecosystem</a> was Alexa’s attempt to apply Amazonian decentralization to the dialogue problem. Have individual teams own individual skills.</p>
<p>But dialogue is not conducive to that degree of separation of concerns. How can you seamlessly hand off conversational context between skills? This means endowing the system with multi-turn memory (a long-standing dream of dialogue research). </p>
<p>The internal design of the skills ecosystem made achieving this infeasible because each skill acted like its own independent bot. It was conversational AI by an opinionated bot committee each with its own agenda. </p>
<h2>Product-Science Misalignment</h2>
<p>Alexa was viciously customer-focused which I believe is admirable and a principle every company should practice. Within Alexa, this meant that every engineering and science effort had to be aligned to some downstream product. </p>
<p>That did introduce tension for our team because we were supposed to be taking experimental bets for the platform’s future. These bets couldn’t be baked into product without hacks or shortcuts in the typical quarter as was the expectation. </p>
<p>So we had to constantly justify our existence to senior leadership and massage our projects with metrics that could be seen as more customer-facing. </p>
<p>For example, in one of our projects to build an open-domain chat system, the success metric (i.e. a single integer value representing overall conversational quality) imposed by senior leadership had no scientific grounding and was borderline impossible to achieve. </p>
<p>This introduced product/science conflict in every weekly meeting to track the project’s progress leading to manager churn every few months and an eventual sunsetting of the effort.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>As we look forward, in the battle for the future of the conversational AI market, I still believe it’s anyone’s game.</p>
<p>Today Alexa has sold 500M+ devices, which is a mind-boggling user data moat. But that alone is not enough. </p>
<p>Here’s how I would organize a dialogue systems effort from the ground-up:</p>
<p><strong>Invest in robust developer infrastructure especially around access to compute, data quality assurance, and streamlined data collection processes.</strong> Data and compute are the lifeblood of modern ML systems so proactively setting up this foundation is imperative.</p>
<p><strong>Make LLMs the fundamental building block of the dialogue flows.</strong> In retrospect, the Alexa skills ecosystem was a premature initiative for the abilities of conversational systems at the time. I liken it to when Leap Motion created and released a developer SDK before the underlying hardware device was stable. </p>
<p>But with the power of modern LLMs, I’m optimistic about redesigning a developer conversational toolkit with LLMs as their primitives. </p>
<p><strong>Ensure product timelines don’t dictate science research time frames.</strong> Because things are moving so fast in the AI world, it’s hard not to feel the pressure of shipping quickly. But there are still so many unsolved problems that will take time to solve. </p>
<p>Of course you should conduct research aggressively, but don’t have delivery cycles measured in quarters, as this will produce inferior systems to meet deadlines. </p>
<p>—</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about the future of multimodal conversational systems and interfaces, I would love to hear from you. We’ve got work to do!</p></div></div>]]></description>

Arjun and Zara here - cofounders of Overwatch (<a href="https://www.overwatchdata.ai/">https://www.overwatchdata.ai</a>), a platform to automate OSINT and threat intel, turning it into actionable insights.  Check out our clickthrough demo here: <a href="https://app.storylane.io/share/qyayvtamapis">https://app.storylane.io/share/qyayvtamapis</a>.</p><p>Overwatch began when we were working with risk and threat intel teams at Google, Stripe, and government. We experienced the immense challenge every fraud and cyber threat analyst faces: manually parsing through an ocean of data to find valuable insights and filter out the noise. This included using many of the feeds and tools out there that were often very expensive, noisy, keyword-based, and lacked accurate entity extraction or advanced query features.</p><p>Most threat intelligence tools utilize thousands of keywords and teams of analysts to manually sift through torrents of alerts. These alerts are usually individual posts on various platforms across news, social media, deep and dark web sources that have some matching keyword. This is full of false positives, requiring many hours to wade through to figure out what intel matters most to our users, why, and what they can do next.</p><p>Overwatch uses an alternative approach by layering AI agents and NLP techniques, including a combination of multifarious datasets, cluster analysis, topic modeling, Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RALM) and domain knowledgeable agents.</p><p>This allows us to (1) Filter through OSINT in real time to identify events and narratives that matter to our users, and write reports on what they could do about it; (2) Identify dark web and deep web threats, fraud methods, new tactics, and compromised accounts, stolen checks, and credentials affecting our users or their peers; (3) Send an alert any time one a 3rd party supplier or parts of the tech stack are impacted by a widely exploited vulnerability, ransomware attack, or breach; and (4) Track malware and ransomware groups that are actively targeting your industry including Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).</p><p>Our intelligence is actionable because the alert comes with the context and important details that an analyst needs to make an informed decision. Being AI-native, we also have a range of chat and data visualization features to effectively function as an intel co-pilot or industry expert. Finally, our in-house intelligence analysts and investigators can assist threat intelligence teams with HUMINT investigations and darkweb acquisition.</p><p>Our current customers include internet platforms, financial institutions, and supply chain companies. Within a day of one breach, one of our customers used Overwatch to surface 18,000+ leaked credentials. Another used us to surface fraudulent checks and learn exactly how threat actors were targeting their specific product features.</p><p>Our website says “Request a demo” but if you want to poke around on a very basic example of how we’re aggregating dark web, deep web, social, and surface web, log in at <a href="https://app.overwatchdata.io/" rel="nofollow">https://app.overwatchdata.io/</a> using these credentials:
  username: try_overwatch@overwatchdata.io 
  pw: HelloHNWorld</p><p>That login is for an un-personalized feed of cyber threat intel (breaches, vulnerabilities, ransomed organizations, and industry updates) that gives you a flavor of not just the kind of information from which we can collect, but more importantly, how our technology prioritizes, clusters, and summarizes alerts for cyber / fraud analysts. Try the chat agent on the left-hand side to parse through the data.</p><p>Or sign up for a longer trial and preview of our email alerts: <a href="https://xryl45u9uep.typeform.com/to/pvtZQyS0" rel="nofollow">https://xryl45u9uep.typeform.com/to/pvtZQyS0</a>. You can also check out our clickthrough demo for dark and deep web intelligence: <a href="https://app.storylane.io/share/qyayvtamapis">https://app.storylane.io/share/qyayvtamapis</a>.</p><p>Integration options range from simple dashboard access to our API for those who want to weave our intelligence directly into other products. Pricing is dependent on how complex a threat landscape our users want to monitor and we’re still figuring out how to standardize this but we’ll always do our best for the HN community.</p><p>Since the platform is AI-powered, it can also be used for news monitoring, supply chain disruptions, regulatory monitoring, or social media monitoring. We’ve had a lot of experience wrangling text-based feeds and using numerous AI-models (from embeddings, entity extractors, and LLMs) to filter, categorize, cluster, and analyze the data into meaning - so let us know if you’d like to nerd-out or have had any particular challenges. Looking forward to your feedback and questions! Thanks, HN!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>
