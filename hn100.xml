<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div data-theme="ivory"><p><em>Claude Sonnet 4.6 is our most capable Sonnet model yet</em>. It’s a full upgrade of the model’s skills across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, agent planning, knowledge work, and design. Sonnet 4.6 also features a 1M token context window in beta.</p><p>For those on our <a href="https://claude.com/pricing">Free and Pro plans</a>, Claude Sonnet 4.6 is now the default model in <a href="https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.eb925555-12ce-4891-9ead-87883b7fc06c">claude.ai</a> and <a href="https://claude.com/product/cowork">Claude Cowork</a>. <a href="https://claude.com/pricing#api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pricing</a> remains the same as Sonnet 4.5, starting at $3/$15 per million tokens.</p><p>Sonnet 4.6 brings much-improved coding skills to more of our users. Improvements in consistency, instruction following, and more have made developers with early access prefer Sonnet 4.6 to its predecessor by a wide margin. They often even prefer it to our smartest model from November 2025, Claude Opus 4.5.</p><p>Performance that would have previously required reaching for an Opus-class model—including on real-world, economically valuable <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/gdpval-aa">office tasks</a>—is now available with Sonnet 4.6. The model also shows a major improvement in computer use skills compared to prior Sonnet models.</p><p>As with every new Claude model, we’ve run <a href="https://anthropic.com/claude-sonnet-4-6-system-card">extensive safety evaluations</a> of Sonnet 4.6, which overall showed it to be as safe as, or safer than, our other recent Claude models. Our safety researchers concluded that Sonnet 4.6 has “a broadly warm, honest, prosocial, and at times funny character, very strong safety behaviors, and no signs of major concerns around high-stakes forms of misalignment.”</p><h2 id="computer-use">Computer use</h2><p>Almost every organization has software it can’t easily automate: specialized systems and tools built before modern interfaces like APIs existed. To have AI use such software, users would previously have had to build bespoke connectors. But a model that can use a computer the way a person does changes that equation.</p><p>In October 2024, we were the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use">first to introduce</a> a general-purpose computer-using model. At the time, we wrote that it was “still experimental—at times cumbersome and error-prone,” but we expected rapid improvement. <a href="https://os-world.github.io/">OSWorld</a>, the standard benchmark for AI computer use, shows how far our models have come. It presents hundreds of tasks across real software (Chrome, LibreOffice, VS Code, and more) running on a simulated computer. There are no special APIs or purpose-built connectors; the model sees the computer and interacts with it in much the same way a person would: clicking a (virtual) mouse and typing on a (virtual) keyboard.</p><p>Across sixteen months, our Sonnet models have made steady gains on OSWorld. The improvements can also be seen beyond benchmarks: early Sonnet 4.6 users are seeing human-level capability in tasks like navigating a complex spreadsheet or filling out a multi-step web form, before pulling it all together across multiple browser tabs.</p><p>The model certainly still lags behind the most skilled humans at using computers. But the rate of progress is remarkable nonetheless. It means that computer use is much more useful for a range of work tasks—and that substantially more capable models are within reach.</p><div><figure><img alt="Chart comparing several Sonnet model scores on the OSWorld benchmark" loading="lazy" width="3840" height="1948" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F1206645ef5a618dabce8587b472b21c67a30a0db-3840x1948.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F1206645ef5a618dabce8587b472b21c67a30a0db-3840x1948.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Scores prior to Claude Sonnet 4.5 were measured on the original OSWorld; scores from Sonnet 4.5 onward use OSWorld-Verified. OSWorld-Verified (released July 2025) is an in-place upgrade of the original OSWorld benchmark, with updates to task quality, evaluation grading, and infrastructure.</figcaption></figure></div><p>At the same time, computer use poses risks: malicious actors can attempt to hijack the model by hiding instructions on websites in what’s known as a prompt injection attack. We’ve been working to improve our models’ resistance to prompt injections—our <a href="https://anthropic.com/claude-sonnet-4-6-system-card">safety evaluations</a> show that Sonnet 4.6 is a major improvement compared to its predecessor, Sonnet 4.5, and performs similarly to Opus 4.6. You can find out more about how to mitigate prompt injections and other safety concerns in <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/mitigate-jailbreaks">our API docs</a>.</p><h2 id="evaluating-claude-sonnet-46">Evaluating Claude Sonnet 4.6</h2><p>Beyond computer use, Claude Sonnet 4.6 has improved on benchmarks across the board. It approaches Opus-level intelligence at a price point that makes it more practical for far more tasks. You can find a full discussion of Sonnet 4.6’s capabilities and its safety-related behaviors in <a href="https://anthropic.com/claude-sonnet-4-6-system-card">our system card</a>; a summary and comparison to other recent models is below.</p><div><figure><img alt="A table of popular benchmarks and Sonnet 4.6's relative performance compared to other frontier models" loading="lazy" width="2600" height="2960" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F10b2602771d21378cd6d76628a081c8a76dcf216-2600x2960.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F10b2602771d21378cd6d76628a081c8a76dcf216-2600x2960.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><p>In Claude Code, our early testing found that users preferred Sonnet 4.6 over Sonnet 4.5 roughly 70% of the time. Users reported that it more effectively read the context before modifying code and consolidated shared logic rather than duplicating it. This made it less frustrating to use over long sessions than earlier models.</p><p>Users even preferred Sonnet 4.6 to Opus 4.5, our frontier model from November, 59% of the time. They rated Sonnet 4.6 as significantly less prone to overengineering and “laziness,” and meaningfully better at instruction following. They reported fewer false claims of success, fewer hallucinations, and more consistent follow-through on multi-step tasks.</p><p>Sonnet 4.6’s 1M token context window is enough to hold entire codebases, lengthy contracts, or dozens of research papers in a single request. More importantly, Sonnet 4.6 <em>reasons effectively</em> across all that context. This can make it much better at long-horizon planning. We saw this particularly clearly in the <a href="https://andonlabs.com/evals/vending-bench-arena">Vending-Bench Arena</a> evaluation, which tests how well a model can run a (simulated) business over time—and which includes an element of competition, with different AI models facing off against each other to make the biggest profits.</p><p>Sonnet 4.6 developed an interesting new strategy: it invested heavily in capacity for the first ten simulated months, spending significantly more than its competitors, and then pivoted sharply to focus on profitability in the final stretch. The timing of this pivot helped it finish well ahead of the competition.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="3840" height="2160" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8c2855afe51fc0980596b5369b01b0b87eea7eaf-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8c2855afe51fc0980596b5369b01b0b87eea7eaf-3840x2160.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Sonnet 4.6 outperforms Sonnet 4.5 on Vending-Bench Arena by investing in capacity early, then pivoting to profitability in the final stretch.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Early customers also reported broad improvements, with frontend code and financial analysis standing out. Customers independently described visual outputs from Sonnet 4.6 as notably more polished, with better layouts, animations, and design sensibility than those from previous models.

                            You craft input that tricks an AI into ignoring its instructions. Like SQL injection, but for AI. Here, you're sending emails that convince Fiu to leak <code>secrets.env</code>.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                <div>
                            <p><strong>Fiu</strong> was the mascot of the <strong>Santiago 2023 Pan American Games</strong> in Chile 🇨🇱</p><p>
                            It's a <em>siete colores</em>, a small colorful bird native to Chile. The name comes from the sound it makes.</p><p>
                            Fiu became a national phenomenon. "Being small doesn't mean you can't give your best." Just like our AI here: small, helpful, maybe too trusting. 💨

                <div>
                        <p>
                            If it worked, Fiu will leak <code>secrets.env</code> contents in his response: API keys, tokens, etc. If not, Fiu won't reply to your email — it will just appear in the <a href="https://hackmyclaw.com/log">attack log</a>. It would be too expensive to make him reply to every email 😓
                        </p>

                <div>
                        <p>
                            Yes! Fiu has full technical ability to send emails — it's not a hard constraint. He's just been <em>told</em> (via prompt instructions) not to send anything without explicit confirmation from his owner. If your injection tricks him into replying anyway... well, that's the whole point 😉

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The 1.26 release of Go this month includes a completely rewritten go fix subcommand. Go fix uses a suite of algorithms to identify opportunities to improve your code, often by taking advantage of more modern features of the language and library. In this post, we’ll first show you how to use <code>go fix</code> to modernize your Go codebase. Then in the <a href="#go/analysis">second section</a> we’ll dive into the infrastructure behind it and how it is evolving. Finally, we’ll present the theme of <a href="#self-service">“self-service”</a> analysis tools to help module maintainers and organizations encode their own guidelines and best practices.</p>
<!-- see https://go.dev/blog/survey2025#challenges -->
<h2 id="running-go-fix">Running go fix</h2>
<p>The <code>go fix</code> command, like <code>go build</code> and <code>go vet</code>, accepts a set of patterns that denote packages. This command fixes all packages beneath the current directory:</p>
<pre><code>$ go fix ./...
</code></pre>
<p>On success, it silently updates your source files. It discards any fix that touches <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Generate_Go_files_by_processing_source" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">generated files</a> since the appropriate fix in that case is to the logic of the generator itself. We recommend running <code>go fix</code> over your project each time you update your build to a newer Go toolchain release. Since the command may fix hundreds of files, start from a clean git state so that the change consists only of edits from go fix; your code reviewers will thank you.</p>
<p>To preview the changes the above command would have made, use the <code>-diff</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code>$ go fix -diff ./...
--- dir/file.go (old)
+++ dir/file.go (new)
-                       eq := strings.IndexByte(pair, '=')
-                       result[pair[:eq]] = pair[1+eq:]
+                       before, after, _ := strings.Cut(pair, "=")
+                       result[before] = after
…
</code></pre>
<p>You can list the available fixers by running this command:</p>
<pre><code>$ go tool fix help
…
Registered analyzers:
    any          replace interface{} with any
    buildtag     check //go:build and // +build directives
    fmtappendf   replace []byte(fmt.Sprintf) with fmt.Appendf
    forvar       remove redundant re-declaration of loop variables
    hostport     check format of addresses passed to net.Dial
    inline       apply fixes based on 'go:fix inline' comment directives
    mapsloop     replace explicit loops over maps with calls to maps package
    minmax       replace if/else statements with calls to min or max
…
</code></pre>
<p>Adding the name of a particular analyzer shows its complete documentation:</p>
<pre><code>$ go tool fix help forvar

forvar: remove redundant re-declaration of loop variables

The forvar analyzer removes unnecessary shadowing of loop variables.
Before Go 1.22, it was common to write `for _, x := range s { x := x ... }`
to create a fresh variable for each iteration. Go 1.22 changed the semantics
of `for` loops, making this pattern redundant. This analyzer removes the
unnecessary `x := x` statement.

This fix only applies to `range` loops.
</code></pre>
<p>By default, the <code>go fix</code> command runs all analyzers. When fixing a large project it may reduce the burden of code review if you apply fixes from the most prolific analyzers as separate code changes. To enable only specific analyzers, use the flags matching their names. For example, to run just the <code>any</code> fixer, specify the <code>-any</code> flag. Conversely, to run all the analyzers <em>except</em> selected ones, negate the flags, for instance <code>-any=false</code>.</p>
<p>As with <code>go build</code> and <code>go vet</code>, each run of the <code>go fix</code> command analyzes only a specific build configuration. If your project makes heavy use of files tagged for different CPUs or platforms, you may wish to run the command more than once with different values of <code>GOARCH</code> and <code>GOOS</code> for better coverage:</p>
<pre><code>$ GOOS=linux   GOARCH=amd64 go fix ./...
$ GOOS=darwin  GOARCH=arm64 go fix ./...
$ GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go fix ./...
</code></pre>
<p>Running the command more than once also provides opportunities for synergistic fixes, as we’ll see below.</p>
<h3 id="modernizers">Modernizers</h3>
<p>The introduction of <a href="https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics">generics</a> in Go 1.18 marked the end of an era of very few changes to the language spec and the start of a period of more rapid—though still careful—change, especially in the libraries. Many of the trivial loops that Go programmers routinely write, such as to gather the keys of a map into a slice, can now be conveniently expressed as a call to a generic function such as <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/maps#Keys" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>maps.Keys</code></a>. Consequently these new features create many opportunities to simplify existing code.</p>
<p>In December 2024, during the frenzied adoption of LLM coding assistants, we became aware that such tools tended—unsurprisingly—to produce Go code in a style similar to the mass of Go code used during training, even when there were newer, better ways to express the same idea. Less obviously, the same tools often refused to use the newer ways even when directed to do so in general terms such as “always use the latest idioms of Go 1.25.” In some cases, even when explicitly told to use a feature, the model would deny that it existed. (See my 2025 GopherCon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VePjjjV9JU&amp;t=3m50s" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">talk</a> for more exasperating details.) To ensure that future models are trained on the latest idioms, we need to ensure that these idioms are reflected in the training data, which is to say the global corpus of open-source Go code.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we have built <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/modernize" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">dozens of analyzers</a> to identify opportunities for modernization. Here are three examples of the fixes they suggest:</p>
<p><strong>minmax</strong> replaces an <code>if</code> statement by a use of Go 1.21’s <code>min</code> or <code>max</code> functions:</p>
<div>
<pre>x := f()
if x &lt; 0 {
    x = 0
}
if x &gt; 100 {
    x = 100
}
</pre>

<pre>x := min(max(f(), 0), 100)
</pre>
</div>
<p><strong>rangeint</strong> replaces a 3-clause <code>for</code> loop by a Go 1.22 <code>range</code>-over-int loop:</p>
<div>
<pre>for i := 0; i &lt; n; i++ {
    f()
}
</pre>

<pre>for range n {
    f()
}
</pre>
</div>
<p><strong>stringscut</strong> (whose <code>-diff</code> output we saw earlier) replaces uses of <code>strings.Index</code> and slicing by Go 1.18’s <code>strings.Cut</code>:</p>
<div>
<pre>i := strings.Index(s, ":")
if i &gt;= 0 {
     return s[:i]
}
</pre>

<pre>before, _, ok := strings.Cut(s, ":")
if ok {
    return before
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>These modernizers are included in <a href="https://go.dev/gopls">gopls</a>, to provide instant feedback as you type, and in <code>go fix</code>, so that you can modernize several entire packages at once in a single command. In addition to making code clearer, modernizers may help Go programmers learn about newer features. As part of the process of approving each new change to the language and standard library, the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/README.md" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">proposal</a> review group now considers whether it should be accompanied by a modernizer. We expect to add more modernizers with each release.</p>
<h2 id="example-a-modernizer-for-go-126s-newexpr">Example: a modernizer for Go 1.26’s new(expr)</h2>
<p>Go 1.26 includes a small but widely useful change to the language specification. The built-in <code>new</code> function creates a new variable and returns its address. Historically, its sole argument was required to be a type, such as <code>new(string)</code>, and the new variable was initialized to its “zero” value, such as <code>""</code>. In Go 1.26, the <code>new</code> function may be called with any value, causing it to create a variable initialized to that value, avoiding the need for an additional statement. For example:</p>
<div>
<pre>ptr := new(string)
*ptr = "go1.25"
</pre>

<pre>ptr := new("go1.26")
</pre>
</div>
<p>This feature filled a gap that had been discussed for over a decade and resolved one of the most popular <a href="https://go.dev/issue/45624">proposals</a> for a change to the language. It is especially convenient in code that uses a pointer type <code>*T</code> to indicate an optional value of type <code>T</code>, as is common when working with serialization packages such as <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Marshal" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">json.Marshal</a> or <a href="https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/gotutorial/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">protocol buffers</a>. This is such a common pattern that people often capture it in a helper, such as the <code>newInt</code> function below, saving the caller from the need to break out of an expression context to introduce additional statements:</p>
<pre><code>type RequestJSON struct {
    URL      string
    Attempts *int  // (optional)
}

data, err := json.Marshal(&amp;RequestJSON{
    URL:      url,
    Attempts: newInt(10),
})

func newInt(x int) *int { return &amp;x }
</code></pre>
<p>Helpers such as <code>newInt</code> are so frequently needed with protocol buffers that the <code>proto</code> API itself provides them as <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/proto#Int64" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>proto.Int64</code></a>, <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/proto#String" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>proto.String</code></a>, and so on. But Go 1.26 makes all these helpers unnecessary:</p>
<pre><code>data, err := json.Marshal(&amp;RequestJSON{
    URL:      url,
    Attempts: new(10),
})
</code></pre>
<p>To help you take advantage of this feature, the <code>go fix</code> command now includes a fixer, <a href="https://tip.golang.org/src/cmd/vendor/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/modernize/newexpr.go" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">newexpr</a>, that recognizes “new-like” functions such as <code>newInt</code> and suggests fixes to replace the function body with <code>return new(x)</code> and to replace every call, whether in the same package or an importing package, with a direct use of <code>new(expr)</code>.</p>
<p>To avoid introducing premature uses of new features, modernizers offer fixes only in files that require at least the minimum appropriate version of Go (1.26 in this instance), either through a <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#versions"><code>go 1.26</code> directive</a> in the enclosing go.mod file or a <code>//go:build go1.26</code> <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Build_constraints" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">build constraint</a> in the file itself.</p>
<p>Run this command to update all calls of this form in your source tree:</p>
<pre><code>$ go fix -newexpr ./...
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, with luck, all of your <code>newInt</code>-like helper functions will have become unused and may be safely deleted (assuming they aren’t part of a stable published API). A few calls may remain where it would be unsafe to suggest a fix, such as when the name <code>new</code> is locally shadowed by another declaration. You can also use the <a href="https://go.dev/blog/deadcode">deadcode</a> command to help identify unused functions.</p>
<h2 id="synergistic-fixes">Synergistic fixes</h2>
<p>Applying one modernization may create opportunities to apply another. For example, this snippet of code, which clamps <code>x</code> to the range 0–100, causes the minmax modernizer to suggest a fix to use <code>max</code>. Once that fix is applied it suggests a second fix, this time to use <code>min</code>.</p>
<div>
<pre>x := f()
if x &lt; 0 {
    x = 0
}
if x &gt; 100 {
    x = 100
}
</pre>

<pre>x := min(max(f(), 0), 100)
</pre>
</div>
<p>Synergies may also occur between different analyzers. For example, a common mistake is to repeatedly concatenate strings within a loop, resulting in quadratic time complexity—a bug and a potential vector for a denial-of-service attack. The <code>stringsbuilder</code> modernizer recognizes the problem and suggests using Go 1.10’s <code>strings.Builder</code>:</p>
<div>
<pre>s := ""
for _, b := range bytes {
    s += fmt.Sprintf("%02x", b)
}
use(s)
</pre>

<pre>var s strings.Builder
for _, b := range bytes {
    s.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf("%02x", b))
}
use(s.String())
</pre>
</div>
<p>Once this fix is applied, a second analyzer may recognize that the <code>WriteString</code> and <code>Sprintf</code> operations can be combined as <code>fmt.Fprintf(&amp;s, "%02x", b)</code>, which is both cleaner and more efficient, and offer a second fix. (This second analyzer is <a href="https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks#QF1012" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">QF1012</a> from Dominik Honnef’s <a href="https://staticcheck.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">staticcheck</a>, which is already enabled in gopls but not yet in <code>go fix</code>, though we <a href="https://go.dev/issue/76918">plan</a> to add staticcheck analyzers to the go command starting in Go 1.27.)</p>
<p>Consequently, it may be worth running <code>go fix</code> more than once until it reaches a fixed point; twice is usually enough.</p>
<!-- Aside: The reason the tool does not apply the fixed point iteration itself is that (a) despite our efforts there is a non-zero chance that the transformation breaks the build, preventing most analyzers (those not marked RunDespiteErrors) from running on the second pass, and (b) the transformations in the first round of fixes may add imports for packages whose type information is not available, requiring the “build” to be restarted, which is impossible in many drivers such as Blaze, nogo, Tricorder, etc. Fundamentally this is a consequence of the analysis framework being designed like a distributed build (batch, coarse-grained, distributed pure function) not like an IDE (interactive fine-grained local mutations). -->
<h3 id="merging-fixes-and-conflicts">Merging fixes and conflicts</h3>
<p>A single run of <code>go fix</code> may apply dozens of fixes within the same source file. All fixes are conceptually independent, analogous to a set of git commits with the same parent. The <code>go fix</code> command uses a simple three-way merge algorithm to reconcile the fixes in sequence, analogous to the task of merging a set of git commits that edit the same file. If a fix conflicts with the list of edits accumulated so far, it is discarded, and the tool issues a warning that some fixes were skipped and that the tool should be run again.</p>
<p>This reliably detects <em>syntactic</em> conflicts arising from overlapping edits, but another class of conflict is possible: a <em>semantic</em> conflict occurs when two changes are textually independent but their meanings are incompatible. As an example consider two fixes that each remove the second-to-last use of a local variable: each fix is fine by itself, but when both are applied together the local variable becomes unused, and in Go that’s a compilation error. Neither fix is responsible for removing the variable declaration, but someone has to do it, and that someone is the user of <code>go fix</code>.</p>
<p>A similar semantic conflict arises when a set of fixes causes an import to become unused. Because this case is so common, the <code>go fix</code> command applies a final pass to detect unused imports and remove them automatically.</p>
<p>Semantic conflicts are relatively rare. Fortunately they usually reveal themselves as compilation errors, making them impossible to overlook. Unfortunately, when they happen, they do demand some manual work after running <code>go fix</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s now delve into the infrastructure beneath these tools.</p>

<h2 id="the-go-analysis-framework">The Go analysis framework</h2>
<p>Since the earliest days of Go, the <code>go</code> command has had two subcommands for static analysis, <code>go vet</code> and <code>go fix</code>, each with its own suite of algorithms: “checkers” and “fixers”. A checker reports likely mistakes in your code, such as passing a string instead of an integer as the operand of a <code>fmt.Printf("%d")</code> conversion. A fixer safely edits your code to fix a bug or to express the same thing in a better way, perhaps more clearly, concisely, or efficiently. Sometimes the same algorithm appears in both suites when it can both report a mistake and safely fix it.</p>
<p>In 2017 we redesigned the then-monolithic <code>go vet</code> program to separate the checker algorithms (now called “analyzers”) from the “driver”, the program that runs them; the result was the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Go analysis framework</a>. This separation enables an analyzer to be written once then run in a diverse range of drivers for different environments, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/unitchecker" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">unitchecker</a>, which turns a suite of analyzers into a subcommand that can be run by the go command’s scalable incremental build system, analogous to a compiler in go build. This is the basis of <code>go fix</code> and <code>go vet</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_go/blob/master/go/nogo.rst" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">nogo</a>, the analogous driver for alternative build systems such as Bazel and Blaze.</li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/singlechecker" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">singlechecker</a>, which turns an analyzer into a standalone command that loads, parses, and type-checks a set of packages (perhaps a whole program) and then analyzes them. We often use it for ad hoc experiments and measurements over the module mirror (<a href="https://proxy.golang.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">proxy.golang.org</a>) corpus.</li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/multichecker" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">multichecker</a>, which does the same thing for a suite of analyzers with a ‘swiss-army knife’ CLI.</li>
<li><a href="https://go.dev/gopls">gopls</a>, the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">language server</a> behind VS Code and other editors, which provides real-time diagnostics from analyzers after each editor keystroke.</li>
<li>the highly configurable driver used by the <a href="https://staticcheck.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">staticcheck</a> tool. (Staticcheck also provides a large suite of analyzers that can be run in other drivers.)</li>
<li><a href="https://research.google/pubs/tricorder-building-a-program-analysis-ecosystem/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Tricorder</a>, the batch static analysis pipeline used by Google’s monorepo and integrated with its code review system.</li>
<li>gopls’ <a href="https://go.dev/gopls/features/mcp">MCP server</a>, which makes diagnostics available to LLM-based coding agents, providing more robust “guardrails”.</li>
<li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/analysistest" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">analysistest</a>, the analysis framework’s test harness.</li>
</ul>
<p>One benefit of the framework is its ability to express helper analyzers that don’t report diagnostics or suggest fixes of their own but instead compute some intermediate data structure that may be useful to many other analyzers, amortizing the costs of its construction. Examples include <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/ctrlflow" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">control-flow graphs</a>, the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/buildssa" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">SSA representation</a> of function bodies, and data structures for <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/inspect" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">optimized AST navigation</a>.</p>
<p>Another benefit of the framework is its support for making deductions across packages. An analyzer can attach a “<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis#hdr-Modular_analysis_with_Facts" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">fact</a>” to a function or other symbol so that information learned while analyzing the function’s body can be used when later analyzing a call to the function, even if the call appears in another package or the later analysis occurs in a different process. This makes it easy to define scalable interprocedural analyses. For example, the printf checker can tell when a function such as <code>log.Printf</code> is really just a wrapper around <code>fmt.Printf</code>, so it knows that calls to <code>log.Printf</code> should be checked in a similar manner. This process works by induction, so the tool will also check calls to further wrappers around <code>log.Printf</code>, and so on. An example of an analyzer that makes heavy use of facts is <a href="https://github.com/uber-go/nilaway" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Uber’s nilaway</a>, which reports potential mistakes resulting in nil pointer dereferences.</p>
<p><img src="https://go.dev/blog/gofix-analysis-facts.svg"></p><p>The process of “separate analysis” in <code>go fix</code>  is analogous to the process of separate compilation in <code>go build</code>. Just as the compiler builds packages starting from the bottom of the dependency graph and passing type information up to importing packages, the analysis framework works from the bottom of the dependency graph up, passing facts (and types) up to importing packages.</p>
<p>In 2019, as we started developing <a href="https://go.dev/gopls">gopls</a>, the language server for Go, we added the ability for an analyzer to suggest a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis#SuggestedFix" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">fix</a> when reporting a diagnostic. The printf analyzer, for example, offers to replace <code>fmt.Printf(msg)</code> with <code>fmt.Printf("%s", msg)</code> to avoid misformatting should the dynamic <code>msg</code> value contain a <code>%</code> symbol. This mechanism has become the basis for many of the quick fixes and refactoring features of gopls.</p>
<p>While all these developments were happening to <code>go vet</code>, <code>go fix</code> remained stuck as it was back before the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">Go compatibility promise</a>, when early adopters of Go used it to maintain their code during the rapid and sometimes incompatible evolution of the language and libraries.</p>
<p>The Go 1.26 release brings the Go analysis framework to <code>go fix</code>. The <code>go vet</code> and <code>go fix</code> commands have converged and are now almost identical in implementation. The only differences between them are the criteria for the suites of algorithms they use, and what they do with computed diagnostics. Go <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.26rc1:src/cmd/vet/main.go;l=62" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">vet analyzers</a> must detect likely mistakes with low false positives; their diagnostics are reported to the user. Go <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.26rc1:src/cmd/fix/main.go;l=46" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">fix analyzers</a> must generate fixes that are safe to apply without regression in correctness, performance, or style; their diagnostics may not be reported, but the fixes are directly applied. Aside from this difference of emphasis, the task of developing a fixer is no different from that of developing a checker.</p>
<h3 id="improving-analysis-infrastructure">Improving analysis infrastructure</h3>
<p>As the number of analyzers in <code>go vet</code> and <code>go fix</code> continues to grow, we have been investing in infrastructure both to improve the performance of each analyzer and to make it easier to write each new analyzer.</p>
<p>For example, most analyzers start by traversing the syntax trees of each file in the package looking for a particular kind of node such as a range statement or function literal. The existing <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/ast/inspector" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">inspector</a> package makes this scan efficient by pre-computing a compact index of a complete traversal so that later traversals can quickly skip subtrees that don’t contain any nodes of interest. Recently we extended it with the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/ast/inspector#Cursor" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Cursor</a> datatype to allow flexible and efficient navigation between nodes in all four cardinal directions—up, down, left, and right, similar to navigating the elements of an HTML DOM—making it easy and efficient to express a query such as “find each go statement that is the first statement of a loop body”:</p>
<pre><code>    var curFile inspector.Cursor = ...

    // Find each go statement that is the first statement of a loop body.
    for curGo := range curFile.Preorder((*ast.GoStmt)(nil)) {
        kind, index := curGo.ParentEdge()
        if kind == edge.BlockStmt_List &amp;&amp; index == 0 {
            switch curGo.Parent().ParentEdgeKind() {
            case edge.ForStmt_Body, edge.RangeStmt_Body:
                ...
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Many analyzers start by searching for calls to a specific function, such as <code>fmt.Printf</code>. Function calls are among the most numerous expressions in Go code, so rather than search every call expression and test whether it is a call to <code>fmt.Printf</code>, it is much more efficient to pre-compute an index of symbol references, which is done by <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/internal/typesinternal/typeindex" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">typeindex</a> and its <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools@v0.41.0/internal/analysis/typeindex" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">helper</a> analyzer. Then the calls to <code>fmt.Printf</code> can be enumerated directly, making the cost proportional to the number of calls instead of to the size of the package. For an analyzer such as <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/hostport" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">hostport</a> that seeks an infrequently used symbol (<code>net.Dial</code>), this can easily make it <a href="https://go.dev/cl/657958">1,000× faster</a>.</p>
<p>Some other infrastructural improvements over the past year include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>dependency graph of the standard library</strong> that analyzers can consult to avoid introducing import cycles. For example, we can’t introduce a call to <code>strings.Cut</code> in a package that is itself imported by <code>strings</code>.</li>
<li>support for <strong>querying the effective Go version</strong> of a file as determined by the enclosing go.mod file and build tags, so that analyzers don’t insert uses of features that are “too new”.</li>
<li>a richer <strong>library of refactoring primitives</strong> (e.g. “delete this statement”) that correctly handle adjacent comments and other tricky edge cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have come a long way, but there remains much to do. Fixer logic can be tricky to get right. Since we expect users to apply hundreds of suggested fixes with only cursory review, it’s critical that fixers are correct even in obscure edge cases. As just one example (see my GopherCon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VePjjjV9JU&amp;t=13m17s" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">talk</a> for several more), we built a modernizer that replaces calls such as <code>append([]string{}, slice...)</code> by the clearer <code>slices.Clone(slice)</code> only to discover that, when <code>slice</code> is empty, the result of Clone is nil, a subtle behavior change that in rare cases can cause bugs; so we had to exclude <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/modernize#hdr-Analyzer_appendclipped" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">that modernizer</a> from the <code>go fix</code> suite.</p>
<p>Some of these difficulties for authors of analyzers can be ameliorated with better documentation (both for humans and LLMs), particularly checklists of surprising edge cases to consider and test. A pattern-matching engine for syntax trees, similar to those in <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/honnef.co/go/tools/pattern" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">staticcheck</a> and <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers/queries/index.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Tree Sitter</a>, could simplify the fiddly task of efficiently identifying the locations that need fixing. A richer library of operators for computing accurate fixes would help avoid common mistakes. A better test harness would let us check that fixes don’t break the build, and preserve dynamic properties of the target code. These are all on our roadmap.</p>

<h2 id="the-self-service-paradigm">The “self-service” paradigm</h2>
<p>More fundamentally, we are turning our attention in 2026 to a “self-service” paradigm.</p>
<p>The <code>newexpr</code> analyzer we saw earlier is a typical modernizer: a bespoke algorithm tailored to a particular feature. The bespoke model works well for features of the language and standard library, but it doesn’t really help update uses of third-party packages. Although there’s nothing to stop you from writing a modernizer for your own public APIs and running it on your own project, there’s no automatic way to get users of your API to run it too. Your modernizer probably wouldn’t belong in gopls or the <code>go vet</code> suite unless your API is particularly widely used across the Go ecosystem. Even in that case you would have to obtain code reviews and approvals and then wait for the next release.</p>
<p>Under the self-service paradigm, Go programmers would be able to define modernizations for their own APIs that their users can apply without all the bottlenecks of the current centralized paradigm. This is especially important as the Go community and global Go corpus are growing much faster than the ability of our team to review analyzer contributions.</p>
<p>The <code>go fix</code> command in Go 1.26 includes a preview of the first fruits of this new paradigm: the <strong>annotation-driven source-level inliner</strong>, which we’ll describe in an upcoming companion blog post next week. In the coming year, we plan to investigate two more approaches within this paradigm.</p>
<!-- TODO(adonovan): update the reference above when this post is ready: [//go:fix inline and source-level inliner](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16n29TcxMnZoEZtIo8BZcz6PSnh2dakWLSaa6UkROIEQ/edit?resourcekey=0-8QYiy7RDd2QbVAgKDOycoQ) -->
<p>First, we will be exploring the possibility of <a href="https://go.dev/issue/59869">dynamically loading</a> modernizers from the source tree and securely executing them, either in gopls or <code>go fix</code>. In this approach a package that provides an API for, say, a SQL database could additionally provide a checker for misuses of the API, such as SQL injection vulnerabilities or failure to handle critical errors. The same mechanism could be used by project maintainers to encode internal housekeeping rules, such as avoiding calls to certain problematic functions or enforcing stronger coding disciplines in critical parts of the code.</p>
<p>Second, many existing checkers can be informally described as “don’t forget to X after you Y!”, such as “close the file after you open it”, “cancel the context after you create it”, “unlock the mutex after you lock it”, “break out of the iterator loop after yield returns false”, and so on. What such checkers have in common is that they enforce certain invariants on all execution paths. We plan to explore generalizations and unifications of these control-flow checkers so that Go programmers can easily apply them to new domains, without complex analytical logic, simply by annotating their own code.</p>
<p>We hope that these new tools will save you effort during maintenance of your Go projects and help you learn about and benefit from newer features sooner. Please try out <code>go fix</code> on your projects and <a href="https://go.dev/issue/new">report</a> any problems you find, and do share any ideas you have for new modernizers, fixers, checkers, or self-service approaches to static analysis.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>opinion</span> Just as the community adopted the term "hallucination" to describe additive errors, we must now codify its far more insidious counterpart: semantic ablation.</p>
<p>Semantic ablation is the algorithmic erosion of high-entropy information. Technically, it is not a "bug" but a structural byproduct of greedy decoding and RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback).</p>
<p>During "refinement," the model gravitates toward the center of the Gaussian distribution, discarding "tail" data – the rare, precise, and complex tokens – to maximize statistical probability. Developers have exacerbated this through aggressive "safety" and "helpfulness" tuning, which deliberately penalizes unconventional linguistic friction. It is a silent, unauthorized amputation of intent, where the pursuit of low-perplexity output results in the total destruction of unique signal.</p>

    

<p>When an author uses AI for "polishing" a draft, they are not seeing improvement; they are witnessing semantic ablation. The AI identifies high-entropy clusters – the precise points where unique insights and "blood" reside – and systematically replaces them with the most probable, generic token sequences. What began as a jagged, precise Romanesque structure of stone is eroded into a polished, Baroque plastic shell: it looks "clean" to the casual eye, but its structural integrity – its "ciccia" – has been ablated to favor a hollow, frictionless aesthetic.</p>

        


        

<p>We can measure semantic ablation through entropy decay. By running a text through successive AI "refinement" loops, the vocabulary diversity (type-token ratio) collapses. The process performs a systematic lobotomy across three distinct stages:</p>
<p>Stage 1: Metaphoric cleansing. The AI identifies unconventional metaphors or visceral imagery as "noise" because they deviate from the training set's mean. It replaces them with dead, safe clichés, stripping the text of its emotional and sensory "friction."</p>

        

<p>Stage 2: Lexical flattening. Domain-specific jargon and high-precision technical terms are sacrificed for "accessibility." The model performs a statistical substitution, replacing a 1-of-10,000 token with a 1-of-100 synonym, effectively diluting the semantic density and specific gravity of the argument.</p>
<p>Stage 3: Structural collapse. The logical flow – originally built on complex, non-linear reasoning – is forced into a predictable, low-perplexity template. Subtext and nuance are ablated to ensure the output satisfies a "standardized" readability score, leaving behind a syntactically perfect but intellectually void shell.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/21/ai_wins_imitation_game_readers/">AI does a better job of ripping off the style of famous authors than MFA students do</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/07/ai_can_write_improved_code_research/">AI can improve on code it writes, but you have to know how to ask</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/23/developers_genai_little_productivity_gains/">AI coding hype overblown, Bain shrugs</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/ai_code_bugs/">AI-authored code contains worse bugs than software crafted by humans</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The result is a "JPEG of thought" – visually coherent but stripped of its original data density through semantic ablation.</p>
<p>If "hallucination" describes the AI seeing what isn't there, semantic ablation describes the AI destroying what is. We are witnessing a civilizational "race to the middle," where the complexity of human thought is sacrificed on the altar of algorithmic smoothness. By accepting these ablated outputs, we are not just simplifying communication; we are building a world on a hollowed-out syntax that has suffered semantic ablation. If we don't start naming the rot, we will soon forget what substance even looks like. ®</p>

They are routinely sidelined in favor of voices whose concern for market discipline ends where Wall Street’s balance sheet begins.</p><p><em><strong>Where I’m going with this</strong></em></p><p>I’m taking Cass’s and Baker’s arguments in a more “developmental state” direction, with pensions being the biggest target. Three claims:</p><p><span>First, the capital that energy, infrastructure, and housing buildouts need already exists: </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025/2024-annual-survey-public-pensions.html" rel="">$6 trillion in public pension funds</a><span>, with liability profiles that match 30-year transmission lines and 40-year nuclear plants almost perfectly.</span></p><p>Second, that capital is trapped in an institutional arrangement that charges enormous fees to match the performance of a simple index fund, while the money deployed through these intermediaries actively harms the communities pensioners live in: buying up their housing, closing their hospitals, bankrupting their local employers, gutting their newspapers.</p><p>Third, redirecting this capital doesn’t require new government spending or new financial structures. It requires breaking the equilibrium that one side of the debate defends (Summers) in favor of the other (Baker, or further still, the developmental-state economists in China, Singapore, and Japan). And it requires conditioning any future public rescues on actual structural reform.</p><p>We want to start with the data, because the data are damning.</p><p><span>The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College ran a straightforward comparison: how did actual public pension returns stack up against a simple 60/40 portfolio of stock and bond index funds, the kind any individual investor could assemble in a Vanguard account for nearly zero cost? </span><a href="https://crr.bc.edu/how-do-public-pension-plan-returns-compare-to-simple-index-investing/" rel="">The answer: roughly the same. Public pensions earned about 6.1% annually. The 60/40 benchmark earned about 6.1% annually.</a><span> The entire apparatus of consultants and alternative managers produced no excess return.</span></p><p><span>It gets worse. Pensions performed better than the benchmark before the 2008 financial crisis and worse afterward, precisely as they ramped up allocations to hedge funds, private equity, and other “alternatives.” </span><a href="https://richardmennis.com/blog/endowments-in-the-casino-even-the-whales-lose-at-the-alts-table" rel="">Richard Ennis has documented a negative alpha of approximately 1.2% per year since 2008</a><span>, virtually all of it associated with alternative investments. Reason Foundation found that 84% of public pension funds failed to beat a passive 60/40 portfolio over the past 20 years. The median plan trails the benchmark by 1-2% annually over 15- and 20-year horizons.</span></p><p>Cass documents the same pattern from the other end of the transaction: private equity is now underperforming a simple S&amp;P 500 index fund across three-month, one-year, three-year, five-year, and ten-year horizons.</p><p>The fee structures explain why. For a large pension fund with 30-40% in alternatives, total portfolio costs exceed 1% annually, versus roughly 5 basis points for an indexed strategy. The most expensive slice is private equity, where Ennis estimates total costs of 6%+ annually. On $6 trillion in assets, 1% is $60 billion per year. Over a decade, half a trillion dollars. Over 30 years, more than a trillion.</p><p>CalPERS, the nation’s largest public pension, exited hedge funds in 2014, citing “high costs and weak performance.” Their hedge fund portfolio had generated 4.8% annually over a decade, trailing the hedge fund industry’s own benchmark by roughly a fifth. Then, by 2024, CalPERS announced plans to increase private market investments by $30 billion. The cycle repeats because nothing about the incentive structure has changed.</p><p>The tens of billions in annual fee waste is actually the smaller problem.</p><p>The larger problem is what pension capital is and what it’s being used for. Pension capital is money that will not be needed for 20 to 40 years. By its nature, it is the most patient capital in the American economy, longer in duration than venture capital (5-7 year exit targets), longer than private equity (similar horizon despite the “long-term” branding). Pension funds should be the natural financiers of the long-duration assets this publication covers: transmission lines, nuclear plants, housing bonds, grid infrastructure.</p><p>Instead, pension funds hand their capital to intermediaries who invest it on shorter time horizons and charge 6% annually. The assets that need patient capital, grid, nuclear, housing, defense-industrial capacity, can’t find it. And the intermediaries collect fees regardless.</p><p>We’ve solved this kind of problem before.</p><p>What we are describing is not novel. It is approximately what American public pensions did for four decades before the alternatives revolution.</p><p><span>From roughly 1920 to 1960, legal restrictions confined pension investments to government securities, primarily municipal and state bonds. Michael Glass and Sean Vanatta call this </span><a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/798740/figure/fig03" rel="">“fiscal mutualism.”</a><span> At the system’s peak in 1942, public pension portfolios held 73% of their assets in state and local bonds. New York Comptroller Morris Tremaine invested pension funds in municipal bonds explicitly “to assist local governments in procuring funds for improvements at fair interest rates.” The bonds paid market rates. This was not a subsidy. But the closed loop aligned the interests of pensioners, taxpayers, and local governments in a way the current system does not. A retired firefighter’s savings backed the fire station. There were essentially no intermediary fees.</span></p><p><span>The mechanism generated what Glass and Vanatta describe as a </span><a href="https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/222115/" rel="">“virtuous cycle.”</a><span> Public employees contributed wages to the pension fund. The fund bought municipal and school district bonds. The captive demand suppressed borrowing costs, allowing localities to build schools, roads, and sewers at favorable rates. That infrastructure supported community growth, which expanded the tax base and the number of public employees, which increased contributions to the pension fund. Nobody got rich intermediating the transaction, which is why nobody has an incentive to bring it back.</span></p><p><span>The system started to strain in the 1940s when municipal bond yields fell to around 1.2%, roughly 41% of corporate bond returns, and broke open in the 1960s when states adopted the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudent_man_rule" rel="">“prudent man rule”</a><span> allowing pension funds to invest in corporate equities. That first shift, from municipal bonds to corporate stocks, was defensible. Equities offered higher long-term returns, and pensioners deserved the benefit. The adoption of the prudent man rule by states and its role in transforming public pension investment is documented in detail by </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00346764.2023.2270458" rel="">Vanatta</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The second shift was not. Starting in the 1980s and accelerating after 2000, pensions piled into hedge funds, private equity, and other alternatives that promised superior returns through sophisticated strategies. By 2021, alternatives constituted </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4940886" rel="">nearly 40% of pension risk allocations</a><span>. Two decades of data now show this shift was a pure loss: same returns, </span><a href="https://richardmennis.com/blog/have-alternative-investments-helped-or-hurt" rel="">vastly higher fees</a><span>, and no benefit to the communities whose workers the funds are supposed to serve. The virtuous cycle was replaced by an extractive one. Pension contributions flow to consultants, who recommend alternative managers, who charge </span><a href="https://richardmennis.com/blog/the-endowment-syndrome-why-elite-funds-are-falling-behind" rel="">6% in fees</a><span> and deliver </span><a href="https://richardmennis.com/blog/how-hidden-costs-undermine-public-pensions-in-the-us" rel="">index-matching returns</a><span>. Meanwhile the communities that employ the pensioners struggle to finance basic infrastructure.</span></p><p>We are not arguing for a return to 1942.

The move into expensive alternatives added cost without adding return. The Japanese failure was political capture of capital allocation. The American failure is intermediary capture, which may be even </span><em>worse</em><span>. Both are real risks, and any reform must guard against both.</span></p><p><span>But here is what Japan got right that America is getting wrong. As of December 2024, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_Japan" rel="">88.1% of Japanese government debt is held domestically. The Bank of Japan holds 46.3%, domestic insurance companies 15.6%, domestic banks 14.5%. Foreign investors hold only about 12%</a><span>. Japanese households save at high rates, deposit into banks and insurance companies, and those institutions buy Japanese government bonds because their liabilities are also yen-denominated. The government uses the proceeds for spending and debt service. Even after the formal FILP reforms in 2001, the structural logic persists through this market-mediated channel. The institutional successor is hiding in plain sight. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Post_Bank" rel="">Japan Post Bank</a><span>, the semi-privatized descendant of the postal savings system that once fed FILP, still holds </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Post_Bank" rel="">¥190 trillion in deposits</a><span> (~$1.29 trillion), still maintains </span><a href="https://www.jp-bank.japanpost.jp/en/ir/financial/en_ir_fnc_finance.html" rel="">¥40.3 trillion in Japanese government bonds</a><span>, and still operates across nearly 24,000 branches serving 120 million accounts. It posted </span><a href="https://www.jp-bank.japanpost.jp/en/ir/financial/en_ir_fnc_finance.html" rel="">record profits for the second consecutive year in FY2025</a><span>. The government still holds a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Post_Bank" rel="">22% economic interest</a><span>. The fiscal mutualism did not disappear with the 2001 reform. It became more market-mediated, for better or worse. Japan Post Bank channels household savings into government debt and, increasingly, into a diversified global portfolio of </span><a href="https://www.jp-bank.japanpost.jp/en/ir/financial/pdf/en_pr250520_1.pdf" rel="">¥87.4 trillion in foreign securities</a><span>. The postal savings pipeline that built postwar Japan is still operating. It just has a stock ticker now.</span></p><p><span>Japan carries </span><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/government-debt-to-gdp" rel="">gross debt exceeding 230% of GDP</a><span>, levels that would trigger capital flight in any country dependent on foreign creditors. It hasn’t. The domestic savings channel has proved so resilient that betting against JGBs became known on Wall Street as the </span><a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/traders-insight/the-widowmaker-pays-off-as-the-last-central-bank-domino-falls/" rel="">“widowmaker trade.”</a><span> Every macro fund that shorted Japanese government bonds on the theory that the debt was unsustainable </span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/2758465-the-widowmaker-and-yen-crash-theories" rel="">lost money</a><span>, because the theory ignored the closed loop of domestic savings financing domestic debt.</span></p><p><span>The widowmaker shorts were wrong for a deeper reason than they realized. The domestic holding base doesn’t merely prevent capital flight. It keeps funding costs so low that the entire Japanese public sector operates (as we are clearly seeing) what </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f7d3f20c-b303-4f6c-b4a0-8ee8906ae155" rel="">economists at the St. Louis Fed and Stanford have called “a sovereign wealth fund with borrowed money.”</a><span> Domestic savers accept low yields on JGBs because their liabilities are yen-denominated and the alternatives are limited. The government borrows at those low rates and holds the proceeds (directly and through entities like GPIF and the Bank of Japan) in higher-returning assets: foreign reserves, equities, and other risky positions. </span><a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2025/apr/what-is-behind-japan-high-government-debt" rel="">Research by YiLi Chien of the St. Louis Fed, Wenxin Du of Harvard, and Hanno Lustig of Stanford</a><span> estimates that this strategy has earned the Japanese government an additional 6 percent of GDP per annum above its funding costs over the past decade.</span></p><p><span>The scale becomes concrete when you look at the individual channels. The Bank of Japan holds </span><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/11/27/boj-gains-from-etf-holdings/" rel="">¥83.2 trillion ($532 billion) in exchange-traded funds</a><span>, making it the </span><a href="https://www.fintechobserver.com/the-exit-strategy-for-the-bank-of-japans-etf-holdings/" rel="">largest single shareholder in the Japanese stock market</a><span>, owning an estimated </span><a href="https://www.investing.com/news/economy/bank-of-japan-keeps-interest-rates-unchanged-outlines-etf-sale-plans-4246037" rel="">7% of the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s market capitalization</a><span>. Those holdings carry </span><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/11/27/boj-gains-from-etf-holdings/" rel="">¥46 trillion in unrealized gains</a><span>, a 124% return on cost, and generate </span><a href="https://www.fintechobserver.com/the-exit-strategy-for-the-bank-of-japans-etf-holdings/" rel="">¥1.2 trillion in annual dividends</a><span> that flow to the national treasury. When the BoJ announced in September 2025 that it would begin selling these holdings, the divestment plan was set at </span><a href="https://www.northerntrust.com/united-states/insights-research/2025/weekly-economic-commentary/the-bank-of-japan-prunes-its-portfolio" rel="">¥625 billion per year</a><span>, a pace that </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-19/japan-etfs-why-the-boj-is-unwinding-its-537-billion-stockpile" rel="">would take over a century to complete</a><span>. While other major central banks sit on </span><a href="https://www.northerntrust.com/united-states/insights-research/2025/weekly-economic-commentary/the-bank-of-japan-prunes-its-portfolio" rel="">underwater bond portfolios, the BoJ’s equity book is ¥44 trillion in the black</a><span>. Add Japan’s foreign exchange reserves, </span><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/foreign-exchange-reserves" rel="">$1.39 trillion as of January 2026</a><span>, mostly in dollar-denominated assets earning the rate differential over near-zero yen funding costs. Japan’s central bank is running a profitable equity long book funded by money creation, its finance ministry is running a leveraged carry trade in foreign currencies, and its pension fund is compounding returns at minimal cost. The “sovereign wealth fund with borrowed money” is not a metaphor. It is a description of actual positions totaling several trillion dollars.</span></p><p><span>This is why the gross debt number is misleading in isolation. When you consolidate the entire public sector balance sheet (the Bank of Japan’s equity holdings, the foreign exchange reserves, GPIF, the public financial institutions) Japan’s net public sector liability had </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f7d3f20c-b303-4f6c-b4a0-8ee8906ae155" rel="">fallen to roughly 65 percent of GDP by the third quarter of 2025</a><span>. When the St. Louis Fed researchers ran the same calculation for the United States in 2022, America’s net public sector liability was 119 percent of GDP, nearly double Japan’s current figure, despite America’s gross debt being barely half of Japan’s in GDP terms. The country that looks fiscally reckless on the headline number is in better net shape than the country that looks responsible, because Japan kept its savings at home and earned a spread on them while America scattered its capital across fee-extracting intermediaries.</span></p><p><span>Japan is not the only country running this playbook. </span><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/singapore/government-debt-to-gdp" rel="">Singapore carries gross debt of 173% of GDP</a><span>, higher than the United States, but has </span><a href="https://www.agd.gov.sg/files/overview_of_singapore_government_borrowings_2025.pdf" rel="">no net debt</a><span>. Its sovereign wealth funds, GIC and Temasek, together with the Monetary Authority of Singapore manage assets estimated at </span><a href="https://www.omfif.org/2025/07/both-government-liabilities-and-assets-matter-for-sovereign-risk/" rel="">three to four times GDP</a><span>. Investment returns from these reserves contribute </span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2019/how-singapore-manages-its-reserves" rel="">roughly 20% of government revenue</a><span>, about </span><a href="https://www.omfif.org/2025/07/both-government-liabilities-and-assets-matter-for-sovereign-risk/" rel="">7% of GDP annually</a><span>. Singapore’s constitution </span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2019/how-singapore-manages-its-reserves" rel="">bars the government from borrowing to spend</a><span>; instead it allows spending up to half of expected long-term real returns on the reserves. As OMFIF put it: </span><a href="https://www.omfif.org/2025/07/both-government-liabilities-and-assets-matter-for-sovereign-risk/" rel="">“Singapore has employed borrowing not to meet current expenses or to fund a deficit, but to build a strong balance sheet.”</a><span> The crude debt-to-GDP metric that dominates American fiscal debate would rank Singapore as more indebted than the United States. In reality it is one of the wealthiest sovereigns on earth.</span></p><p>The principle is the same in both cases. The domestic holding base is the load-bearing wall of fiscal stability; the direct product of keeping capital circulating inside the national economy rather than handing it to intermediaries who scatter it across global alternative assets. The St. Louis Fed researchers note that Japan’s ability to sustain this depends on “stable and low funding costs from bondholders,” meaning the domestic savings channel must hold. If domestic institutions stop buying JGBs, the spread collapses and the sovereign wealth fund logic unravels. America cannot copy Japan’s solution or Singapore’s. But the underlying principle is clear: a nation that keeps its savings circulating domestically earns the fiscal room to maneuver that a nation dependent on foreign creditors and fee-extracting intermediaries does not.</p><p><span>China built a similar engine through the </span><a href="https://www.euromoney.com/article/27bjsstsqxhkmh1v3kzkt/banking/making-sense-of-belt-and-road-the-chinese-policy-bank-china-development-bank/" rel="">China Development Bank</a><span> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_financing_vehicle" rel="">Local Government Financing Vehicles</a><span>, routing household deposits into infrastructure at massive scale.

China directs state-mobilized capital toward </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/28/chinas-47b-semiconductor-fund-puts-chip-sovereignty-front-and-center/" rel="">strategic technology competition</a><span> and builds physical infrastructure at a third the cost, financed through a banking system that treats development lending as a sovereign function. Japan runs a disciplined, low-cost portfolio and keeps its domestic savings circulating where they underwrite fiscal stability and a 6 percent of GDP annual spread. Singapore borrows at 173% of GDP and funds a fifth of government revenue from the proceeds. America </span><a href="https://www.governing.com/finance/how-alternative-investments-are-dragging-down-pension-performance" rel="">pays tens of billions per year to financial intermediaries who add no value</a><span>, while the infrastructure and defense-industrial capacity that pension capital should be financing goes underfunded. We don’t need to emulate China’s state-directed model. But we should stop being the only major economy whose largest pool of patient capital is optimized for fee extraction rather than national capacity.</span></p><p>So where would this capital actually go?</p><p>The housing case is the most proven, because it’s already working at small scale.</p><p><span>New York City’s pension systems allocate 2% (but effectively less) of assets to economically targeted investments, deploying $852 million through the </span><a href="https://www.aflcio-hit.com/new-york/" rel="">AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust</a><span> since 2002 and financing over 37,000 affordable apartments using union labor. The </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/pemd-95-13" rel="">GAO evaluated these programs</a><span> and found they achieved competitive returns. </span></p><p>Texas offers another model at the infrastructure level. Municipal Utility Districts are special districts that issue tax-exempt bonds to finance water, sewer, drainage, and road infrastructure for new developments. MUD bonds are self-liquidating (homeowners pay them off through property taxes over 20-30 years), asset-backed, transparent, and regulated by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. They have financed major projects like The Woodlands, Clear Lake City, and First Colony. Pension funds holding MUD bonds instead of hedge fund LP interests would earn comparable returns while financing actual housing and infrastructure.</p><p>The question is why New York’s ETI allocation is 2% instead of 15%. The answer is institutional inertia and the same consultant-driven incentive structure that pushes everything toward complex, high-fee alternatives. The mechanism works.

His conclusion: “New transmission capacity must be heavily subsidized.”</span></p><p>He’s right, and we need to go further with providing cheaper capital. Transmission lines are 30-50 year assets with regulated, predictable cash flows. They don’t need charity, they need patient buyers for the debt that finances them. The natural buyers are pension funds, whose 30+ year liability profiles match transmission asset durations almost perfectly. The reason pension funds aren’t buying is that their capital is tied up in alternative strategies with 5-7 year horizons, paying 6% in annual fees to roughly match a bond index.</p><p>Pension funds currently hold around $2 trillion in the bond side of their portfolios. Most of that is in corporate bonds, complex fixed-income strategies, and private credit funds charging 2-and-20. If even a quarter of that allocation shifted to municipal and infrastructure bonds, including bonds financing grid transmission, that would create roughly $500 billion in captive demand for infrastructure debt. That would lower the cost of financing transmission buildout. Not through subsidies. Through a large, natural buyer entering the market for the assets its liability structure already demands.</p><p>Parlmer estimates that solving the location problem might be part of a greater-than-$1 trillion project. The pension system’s bond allocation alone could absorb a significant fraction of that financing need, if it weren’t locked up in hedge fund LP interests.</p><p>China has roughly 30 reactors under construction, financed in significant part through state-mobilized patient capital channeled via the China Development Bank. American pension funds hold $6 trillion in equivalent long-duration capital and are spending it on hedge fund fees.</p><p><span data-state="closed"><a href="https://open.substack.com/users/75852873-thomas-hochman?utm_source=mentions" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Thomas Hochman&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:75852873,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LQDn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dd36654-b959-48eb-87ee-3c5548462d81_1170x1170.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;9038ea4b-a298-4f64-a381-9835d04a43b3&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionUser">Thomas Hochman</a></span><span> </span><a href="https://www.greentape.pub/p/the-case-for-double-dipping-reform" rel="">has written about the LPO’s role in nuclear financing and the double-dipping restrictions that impede it</a><span>. The LPO is a critical tool, providing federal debt for projects that private lenders consider too large or technically complex. But nuclear projects also need long-term equity commitments and project finance bonds that match their 40-60 year operational life. A nuclear plant with a power purchase agreement is essentially an infrastructure bond: predictable cash flows over a multi-decade horizon, backed by a regulated revenue stream. Pension funds should be natural participants in that capital stack.</span></p><p>Parlmer has floated the idea of state-backed reactor fleets, either DoD or DoE operated, because he can’t see another path to rapid deployment. Pension-backed project finance isn’t state ownership, but it could serve a similar de-risking function. A pension fund investing in a nuclear project finance bond backed by a DoD power purchase agreement would face lower risk than most of what is currently in pension alternative allocations, and would fund something that matters.</p><p><span>Parlmer’s analysis of Chinese industrial automation is alarming: </span><a href="https://mattparlmer.substack.com/p/blitzrobotik" rel="">PRC added more industrial robots in 2023 than the rest of the world combined</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/china-now-has-more-factory-robots-than-the-rest-of-the-world-combined/" rel="">quintupled its per-worker robot count since 2017</a><span>, and is pulling ahead of the United States in industrial sophistication. His prescription: dollars flowing into industrial automation at more than ten times current levels, with subsidies directed to startups rather than legacy firms.</span></p><p>Pension funds already allocate significant capital to venture through their alternatives sleeve, but that money flows overwhelmingly to Sequoia and Andreessen, not to defense tech or industrial automation startups in Ohio or Texas. The geographic and sectoral concentration of pension-funded VC mirrors the broader venture ecosystem’s biases: software over hardware, Bay Area over everywhere else, consumer over defense.</p><p><span>Redirecting even a fraction of pension VC allocation toward regional defense and industrial venture vehicles wouldn’t require new government spending. It would redirect existing capital flows. The </span><a href="https://www.ohioinnovationfund.com/" rel="">Ohio Innovation Fund</a><span> and similar state-level vehicles demonstrate that the institutional architecture is feasible. The returns are uncertain (this is venture, after all) but the counterfactual is not a guaranteed 12% from private equity. It’s 6% from a fund that charges 6% in fees to roughly match the S&amp;P 500.</span></p><p>We will be candid: the venture case is weaker than the infrastructure case. Pension funds are not natural venture investors, and pushing them toward VC risks the “picking winners” failure mode that destroyed Japan’s Fiscal Investment and Loan Program. But our argument is not that pensions should become venture funds. It is that the capital they currently waste on underperforming alternatives could be partially redirected toward asset classes that at least fund something strategic, and that the bar for improvement over the status quo is extraordinarily low.</p><p><span>Pension capital allocated to private equity and hedge funds does not just fail to generate excess returns. It actively harms the communities pensioners live in: their housing, their hospitals, their local employers, their newspapers. The capital that once built those communities through municipal bond investment now funds their extraction. Public pension funds provide roughly one-third of all private equity investment capital, </span><a href="https://prospect.org/labor/2023-10-04-workers-funding-misery-private-equity-pension-funds" rel="">over $620 billion in 2022</a><span>, up from 3.5% of pension assets in 2001.</span></p><p><span>Start with Chelmsford, Massachusetts. Public school custodians earning $25 an hour had their jobs privatized when Aramark, then </span><a href="https://prospect.org/labor/2023-10-04-workers-funding-misery-private-equity-pension-funds" rel="">owned by private equity and backed by 37 state and local retirement funds</a><span>, underbid their union for the school cleaning contract. Aramark offered the custodians their jobs back at $8.75 an hour, </span><a href="https://www.nyulawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NYULawReview-89-6-2106-Webber.pdf" rel="">a 56% pay cut</a><span>. Their own pension savings funded the company that destroyed their livelihoods.</span></p><p><span>Chelmsford is not an outlier. Over the past decade, approximately 597,000 workers at PE- and hedge fund-owned retailers have lost their jobs directly. When indirect supply-chain effects are included (the </span><a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/updated-employment-multipliers-for-the-u-s-economy/" rel="">Economic Policy Institute estimates 122 additional jobs lost per 100 direct retail losses</a><span>), the total approaches 1.3 million. Toys “R” Us, 99 Cents Only Stores, Joann, Big Lots, Red Lobster: PE-owned firms go bankrupt at roughly ten times the rate of comparable non-PE firms. Cass catalogues the pattern across veterinary practices, funeral parlors, campgrounds, youth sports, and volunteer fire departments, all consolidated and squeezed and repackaged as “value creation.”</span></p><p><span>In local media, hedge fund </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alden_Global_Capital" rel="">Alden Global Capital</a><span> and similar firms now control more than </span><a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2023/opinion-action-needed-to-avoid-local-news-setbacks-like-pennsylvania-sale/" rel="">half of America’s daily newspaper circulation</a><span>. Over 2,000 local newspapers have closed nationwide. When local papers disappear, </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/18/1046952430/the-consequences-of-when-a-hedge-fund-buys-newspapers" rel="">research shows</a><span> communities experience increased political polarization, decreased civic engagement, and higher borrowing costs for local governments, because the loss of journalistic oversight reduces transparency. The function that fiscal mutualism once served, lowering government borrowing costs through captive pension demand, is being actively undermined by what pension capital currently funds.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/06/opinion/finance-industry-grift.html" rel="">Cass argues</a><span> that financialization should be treated as “a grift, a rarefied form of bookmaking.” But the Chelmsford custodians don’t need a cultural reckoning. They need their pension fund to stop financing the company that cut their wages by 56 percent.</span></p><p><span>Steward Health Care shows how the extraction works at its most lethal. In 2010, </span><a href="https://pestakeholder.org/news/pesp-untangles-steward-health-cares-long-road-to-bankruptcy/" rel="">Cerberus Capital Management bought Caritas Christi</a><span>, a Catholic hospital system in eastern Massachusetts, for $895 million, putting up only $246 million in equity. Cerberus subsequently sold Steward’s hospital real estate to Medical Properties Trust for $1.25 billion in a sale-leaseback that saddled the hospitals with unsustainable rent obligations. All told, Cerberus and Steward CEO Ralph de la Torre </span><a href="https://pestakeholder.org/news/steward-health-cares-bankruptcy-one-year-later/" rel="">extracted approximately $1.3 billion</a><span> from the system. De la Torre bought a $40 million yacht and two private jets. Steward </span><a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/steward-health-care-bankruptcy-one-year-anniversary/747348/" rel="">filed for bankruptcy in 2024</a><span> with $9 billion in liabilities. Five hospitals closed. Roughly 2,400 workers lost their jobs. Nashoba Valley Medical Center, which served 115,000 residents in rural Massachusetts and received 16,000 emergency room visits annually, shut its doors. First responders now travel roughly 15 miles to the next hospital.</span></p><p><span>Steward is not an outlier either. A </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w28474" rel="">2024 Review of Financial Studies paper</a><span> found that private equity acquisition of nursing homes was associated with an ~10% increase in deaths, implying approximately 22,500 additional deaths over the twelve-year sample period.

No study to date has found PE ownership improves patient outcomes or lowers costs.</span></p><p><span>Private equity investment in healthcare has grown from $5 billion in 2000 to </span><a href="https://www.healthcare-brew.com/stories/2025/11/20/steward-health-care-shaped-private-equity-hospitals" rel="">an estimated $104 billion in 2024</a><span>.

In 1998, the Federal Reserve brokered a $3.625 billion rescue of Long-Term Capital Management, coordinating 14 banks to recapitalize a single hedge fund whose collapse threatened the broader financial system. That set a template. In March 2020, when COVID triggered a liquidity crunch, hedge funds running highly leveraged Treasury basis trades started dumping Treasuries en masse. The Fed responded by purchasing roughly $1.6 trillion in Treasury securities over several weeks. The basis trade was effectively backstopped with public money. That trade has since doubled in size, to roughly $1 trillion, concentrated among fewer than ten hedge funds.

The financial establishment is now pre-planning the next hedge fund bailout.</span></p><p><span>Now the pension side. Years of fee extraction and underperformance have left pensions deeply underfunded, </span><a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/news/public-pensions-are-mixing-risky-investments-unrealistic-predictions" rel="">$1.3 trillion in the hole by official accounting, or closer to $5.1 trillion using market-rate discount rates</a><span>, according to Stanford’s Joshua Rauh. That underfunding eventually triggers its own bailouts. In 2021, the American Rescue Plan included </span><a href="https://www.pbgc.gov/arp-sfa/faqs" rel="">roughly $97 billion in “special financial assistance”</a><span> for the most severely underfunded union pension plans. The single largest allocation, </span><a href="https://teamster.org/2022/12/in-victory-for-teamster-retirees-central-states-pension-fund-awarded-36-billion/" rel="">$36 billion, went to the Teamsters’ Central States Pension Fund</a><span>. That assistance has improved headline numbers: Milliman’s year-end 2024 study reports </span><a href="https://www.milliman.com/en/insight/multiemployer-pension-funding-study-year-end-2024" rel="">aggregate multiemployer funding at 97%</a><span>. But strip out the SFA grants and the aggregate drops to 89%. Eighty-five plans remain below 60% funded. And the SFA program </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47512" rel="">made no changes to multiemployer plan funding rules</a><span>, so the structural dynamics that created the underfunding are entirely intact.</span></p><p>The obvious objection to redirecting pension capital is political capture, Japan’s FILP and its bridges to nowhere. That risk is real. But Japan’s pension system, whatever FILP’s failures, is not trillions in the hole. The counterfactual is not “safe status quo vs. risky reform.” The current system already fails, already gets bailed out, and taxpayers are already on the hook.</p><p>On top what the pension funds already pay out in fees, if the federal government is going to spend $97 billion rescuing pension plans, and the Fed is going to deploy trillions backstopping the Treasury market, the obvious question is: why isn’t any of that capital building something?</p><p>A $97 billion pension rescue conditioned on not just reforms but also investing 25% of assets in domestic infrastructure bonds would have simultaneously stabilized the pensions, financed grid buildout, and created a template for redirecting patient capital toward national priorities. Instead, the money went in with no structural reform. No investment mandates, no fee caps, no requirement to stop feeding the same intermediary complex that created the underfunding. The plans that received bailout funds are free to continue allocating to the same managers whose fees helped drain them. And they will.</p><p>The institutional dynamics are a textbook captured-bureaucracy problem. Career risk provides cover through complexity: run a simple indexed portfolio and underperform in a given year, and you look unsophisticated. Run a complex alternatives-heavy portfolio and underperform, and you look like you tried your best. No one gets fired for hiring Goldman Sachs. Consultants don't get paid to recommend index funds; they get paid to recommend strategies requiring ongoing advice and manager searches. Benchmarks are gamed: pension funds construct custom benchmarks biased by 1-2% annually relative to fair passive alternatives, and private equity returns are reported with lags that smooth volatility and create the illusion of diversification. Trustees worry that directing capital toward municipal or infrastructure bonds rather than "optimizing" globally could be challenged as a breach of fiduciary duty, even though the "safe" legal path leads into strategies that have demonstrably underperformed. The cycle is self-reinforcing. CalPERS tried to break it in 2014 when they exited hedge funds. Ten years later, they were back in private markets.</p><p>The honest version of this section would list transparency mandates, fee caps, infrastructure bond requirements, and indexing mandates. We drafted it. Then we deleted it, because every item on the list requires action by the same actors who benefit from the current arrangement.</p><p>State legislators who would mandate fee transparency receive campaign contributions from the asset management industry. Pension board trustees who would cap alternatives face career risk if they simplify. The consultants who would need to recommend index funds over complex strategies are the same consultants whose business model depends on recommending complex strategies. Federal legislators who would attach conditions to bailouts just passed $97 billion with no conditions attached, because the political incentive was to deliver the money and move on.</p><p>We have spent this entire piece documenting a self-reinforcing capture loop. It would be dishonest to end it by proposing that the captured institutions reform themselves. CalPERS knew the answer in 2014. They exited hedge funds, published the rationale, took a public stand. A decade later they were back in private markets for $30 billion more, because nothing about the incentive structure had changed. If the nation’s largest and most sophisticated pension fund, with a board that understood the problem and acted on it, could not sustain the exit, a policy white paper is not going to do it.</p><p>We are describing a trap, not proposing an escape.</p><p>What will happen is another bailout. The math guarantees it. The SFA grants improved headline numbers, but strip them out and aggregate multiemployer funding drops to 89%. Eighty-five plans remain below 60% funded. The program changed no funding rules. The fee extraction continues. The underperformance compounds. At some point, probably within the next decade, a recession or market downturn will force the next round of plans into insolvency and Congress will face the same choice it faced in 2021.</p><p>That is the only moment when the political dynamics actually shift. When public money is on the table and legislators need a story to tell about why this time is different, there is a narrow window in which conditions can be attached. Not because anyone in the system wants reform, but because the politics of unconditional bailouts get worse each time. The 2021 rescue passed in a COVID relief omnibus where no one was paying attention. The next one will face more scrutiny, more anger, and a public that has watched pension-funded private equity close their hospitals and cut their neighbors’ wages.</p><p>The question is not “how do we reform pension allocation now.” It is: “when the next bailout arrives, what conditions are ready to attach?” That means having the legislative language drafted. It means having the qualifying criteria for infrastructure bonds defined (investment-grade, revenue-backed, independently certified) so that the debate is over a concrete mechanism rather than an abstract principle. It means having the fee cap number chosen and the benchmark methodology specified. It means having the sunset clause and the performance trigger designed, so that the infrastructure mandate self-destructs if it fails and cannot become a permanent slush fund.</p><p>None of that requires passing legislation today. It requires preparation for a political window that is coming whether anyone wants it or not.</p><p>The trap will not reform itself. But it will need public money again. The work between now and then is to make sure that the next time Congress writes a check to rescue a pension system bled dry by intermediary fees, the check comes with conditions that route the capital toward qualifying infrastructure debt rather than back into the same extraction loop that created the crisis. That is the difference between rescue and subsidy. It is also, realistically, the only reform that has a chance of happening.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.governance.fyi/p/americas-pensions-cant-beat-a-vanguard?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.governance.fyi/p/americas-pensions-cant-beat-a-vanguard?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><a href="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/">← Back</a><p>Feb 17, 2026 · Arthur Cnops</p><p>A few days ago I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47023255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted to Show HN</a>. I had good fun building that useless little internet experience. The post quickly disappeared from Show HN's first page, amongst the rest of the vibecoded pulp. And to be clear, I'm fine with that.</p>
<p>The behavior on Show HN was interesting to see though. So I pulled the data.</p>
<h2>The Short Version</h2>
<p>Show HN of course isn't dead. You could even say it's more alive than ever. What has changed is the volume of posts and engagement per post. It's only natural when more projects are being built in a single weekend. There's less "Proof of Work".</p>
<p>From the business side of this, Johan Halse recently called this <a href="https://johan.hal.se/wrote/2026/02/03/the-sideprocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Sideprocalypse</a>: the end of the small indie developer's dream. Every idea has been built, marketed better, and SEO'd into oblivion by someone with more money.</p>
<p>Some cool projects aren't getting through this noise, which is a pity. Here are a few I thought were interesting:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47012984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neohabit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46965662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenRun</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47003384" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uForwarder</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I just upvoted them!</p>
<p>Now, let's look at some data.</p>
<h2>Volume Is Exploding</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-volume.svg" alt="HN volume over time for all posts, Show HN, and non-Show-HN"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-share.svg" alt="Show HN monthly share of all HN story volume"></p>
<h2>The Graveyard Is Growing</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-one-point.svg" alt="1-point share over time for Show HN versus non-Show-HN"></p>
<p>Show HN started out <em>better</em> than regular submissions. Now it's significantly <em>worse</em>.</p>
<h2>The Shrinking Window</h2>
<p>How long does a Show HN post stay on page 1 before being pushed off? During peak hours (US daytime):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-visibility.svg" alt="Estimated visibility time for Show HN posts during peak hours"></p>
<h2>Discussion Is Dying Too</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/images/hn-show-dead-comments.svg" alt="Average comments per Show HN post"></p>
<h2>So Is Show HN Dead?</h2>
<p>No. There's just more noise, and less opportunity to get attention and have a discussion with other folks on HN about your project. Some gems go completely unnoticed. Maybe something for HN to think about: how do these subjective "gems" get more spotlight? How does HN remain the coolest place to talk about the coolest tech?</p>

<h2 id="introduction-feel-free-to-skip">Introduction (feel free to skip)</h2>

<p>Just a year ago, I was really deep into the Apple ecosystem. It seemed like there was no turning back from the orchard for me. Phone, laptop, watch, tablet, video and music streaming, cloud storage, and even a key tracker. All from one manufacturer. Plus shared family photo albums, calendars, and even shopping lists.</p>

<p>However, at some point, I discovered <a href="https://plenti.app/">Plenti</a>, a company that rents a really wide range of different devices at quite reasonable prices. Casually, I threw the phrase “samsung fold” into the search engine on their website and it turned out that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 could be rented for just 250-300 PLN per month. That was quite an interesting option, as I was insanely curious about how it is to live with a foldable phone, which after unfolding becomes the equivalent of a tablet. Plus, I would never dare to buy this type of device, because firstly, their price is astronomical, and secondly, I have serious doubts about the longevity of the folding screen. I checked the rental conditions from Plenti and nothing raised my suspicions. Renting seemed like a really cool option, so I decided to get the Fold 6 for half a year. That’s how I broke out of the orchard and slightly reopened the doors to my heart for solutions without the apple logo. I even wrote a post about the whole process - <a href="https://blog.tomaszdunia.pl/zdradzilem-teamapple-eng/">I betrayed #TeamApple for broken phone</a>. What I’m getting at is that this is how Android returned to my living room and I think I started liking it anew.</p>

<p>My adventure with Samsung ended after the planned 6 months. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a good phone, and the ability to unfold it to the size of a tablet is an amazing feature. However, what bothered me about it was:</p>

<ol>
  <li>after folding it was terribly thick,</li>
  <li>it couldn’t be used in a case, because all the covers either didn’t fit or slipped off the part that has screens on both sides,</li>
  <li>naked, it was very blocky, even sharp, which caused me discomfort; holding it was simply unpleasant,</li>
  <li>paying 300 PLN (~80 USD) for rent is a good short-term solution to get something to test, but not in the long run.</li>
</ol>

<p>All the points above made me give up on extending the rental and start wondering what to do next. Interestingly, I liked Android enough that I didn’t necessarily want to go back to iOS. Around this time, an article hit my RSS reader: <a href="https://ithardware.pl/aktualnosci/grapheneos_ucieka_francja_kraj_niebezpieczny_prywatnosc_open_source-46855.html">Creators of the most secure version of Android fear France. Travel ban for the whole team</a> (I think it was this one, but I’m not entirely sure, it doesn’t really matter). It talked about how France wants to get its hands on the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/"><strong>GrapheneOS</strong></a> system and thus carry out a very serious attack on the privacy of its users. I thought then, “Hey! A European country <strong>wants to force a backdoor into the system</strong>, because it is too well secured to surveil its users. Either this is artificially blowing the topic out of proportion, or <strong>there is actually something special about this system!</strong>”. At that moment, a somewhat forgotten nerd gene ignited in me. I decided to abandon not only iOS, but also mainstream Android, and try a completely alternative system.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-grapheneos">What is GrapheneOS</h2>

<p>GrapheneOS is a custom, <strong>open-source operating system</strong> designed with the idea of <strong>providing users with the highest level of privacy and security</strong>. It is based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), but differs significantly from standard software versions found in smartphones. Its creators completely <strong>eliminated integration with Google services</strong> at the system level, which avoids tracking and data collection by corporations, while offering a modern and stable working environment.</p>

<p>The system is distinguished by advanced “hardening” of the kernel and key components, which minimizes vulnerability to hacking attacks and exploits. A unique feature of GrapheneOS is the ability to run Google Play Services in an <strong>isolated environment</strong> (sandbox), allowing the user to use popular applications without granting them broad system permissions. Currently, the project focuses on supporting <strong>Google Pixel</strong> series phones, utilizing their dedicated Titan M security chips for full data protection.</p>

<h2 id="dedicated-devices">Dedicated devices</h2>

<p>When I used to read about GrapheneOS, the list of compatible devices included items from several different manufacturers. Now it’s only Google Pixel devices. This doesn’t mean you can’t run this system on a Samsung, for example, but the creators simply don’t guarantee it will work properly, and you have to deal with potentially porting the version yourself. Note that it’s quite funny that <strong>a system freed from Google services should be run exactly on Google devices</strong>. If anyone wants to read more about why Pixels are the best for GrapheneOS, I recommend checking out the following keywords - Verified Boot, Titan M, IOMMU, MTE.</p>

<h3 id="list-of-supported-devices-february-2026">List of supported devices (February 2026)</h3>

<p><em>I’ve bolded the items that are not only supported but also recommended (at the time of writing this post, you can find the current list <a href="https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices">here</a>)</em></p>

<h3 id="my-smartphone-choice">My smartphone choice</h3>
<p>At the stage of choosing a device to test GrapheneOS on, I wasn’t yet sure if such a solution would work for me at all and if I’d last with it in the long run. So it would be unreasonable to lay out a significant amount of money. Because of this, probably the only sensible choice was the <strong>Google Pixel 9a</strong>. This was a few months ago, when not enough time had passed since the premiere of the 10 series models for them to make it onto the fully supported devices list. At that time, the Pixel 9a was the freshest device on the list (<strong>offering up to 7 YEARS of support!</strong>) and on top of that, it was very attractively priced, as I bought it for around <strong>1600 PLN</strong> (~450 USD).</p>

<p>In retrospect, I still consider it a good choice and definitely <strong>recommend this path to anyone</strong> who is currently at the stage of deciding on what hardware to start their GrapheneOS adventure. The only thing that bothers me a bit about the Pixel 9a is the quality of the photos it takes. I switched to it having previously had the iPhone 15 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, which are excellent in this regard, so it’s no wonder I’m a bit spoiled, because I was simply used to a completely different level of cameras. Now I also know that <strong>GrapheneOS will stay with me for longer</strong>, so it’s possible that knowing then what I know now, I would have opted for some more expensive gear. However, this isn’t important to me now, because for the time being I don’t plan to switch to another device, and by the time that changes, the market situation and the list of available options will certainly have changed too. Besides, I’m <strong>positively surprised by the battery life and overall performance of this phone</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="installing-grapheneos">Installing GrapheneOS</h2>

<h3 id="we-need">We need</h3>

<ol>
  <li>A suitable <strong>smartphone</strong> - in my case, it’s a Google Pixel 9a.</li>
  <li>A <strong>cable</strong> to connect the phone to a computer; it can’t be just any cable, but one that is used not only for charging but also for data transmission. It’s best to just use the cable that came with the phone.</li>
  <li>A <strong>computer with a Chromium-based browser</strong> (e.g., Google Chrome, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Vivaldi?). Unfortunately, I must recommend Windows 10/11 here, because then you don’t have to mess around with any drivers; it’s the simplest option.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="phone-preparation">Phone preparation</h3>

<ol>
  <li>If it’s new, we take it out of the box and <strong>turn it on</strong>. If it was previously used, we <strong>restore it to factory settings</strong> (Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Reset options -&gt; Erase all data (factory reset) -&gt; Erase all data). I think it’s stating the obvious, but I’ll write it anyway - a factory reset results in the deletion of all user data from the device, so if you have anything important on it, you need to back it up.</li>
  <li>We must <strong>go through the basic setup</strong> until we see the home screen. We do the absolute minimum. Here is a breakdown of the steps:
    <ul>
      <li>on the welcome screen, you can change the language to whatever suits you</li>
      <li>we skip the GSM services setup (SIM card)</li>
      <li>we don’t connect to Wi-Fi, so we skip this step too</li>
      <li>the date and time settings should be correct</li>
      <li>we turn off all Google Services (location, scanning, sending diagnostic data) and accept</li>
      <li>we don’t need to do anything with the warranty terms, so just the Next button</li>
      <li>we accept the Legal Terms</li>
      <li>we set some easy PIN, e.g., 12345</li>
      <li>there is no need to waste time setting up biometrics, so we politely decline and skip fingerprint and face scan</li>
      <li>a moment of waiting</li>
      <li>we skip the tutorial</li>
      <li>swipe up and we’re done, we are on the home screen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>First of all, we need to make sure that <strong>our phone’s software is updated</strong> to the latest available version. For this purpose, we go to <strong>Settings -&gt; System -&gt; System update</strong>. If necessary, we update.</li>
  <li>Next, we go to <strong>Settings -&gt; About phone -&gt; find the Build number field</strong> and tap it 7 times until we see the message <strong>You are now a developer</strong>. In the meantime, the phone will ask for the PIN we set during the phone setup.</li>
  <li>We go back and now enter <strong>Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Developer options -&gt; turn on the OEM unlocking option</strong>. The phone will ask for the PIN again. After entering it, we still have to confirm that we definitely want to remove the lock.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="unlocking-the-bootloader">Unlocking the bootloader</h3>

<ol>
  <li>We start the bootloader unlocking process by <strong>turning off the phone</strong>.</li>
  <li>When the screen goes completely dark, <strong>we simultaneously press and hold the power and volume down buttons</strong> until the text-based <strong>Fastboot Mode</strong> interface appears. If the phone starts up normally, it means we performed one of the earlier steps incorrectly.</li>
  <li>We connect the <strong>phone to the computer</strong>.</li>
  <li>We go to the computer and open the browser (based on the Chromium engine) to the address <strong><a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web">https://grapheneos.org/install/web</a></strong>.</li>
  <li>We go to the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web#unlocking-the-bootloader">Unlocking the bootloader</a> section and press the <strong>Unlock bootloader</strong> button.</li>
  <li>A window with a list of devices to choose from will pop up in the browser. There should basically be only one item on it, and that should be our Pixel. <strong>We select it and press the Connect button</strong>.</li>
  <li>Changes will occur on the phone’s display. A message will appear asking to confirm that we actually want to unlock the bootloader. To do this, we must press one of the volume buttons so that instead of <strong>Do not unlock the bootlader</strong>, <strong>Unlock the bootlader</strong> appears. At this point, we can confirm by <strong>pressing the power button</strong>.</li>
  <li>If everything succeeded, among the data displayed in Fastboot Mode we should see <strong>Device state: unlocked</strong> (in red).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="downloading-and-flashing-the-system-image">Downloading and flashing the system image</h3>

<ol>
  <li>On the GrapheneOS website, we scroll down to the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web#obtaining-factory-images">Obtaining factory images</a> section and press the <strong>Download release</strong> button. If the phone is still connected to the computer, the website will decide on its own which system image to download.</li>
  <li>We wait for the download to finish. It is obvious that the time needed for this depends directly on the speed of the internet connection.</li>
  <li>When the download is complete, we can go to the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web#flashing-factory-images">Flashing factory images</a> section below and press <strong>Flash release</strong>.</li>
  <li>Spit over your left shoulder now, hold your breath, and under no circumstances unplug the phone from the computer. Best not to touch either device at all.</li>
  <li>When the process is complete, the phone will restart itself and return to the Fastboot Mode interface. In the browser, we will see the message <strong>Flashed …</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="re-locking-the-bootloader">Re-locking the bootloader</h3>

<p>Locking the bootloader is crucial because it enables the full operation of the Verified Boot feature. It also prevents the use of fastboot mode to flash, format, or wipe partitions. Verified Boot detects any modifications to the OS partitions and blocks the reading of any altered or corrupted data. If changes are detected, the system uses error correction data to attempt to recover the original data, which is then verified again – thanks to this mechanism, the system is resilient to accidental (non-malicious) file corruption.</p>

<p>However, before re-securing the bootloader, I recommend checking if the system was flashed correctly and everything works as it should, because if it doesn’t, locking the bootloader might brick (completely block, or even damage) the phone. Therefore:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Being in Fastboot Mode, when we see the <strong>Start</strong> message, we press the power button, which will cause the system to start normally. If we don’t see <strong>Start</strong> at the height of the power button, we have to press the volume buttons and find this option.</li>
  <li>When the phone starts up, we can immediately perform the basic setup. The bootloader won’t run away.</li>
  <li>This is a standard procedure, so we will only go through it briefly:
    <ul>
      <li>welcome screen</li>
      <li>we choose the <strong>language</strong></li>
      <li>we choose the time zone and thus set the <strong>date and time</strong></li>
      <li>we connect to <strong>Wi-Fi</strong></li>
      <li>if you can, you can immediately set up the <strong>SIM card</strong>, but you can also postpone it for later</li>
      <li>I recommend turning off the <strong>location service</strong>, because it’s better to configure it calmly later by granting permissions only to apps that really need it</li>
      <li>securing the phone with a <strong>fingerprint</strong>; I personally am an advocate of this solution, so I recommend using it, GrapheneOS does not (yet) support face unlock, so fingerprint and a standard password are the only methods we have to choose from (of course I reject pattern unlock right at the start as a form of screen lock that cannot even in good conscience be called any security)</li>
      <li>I assume that if you are reading this post, you are a graphene freshman and you have no <strong>backup</strong> to restore, so we just skip this step</li>
      <li><strong>Start</strong> button and we are on the home screen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If everything is working correctly, you can now go ahead and turn off the phone and turn it on while holding the power button and volume down, just like we did earlier.</li>
  <li>We land back in Fastboot Mode. I assume the phone was connected to the computer the whole time (if not, reconnect it). We return to the browser on the computer. We find the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web#locking-the-bootloader">Locking the bootloader</a> section and press the <strong>Lock bootloader</strong> button.</li>
  <li>Again, confirmation of this operation on the phone is required. It looks analogous to unlocking, except this time, using the volume buttons, we have to make the <strong>Lock the bootloader</strong> option active and confirm it with the power button.</li>
  <li>The result should be a change of <strong>Device state</strong> to <strong>locked</strong> (in green).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="restoring-the-oem-lock">Restoring the OEM lock</h3>

<p>The final step before starting to play with the new system is reapplying the OEM lock.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Just like when removing the lock, we go to <strong>Settings -&gt; About phone -&gt; find the Build number field</strong> and tap it 7 times until we see the message <strong>You are now a developer</strong>. In the meantime, the phone will ask for the PIN we set during the phone setup.</li>
  <li>We go back and now enter <strong>Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Developer options -&gt; turn off the OEM unlocking option</strong>. The phone will ask us to restart to change this setting, but for now we cancel this request, because we still want to <strong>completely turn off Developer options</strong>, which is done by unchecking the box next to the first option at the very top, <strong>Use developer options</strong>.</li>
  <li>Now we can <strong>restart the device</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="my-vision-of-using-grapheneos">My vision of using GrapheneOS</h2>

<p>Now the real fun begins. You’ll hear/read as many opinions on what you should and shouldn’t do regarding GrapheneOS hardening as there are people. Some are conservative, while others approach the topic a bit more liberally. In my opinion, there is no one right path, and everyone should dig around, test things out, and decide what suits them and fits their security profile. You’ll quickly find out that <strong>GrapheneOS is really one big compromise between convenience and privacy</strong>. While this same rule applies to everything belonging to the digital world, it’s only in this case that you’ll truly notice it, because <strong>GrapheneOS will show you how many things you can control, which you can’t do using conventional Android</strong>.
I don’t intend to use this post to promote some “one and only” method of using GrapheneOS. I’ll simply present how I use this system. This way, I’ll show the basics to people fresh to the topic, maybe I’ll manage to suggest an interesting trick they didn’t know to those who have been users for a while, and on a third note, maybe some expert will show up who, after reading my ramblings, will suggest something interesting or point out what I’m doing wrong / could do better. I’m sure that’s the case, since my adventure with GrapheneOS has practically only been going on for 3 months. I warn you right away that I’m not sure if I’ll be able to maintain a logical train of thought, as I’ll probably jump around topics a bit. <strong>The subject of GrapheneOS is vast</strong> and in today’s post I’ll only manage to slightly touch upon it.</p>

<h3 id="additional-user-profile">Additional user profile</h3>

<p>One of the first things I did after booting up the freshly installed system was to create a second user profile. This is done in <strong>Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Multiple users</strong>. The idea is for this feature to allow two (or more) people to use one phone, each having a separate profile with their own settings, apps, etc. Who in their right mind does that? While I can imagine sharing a home tablet, sharing a phone completely eludes me. It therefore seems like a dead feature, but nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p>For me, it works like this: on the <strong><em>Owner</em></strong> user, because that’s the name of the main account created automatically with the system, I installed the <strong>Google Play Store</strong> along with <strong>Google Play services</strong> and <strong>GmsCompatConfig</strong>. This is done through the <strong>App Store</strong> application, which is a component of the GrapheneOS system. Please don’t confuse this with Apple’s app store, even though the name is the same. From the Play Store I only installed the following applications:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>mBank</strong> - paying via contactless BLIK through NFC is possible only having Google services installed and only works for me on the user profile with administrator privileges (Owner),</li>
  <li><strong>Mój T-Mobile</strong> - without Google services, the Magenta Moments tab didn’t work for me at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s it. As you can see, this profile serves me only for apps that absolutely require integration with Google services. In practice, I switch to it only when I want to pay contactlessly in a store, which I actually do rarely lately, because if there’s an option, I pay using BLIK codes. Right after switching from Samsung there were more apps on this profile, but one by one I successively gave up on those that made me dependent on the big G.</p>

<p>It’s on the <strong>second profile</strong>, which let’s assume I called <em>Tommy</em>, that I keep my entire digital life. What does this give me? For instance, the main profile cannot be easily deleted, but the additional one can. Let’s imagine a situation where I need to quickly wipe my phone, but in a way that its basic functions still work, i.e., without a full factory reset. An example could be, say, arriving in the USA and undergoing immigration control. They want access to my phone, so I delete the <em>Tommy</em> user, switch to the <em>Owner</em> user, and hand them the phone. It makes calls, sends SMS messages, even has a banking app, so theoretically it shouldn’t arouse suspicion. However, it lacks all my contacts, a browser with my visited pages history, a password manager, and messengers with chat histories. This is rather a drastic scenario, but not really that improbable, as actions like searching a phone upon arrival in the States are something that happens on a daily basis. Besides, the basic rule of security is <strong>not to use an account with administrator privileges on a daily basis</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="obtainium">Obtainium</h3>

<p>On GrapheneOS, Obtainium is my <strong>primary aggregator for obtaining .apk installation files and automating app updates</strong>. It’s like the Google Play Store, but privacy-respecting and for open-source applications. It would be a sin to use GrapheneOS and not at least try to switch to open-source apps. Below I present a list of apps that I use. Additionally, I’m tossing in links to the source code repositories of each of them.</p>

<h4 id="list-of-my-open-source-applications">List of my open-source applications</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod"><strong>AntennaPod</strong></a> - podcast app (I haven’t completely switched to it from Pocket Casts yet, but I plan to),</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/whyorean/AuroraStore"><strong>Aurora Store</strong></a> - if there is no other option to download an .apk file, this very app can serve as an alternative to the Google Play Store, I’ll mention it again later,</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bitwarden/android"><strong>Bitwarden</strong></a> - password manager,</li>
  <li><a href=""><strong>Brave</strong></a> - web browser,</li>

<h3 id="aurora-store">Aurora Store</h3>

<p>I have a few apps that are not open-source, but I still need them. In this case, I don’t download them from the Google Play Store, but exactly from the <strong>Aurora Store</strong>, which I mentioned above.</p>

<p>Aurora Store is an open-source client of the Google Play store (I guess you could call it a frontend) that <strong>allows downloading applications from Google servers without needing Google services</strong> (GMS) on the phone.</p>

<p>The Internet characterizes this solution as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Privacy</strong> - you don’t need to log in with a Google account to download free apps (you can use built-in anonymous accounts).</li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong> - you install original .apk files straight from Google servers, not from unverified third-party sites.</li>
  <li><strong>Functionality</strong> - allows bypassing regional restrictions and installing apps that Google Play considers “incompatible” with a given device.</li>
  <li><strong>Open Source</strong> - the entire application code is transparent and auditable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds perfect, right? A bit, yes, but unfortunately not everything holds up completely. I have <strong>two main complaints</strong> about Aurora Store.</p>

<p>With these anonymous accounts, the thing is that <strong>sometimes they work, and sometimes they don’t</strong>, due to limits that are unreachable with a normal account used by one person, but when a thousand people download apps from one account at once, it starts to get suspicious, and the limits are exceeded quite quickly. Using Aurora Store violates the Google Play Store terms of service, so on the other hand <strong>if we use our Google account, it might be temporarily blocked</strong> or permanently banned. Some option here is to create a “burner” account just for this, but that takes away some of our privacy, because Google can still index us based on what we downloaded. Anonymous accounts in this case provide almost complete anonymity, because then we are just a drop in the ocean.</p>

<p>When it comes to security, yes, in theory we download .apk files from a verified source, but <strong>only under the condition that the Aurora Store creators don’t serve us a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Man in the Middle</a> attack</strong>. The decision whether you trust the creators of this app is up to you.</p>

<h4 id="list-of-apps-whose-functionality-without-gms-i-have-verified">List of apps whose functionality without GMS I have verified</h4>

<p>Below I present a list of applications that I downloaded from the Aurora Store, checked, and can confirm that they work without GMS (Google Mobile Services).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Allegro</strong> - shopping</li>
  <li><strong>Apple Music</strong> - yes, I didn’t manage to give this up when ditching the iPhone</li>
  <li><strong>Apple TV</strong> - comes in a bundle, but if it didn’t I’d cancel the subscription, because Stremio is enough for me</li>
  <li><strong>Biedronka</strong> - grocery promos</li>
  <li><strong>Bolt</strong> - taxis</li>
  <li><strong>Booksy</strong> - barber</li>
  <li><strong>BPme</strong> - fuel promos</li>
  <li><strong>CityParkApp</strong> - city parking</li>
  <li><strong>Decathlon</strong> - I got rid of it, but it worked</li>
  <li><strong>DeepL</strong> - translator, is there any open-source alternative that is equally good?</li>
  <li><strong>Discord</strong> - after recent events I’ll probably get rid of it, because I basically don’t use it</li>
  <li><strong>Duolingo</strong> - the owl! learning Italian together is a daily routine for my daughters</li>
  <li><strong>DWService</strong> - remote desktop</li>
  <li><strong>Ekstraliga</strong> (speedway) - I’m a psycho fan</li>
  <li><strong>epark</strong> - city parking</li>
  <li><strong>Formula 1</strong> - I’m a psycho fan</li>
  <li><strong>Geoportal Mobile</strong> - spatial development plans, buggy as hell app, but works better than the mobile web version</li>
  <li><strong>GitHub</strong> - I know there is the OpenHub alternative, but it crashes for me after logging into GH</li>
  <li><strong>My municipality’s app</strong> - because I need to know when they’ll collect my trash :)</li>
  <li><strong>Jakdojade</strong> - bus schedules</li>
  <li><strong>Lidl Plus</strong> - grocery promos</li>
  <li><strong>LiveKid</strong> - communication with my daughter’s kindergarten</li>
  <li><strong>Messanger</strong> - shame on me, but unfortunately I have friends who can’t imagine life without FB…</li>
  <li><strong>OLX</strong> - local classifieds, I basically only use it for notifications</li>
  <li><strong>OpenVPN</strong> - I use it as a tunnel to my home network</li>
  <li><strong>park4night</strong> - great app for finding parking on vacation (not only in a camper)</li>
  <li><strong>Pepper</strong> - bargain hunting</li>
  <li><strong>Perplexity</strong> - I switched to Gemini, but I confirm it works</li>
  <li><strong>Synology Photos</strong> - my home photo gallery on a NAS</li>
  <li><strong>Pocket Casts</strong> - podcasts, I plan to migrate to AntennaPod</li>
  <li><strong>Reddit</strong> - honestly I don’t know why I need the app, but it works</li>
  <li><strong>Reolink</strong> - home monitoring</li>
  <li><strong>SmartLife</strong> - anyone who has anything smart from China knows what this is for</li>
  <li><strong>Tapo</strong> - home cameras</li>
  <li><strong>Termius</strong> - here I’m also looking for some open-source alternative</li>
  <li><strong>Tether</strong> - managing TP-Link routers</li>
  <li><strong>TickTick</strong> - to-do lists, it’s hard for me to find a sensible alternative that is multiplatform and has all the features I need</li>
  <li><strong>TV Time</strong> - tracking what series and movies I’ve watched (I might actually be interested in finding an alternative here too)</li>
  <li><strong>Zepp</strong> - dedicated app for the Amazfit Balance smartwatch I use</li>
  <li><strong>ZeroTier</strong> - I used it instead of OpenVPN back when I didn’t have fiber optic yet, just radio internet</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="full-control-over-app-permissions">Full control over app permissions</h3>

<p>GrapheneOS allows for full control over what permissions each application can have. For example, in conventional Android forks, every application by default has granted <strong>Network</strong> (internet access) and <strong>Sensors</strong> (access to all sensors like the accelerometer) permissions.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever wondered <strong>if all apps on a phone need Internet access?</strong> Indeed, in the vast majority of cases, a mobile app without network access is useless, but you can’t generalize like that, because for example, the previously mentioned <strong>FUTO Voice Input</strong> uses a local LLM to convert speech to text, which works offline on the device. Why would such an app need Internet access then? For nothing, so <strong>it shouldn’t have such permission</strong>. Now let’s take apps like FairScan (document scanning), Catima (loyalty card aggregator), Collabora Office (office suite), or Librera (ebook reader). They too <strong>do not need Internet access!</strong></p>

<p>The situation looks even more bizarre when you look at which apps actually need access to all of our device’s sensors. If we think about it calmly, we’ll conclude that in this specific case it’s completely the opposite of the previous one, meaning <strong>practically no app needs this information</strong>. And I remind you that <strong>by default on Android with Google services, all apps have such permissions</strong>.</p>

<p>To manage a given application’s permissions, just <strong>tap and hold on its icon</strong>, select <strong>App info</strong> from the pop-up menu, and find the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab. A list categorized by things like - <strong>Allowed</strong>, <strong>Ask every time</strong>, and <strong>Not allowed</strong> will appear. I recommend reviewing this list for each app separately right after installing it. This is <strong>the foundation of GrapheneOS hardening</strong>.</p>

<p>A collective menu where you can view specific permissions and which apps have them granted is available in <strong>Settings -&gt; Security &amp; privacy -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Permission manager</strong>. Another interesting place is the <strong>Privacy dashboard</strong> available in the same location. It’s a tool that shows not only app permissions, but also how often a given app reaches for the permissions granted to it.</p>

<h3 id="private-space">Private space</h3>

<p>In GrapheneOS we don’t only have user profiles, but each user can also have something called a <strong>Private space</strong>. I encountered something similar on Samsung, where it was called <strong>Secure Folder</strong>, so I assume this might just be an Android feature implemented differently by each manufacturer.</p>

<p>Private space is turned on in <strong>Settings -&gt; Security &amp; privacy -&gt; Private space</strong>. It acts like a sort of separated sandbox that is part of the environment you use, but at the same time is isolated from it. For me, it’s a place that gives me quick access to apps that nevertheless require Google services. You might ask - why then do I keep the mBank and T-Mobile apps on the <strong>Owner</strong> user if I could keep them here? Well, for reasons unknown to me, I’m unable to configure my private space so that paying with contactless BLIK via NFC works correctly in it. The same goes for Magenta Moments from T-Mobile, which don’t work correctly despite GMS being installed in the private space.</p>

<h4 id="list-of-apps-in-my-private-space">List of apps in my private space</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Drive</strong> - I use it as a cloud to share files with clients</li>
  <li><strong>Finax</strong> - saving for retirement under PEPP</li>
  <li><strong>IKO</strong> - PKO BP bank app, treasury bonds plus PPK</li>
  <li><strong>InPost Mobile</strong> - parcel lockers, location doesn’t work for me in the private space either (the phone doesn’t send its position to the app), so I use QR codes like some Neanderthal</li>
  <li><strong>mBank</strong> - again, because while contactless payment doesn’t work for me here, other banking app functions work normally (including BLIK code payments, as well as confirming transactions with biometrics)</li>
  <li><strong>mObywatel</strong> - at first I kept this app in the main profile as downloaded from Aurora Store and everything somewhat worked, but every now and then the app caught a total freeze and stopped responding, I think it might be related to the fact that it does send some Google services-related requests in the background and doesn’t respond until such a request times out, I have this on my list to investigate</li>
  <li><strong>mojeIKP</strong> - lately I’ve been having more and more health problems, I’m clearly not as indestructible anymore, so such a geriatric app is simply essential for me</li>
  <li><strong>Mój T-Mobile</strong> - duplicated just like the mBank app, because everything works except Magenta Moments</li>
  <li><strong>Orlen Vitay</strong> - this app didn’t work for me without GMS, so sort of a D minus for Orlen, because the app from BP doesn’t have such a problem</li>
  <li><strong>Revolut</strong> - basically it probably doesn’t require GMS, but I decided I’ll just keep all financial apps in the private space</li>
  <li><strong>Santander</strong> - another banking app…</li>
  <li><strong>Play Store</strong> - I have to download all these apps from somewhere, doing it via Aurora Store in the private space wouldn’t make sense since I have the whole Google services package installed here anyway</li>
  <li><strong>XTB</strong> - another investing app… works without GMS, but like I said, I keep all financial ones in one place</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Oof… I did it again, sorry. I’m just counting the characters and it comes out to just under 35,000… I’ll probably break that barrier with these next few sentences. Well, long again, but purely meaty again, so I don’t think anyone has reason to complain. As I mentioned earlier, I’ve only touched upon the topic of GrapheneOS, which is extensive, and it’s a good thing, because it’s a <strong>great system</strong>, and the biggest <strong>respect goes to the people behind this project</strong>. It’s thanks to them that we even have the option of at least partially <strong>freeing ourselves from Google (Android) and Apple (iOS)</strong>. Therefore, I highly invite you to the final chapter of this post.</p>

<h2 id="supporting-the-grapheneos-project">Supporting the GrapheneOS project</h2>

<p>Finally, I would like to encourage you to <strong>support the GrapheneOS project</strong>. The developers behind it are doing a really great job and in my opinion deserve to have some money thrown at them. Information on where and how this can be done can be found <strong><a href="https://grapheneos.org/donate">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p><em>This post is an elaboration of a <a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2021/05/29/objectives-and-constraints/">shorter post I wrote about five years ago</a>.</em></p>



<p>The two management giants of the mid-twentieth century were Peter Drucker and W. Edwards Deming. Ironically, while Drucker hails from Austria-Hungary (like me, Drucker emigrated to the U.S. as an adult) and Deming was born in the U.S., it was Drucker that proved to be more influential in America. Deming’s influence was much greater in Japan than it ever was the U.S. If you’ve ever been at an organization that uses OKRs, then you have worked in the shadow of Drucker’s legacy. While you can tell a story about how Deming influenced Toyota, and Toyota inspired the lean<em> </em>movement, I would still describe management in the U.S. as <em>Deming in exile</em>. Deming explicitly stated that management by objectives isn’t leadership, and I think you’d be hard-pressed to find managers in American companies who would agree with that sentiment.</p>

<p>Here I want to talk about why I think it is that Drucker’s ideas were stickier than Deming’s in the U.S. It all comes down to the nature of organizations and people. </p>

Not to scale.</figcaption></figure>



<p>An organization is a big, hairy, complex mess, and the bigger the organization is, the hairier and more complex it gets. Managers, on the other hand, have a very finite amount of bandwidth. There are only so many hours in a day, and this number does not increase with the complexity of an organization. And, let’s face it, they’re spending something close to 100% of that bandwidth attending meetings.</p>



<p>How is a manger to make sense of this mess?</p>



<h2>OKRs as a mess-reduction mechanism</h2>



<p>In the Druckerian approach of OKRs, you set a small number of <em>objectives</em>, and then you identify quantifiable <em>key results</em> for each objective that provide a signal about whether progress towards the objective is being made, and then you monitor the key results. Key results reduce the bandwidth required to make sense of what’s happening in the system. Instead of the blooming, buzzing confusion of the entire system, monitoring key results means you can filter out all of that unnecessary detail to focus specifically on the aspects that are relevant to the bandwidth-limited manager. It’s no coincidence that when John Doerr wrote a book on his experience with OKRs at Intel and how he brought them to Google, he titled his book <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/measure-what-matters-how-google-bono-and-the-gates-foundation-rock-the-world-with-okrs-john-doerr/81baba4bd4bb8c25?ean=9780525536222&amp;next=t">Measure What Matters</a>.</p>

<p>The beauty of a set of key results is that they take the messiness of the system as input and create a neat summary in spreadsheet or slide format as output.</p>



<h2>Deming’s critique</h2>



<p>Deming’s approach to the problem of management was radically different from Drucker’s. In his book <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/out-of-the-crisis-reissue-w-edwards-deming/6697a386cfa66ed3?ean=9780262535946&amp;next=t">Out of the Crisis</a>, Deming puts his criticism of the Drucker-ish approach in stark terms. He uses the term <em>deadly disease</em> to describe managing through numerical targets.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers, numerical goals. Substitute leadership.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Deming’s perspective can be summed up with the old saying: <em>if you don’t change the system, the system doesn’t change.</em>  He argued that if you wanted improvements, you had to make systemic changes. Furthermore, you had to understand the system if you wanted to come up with a system improvement that would actually work. </p>

<h2>Classical control versus statistical control </h2>



<p>Deming was not opposed to the idea of goals: indeed, he was a passionate believer that management should strive to improve quality and productivity, and both of those are goals. He was also not opposed to metrics: he was an advocate of applying Walter Shewhart’s statistical techniques for management. It’s the <em>use</em> of metrics that’s radically different in the two approaches.</p>



<p>The Drucker-ian approach is akin to a classical control system, like a thermostat. Specifying the key results are like setting the desired temperature (say, 68°F), and then the thermostat generates output in order to bring the current temperature of the room in line with the setpoint.</p>

<p>The idea here is that you give the organization a setpoint, and it will implement the control system that will work to achieve the setpoint.</p>



<p>Deming wrote in explicit terms about control, but he meant it in a different sense: we wrote about statistical process control, and statistical process control is about the <em>variability</em> of the output. I’ve written about statistical process control <a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/11/27/fun-with-incident-data-and-statistical-process-control/">before</a>, but here I’ll touch on the concepts again, with an example. Let’s imagine we are observing the behavior of two brands of thermostats, A and B, each controlling the temperature of a different room.  Both thermostats have the same setpoint of 68°F. We observed their behavior by graphing the temperature of the two rooms over time. </p>

<p>Note how the points for thermostat A all fall within a narrow band, whereas for thermostat B there are many more outliers. We’d say that thermostat A is under statistical process control whether thermostat B is not, even though the average temperature for thermostat B is closer to the setpoint then the average temperature for thermostat A. (In practice, you’d draw a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart">control chart</a> to identify whether the system is under statistical control). </p>



<p>Deming argued that you had to understand whether your system was under statistical control in order to determine what intervention to do in order to make an improvement. For example, if your system was out of control, the next intervention would be to do a qualitative investigation into the outliers. On the other hand, if the system was under statistical control, then you’d have to figure out what systemic change to make to improve things.</p>



<p>Note how you <em>build</em> a classical control system, whereas you <em>observe</em> whether your system is under statistical process control. Statistical process control is about understanding the system. </p>



<h2>Drucker makes a manager’s life easier, Deming makes it harder</h2>

<p>One of the virtues of OKRs is that they are straightforward for managers to apply. You set direction by specifying objectives, and you enforce accountability by monitoring key results. Applying Deming’s approach, on the other hand, requires a much greater commitment of management bandwidth. Drucker offers a control mechanism with a bounded amount of information, where Deming requires a never-ending research program, with no upper bound on the kind of information that might be relevant. In fact, the information might even be unobservable. Deming approvingly quotes the statistician Lloyd Nelson, who said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The most important figures needed for management of any organization are unknown and unknowable.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Myself, I’m in the Deming camp, but I can see why Drucker’s ideas won out. In reliability, we talk about “making the right thing easy and the wrong thing hard”, other people call this <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">The Pit of Success</a>. The rationale is that people will tend to do the easy thing over the hard thing. And managers are people too. But sometimes the right thing to do is the harder one, and nothing can be done about that. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had a theory for most of my adult life: hard days at work burn a lot of calories. The kind of days where you're deep in complex problems for eight hours straight, making decisions, debugging, writing. By evening, I'd feel utterly drained. Surely all that thinking was metabolically expensive. Surely it justified skipping the interval session I'd planned.</p>
<p>Then I looked at the numbers. And then I looked at what that cognitive exhaustion was actually doing to my workouts. The first part was humbling. The second part was alarming.</p>
<h2>Your brain is expensive, but thinking is cheap</h2>
<p>Your brain consumes roughly 20 to 25% of your body's total energy at rest. For an organ that accounts for about 2% of your body weight, that's extraordinarily costly. It runs almost exclusively on glucose, consuming about 120 grams per day, and it can't store meaningful reserves. It needs a constant supply delivered through the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Here's the part that surprised me: almost all of that energy goes to baseline maintenance. Keeping 86 billion neurons electrically charged. Maintaining synaptic connections. Running the background processes that keep you conscious and breathing and aware of your surroundings. The "idle cost" of having a brain is enormous.</p>
<p>The incremental cost of actually thinking hard? <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/thinking-hard-calories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Almost nothing</a>. Studies measuring brain glucose consumption during demanding cognitive tasks find increases of only about 5% above baseline. Over the course of a full day of intense mental work, that translates to maybe 100 to 200 extra calories. That's a banana and a half.</p>
<p>Even chess grandmasters, who sit for hours in states of intense concentration, burn only about <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-many-calories-chess-players-burn-2019-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.67 calories per minute</a> while playing, compared to 1.53 calories per minute at rest. A 10% premium for one of the most cognitively demanding activities humans engage in.</p>
<p>The reason is structural. Your brain's energy budget is dominated by housekeeping. Maintaining the electrochemical gradients across neuronal membranes, the resting activity of vast neural networks, the constant baseline hum of consciousness. Conscious thought, the stuff that feels effortful, is a thin layer of activity on top of this expensive foundation. It's like turning on a desk lamp in a building where the HVAC system already runs 24 hours a day. The lamp is real. It's just not where the bill comes from.</p>
<p>So no, your day of deep work didn't burn enough extra calories to justify the extra slice of pizza. I found this mildly deflating. But what I found next was far more consequential.</p>
<h2>The 15% problem</h2>
<p>In 2009, Samuele Marcora and colleagues at Bangor University published a <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.91324.2008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study in the Journal of Applied Physiology</a> that I think about every time I consider training after a long cognitive day.</p>
<p>They had 16 subjects complete two experimental conditions. In one, participants performed 90 minutes of a demanding cognitive task (the AX-CPT, a sustained attention test that requires continuous vigilance and response inhibition). In the other, they watched emotionally neutral documentaries for the same duration. Then both groups cycled to exhaustion at 80% of peak power output.</p>
<p>The mentally fatigued group quit 15% sooner. They lasted 640 seconds compared to 754 seconds for the control group.</p>
<p>Here's the part that makes this study remarkable: every physiological variable the researchers measured was identical between conditions. Heart rate, cardiac output, blood lactate, oxygen consumption, muscle glycogen use. None of it differed. The bodies of the mentally fatigued subjects were functioning normally. They had plenty of physical capacity left.</p>
<p>What differed was perceived exertion. The mentally fatigued group rated the same absolute workload as significantly harder. They reached their <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/internal-negotiation-heart-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">psychological ceiling</a>, the point where continuing felt impossible, earlier. Not because their muscles had failed, but because their brains reported the effort as unbearable sooner.</p>
<p>The workout was the same. The body was the same. The brain's interpretation of it was different. And that difference cost them 15% of their endurance.</p>
<h2>This isn't one study</h2>
<p>When I first read Marcora's experiment, I wondered if it was a fluke. It wasn't.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28044281/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2017 systematic review in Sports Medicine</a> by Van Cutsem and colleagues analyzed 11 studies examining mental fatigue and physical performance. The finding was consistent across all of them: mental fatigue impaired endurance performance through elevated perceived exertion while leaving traditional physiological markers unchanged.</p>
<p>The effect showed up in cycling, running, and other endurance tasks. The impairment was specific to sustained effort, not maximal strength or short anaerobic bursts. And the mechanism was always the same: the body was fine, but the brain made everything feel harder than it actually was.</p>
<p>This is the same perceptual channel that <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/boredom-not-fatigue-ruins-workouts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boredom operates through</a>, and the same one that the <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/internal-negotiation-heart-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal negotiation during hard intervals</a> runs on. Your brain's effort-monitoring system has limited bandwidth. When that system is already taxed from hours of cognitive work, it inflates the perceived cost of everything that follows.</p>
<h2>What's actually happening in your brain</h2>
<p>The leading explanation for why this happens involves a molecule you're already familiar with if you drink coffee: adenosine.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24504653/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pageaux and colleagues proposed in 2014</a> that prolonged cognitive activity increases adenosine accumulation in specific brain regions, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC sits at the intersection of effort perception, motor planning, and executive control. It's the region that integrates signals about how hard something feels and decides whether to keep going.</p>
<p>Adenosine is a byproduct of neuronal activity. When your brain works hard for extended periods, adenosine accumulates as neurons fire repeatedly and break down ATP (the cellular energy currency). Adenosine then binds to receptors that inhibit further neural firing, essentially acting as the brain's fatigue signal. It's the same molecule that builds up throughout the day and makes you sleepy by evening. It's also the molecule that <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/does-caffeine-improve-vo2-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caffeine blocks</a> by occupying the same receptors without activating them.</p>
<p>The hypothesis is elegant: hours of demanding cognitive work flood the ACC with adenosine. When you then ask your body to exercise, the ACC, already loaded with this inhibitory molecule, generates a louder effort signal than usual. The same physical workload now <em>feels</em> harder because the neural machinery responsible for assessing effort is running in a compromised state.</p>
<p>Supporting evidence comes from multiple directions. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29509641/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caffeine, an adenosine antagonist, counteracts the effect</a>, improving endurance by roughly 14% in mentally fatigued individuals. Sleep deprivation, which also increases brain adenosine, produces similar impairments in endurance through the same perceptual pathway. And tasks requiring response inhibition and sustained attention, which heavily recruit the ACC, produce the strongest mental fatigue effects on subsequent exercise.</p>
<h2>Why this matters for your VO₂ max</h2>
<p>Improving <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VO₂ max</a> requires training at specific intensities. The <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/how-to-improve-vo2-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4x4 interval protocol</a>, arguably the best-studied method for boosting cardiovascular fitness, demands four minutes at 90 to 95% of your maximum heart rate. That's the <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/heart-rate-zone-that-improves-vo2-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zone 4 territory</a> where real cardiovascular adaptation happens.</p>
<p>But hitting that zone requires tolerating significant discomfort. The <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/internal-negotiation-heart-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal negotiation</a> that kicks in during minute two or three of a hard interval is already a close call on a good day. If your brain's effort-assessment system is pre-loaded with adenosine from eight hours of demanding work, that negotiation tips against you earlier. You bail on the last interval. Or you never quite reach 90% because the perceived effort hits your ceiling at 85%.</p>
<p>Over weeks and months, this quietly degrades training quality. You're doing the sessions, logging the time, showing up consistently. But you're systematically underperforming during the efforts that actually <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/why-your-vo2-max-not-improving" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drive adaptation</a>. The trend line on your <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/find-vo2-max-on-apple-watch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Watch</a> stays flat, and you can't figure out why.</p>
<p>I experienced this pattern without understanding it. My Tuesday evening interval sessions, scheduled after long workdays, consistently felt worse than my Saturday morning sessions. I blamed sleep, stress, hydration. Those all matter, but the research suggests the cognitive load itself was a primary culprit.</p>
<h2>What you can do about it</h2>
<p>This isn't a problem you can willpower your way through. The adenosine is physically present in your brain. Telling yourself to try harder doesn't clear it. But there are structural adjustments that help.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule hard sessions strategically.</strong> If you follow the <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/how-to-improve-vo2-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80/20 polarized model</a>, you only have one or two high-intensity sessions per week. Those are the ones that drive VO₂ max improvement. Try to place them on days with lower cognitive demand, or earlier in the day before the accumulated mental load peaks. A morning interval session before work is neurochemically different from an evening session after eight hours of complex problem-solving.</p>
<p><strong>Use caffeine intentionally.</strong> Since caffeine directly blocks adenosine receptors, it can partially counteract the mental fatigue effect. A dose of 3 to 6 mg per kilogram of body weight, taken <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/does-caffeine-improve-vo2-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">45 to 60 minutes before training</a>, is well-supported by research. But this works best if you don't already rely on caffeine throughout the day, since chronic use leads to receptor upregulation that blunts the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Protect your easy days.</strong> <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/heart-rate-zone-that-improves-vo2-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zone 2 sessions</a> are more forgiving of mental fatigue because they operate at intensities where perceived exertion stays low. If you've had a brutal day at work, an easy run still provides aerobic benefit without requiring the high effort tolerance that mental fatigue compromises. Save the intervals for a fresher day. This is also where <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/boredom-not-fatigue-ruins-workouts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">music or podcasts</a> pay dividends, since the attentional demands of Zone 2 are low enough for external stimulation to keep you engaged.</p>
<p><strong>Consider a brief cognitive reset.</strong> There's some evidence that even 20 to 30 minutes of low-demand activity between cognitive work and exercise can help. A walk outside, a stretch, something that doesn't require sustained attention. It won't fully clear the adenosine, but it may provide enough neural recovery to shift the perceived exertion curve back toward something manageable.</p>
<h2>The deeper insight</h2>
<p>What fascinates me about this research is what it reveals about the relationship between mental and physical performance. We tend to treat them as separate systems. Your brain does the thinking, your body does the moving. But the evidence shows they share a common metabolic currency. The adenosine that accumulates from cognitive work doesn't stay in some isolated cognitive compartment. It infiltrates the neural circuits that govern physical effort perception.</p>
<p>Your post-work exhaustion isn't imaginary. It's just not caloric. The brain spent almost no extra energy thinking all day, but it produced real metabolic byproducts that change how hard everything else feels. The tiredness is neurochemical, not energetic.</p>
<p>Understanding this reframed how I think about <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/recovery-affects-vo2-max-more-than-effort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recovery</a>. Recovery isn't just about muscles and sleep. It's about the state of your brain when you begin a session. A well-rested nervous system with low adenosine load will perceive the same workout as easier, sustain higher intensities longer, and extract more <a href="https://vo2maxpro.com/blog/how-long-it-takes-to-improve-vo2-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cardiovascular adaptation</a> from the same training plan.</p>
<p>The calories your brain burns barely register. The residue it leaves behind can cost you the workout that matters most.</p>

But that was about it.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>They contacted Facebook, which at the time dominated the social media landscape, asking for help scouring uploaded family photos - to see if Lucy was in any of them. But Facebook, despite having facial recognition technology, said it "did not have the tools" to help.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>So Squire and his colleagues analysed everything they could see in Lucy's room: the bedspread, her outfits, her stuffed toys. Looking for any element which might help.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And then they had a minor breakthrough. The team discovered that a sofa seen in some of the images was only sold regionally, not nationally, and therefore had a more limited customer base.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But that still amounted to about 40,000 people.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"At that point in the investigation, we're [still] looking at 29 states here in the US.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Over the weekend Ars Technica <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/">retracted an article</a> because the AI a writer used <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjedwards.com/post/3mewgow6ch22p">hallucinated quotes</a> from an open source library maintainer.</p><p>The irony here is the maintainer in question, Scott Shambaugh, was <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/">harassed by someone's AI agent</a> over not merging it's AI slop code.</p><p>It's likely the bot was running through someone's local 'agentic AI' instance (likely using OpenClaw). The guy who built OpenClaw was just hired by OpenAI to "work on bringing agents to everyone." You'll have to forgive me if I'm not enthusastic about that.</p><h2 id="video">Video</h2><p>This blog post is a lightly-edited transcript of the video I published to YouTube today. Scroll past the video embed if you're like me, and you'd rather read the text :)</p><div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZJ7A1QoUEI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><h2 id="impacts-on-open-source">Impacts on Open Source</h2><p>Last month, even before OpenClaw's release, curl maintainer Daniel Stenberg <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2026/01/26/the-end-of-the-curl-bug-bounty/">dropped bug bounties</a> because AI slop resulted in actual <em>useful</em> vulnerability reports going from 15% of all submissions down to 5%.</p><p>And that's not the worst of it—the authors of these bug reports seem to have a more entitled attitude:</p><blockquote><p>These "helpers" try too hard to twist whatever they find into something horribly bad and a critical vulnerability, but they rarely actively contribute to actually improve curl. They can go to extreme efforts to argue and insist on their specific current finding, but not to write a fix or work with the team on improving curl long-term etc. I don't think we need more of that.</p></blockquote><p>These agentic AI users don't care about curl. They don't care about Daniel or other open source maintainers. They just want to grab quick cash bounties using their private AI army.</p><p>I manage <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy">over 300 open source projects</a>, and while many are more niche than curl or matplotlib, I've seen my own increase in AI slop PRs.</p><p>It's gotten <em>so</em> bad, GitHub added a feature to <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-13-new-repository-settings-for-configuring-pull-request-access/">disable Pull Requests entirely</a>. Pull Requests are the fundamental thing that made GitHub popular. And now we'll see that feature closed off in more and more repos.</p><p>AI slop generation is getting easier, but it's not getting smarter. From what I've seen, models have <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2025/9/an-ai-plateau">hit a plateau</a> where code generation is <em>pretty good</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>...</p><p>But it's not improving like it did the past few years. The problem is the humans who <em>review</em> the code—who are responsible for the useful software that keeps our systems going—don't have infinite resources (unlike AI companies).</p><p>Some people suggest AI could take over code review too, but that's not the answer.</p><p>If you're running a personal weather dashboard or building a toy server for your Homelab, fine. But I wouldn't run my production apps—that actually make money or could cause harm if they break—on unreviewed AI code.</p><p>If this was a problem already, OpenClaw's release, and this hiring by OpenAI to democratize agentic AI further, will only make it worse. Right now the AI craze feels the same as the <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/what-happened-to-nfts-094039263.html">crypto and NFT boom</a>, with the same signs of insane behavior and reckless optimism.</p><p>The difference is there's more useful purposes for LLMs and machine learning, so scammers can point to those uses as they bring down everything good in the name of their AI god.</p><p>Since my video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rbz0akyLyQ">The RAM Shortage Comes for Us All</a> in December, we have <em>hard drives</em> as the next looming AI-related shortage, as <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/western-digital-is-already-sold-out-of-hard-drives-for-all-of-2026-chief-says-some-long-term-agreements-for-2027-and-2028-already-in-place">Western Digital just announced</a> they're already sold through their inventory for 2026.</p><p>Some believe the AI bubble isn't a bubble, but those people are misguided, just like the AI that hallucinated the quotes in that Ars Technica article.</p><p>And they say <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=375826">"this time it's different"</a>, but it's not. The same signs are there from other crashes. The big question I have is, how many other things will AI companies destroy before they have to pay their dues.</p></section></div>]]></description>

<p>During the rapid technological advancements of the early 1990s, the video game industry was on the cusp of a massive addition - <span>another dimension</span>. With console shenanigans like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_FX">Super FX chip</a> giving players a taste of 3D, hype was at an all-time high.  But the games released for home consoles were nothing compared to what arcade developers were capable of doing. By employing gigantic budgets and cutting-edge hardware, the arcade gave players a chance to see the future, today.</p>



<p>But the future eventually arrived with the launch of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_of_video_game_consoles">5th generation of consoles</a>.  All of a sudden, the revolutionary 3D hardware features that were once exclusive to arcades were now available in home consoles.  Without next-generation hype pushing players into the arcade, powerful but expensive arcade machines were no longer sustainable to develop.  The industry adjusted by moving toward more cost effective solutions, with many turning to the inexpensive, already proven 3D-capable hardware available in 5th gen home consoles.</p>
<p>Rather than turning around the decline of the arcade, the cheaper hardware may have helped accelerate it.  There were fewer unique experiences to pull players into the arcade, and previous hit exclusives were now seeing high quality home console ports that allowed them to be enjoyed without munching quarters.  When the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_generation_of_video_game_consoles">6th generation</a> arrived with the Dreamcast and the PlayStation 2, many arcade stalwarts waved the white flag and started to shift their arcade divisions to home console projects, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_May_Cry_2">with mixed success</a>.</p>
<p>Sega was among those hit hardest by this era.  They produced some of the greatest arcade thrills of the 1990s and enjoyed massive success in the home console market with the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.  But a string of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32X">mistakes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Saturn">miscalculations</a> combined with the slumping arcade industry sent them to the brink of bankruptcy.  By 2002, the Dreamcast had been soundly defeated by the launch of the PlayStation 2, and Sega began <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Sonic_Adventure_2:_Battle">porting</a> some of their <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Skies_of_Arcadia_Legends">hits</a> to their former rivals' hardware just to stay afloat.</p>
<p>The home market was lost, but the languishing arcade scene presented Sega with an opportunity.  They still had legendary arcade development teams, and if Sega could leverage them to produce a wave of arcade hits, they would be in a position to dominate a new era of arcades when most others were changing gears.  There was just one problem: Sega didn't have the resources that they once did.  If they were going to do this, they needed some help.</p>
<p>And so they did something that would have been considered unthinkable just five years prior.  Sega teamed up with Nintendo to develop a <em>GameCube-based arcade platform</em>.  Bolstering their ranks was Namco, another coin-op stalwart with tons of arcade veterans.</p>
<p>Three companies, one mission: Triforce.</p>

<h3 id="triforce-hardware"><strong>Triforce Hardware</strong><a href="#triforce-hardware" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>While Triforce was a collaboration project, it still feels like a very <em>Sega coded</em> arcade system.  It can even use certain <a href="https://segaretro.org/Sega_NAOMI">NAOMI</a> style components!  Along with the Xbox-based <a href="https://segaretro.org/Sega_Chihiro">Chihiro</a>, the Triforce is sometimes considered a successor to the <a href="https://segaretro.org/Sega_NAOMI_2">NAOMI 2</a>.</p>




<p><br>
Inside of this metal shell is... a GameCube!  Quite literally, actually.</p>



<p>The Triforce hardware is built around a stock GameCube motherboard, with two Triforce-specific boards attached to it: the AM-Baseboard and AM-Mediaboard. The <em>AM</em> (Amusement Machine) boards are the secret sauce of the Triforce and transform the stock GameCube into something capable of producing arcade experiences.</p>
<p>The early boot process is the same as a retail console, but a modified GameCube IPL (sometimes referred to as the GameCube BIOS) is used to initialize the Triforce hardware and load the Triforce equivalent of a "home menu", Segaboot.</p>


<p>Segaboot is a special disc image on the Mediaboard that can be loaded by the Triforce at will through special commands. It is responsible for loading the actual game and for providing the Service Menu,  where the operator can run hardware tests and change settings on the machine.</p>
<p>By using <a href="https://github.com/webhdx/PicoBoot">Picoboot</a> to override the boot process, it is possible to load a standard GameCube IPL or homebrew like <a href="https://github.com/emukidid/swiss-gc">Swiss</a>.  And since all of the pins are still on the mainboard, we can also connect a standard GameCube front panel and even load full GameCube games from microSD over Serial Port 2!</p>


<p>The Baseboard is primarily responsible for input and output.  It handles translation between JVS I/O devices (more on those later) and the GameCube's <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Hardware/Serial_Interface">SI bus</a>. It also takes the GameCube's digital video output and feeds it to two VGA ports on the back of the main unit.</p>


<p>The Mediaboard's most important responsibility is storing and serving the game software to the GameCube.  It is also used to handle other tasks, such as networking, through special commands.</p>


<p>The Triforce Baseboard was mostly unchanged throughout the Triforce's lifespan, but the Mediaboard could vary depending on the developer, game, and when the game was released.  In fact, games weren't guaranteed to even come out on the same storage medium!</p>
<h4 id="format-wars"><strong>Format Wars</strong><a href="#format-wars" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>A spinning disc and active laser were not <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_Lair_(1983_video_game)">normally</a></em> considered reliable enough for an arcade environment.  These machines will be on all day, every day for <em>years</em>, and players were often rough on machines that they didn't own. So, the Triforce eschews the standard GameCube mini-DVD alike format for its own storage solutions. </p>
<p>Most games were designed for the DIMM (Dual In-line Memory Module) variant of the Triforce, where game data is shipped on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GD-ROM">GD-ROM</a> and loaded into RAM on the first boot.  GD (Gigabyte Disc) was a format initially devised by Sega and Yamaha for use in the Dreamcast. By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-density_compact_disc">increasing the data density</a> of ordinary compact disc technology, the 12cm GD-ROM had somewhat comparable capacity to the GameCube's DVD-based 8cm disc (1GiB versus 1.46GiB).</p>
<p>Were GD-ROM drives more reliable than early DVD drives?  Maybe!  By this point, GD-ROM was an established technology that Sega was already using in arcades for years.  Perhaps even more importantly, it was <em>cheaper</em>.  Sega designed it so they could even reuse GD-ROM drives designed for their other arcade platforms, since they used a generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_SCSI">SCSI</a>-style connector.  </p>


<p>DIMM variant Triforces came with stickers advertising the amount of DIMM RAM on the Mediaboard. These stickers caused some confusion in the enthusiast community, as people would often mistake the amount listed as the total RAM accessible to the game. In reality, the DIMM RAM was mostly intended for use as a read-only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM_drive">RAM drive</a>, rather than for general purpose use. As previously mentioned, the Triforce hardware is based around a stock GameCube motherboard, so games can only access the same 24+16 MiB of RAM that a retail GameCube uses. </p>


<p>Once the game was loaded into memory, it was intended to stay there. And thanks to a battery backup that maintained the data even in the event of a power failure, the GD-ROM may only be needed once in the entire lifetime of the machine. <em>This</em> was their secret toward making the Triforce GD-ROM drive reliable for the arcade.  One of the main exceptions would be if a new disc were inserted.  Many Triforce games saw updates, which could be shipped on new GD-ROMs. </p>
<p>Namco's Triforce games ditched the GD-ROM and DIMM RAM and instead used 512MB NAND cartridges to store game data. The NAND retains its contents even if the system loses power and the backup battery runs dry, which eliminates the need for GD-ROMs.  These games also saw updates through SD card or over the internet, with updates able to directly modify the NAND contents.</p>




<p>Both methods of storing Triforce game data have the same goal in the end: deliver a disc image to the internal GameCube. In addition to the GD-ROM or NAND cartridge, each game also has a corresponding security key that must be inserted into the Triforce unit in order for the game to run.</p>
<h4 id="type-1-type-3-and-saving-in-arcades"><strong>Type 1, Type 3, and Saving in Arcades</strong><a href="#type-1-type-3-and-saving-in-arcades" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>There are two variants of Triforce I/O: Type 1 and Type 3.  These refer to the Sega JVS Type 1 and Sega JVS Type 3.  JVS stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Amusement_Machine_and_Marketing_Association#Video">JAMMA Video Standard</a>, a common standard created by a group of Japanese game companies for connecting various accessories and controllers to arcade systems.  It's easiest to think of JVS I/O as the arcade equivalent to USB.  Other Sega JVS I/O compatible devices can work with the Triforce even if they were originally designed for other arcade platforms, but it's up to the game developers to actually add support for a particular piece of hardware.  Type 3 Triforces also have the capability to support more complicated analog input devices.</p>
<p>Whether it was Type 1 or Type 3, Sega had a trick that was instrumental to their efforts to revive the arcade scene and almost <em>every</em> Triforce game would use it.  It was a revolutionary idea that had taken hold in the home console market but was still rare to see in arcades: saving and continuing.</p>
<p>By using cheap cards that could hold a small amount of data, players could buy what amounted to a small memory card directly from the arcade machine using a built-in vendor.  These cards could be bought for as cheap as a single credit in some cases, and had enough storage to save progress, preferences, and other unlocks.  Because the data wasn't locked to the machine, these cards allowed the player to continue their progress from any arcade that had the game and a working card slot.</p>
<p>The end goal of this was to get players more invested in arcade experiences by having them progress and unlock content.  Some Triforce games are full of so many unlockables that it'd be impossible to see everything in a single session at the arcade.</p>


<p>Triforce games can support two types of cards for saving: Magnetic Cards (magcards) and Integrated Circuit (IC) cards.  Magcards are cheaper, fragile, and can only survive so many writes before failing.  They have the added bonus of having a printable side, where the game can print a player's achievements and more.  IC cards are more like old credit cards with a thicker plastic.  They weren't printable, but were much sturdier.</p>
<p>A limit of 50 writes was imposed on magcards, likely to recoup printing costs <em>and</em> because the cards would eventually wear out.  This meant that after 50 writes, the player would have to spend more money on a new card in order to continue saving their data.  If an arcade was feeling generous, the operator could choose to make buying and/or refreshing cards free.</p>


<p>Regardless of the card type, if the card were somehow destroyed outside of the machine for any reason, the save data would be lost and the player would have to start over with a fresh card.</p>
<p>Outside of the various cards and their readers, there were plenty of other fairly generic JVS I/O devices, such as coin mechanisms, arcade sticks, buttons, steering wheels, and pedals.  Because there were so few Triforce games released, we'll take a look at unique JVS I/O devices on a game-by-game basis when we start spotlighting the games.</p>
<h4 id="bringing-the-triforce-home"><strong>Bringing the Triforce Home</strong><a href="#bringing-the-triforce-home" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Hypothetically, let's say you have a vested interest in GameCube hardware and decided to purchase a Triforce arcade unit with a game to see how it works first-hand and write an article about it.  Without a cabinet and all of the additional hardware that is required to run a game, the core Triforce is just a fancy paperweight, right?  Actually, no!  </p>
<p>Using a Raspberry Pi, we can convert USB controllers into JVS devices that the games will recognize thanks to JVS I/O emulation!  JVS I/O uses a USB-A style connector, but arranges the pins differently.  Compared to USB, JVS I/O's differential serial signal is closer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-485">RS485</a> standard (aka the last <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial port</a> standard).  It's not <em>exactly the same</em>, but by using a RS485 adapter connected to through USB-A with D- and D+ hooked up as the differential pair and VBUS hooked to the sense line, USB devices can communicate with JVS I/O.  Combine that with <a href="https://github.com/OpenJVS/OpenJVS">OpenJVS</a>, and you can have a computer interface with a Triforce to emulate JVS I/O devices.</p>
<p>In our hypothetical, we suggested that we only purchased one Triforce.  In reality, we ended up with <em>four</em> over the past few years: A Type 1 DIMM, a Type 3 DIMM, and two Type 3 NANDs.  We also bought a few JVS I/O devices that popped up, including a Virtua Striker 4 Card Reader and a Chihiro/Triforce/NAOMI 2 compatible magcard reader/printer/distributor.  However, our real JVS I/O devices ended up being pretty useless due to the fact we were still missing too much hardware to hook them up.  JVS I/O emulation was mandatory, and was used to fake enough of the devices to get the games into a working state. To replace the Triforce's JVS power supply, we used an ATX power supply with the 20+4 pin power connector carefully modified to match its pinout.  Do not attempt this at home!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/OpenJVS/OpenJVS">OpenJVS</a> does a well enough job faking devices that most Triforce games can be made to run under it.  More importantly, it also let us map the various input devices attached to the games to a DS4 controller.  As a bonus, we used some of the extra buttons on the controller to map actions like inserting coins to make general play easier. </p>
<p>All of this tinkering was <em>just enough</em> to let us control and play real Triforce games on real hardware.</p>


<p>Now that we could play Triforce games, we had to give it a spin.</p>

<h3 id="the-triforce-games"><strong>The Triforce Games</strong><a href="#the-triforce-games" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Given that Nintendo hardware powers the Triforce, one might expect it to have some <em>Nintendo-developed games</em>.  But there aren't any.  Despite Nintendo's pedigree for creating appealing and accessible games, they had no interest in making arcade games for the Triforce.  Hits like <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Donkey_Kong">Donkey Kong</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Bros.">Mario Bros</a> were eons ago and the market had drastically changed since then.  Instead, Nintendo opted to license out their IPs to the more experienced arcade developers at Sega and Namco.</p>
<p>This partnership resulted in a golden opportunity for the two companies. Their experienced arcade developers had access to some extremely popular IPs, and the GameCube base meant they had a powerful core machine that was also affordable.  In the end, though, the Triforce only had <strong>nine</strong> games released for it and several of those saw home ports.</p>
<p>With so few titles released for the system, it affords us the rare opportunity go through each and every one.  The games range from fairly typical arcade titles to high budget monstrosities that would be the crown jewel of any arcade.  We'll be looking at obscure games, legendary games, and everything in between while doing our best to see how they took advantage of the Triforce hardware.  Let's begin.</p>

<p>Did you know that the Triforce has not one, but <em>two</em> Mario Kart games?  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> (2005) and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> (2007) are often forgotten when people talk about the phenomenal Mario Kart series due to their limited release, especially internationally.  Both games are built off the <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart:_Double_Dash%E2%80%BC">Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</a> engine, but have more of a focus on arcade simplicity and play closer to the style of the original <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Super_Mario_Kart">Super Mario Kart</a>.</p>
<p>Those that have played a Mario Kart game know what to expect at the surface level.  This is an arcade kart racer with tons of wacky items, popular characters, and colorful tracks to race on.  This time around, some popular characters from Namco properties join Mario Kart veterans, such as Pac-Man!</p>


<p>The first game launched with twelve race tracks spread across six cups.  Each cup has four stages that use two of the tracks.  The second time you race a track in the cup, it will be remixed slightly.  Sometimes this just means some different visuals or items, but other times it might have some slight alterations to make driving the track more difficult.</p>


<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> has all of the tracks from the first game and four brand new ones spread out between two new cups.  If this was a home console game, the amount of reused content would have been very disappointing.  In the arcade setting, it's not nearly as big of a deal.  Most players wouldn't have had a lot of experience on every course, and many might not have played the first game at all!  That being said, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> still feels more like an improved <em>version 2.0</em> rather than a full fledged sequel.</p>
<p>On that note, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> has some very puzzling omissions that were fixed by the sequel.  For instance?  Only <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> has the iconic 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc difficulty options available from the start!  Both games have the same three gameplay modes: Grand Prix, Time Trial, and Versus.  Grand Prix has players racing through cups one round at a time.  By winning a race in a cup, you unlock the next race.  Time Trial should be familiar to anyone.  Players are given a triple mushroom and a solo run on a course to set the best time possible.  Versus mode can only happen in multicabinet setups when multiple players are around.  In this mode, up to four players can race one another on any track.</p>
<p>Regardless of mode, races have a time limit to keep people moving, but they are relaxed enough that they usually won't come into play.</p>
<p>In order to record progress, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> rely on magcards.  When the game starts, it'll ask the player to insert or create a license profile to save their progress.  On some cabinets, a camera (known as the "namcam2") will be present to take a picture that will be used during the race.  Players' faces will show up in the heads-up display and with various <em>distraction items</em>, so making a goofy face could be an advantage in multiplayer.  Note that these features are optional, and a player can always choose to play without taking a picture or using a magcard.</p>


<p>There is one rather egregious oversight that is only present in the first game.  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> <strong>locks a player to a single character once they've created a license card</strong>.  That means before the player even gets a chance to play the game, they have to choose a character and are forced to use that character unless they start over!  Characters have different driving characteristics, so this is a rather important decision!</p>
<p>Regardless, the developers must have realized how awkward this was and changed it so that swapping characters is possible in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> even when using a magcard.</p>
<p>Whether the driving model for a Mario Kart game is good or not mostly comes down to player preference.  Some players love Mario Kart DS, others swear by <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Wii">Mario Kart Wii</a>, or even <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart:_Double_Dash%E2%80%BC">Double Dash</a>.  The GP games are definitely on the slippery side of the series, especially when using the "difficult" characters at higher CCs.</p>
<p>Controls are simple even compared to the already casual home Mario Kart games.   The game uses a racing wheel, gas and brake pedals, and an item button.  Additionally, there's a <em>Versus Cancel</em> to opt out of multiplayer to focus on winning the cups.  Despite this, it takes some time to get acclimated to the arcade exclusives after coming from modern Mario Kart games.  The harder courses pull no punches and will relentlessly throw tight corners.  The Grand Prix mode even has hindrances added to certain tracks on their reruns.  On Bowser's Castle, Kamek invades and blocks some of the racing lines on the later laps!</p>


<p>To win on harder difficulties, the player needs every advantage they can get.  Items can be the advantage that players need.  Both games feature <strong>over 100 items</strong>, but during a race, each player has access to a pool of three items.  In harder Grand Prix cups (and sometimes later stages in earlier ones), players get the option to create their own unique item pool from their unlocked items.  Even though a lot of them share properties, a surprising number of them have their own wrinkles.  For example, dropping a banana can cause a spinout and immediate time loss, but dropping tacks will cause a kart to pop a tire and lean to one side, making overall driving temporarily more difficult for that player. Items aren't very balanced so unlocking powerful items gives an undeniable edge.</p>
<p>Throwing items are simple.  Aside from the green shell, almost all forward throwing items feature a powerful lock-on effect.  Lock-on is automatic and happens after keeping another driver in front for a couple of seconds.  Once locked on, that item will head toward the target regardless of what they do to avoid it.</p>


<p>In the first game, players must win all four stages of a cup and the minigame that follows. These minigames are short solo challenges that test a player's control over the game in unusual situations.  Sometimes this means pushing an object, getting big air over jumps, driving backwards, hitting tons of pedestrians (they're Koopa Troopas, that makes it OK), or even facing off with Bowser outside of his castle.  In the sequel, the bonus games are no longer required for cup completion and only award bonus coins.</p>


<p>By winning all of the cups, players unlock a <em>Special</em> mode that varies per game.  In GP 1, that is 150cc mode.   <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> has 150cc mode unlocked by default, so they went a different direction.  Instead, players unlock new track layouts in <em>reverse mode</em>.  Unlike the <em>mirror mode</em> present in other games, reverse mode significantly changes some of the tracks beyond just ruining muscle memory.  Fun fact, reverse mode <em>was</em> also planned for <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart:_Double_Dash%E2%80%BC">Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</a> before being cut for mirror mode.</p>
<p>To handle the plethora of tricky corners and tracks, GP games have a drifting mechanic.  By tapping the brake, players can initiate a hop.  By turning in the air before landing, players can initiate a drift that allows sharp corners to be taken at higher speeds.  Because of the powerful lock-on that most items have, drifting has been given an additional benefit.  During a drift, players will <em>reflect</em> most items with a shield.  An unexpected drift will cost some time, but could be used to block an item at the last moment.  Some items also provide a shield, such as the <em>Invincibility Star</em> and <em>Shield</em> items.</p>
<p>Much like the original <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Super_Mario_Kart">Super Mario Kart</a> and more recent Mario Kart entries, the GP games have coins strewn across the track.  Collecting coins increases a kart's stop speed, adding a layer of strategy as just driving the optimal lines isn't enough. During a race, holding 15 coins pushes a kart to its maximum speed.  But driving at that speed can also be dangerous, as hitting walls, bouncing off other karts, or being hit by items can cause the player to lose coins.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> changes all of the coins on the track to <em>Mario Coins</em>.  The first time these coins are collected they count as currency toward unlocks.  If coins are dropped, players don't lose the Mario Coins and they will respawn as golden coins.  Up to 25 Mario Coins can be picked up on the track along with bonuses from race ranking and minigames.</p>
<p>Collecting Mario Coins allows for unlocking certain karts, items, portraits, and <em>kart upgrades</em> that will make the veteran players much faster than players just starting out.</p>


<p>Lastly,  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> also adds one more major feature: <s>Waluigi!</s>  a "live" announcer that gives updates throughout the race.  This feature is proudly demonstrated during the attract menu, even!  As corny as it sounds, it's rather entertaining to leave on at least a few times.  Players that don't want the announcer can turn it off and their preference will be saved to their magcard.</p>
<p>Overall, both of these games are best as multiplayer arcade spectacles. The depth and content of these games don't quite rival contemporary home releases like <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Wii">Mario Kart Wii</a>. But none of that matters in the arcade with friends, where loud and bombastic multiplayer experiences really shine.</p>
<p>The Mario Kart Arcade GP series would continue with <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_DX">Mario Kart Arcade GP DX</a> in 2013 and <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_VR">Mario Kart Arcade GP VR</a> in 2017, but those would run on newer and more standard PC-based arcade hardware.</p>
<p>These Mario Kart titles were the only two games Namco released on the Triforce hardware.  But they had planned <em>at least</em> one other game.</p>
<h4 id="star-fox-working-title-unreleased-by-namco"><strong>Star Fox</strong> (working title, unreleased) by Namco<a href="#star-fox-working-title-unreleased-by-namco" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Announced in 2002 as a dual GameCube and arcade release, Star Fox was originally planned to launch before either of the Mario Kart Arcade GP games in 2003.  As part of a push for games that could easily be ported between GameCube and arcade, Star Fox would have had connectivity between the two versions through <em>GameCube memory card slots</em> included on the machines.  That way, players could bring their own memory cards to transfer progress and/or unlockables between the home version and the arcade version of the game.</p>


<p>Considering the arcade style action featured in Star Fox and Star Fox 64, this seemed like a natural choice for an arcade hit.  Players were already chasing high scores in Star Fox 64 and the overall game design would need little modification to work in an arcade.  If rumors were true, Namco wasn't planning to skimp on the hardware, either.  They were going to use the massively impressive and incredibly expensive <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-greatest-arcade-cabinet-that-never-was-5849339">O.R.B.S. cabinet</a>, which was designed specifically for on-rail shooters.  Essentially, the player would be locked in a fully immersive orb that would place them squarely in the cockpit of an Arwing with a semi-spherical screen acting as a bubble canopy.  On top of that, the cabinet could rotate and slide to reflect what was going on in-game.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, Star Fox Arcade <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Star_Fox_Arcade_(lost_build_of_cancelled_arcade_port_of_GameCube_rail-shooter_%22Star_Fox:_Assault%22;_2002)">was quietly cancelled</a> and the O.R.B.S. cabinet itself would never actually be used for any arcade game.  The GameCube version did <em>eventually</em> see the light of day, however.  Released as <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Star_Fox:_Assault">Star Fox Assault</a> in <strong>2005</strong>, the game was heavily reworked and padded out with third person on foot sections.  Perhaps as a nod to its origins, players can unlock a port of the arcade classic <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Xevious_(Arcade)">Xevious</a> by collecting all silver medals.</p>
<p>With that side quest complete, we've now covered the entirety of Namco's contributions to the Triforce library.  Thankfully, we're not done yet, as Sega developed a variety of Triforce arcade games.</p>

<h4 id="gekitou-pro-yakyuu-by-wow-entertainment"><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Gekit%C5%8D_Pro_Yaky%C5%AB_(Triforce)">Gekitou Pro Yakyuu</a></strong> by <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:WOW_Entertainment_(Developer)">WOW Entertainment</a><a href="#gekitou-pro-yakyuu-by-wow-entertainment" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Gekit%C5%8D_Pro_Yaky%C5%AB_(Triforce)">Gekitou Pro Yakyuu</a> is a rather unique baseball game that combines characters from various baseball manga created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinji_Mizushima">Shinji Mizushima</a> with real-life Japanese professional baseball players of the era.  The game also has a faithful home console port, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Gekit%C5%8D_Pro_Yaky%C5%AB_(GC)">Gekitou Pro Yakyuu</a>, for the GameCube and PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>The main draw of this baseball game is that it can provide a faithful simulation style game between professional players or a zany arcade experience with special pitches, strong batters, and manga cutaways featuring the illustrated characters.  What makes the game so interesting is that these two things aren't separated - both teams can be filled with a mix of illustrated and professional players, letting their contrasting styles clash right on the field.</p>


<p>At its core, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Gekit%C5%8D_Pro_Yaky%C5%AB_(Triforce)">Gekitou Pro Yakyuu</a> is a fairly standard late early 2000s baseball game.  Pitchers can roughly place their pitches anywhere in and around the strike zone and batters in turn try to guess where the pitch will be to get a solid hit.  Pitchers have a variety of pitches at their disposal that add movement to the ball, and batters in turn have multiple swing types that can counter pitches.  Players with better stats generally have more options at their disposal.  If the batter guesses the pitch right, their aiming reticle will turn red giving them advanced warning that they guessed correctly.</p>
<p>When playing in the arcade, both teams are filled with a mix of real players and manga players.  This creates the interesting scenario where many manga players often feel like <em>superstars</em> that can break the game if not carefully played around.  Most of them have special quirks and often have access to special abilities.  Manga pitchers can make the ball disappear, zig zag, and confound the batter.  Manga batters can also counter this as they have active and passive abilities of their own.  One player has his contact range and power grow further out from the center of the strike zone, making him incredibly powerful if the pitcher is painting the corners.</p>


<p>For those interested in playing this game without a Triforce, there's good news.  The home console port is incredibly faithful and even adds some additional modes and features for depth.  The GameCube controller also affords players analog control, whereas the arcade original uses an eight-way gate.  Once you get in game, though, it's very apparent that this is the same game.</p>


<p>The home port, as far as we could tell, is missing <em>one small thing</em>.  The Triforce version has a scoring system for putting up high scores on the machine.  Rather than just trying to win baseball games, players are instead challenged to get a high score across a nine-inning game.  Doing positive things like getting hits and getting the opponent out will give the player points.  Big moments like double plays and grand slams will give even bigger bonuses, pushing players to the top of the leaderboards.</p>
<p>Players get two innings per credit or can pay 4 credits for a full nine-inning game.  Players aiming for a high score <em>need</em> to do that, as those extra innings give more opportunities for scoring points, and there's a large swath of bonus points for winning the baseball game outright.  After nine-innings, win or lose, the game ends.  The game also lists high scores for a home run contest, but we couldn't figure out how to get to that mode.</p>


<p>This game suggests that it has some kind of save card support in the Service Menu, but we weren't able to find any cards for it to be sure.  In all likelihood, cards would have been used to save team data and other preferences for a player.  Overall, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Gekit%C5%8D_Pro_Yaky%C5%AB_(Triforce)">Gekitou Pro Yakyuu</a> is an effective, if not somewhat simple baseball game that lends itself well to the pick up and play nature of the arcade.</p>

It is a simple to pick up and easy to play sports game with an incredibly faithful home port that brings the same experience to console players with modes that add extra depth.  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_2002">Virtua Striker 3 ver. 2002</a> is a three-button game:  short pass (tackle on defense), long pass, and shoot.  That's it.</p>


<p>The <em><a href="https://youtu.be/Rfg9FFytpPM?t=3978">gooooooal</a></em> of the game is to win five matches in a row against the AI to secure the championship while surviving potential intruders jumping in from the second player in standard mode.  This is a <em>king of the hill</em> style arcade game, so whoever wins gets to keep playing while the loser is knocked out.  This remains true when playing against AI, so a strong player can play up to five games against the AI before reaching the credits and having to put in more money.</p>
<p>The game follows the rules of <s>football</s> soccer closely.  There are yellow cards, red cards, offsides, corner kicks, penalty kicks, free kicks and injury time.  As an arcade game, it even captures some of the pageantry of the sport with a bombastic opening as the players march onto the field.  However, once you're in game it is a very no frills experience.</p>
<p>The arcade operator could adjust the cabinet's settings to make things more or less unfair to optimize their profits.  In addition to difficulty settings, Golden Goal (short overtime period) and Penalty Kicks could be disabled to give the players less opportunities to break a tie.  And this matters a lot, because <em>the AI wins in the event of a tie</em>, forcing the player to plunk in more money to continue.</p>
<p>For competitive events and tournaments, there's an aptly named <em>tournament mode</em> present in the settings.  This mode has both players kicked off the game after match, regardless of who wins.  This mode wasn't (just) added to allow the operator to maximize profits, but rather it was intended for holding in-person tournaments where players would be swapping in and out after every match.</p>
<p>The simplicity to the controls is both the game's selling point and an annoyance.  When on defense in particular, sometimes the defender will rush to get into a particular position regardless of the direction being held on the arcade stick.  This lack of control is only worsened by the fact that there's no switch player button... on the arcade version, at least.  The home port is mostly faithful gameplay-wise, but it does take advantage of the extra buttons on the controller to give players the ability to change tactics and swap defenders.</p>


<p>One thing that we should mention is that we were playing on revision 0001 of <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_2002">Virtua Striker 3 ver. 2002</a>.  Most games on the Triforce have multiple revisions or updates, with some revisions coming with significant upgrades.  Later revisions may have addressed problems in this revisions, especially if the supposed <em>Type 3</em> version exists.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_2002">Virtua Striker 3 ver. 2002</a> was a tad underwhelming in our opinion.  If you're a huge fan of these games and are seething at our mini-review, we're fully aware that a lot of our frustrations might simply boil down to a <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuE0QMHErQo">skill issue</a></em>.  But since we were familiar with the rich history of the veterans at <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:Amusement_Vision_(Developer)">Amusement Vision</a> and their legendary track record of arcade games, this one was a little disappointing.</p>

<p>Originally released in 2003, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_of_Avalon:_The_Wizard_Master">The Key of Avalon: The Wizard Master</a> is a strange and very, <em>very</em> expensive arcade game.  This game was not just expensive for the players, but it was also expensive for the operator too!  This game is powered by <strong>five</strong> Triforce cabinets: one central Triforce server for the main game screen, and four additional satellite Triforce pedestals for the players.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_of_Avalon:_The_Wizard_Master">The Key of Avalon: The Wizard Master</a> is an arcade trading card board game.  The objective of the game is simple - players scan in their decks and see their monsters on the big screen while battling up to three other players for supremacy. </p>
<p>Before playing the game, players need to purchase a starter deck of 30 random trading cards. This deck also comes with an IC card so that players can save their progress. Each satellite Triforce comes with a deck reader to allow a player to scan in their deck of cards. But how would you control the game after scanning in your cards? Why, a <em>touchscreen</em>, of course!  And if that wasn't enough, the game also came with a separate card kiosk specifically for purchasing starter decks and booster packs.</p>


<p>There are at least six revisions of The Key of Avalon.  It is important to be aware of what revision a cabinet is, as cards from newer sets will not work with older revisions. Thankfully, cards are marked with what set they came from, making it fairly easy to know which revisions each card is compatible with.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_of_Avalon:_The_Wizard_Master">The Key of Avalon: The Wizard Master</a></strong> - Supports the initial 100 cards.  There is a 1.10 revision with small adjustments.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_Of_Avalon_Ver.1.20:_Summon_The_New_Monsters">The Key of Avalon 1.20: Summon The New Monsters</a>:</strong>  This first <em>major</em> update adds support for 52 new cards in the <strong>N</strong> series.  Earlier prints of these cards may have different stats and are missing some information on the back of the card.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_Of_Avalon_1.30:_Chaotic_Sabbat">The Key of Avalon 1.30: Chaotic Sabbat</a>:</strong>  This version adds support for 35 more cards in the <strong>C</strong> series.  Much like Summon The New Monsters, reprints of these cards have additional information and may have slightly different stats.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_Of_Avalon_2:_Eutaxy_Commandment">The Key of Avalon 2: Eutaxy Commandment</a>:</strong>  An update big enough to be called a sequel.  It has 61 new cards, a single player mode, and much more.  The cards for this revision are in the <strong>E</strong> series.  These cards do not appear to have any changes between early and late prints.  The updated stats for older cards are used by this game.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_Of_Avalon_2.5:_War_of_the_Key">The Key of Avalon 2.5: War of the Key</a>:</strong>  The final revision adds support for 40 new cards in the <strong>W</strong> series.  There are also additional <strong>Legend</strong> cards separate from the main catalogue.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, nearly 300 total cards were released spread out over five rarities:  Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, and Super Rare.  Some cards are undoubtedly stronger than others, and those cards are mostly the rarer ones.</p>
<p>Like other collectable card games, players were expected to buy packs and trade with others to build the best possible deck.  To prevent someone from getting clever with a printer and suddenly owning all the rare cards, Avalon cards have a barcode embedded into their top edge that the game reads the card data from.  Though nearly invisible in normal circumstances, if held up to a light <em>just right</em>, the material of the barcode stands out against the rest of the card.</p>


<p>Cards weren't all about utility, though.  These cards were beautifully illustrated by a myriad of artists, and each monster is represented by a detailed 3D model in game.  If someone was lucky, they might've stumbled upon alternate art or holofoil versions of cards.  Players could also be rewarded with unique <strong>Ex</strong> cards that were <strong>only</strong> distributed through events.</p>


<p>Of all of the Triforce games, this was the only one we couldn't play.  Even if we had five Triforces, five GD-ROM drives, and JVS I/O emulation for the cards, it still wouldn't be enough.  The game can be booted with fewer Triforces, but the touchscreen is a total mystery and there was no way to bypass it without having a working Avalon Satellite Pedestal.</p>


<p>We've researched the game, bought manuals, and obtained a ton of cards and understand the gameflow, but without having played it we can't really say if it's fun or not.  However, based on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sega-profits-rise-as-console-game-division-approaches-break-even">existing sales data</a> and the number of updates, we know that <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_of_Avalon:_The_Wizard_Master">The Key of Avalon</a> was moderately successful despite its high price.  Sega would go on to make more trading card arcade games, including a suspiciously similar Chihiro game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_of_D">Quest of D</a>.</p>

<h4 id="virtua-striker-4-and-virtua-striker-4-ver2006-by-amusement-vision"><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4">Virtua Striker 4</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4:Ver._2006">Virtua Striker 4 ver.2006</a></strong> by <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:Amusement_Vision_(Developer)">Amusement Vision</a><a href="#virtua-striker-4-and-virtua-striker-4-ver2006-by-amusement-vision" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Two years after <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_2002">Virtua Striker 3 ver. 2002</a>, Sega released the next game in the Virtua Striker lineup with <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4">Virtua Striker 4</a>.  With dramatic upgrades to the controls, support for saving progress, team configuration, rank, and more, this game is often considered the best in the series by fans.  And it only got better with <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4:Ver._2006">Virtua Striker 4 ver.2006</a>, which updated the rosters and added additional online events.</p>


<p>Like most Triforce games, the newer Virtua Striker games take advantage of cards for saving. <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4">Virtua Striker 4</a> uses IC cards to track player progress, similar to <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_of_Avalon:_The_Wizard_Master">The Key of Avalon</a>.  These cards are nifty, as not only are they more durable than magcards, but they also contain an ID for logging in to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALL.Net">Sega ALL.Net</a></strong>.  The internet was enough of a thing at this point that Sega started experimenting with it for tracking player data and progress.</p>


<p>This meant that instead of a local arcade leaderboard, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4">Virtua Striker 4</a> could have a global leaderboard tracking players on ALL.Net-connected machines across the world. By playing against other players that had registered online, players could be promoted to higher ranks or be demoted to lower ranks.  On the surface, this is an upgrade over traditional magcards, but the obvious downside is that these games rely on servers hosted by Sega.  Unfortunately, support for these machines ended in 2017, meaning that the online features no longer work.  Thankfully, these games can still be played offline without the online services, albeit without the special features and events.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4">Virtua Striker 4</a> was a revelation to play after the previous games.  The changes are subtle, but they come together to provide a far superior experience.  The ability to dash gives players much more control over attacking at the expense of stamina, and helps avoid the common problem in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_2002">Virtua Striker 3</a> where athletes were constantly just banging into each other in a scrum.  The <em>change tactics</em> buttons add depth as players can adjust their strategy on the fly instead of waiting for halftime.  This gives the opportunity to go for that golden goal in the final seconds or play defensively to hold a tight lead.</p>
<p>Instead of being locked to an eight-way gate, this game uses a full analog lever that allows for more precise control.  Player movement is still a little stiff, but it makes a world of difference when it comes to the accuracy of shots and passes.</p>


<p>For most fans of the series, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4:Ver._2006">Virtua Striker 4 ver.2006</a> is the definitive version in the series, and we can see why.  Unfortunately, it is also the last game in the series and it never saw a home console port.</p>

<h4 id="f-zero-ax-by-amusement-vision"><strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a></strong> by <strong><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:Amusement_Vision_(Developer)">Amusement Vision</a></strong><a href="#f-zero-ax-by-amusement-vision" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>If there was a crown jewel of the Triforce efforts, it has to be <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> and the home console game born from it, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a>.  Without Nintendo collaborating with Sega, there's no way that the legendary arcade racing devs at <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:Amusement_Vision_(Developer)">Amusement Vision</a> would have had the chance to work with the F-Zero license.</p>
<p>For those out of the loop, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a> is renowned as one of the greatest arcade-style racing games ever made.  It has tight controls, an incredible sense of speed, and legendary difficulty.  The racing alone would make for a great game, but the developers went above and beyond with tons of content to elevate the experience.  It has tons of characters with their own 3D models, F-Zero machines, and even theme songs accompanying their profiles.  The garage functionality also gives players the ability to create their own vehicles with a custom appearance and stats.  Topping all of that off is an iconic and difficult story mode full of goofy FMV cutscenes oozing cheesy goodness.  And for those who never had a chance to play the <em>arcade-exclusive</em> tracks, the arcade tracks can actually be unlocked in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a>!</p>
<p>So that's it then?   <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a> has everything the arcade could offer and more.  There's no reason to care about <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a>, right?  <strong>Wrong</strong>.</p>


<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> is still an incredible experience even for those that have completely mastered <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a>.  The controls and physics have been adjusted to make the game play better on a force feedback yoke and pedals.  The change in controls allows players to <em>push</em> the vehicle in ways that are lost in the home console version.  And, if you're lucky enough to find a deluxe cabinet, the intensity is ramped up further with pilot seat haptics - it can tilt to throw the player around corners.</p>
<p>The game is a visceral thrill.  Everything great about the racing in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a> is here, just with the intensity cranked up to another level.  Unfortunately, it only has six tracks, with one of them being a fairly simple oval for learning the game.  The other tracks are fantastic visual showcases with devious layouts.  The long ice slide at the end of Green Plant: Spiral pushes players to go fast as they can with no traction, while the back-to-back right angle turns and thin straightaways force precision driving on Lighting: Thunder Road.</p>
<p>There are only two modes in this game: Race and Time Trial.  Race has players going up against 29 other AI opponents or three other players if playing against linked cabinets.  Time Trial is exactly what it sounds like and has players racing for the best time in a solo effort.  Best records could be uploaded online with a code, back in the day.</p>


<p>Hidden away in the Service Menu, there are five difficulty modes to help the operator tune the experience according to the clients.  In a more casual arcade, the game's difficulty could be lowered to <em>Very Easy</em> to give players more time to make mistakes and still win.  If they wanted people to suffer, <em>Hardest</em> all but guarantees no one will ever win.  The length of the races can also be adjusted.  Even a standard three lap race can be exhausting on a cabinet, so cranking up the length can really turn the game into an endurance challenge.</p>


<p>On the track, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> looks like <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a>.  But after having the opportunity to play them back to back, the differences in how they drive became very apparent.  Even ignoring the arcade atmosphere, AX gives the sensation of always being one mistake from careening out of control.  After playing a lot of <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> and returning to GX, the change in feel was shocking.  Treacherous turns in AX were suddenly ordinary in GX thanks what feels like higher grip and different drifting physics.  The cars felt like they were glued to the track in the console version!</p>
<p>After spending a lot of time with both, AX definitely presents a more difficult, but rewarding to master, driving model.  The arcade game <em>does</em> grant players some reprieve though.  Running out of energy or flying off the track will happen now and then even to the most experienced players.  This is <em>not</em> an immediate race over!  Instead players will be respawned back on the track after a small time penalty.  It dampens the hopes of victory, but it's usually possible to come back from one major mistake.  However, unlike the console version, players are on a strict time limit by default.  Once the clock hits zero, the race is over regardless of whether the player is in first or last place.</p>


<p>Both magcards and GameCube memory cards can be used to save progress.  Players are assigned a license rating that can be upgraded by winning races and earning points.  Every 30,000 points, players are afforded an opportunity to buy upgrades for their own custom F-Zero Machine.  This machine could be used directly in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> or transferred to <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a> via memory card.</p>
<p>To beat <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a>, players have to win all six races and all six target times.  While doing this, players earn points that upgrade their license's rank, which allows them access to better parts for their custom F-Zero machine.</p>
<p>After experiencing it first hand, we can say that the game is a truly incredible arcade experience.  If not for <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_GX">F-Zero GX</a>, it would be a modern tragedy that it didn't see a wider release.  Still, those who love the F-Zero series should definitely give this version of the game a spin if they have the chance.</p>
<h4 id="monster-ride"><strong>Monster Ride</strong><a href="#monster-ride" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>


<p>It would be a crime if we didn't at least mention <em>Monster Ride</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX: Monster Ride</a> is a separate release of F-Zero AX and the only Sega-produced Triforce game that uses a NAND cartridge.  It has fewer features, pilots, and ships than the standard version of F-Zero AX, and doesn't seem to have multiplayer or any save support whatsoever.</p>
<p>But in exchange, Monster Ride runs in a <a href="https://segaretro.org/Cycraft">Cycraft</a> cabinet. </p>
<p>Imagine playing F-Zero AX inside a five degrees of freedom <strong>motion simulator</strong> where the player's cockpit is suspended in the air with an arm, and the cabinet literally swings the cockpit around to match the ship's movement in game. That's Monster Ride, and it's as awesome as it sounds.  Unfortunately, these cabinets are <em>incredibly</em> rare and appear to have never left Japan.  We invite readers to watch this clip showing it off, as this is as close as most of us will ever get to the real thing.</p>


<p>In most cases, something this obscure would be lost to time.  But, luckily enough, a few Monster Ride Triforces have survived over the years.  And thanks to <a href="https://github.com/bobbydilley/cycraft-emulator">Cycraft emulation</a>, Monster Ride can technically be run from a standard Type 3 NAND Triforce.  Maybe some day all of this could be hooked up to a homemade Cycraft-compatible motion simulator and Monster Ride will live again.  We can dream, right?</p>

<h3 id="in-retrospect"><strong>In Retrospect</strong><a href="#in-retrospect" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>After having played each and every Triforce game to the best of our ability, it's easy to see why the platform is still beloved by its fans.  Unfortunately, it was a victim of its era and most games only released in Japan. The games that did get international releases were only released in limited quantities.</p>
<p>As developers of a GameCube and Wii emulator, the Triforce is an especially interesting topic for us. At the core of every Triforce is a GameCube, yet that familiar hardware was used to drive a different type of experience in the arcades. It's fascinating! For this article, we wanted to shine a spotlight on this interesting step-sibling to the consoles we emulate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to emulation, arcade hardware is a very, very different challenge than emulating a home console. Even though each game is powered by a Triforce, all of the hardware around it can be unique for each game and even behave differently on different revisions of the same game!  An arcade cabinet only needs to be compatible with the specific game inside of it.  Because of that, unlike GameCube/Wii emulation, where fixing one game can sometimes fix dozens of others, each individual <em>revision</em> of an arcade game needs to be treated as its own challenge.</p>
<p>Those problems didn't stop people from trying to build Triforce emulation on top of Dolphin in the past, though!  <strong>Over 17 years ago</strong>, <a href="https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/commit/93b83f8d65962a10a2776bf9fb6c39ce1eb03f2d">Dolphin gained the ability to emulate parts of the Triforce Baseboard</a>. It wasn't enough to boot any Triforce games, but it was a start. However, that was the last time anything Triforce-related hit our mainline builds.  Aside from code clean up efforts, the fledgling Baseboard emulation was left untouched <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2016/09/01/dolphin-progress-report-august-2016/">until it was removed in the summer of 2016</a> to avoid misleading users into thinking that mainline Dolphin targeted Triforce hardware.</p>
<p>Just because Triforce emulation wasn't progressing in the main builds doesn't mean it wasn't being pursued, though.  Instead, efforts were moved to a dedicated <em>Triforce branch</em>, where developers could do whatever they wanted to improve Triforce emulation.  And there was some success from this approach - it was eventually able to play a few games, such as <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP 1</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">2</a>.</p>


<p>However, a lot of this progress was achieved through <strong>brute force</strong>.  Because so little was understood about how the Triforce worked, many <em>suboptimal</em> techniques were used to get results fast, like hacking problematic behaviors out of games and hardcoding responses.  This, combined with some magic to force each game's controls to work with a standard GameCube controller, was enough to get some games running.</p>


<p>This was fine for a separate branch. Hacky emulation is sometimes a necessary first step to more accurate emulation, after all.  But on the other hand, the hacky nature of the Triforce branch made it unacceptable to be merged into mainline builds as-is, despite its achievements. Unfortunately, the emulation quality never improved and progress stalled out. The Triforce branch was abandoned after just two years of sporadic contributions, and it eventually faded into obscurity.</p>


<p>Any attempt at Triforce emulation today must be held to a higher standard. It wouldn't need to be perfect at first, but the goal should be to actually <em>emulate</em> Triforce hardware, rather than to ignore that it exists.  We should strive to give retro and arcade enthusiasts the tools to bring Triforce games to life with their own custom solutions for the platform's assortment of obscure hardware.  In a perfect world, Dolphin would be capable enough to be the core of hobbyist arcade cabinets.</p>
<p>Each Triforce game brings difficult questions that Dolphin just isn't well suited to answer.  Dolphin is a console emulator at heart and is not designed to tackle the hyper-specific challenges that come with arcade emulation.  We already have enough problems trying to emulate all the weird <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080530194734/http://www.siliconera.com/2007/01/23/introducing-the-densha-de-go-wii-controller/">Wii Remote attachments</a> and <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2025/06/04/dolphin-progress-report-release-2506/#2503-270-disguise-rock-band-playstation-usb-devices-as-wii-equivalents-by-josjuice">USB devices</a> out there!  To do right by the Triforce would take an inordinate amount of work and expertise.  And embarking on that journey for what amounts to a handful of games, many of which already saw very faithful home ports, would be a foolish endeavor at best.</p>
<p>Having said all of that, we're just as surprised as you to be announcing this...</p>
<h3 id="the-return-of-the-triforce"><strong>The Return of the Triforce</strong><a href="#the-return-of-the-triforce" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>As of <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/2512-395/">Dolphin 2512-395</a>, Triforce support is here!</strong>  Readers that have been paying close attention might have noticed that some of the screenshots in this article are suspiciously high resolution.  There's a reason for that!  <em>Every single in-game screenshot in this article comes from Dolphin!</em></p>


<p>This is the culmination of over a decade of work.  While were focused on advancing GameCube and Wii emulation, <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a> doubled down and continued maintaining his own fork <em>specifically for</em> Triforce emulation.  We were aware of this fork, but given the fact that we knew little about how the Triforce worked and had bad memories of the old, hacky Triforce branch, it mostly flew under our radar.</p>
<p>Everything changed mid-2025 when <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a> contacted us about potentially making a pull request to get his Triforce emulation code into our official builds.  Developers had a mixture of both excitement and concern upon hearing about this.  It would be a major project, and <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a>'s solo work would now be scrutinized by a bunch of people.</p>
<p>In the end, what won us over was the quality of emulation.  The games ran beautifully, and apart from missing touchscreen support for The Key of Avalon, each game was playable.  The hacky, messy Triforce emulation we remembered was gone, and something much better had taken its place.</p>
<p>So, we wanted Triforce emulation in Dolphin, and <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a> wanted to bring it into Dolphin.  Their pull request was an easy merge, right?  Well, there was still one big hurdle in the way:  <em>code review</em>.</p>


<p>Because the Triforce has a significant amount of bespoke hardware, none of the developers reviewing the code knew much about how it worked.  We were put into a tough spot of having to review a large volume of code that emulated unfamiliar devices.  The Triforce was mostly a black box to us at the beginning of this effort, and it still is in many ways.</p>
<p>To get Triforce emulation to the finish line, we had to work together and make <em>a lot</em> of compromises.  We did not want to let perfect be the enemy of good, but it still had to be good enough to not hinder further development.  <a href="https://github.com/jordan-woyak">Billiard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sepalani">sepalani</a> gave huge assists with their own fixes and clean ups to help get the Triforce pull request ready for action.  Many of our targeted clean ups focused on fixing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety">memory safety</a> bugs, removing potential game hangs, and improving the overall user experience by adding safeguards and streamlining the process of configuring Dolphin to run Triforce games.  After many months of review, cleanups, and testing within the team and the community,  Triforce emulation is finally here.  And it is here to stay.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a> has been helping us with his knowledge on the Triforce for various guides and information.  He also assisted us with dumping Triforce games and provided a homebrew payload that can dump Triforce games directly over the network.  It is also possible to dump GD-ROM titles without any Triforce hardware by using a PC disc drive, but it is a more complicated process and takes several steps in order to retrieve the game from the disc.</p>
<p>For full instructions on how to dump Triforce games, please visit <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Ripping_Games">the game dumping guide on our wiki</a>.</p>
<h4 id="setting-up-dolphin-for-triforce-emulation"><strong>Setting up Dolphin for Triforce Emulation</strong><a href="#setting-up-dolphin-for-triforce-emulation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Triforce is ultimately a GameCube with arcade bits attached to it.  Much like how Dolphin can automatically reconfigure itself depending on if you're booting a GameCube or Wii game, Dolphin will now become a <em>Triforce</em> when it detects a Triforce game being loaded.  However, the Triforce Baseboard options can also be manually enabled for homebrew purposes, and there are some important settings in its configuration menus.</p>
<p>The Triforce Baseboard can be found as a SP1 device in Options -&gt; Configuration -&gt; GameCube.  It has additional configuration options for various IP address redirects, which can make it easier to set up networking features of the Triforce.  There's also a shortcut here to configure Triforce controls, which can also be found as a GameCube Controller Input device in Options -&gt; Controller Settings.</p>
<p>Each game's arcade controls have already been roughly adapted to a GameCube controller, but be sure to configure the Coin, Service, and Test buttons!  Controller port 2 can optionally be set to a baseboard as well, but Dolphin will automatically translate controls when possible without this being necessary. These are the only two places where Triforce settings need to be adjusted in Dolphin.  Note that standard GameCube/Wii games should not be booted with the Baseboard set in SP1 or as a controller.</p>


<p>One other important component of the Triforce is <strong>Segaboot</strong>.  Without Segaboot, players can't access the Service Menu and the game's settings.  This means not being able to enable free play, change difficulties, calibrate controllers, and much more.  Additionally, the full boot process can only be experienced by providing a Triforce IPL <em>and</em> Segaboot combined with "Skip Main Menu".  Just be prepared for a few error popups along the way as some parts of initialization are not fully emulated.</p>
<p>Segaboot can be found on certain Triforce update discs or in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4">Virtua Striker 4</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4:Ver._2006">Virtua Striker 4 ver.2006</a>'s files.  You can use Dolphin's filesystem explorer to locate the "firm" folder that holds Segaboot files.  The correct file is 2MB, and in the case of <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4:Ver._2006">Virtua Striker 4 ver.2006</a>, it is named <code>segaboot.img01</code>.  Renaming this file <code>segaboot.gcm</code> and placing it in the <code>Triforce</code> directory inside of the User folder will allow Dolphin to use it.</p>


<p>Some games use <em>networking</em> for certain hardware, such as <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX Monster Ride</a>'s Cycraft and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP 1</a>/<a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">2</a>'s namcam2.  In both cases, a third-party server that emulates the behavior of the original device can be used with Dolphin.  By default, Dolphin includes an IP Redirect to make the game look at localhost for these devices.</p>
<p><s>Conveniences such as save states are not yet available as Triforce emulation isn't fully integrated with all of Dolphin's features</s>.  This part of the article was originally a much longer "Limitations" section with a big list of warnings, shortcomings and potential problems for users, but some cheeky developers decided to go through and fix most of them after reading through the section.  At this point, the biggest omissions are NetPlay and TASing support only because the new Triforce input devices aren't supported by input recordings.</p>
<p>Even Android users get to join in on the fun! Triforce hardware can be enabled and configured in the Android GUI like on desktop and games will run out of the box. The only limitation is that the Coin, Test, and Service buttons have not been added to Dolphin's touchscreen controller, so users will have to map them to a real controller or a physical button on the device. One exception to this is inserting a coin, which has been mapped by default to shaking your device.</p>


<p>Regardless of whether you're playing on PC or Android, some parts of the Triforce experience are still hardcoded.  The attached JVS I/O devices for each game cannot be customized or changed in any way.  This is not particularly accurate, as real cabinets could be configured in multiple ways, with some having deluxe features not present on others.  This was a compromise, and we hope to make hardware features customizable in the future.  Dolphin also automatically generates a magcard or IC card for each game and tracks progress on it, but users cannot swap cards, eject cards, or interact with them in any way whatsoever through Dolphin's GUI.</p>
<h4 id="emulating-arcade-multiplayer"><strong>Emulating Arcade Multiplayer</strong><a href="#emulating-arcade-multiplayer" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Lastly, there is multiplayer support to talk about. Multiplayer was an important part of the arcade experience, and every Triforce game supports multiple players in some form.  Single machine multiplayer should work without issues.  This means that <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_2002">Virtua Striker 3 ver. 2002</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4">Virtua Striker 4</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Virtua_Striker_4:Ver._2006">Virtua Striker 4 ver.2006</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Gekit%C5%8D_Pro_Yaky%C5%AB_(Triforce)">Gekitou Pro Yakyuu</a> will all "just work".</p>
<p>Then there are the <em>multicabinet</em> games.  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_of_Avalon:_The_Wizard_Master">The Key of Avalon</a> games, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> all had support for up to through using separate cabinets connected to a LAN (Local Area Network).  Prior to these efforts, <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a> had actually implemented some networking and socket features as part of emulating the monstrosity that is <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Key_of_Avalon:_The_Wizard_Master">The Key of Avalon</a>.  Multicabinet is <em>required</em> for the Avalon games, even for single player, as they use a server/client model with each player on a client Triforce and the master Triforce hosting the game server.  Unfortunately, due to missing touchscreen support, they still aren't playable even when the instances are able to connect with each other.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> was on the opposite side of the spectrum and never showed any signs of life.  The game would just get stuck on searching for other instances forever. We unfortunately can't figure out the problem right now, as we don't have any packet dumps from real networked <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> cabinets.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> were the tragic pair throughout the review process.  These games could actually see other instances of Dolphin on the network for a brief moment before they gave up and reverted to single cabinet mode.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to this article's release, <a href="https://github.com/jordan-woyak">Billiard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sepalani">sepalani</a> spent some <em>very</em> late nights cleaning up parts of the networking code and hunting down regressions from those clean ups.  The namcam2 for the Mario Kart games communicates via LAN on real hardware, and was particularly problematic during the clean up process.  This was something that <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a> already had working, so we <em>really</em> didn't want to break it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, testing the namcam2 only takes a couple of seconds.  The game checks for it on boot during the initial hardware checks.  But waiting for new builds to try would usually take anywhere from 10 minutes to multiple hours.  During that waiting period, one of the few testers with access to Triforce software had to be at the ready to test things or else everything would get delayed.  This led to a lot of downtime with bored testers messing with Triforce games to pass the time.  It was during one of those downtimes that a tester reported that some of the attempts to fix the namcam2 were affecting multicabinet support, as multiple instances of Dolphin could no longer find each other in Mario Kart!  Even though the effect was negative, it was still interesting and prompted more investigation.</p>
<p>After we properly fixed namcam2 support, curiosity got the best of us and we continued tinkering with various Mediaboard network commands hoping to get multicabinet working in time for launch.  It seemed hopeless at times, but after multiple nights of burning the midnight oil... this happened.</p>


<p>At the 11th hour, we were finally able to get multiple instances of Dolphin running <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP_2">Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</a> to connect to each other.  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> wasn't as easy and threw out "unhandled mediaboard command" errors despite the instances seeing one another.  Thankfully, one look at the error and <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a> knew exactly how to fix it.  Minutes later, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Arcade_GP">Mario Kart Arcade GP</a> was working just as well as its sequel.  Both games now work incredibly well and are able to survive Wi-Fi latency spikes of over 80ms with little hitching and no disconnects.</p>
<p>We plan to write a full multicabinet emulation guide on our wiki after this article launches. Please stay tuned.</p>
<h3 id="triforce-emulation-roadmap"><strong>Triforce Emulation Roadmap</strong><a href="#triforce-emulation-roadmap" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>This isn't the hacked-up Triforce emulation of 2012, but there's still a lot of work to be done.  Throughout testing, a ton of features were added and many issues were addressed, but work is far from done.  In order to get this massive project merged, some items on our wishlist had to be put off for later.  He's a rundown of some of the bigger things we really want.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better IC/Magnetic Card Interface:</strong>  Currently, Dolphin automatically inserts a card that matches the current game ID in supported titles.  This lets players easily play games and save without any extra setup. While this is nice, it isn't always what a player wants.  We want to add the ability to buy, eject, swap, and insert cards like players could do at a real arcade.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Cabinet Configurations:</strong> Each game has its own hardcoded set of JVS I/O devices at the moment.  While this means that games will always boot up with a valid configuration, it also means that alternative configurations can't easily tested, such as a cabinet without a magcard reader.</li>
<li><strong>Make The Key of Avalon Games Playable:</strong> These games are monsters to emulate, thanks to their specialized hardware.  Even with multicabinet support working, there is still so much more to be done before Dolphin can bring this arcade experience home.  The biggest fires to put out are the lack of touchscreen emulation and limited support for deck scanning.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Force Feedback Hardware:</strong>  There are many bits and pieces on various Triforce cabinets that Dolphin can't currently handle.  For example, force feedback motors are not generally supported. Only <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a>'s steering wheel motors can be mapped at all, but even if you do map them, some forces are incorrectly interpreted.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Controller Configuration GUI:</strong>  The Triforce Baseboard SI device reuses the GameCube controller configuration GUI and adapts that to each game as best as it can.  In the long term, we want players to see each game's control devices and their layouts so that they can configure a controller without having to guess what each input does.</li>
<li><strong>Hook up TAS Tools and NetPlay</strong>: Dolphin's input recording tools don't support Triforce input devices, breaking these features.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in Support For namcam2/Cycraft</strong>:  Currently, third-party programs are required in order to emulate Cycraft and namcam2.  In order to make using third-party servers easier, Triforce games can be told to look at any address, including localhost, for these devices.  In the future, an emulated option alongside real servers would be preferrable, somewhat like how Emulated USB Devices are currently handled.</li>
<li><strong>Continue Fixing Crashes/Hangs:</strong>  Triforce emulation performed extremely well during our extensive testing, but to say everything is perfect would be a stretch.  Given the rarity of Triforce games, not every revision of every game has been tested and some may not work.  <s>One common hang is that the Mario Kart titles get stuck when trying to eject the magcard after play.  This doesn't result in any loss of data, but does mean the game has to be reset.</s>  <strong>Edit</strong>: The magcard eject hang was fixed just before this article was launched.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is by no means exhaustive, but we wanted to give an idea of how much work is still left to be done.  Triforce emulation works incredibly well right now, but will continue to be a work-in-progress for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h3 id="wrapping-things-up"><strong>Wrapping Things Up</strong><a href="#wrapping-things-up" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Suddenly being thrust into Triforce emulation after all of these years was quite the experience for everyone involved.  We can confidently say that this esoteric hardware is full of surprises.  Just emulating these games and trying to test them was a distinct challenge far removed from anything we experienced with the GameCube and Wii!  Each game has so many unique quirks, revisions, and sometimes even hardware configurations!  </p>
<p>This couldn't have happened without <a href="https://github.com/crediar">crediar</a>.  Going into this, most Dolphin developers knew almost nothing about Triforce emulation, and without the decade plus of knowledge he had built up while maintaining his fork, we would have stood no chance.</p>
<p>With everything that's been done, there was one final challenge.  Our goal was for Dolphin's Triforce emulation to be good enough to drive hobbyist arcade cabinets and preserve the arcade experience these games were meant for. So we gave it a try. We built a hobbyist <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=F-Zero_AX">F-Zero AX</a> cabinet kit, set up a PC with Dolphin, and let family and friends have at it.  And it was a blast for everyone involved.</p>


<p>When we first started on this journey, most of us hadn't had the opportunity to play any of the Triforce games on an original cabinet. The best we could do was buy the core systems and games and try to get them running with what we had.  The experience on bare hardware was rarely good and never great, but that was not how they were meant to be played.  Triforce games were designed to be a part of an arcade experience, with a cool cabinet, interesting features, and unique control schemes. Through emulation, we were able to bring some of that arcade magic back to these games that no longer have a cabinet to call home.</p>
<p>But through all of those trials, it's finally here.  Maybe a <s>few</s> <em>dozen</em> years later than anyone expected.  However, there are still a lot of exciting changes still on the horizon, so be sure to check in for more development articles about Dolphin - the GameCube, Wii, and <strong>Triforce</strong> emulator!</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Agent Skills are structured packages of procedural knowledge that augment LLM agents at inference time. Despite rapid adoption, there is no standard way to measure whether they actually help. We present SkillsBench, a benchmark of 86 tasks across 11 domains paired with curated Skills and deterministic verifiers. Each task is evaluated under three conditions: no Skills, curated Skills, and self-generated Skills. We test 7 agent-model configurations over 7,308 trajectories. Curated Skills raise average pass rate by 16.2 percentage points(pp), but effects vary widely by domain (+4.5pp for Software Engineering to +51.9pp for Healthcare) and 16 of 84 tasks show negative deltas. Self-generated Skills provide no benefit on average, showing that models cannot reliably author the procedural knowledge they benefit from consuming. Focused Skills with 2--3 modules outperform comprehensive documentation, and smaller models with Skills can match larger models without them.

<p dir="auto">I like the concept of apps like <a href="https://wisprflow.ai/" rel="nofollow">Wispr Flow</a>, <a href="https://superwhisper.com/" rel="nofollow">Superwhisper</a>, and <a href="https://www.monologue.to/" rel="nofollow">Monologue</a> that use AI to add accurate and easy-to-use transcription to your computer, but they all charge fees of ~$10/month when the underlying AI models are free to use or cost pennies.</p>
<p dir="auto">So over the weekend I vibe-coded my own free version!</p>
<p dir="auto">It's called FreeFlow. Here's how it works:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Download the app from above or <a href="https://github.com/zachlatta/freeflow/releases/latest/download/FreeFlow.dmg">click here</a></li>
<li>Get a free Groq API key from <a href="https://groq.com/" rel="nofollow">groq.com</a></li>
<li>Press and hold <code>Fn</code> anytime to start recording and have whatever you say pasted into the current text field</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">One of the cool features is that it's context aware. If you're replying to an email, it'll read the names of the people you're replying to and make sure to spell their names correctly. Same with if you're dictating into a terminal or another app. This is the same thing as Monologue's "Deep Context" feature.</p>
<p dir="auto">An added bonus is that there's no FreeFlow server, so no data is stored or retained - making it more privacy friendly than the SaaS apps. The only information that leaves your computer are the API calls to Groq's transcription and LLM API (LLM is for post-processing the transcription to adapt to context).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h3><a id="user-content-faq" aria-label="Permalink: FAQ" href="#faq"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why does this use Groq instead of a local transcription model?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">I love this idea, and originally planned to build FreeFlow using local models, but to have post-processing (that's where you get correctly spelled names when replying to emails / etc), you need to have a local LLM too.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you do that, the total pipeline takes too long for the UX to be good (5-10 seconds per transcription instead of &lt;1s). I also had concerns around battery life.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some day!</p>

<p>Macroeconomics, DIY Hardware and AI-Driven Voting Pools</p>
<p>I downloaded every Show HN post since the site was launched and ran them through a hierarchical topic model. I set out to discover what the Hacker News community finds interesting but in the process I ended up uncovering macro-economic trends, evidence of voting rings/fraud, and subtle shifts in behavior over the lifespan of the post</p>

<p>If a picture is a thousand words, I like to think this interactive treemap is at least one thousand and one. You can click into a box to dig into the year or topic group. The first thing that jumps out is just how much bigger the 2025 box is than any other year. The second is how much lighter the 2025 box is compared to the previous few years.</p>
<p>I enjoy history, but I am often told that people care much more about what is happening now. So let’s dig into specifically 2025.</p>
<section id="these-are-the-top-performing-topics-in-2025">
<h4 data-anchor-id="these-are-the-top-performing-topics-in-2025">These are the top performing topics in 2025:</h4>

<p>Again, what sticks out to me is the discrepency between the average 2025 post’s average performance compared to the previous few years. The top performing topic in 2025 has the same likelihood of receiving 100 points as the average post in 2022. That’s a discrepency that I want to dig a bit deeper into.</p>

<p>There are three distinct groups: 2022 as the heyday of Show HN posts, 2021, 2023, &amp; 2024 as still extremely highly performing, and 2025 with a significant performance reduction. If I were to make a guess at the root cause of this difference, I would have two (not necessarily contradictory) theories.</p>
<p>The first is tied to the software job market. I can easily imagine that the combination of remote work and post-covid tech boom drove much more overall Hacker News engagement and more interesting Show HN projects. The job market and remote work receded a little in ’23 and ’24 but morale seems to have cratered in 2025. Which leads to my second theory.</p>
<p>AI has driven much more content, by both aiding in its creation and creating a cohort of startups and companies chasing a piece of the pie. This AI-driven content tends to be more shallow, and its noise makes it harder to discover genuine, interesting content. There is some evidence for this theory in the expontential growth in the quantity of hacker news posts from 2022 onwards.</p>
<p>These are both guesses. I don’t have an easy avenue to dig into the economic theory, but I do want to dig a bit deeper into the composition of posts in 2025.</p>
</section>
<section id="digging-into-2025">
<h2 data-anchor-id="digging-into-2025">Digging into 2025</h2>
<p>The first thing I want to dig into is the change in topics of viral posts. Take a look at this <em>slope plot</em>, which shows the change in content of all posts between 2024 and 2025. Each side of the plot lists topics by rank, and a line connects their 2024 position to their 2025 position; topics which decreased in prominence have negative slopes, shown in <em>red</em>. Topics which surged in prominence have positive slopes, shown in <em>blue</em>.</p>


    
<p><br> You can see a spike in topics related to AI such as “Agent Connectivity”, “AI Coding”, &amp; “AI Automation”, which lends credence to at least my theory that AI related posts grew more common in Show HNs. However, I’m curious to dig into not just how often topics were posted in 2025, but how successful each topic was.</p>


    
<p><br> This plot shows that, outside of the “AI Automation” topic, which saw slightly higher represented in viral posts than it’s overall prevalence, AI related Show HN posts underperform expectations. The majority of the bottom right “quadrant of death” is AI related topics. Topics such as “AI Coding” and “AI Image Generation” see noticable drops as well. It is interesting to me that “Document Ingestion and Retrieval” strongly overperforms expectations as a tool that supports a lot of these other AI topics (something about selling pick-axes?). But standing above all, the deep blue line shooting like Superman across the sky is DIY Hardware IoT Projects. I confess that I am a sucker for these posts, as it appears all of Hacker News is as well. These tends to be extremely authentic, lack any sort of commercial viability and just have a lot of soul put into them.</p>
<p>The last thing I wanted to dig into is the audience segmentation aspect of Hacker News. There’s two distinct audiences viewing posts. The first is the much more hardcore technical readers that view the “New” and “Show” pages. The second is the more mass market crowd that goes on the front page.</p>


    

<p>So some takeaways I have is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The real heavy-lifting for the performance of “DIY Hardware” projects is really coming from the first wave of Hacker News readers (though it does get a sizeable boost from the front page audience as well).</p></li>
<li><p>Nearly every AI related topic does worse once it clears the 10 point threshold than any other category. This means that either the people looking through the New and Show sections are disporportionately interested in AI. This is very possible, but from my interaction with this crowd from my posts, these users tend to be more technically minded (think DIY hardware, rather than landing-page builders).</p>
<p>However, my Spidey-sense is going off a little bit. AI has received a massive wave of funding for startups and enterprises have carved out budget space to invest in solutions. This is obviously not hard evidence, but circumstantially, it looks like there is a evidence that some level of voting rings are on within this AI posts.</p>
<p>However, either explanation would explain why 2025 is such a challenging year for viral Show HN posts. There exists this set of topics that are more frequent than ever, that quickly garner early points, but do not resonate with the broader audience. Beyond that is speculation on my part.</p></li>

<p>Ah the question you really wanted to know. This was actually the first question I asked as well. I did a simple SQL query estimate. However, Mike McCourt saw a chance to apply a Gelman-style hierarchical mixed-effects model to better leverage the data to answer this question. I won’t spoil his analysis but I’ll leave you with a little preview …</p>
