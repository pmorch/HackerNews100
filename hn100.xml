Last year, Willow proved its power with our Random Circuit Sampling benchmark, a test designed to measure maximum quantum state complexity. The Quantum Echoes algorithm represents a new class of challenge because it models a physical experiment. This means this algorithm tests not only for complexity, but also for precision in the final calculation. This is why we call it “quantum verifiable,” meaning the result can be cross-benchmarked and verified by another quantum computer of similar quality. To deliver both precision and complexity, the hardware must have two key traits: extremely low error rates and high-speed operations.</p>

One of the tools scientists use to understand chemical structure is Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), the same science behind MRI technology. NMR acts as a molecular microscope, powerful enough to let us see the relative position of atoms, which helps us understand a molecule’s structure. Modeling molecules’ shape and dynamics is foundational in chemistry, biology and materials science, and advances that help us do this better underpin progress in fields ranging from biotechnology to solar energy to nuclear fusion.</p><p data-block-key="7svu9">In a <a href="https://quantum.devsite.corp.google.com/site-assets/downloads/quantum-computation-molecular-geometry-via-nuclear-spin-echoes.pdf">proof-of-principle experiment</a> in partnership with The University of California, Berkeley, we ran the Quantum Echoes algorithm on our Willow chip to study two molecules, one with 15 atoms and another with 28 atoms, to verify this approach. The results on our quantum computer matched those of traditional NMR, and revealed information not usually available from NMR, which is a crucial validation of our approach.</p><p data-block-key="57iba">Just as the telescope and the microscope opened up new, unseen worlds, this experiment is a step toward a ‘quantum-scope’ capable of measuring previously unobservable natural phenomena. Quantum computing-enhanced NMR could become a powerful tool in drug discovery, helping determine how potential medicines bind to their targets, or in materials science for characterizing the molecular structure of new materials like polymers, battery components or even the materials that comprise our quantum bits (qubits).</p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/2025/new-ebu-research-ai-assistants-news-content">https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/2025/new-ebu-research-ai-assistants-news-content</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45668990">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="textComponent"><p>New research coordinated by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and led by the BBC has found that AI assistants – already a daily information gateway for millions of people – routinely misrepresent news content no matter which language, territory, or AI platform is tested.</p>
<p>The intensive international study of unprecedented scope and scale was launched at the EBU News Assembly, in Naples. Involving 22 public service media (PSM) organizations in 18 countries working in 14 languages, it identified multiple systemic issues across four leading AI tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the <strong><a title="Opens a PDF in a new window." href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/documents/news-integrity-in-ai-assistants-report.pdf%20" target="_blank">News Integrity in AI Assistants Report</a></strong></li>
<li>Read the&nbsp;<strong><a title="Opens a PDF in a new window." href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/documents/news-integrity-in-ai-assistants-toolkit.pdf%20" target="_blank">News Integrity in AI Assistants Toolkit</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Professional journalists from participating PSM evaluated more than 3,000 responses from ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Perplexity against key criteria, including accuracy, sourcing, distinguishing opinion from fact, and providing context.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Key findings:&nbsp;<br> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>45% of all AI answers had at least one significant issue.</li>
<li>31% of responses showed serious sourcing problems – missing, misleading, or incorrect attributions.</li>
<li>20% contained major accuracy issues, including hallucinated details and outdated information.</li>
<li>Gemini performed worst with significant issues in 76% of responses, more than double the other assistants, largely due to its poor sourcing performance.</li>
<li>Comparison between the BBC’s results earlier this year and this study show some improvements but still high levels of errors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this distortion matters</strong></p>
<p>AI assistants are already replacing search engines for many users. According to the Reuters Institute’s Digital News Report 2025, 7% of total online news consumers use AI assistants to get their news, rising to 15% of under-25s.</p>
<p>‘This research conclusively shows that these failings are not isolated incidents,’ says EBU Media Director and Deputy Director General Jean Philip De Tender. ‘They are systemic, cross-border, and multilingual, and we believe this endangers public trust. When people don’t know what to trust, they end up trusting nothing at all, and that can deter democratic participation.’</p>
<p>Peter Archer, BBC Programme Director, Generative AI, says: ‘We’re excited about AI and how it can help us bring even more value to audiences. But people must be able to trust what they read, watch and see. Despite some improvements, it’s clear that there are still significant issues with these assistants. We want these tools to succeed and are open to working with AI companies to deliver for audiences and wider society.’</p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>
<p>The research team have also released a <a title="Opens a PDF in a new window." href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/documents/news-integrity-in-ai-assistants-toolkit.pdf%20" target="_blank">News Integrity in AI Assistants Toolkit</a>, to help develop solutions to the issues uncovered in the report. It includes improving AI assistant responses and media literacy among users. Building on the extensive insights and examples identified in the current research, the Toolkit addresses two main questions: “What makes a good AI assistant response to a news question?” and “What are the problems that need to be fixed?”.</p>
<p>In addition, the EBU and its Members are pressing EU and national regulators to enforce existing laws on information integrity, digital services, and media pluralism. And they stress that ongoing independent monitoring of AI assistants is essential, given the fast pace of AI development, and are seeking options for continuing the research on a rolling basis.</p>
<p><strong>About the project</strong></p>
<p>This study built on research by the BBC published in February 2025, which first highlighted AI’s problems in handling news. This second round expanded the scope internationally, confirming that the issue is systemic and is not tied to language, market or AI assistant.</p>
<p><strong>Participating broadcasters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Belgium (RTBF, VRT)</li>
<li>Canada (CBC-Radio Canada)</li>
<li>Czechia (Czech Radio)</li>
<li>Finland (YLE)</li>
<li>France (Radio France)</li>
<li>Georgia (GPB)</li>
<li>Germany (ARD, ZDF, Deutsche Welle)</li>
<li>Italy (Rai)</li>
<li>Lithuania (LRT)</li>
<li>Netherlands (NOS/NPO)</li>
<li>Norway (NRK)</li>
<li>Portugal (RTP)</li>
<li>Spain (RTVE)</li>
<li>Sweden (SVT)</li>
<li>Switzerland (SRF)</li>
<li>Ukraine (Suspilne)</li>
<li>United Kingdom (BBC)</li>
<li>USA (NPR)</li>
</ul>
<p>Separately, the BBC has today published research into audience use and perceptions of AI assistants for News. This shows that many people trust AI assistants to be accurate - with just over a third of UK adults saying that they trust AI to produce accurate summaries, rising to almost half for people under-35.</p>
<p>The findings raise major concerns. Many people assume AI summaries of news content are accurate, when they are not; and when they see errors, they blame news providers as well as AI developers – even if those mistakes are a product of the AI assistant. Ultimately, these errors could negatively impact people’s trust in news and news brands.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The relationship between computing systems and the brain has served as motivation for pioneering theoreticians since John von Neumann and Alan Turing. Uniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful properties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for Machine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.
<br>We introduce `Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a new Large Language Model architecture based on a scale-free biologically inspired network of \$n\$ locally-interacting neuron particles. BDH couples strong theoretical foundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like performance.
<br>BDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space sequence learning architecture. In addition to being a graph model, BDH admits a GPU-friendly formulation. It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws: empirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at the same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.
<br>BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during inference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using spiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses strengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept while processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a graph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model is biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human neurons could use to achieve speech.
<br>BDH is designed for interpretability. Activation vectors of BDH are sparse and positive. We demonstrate monosemanticity in BDH on language tasks. Interpretability of state, which goes beyond interpretability of neurons and model parameters, is an inherent feature of the BDH architecture.

<p>Click. Ugh. Another one.</p>
<p>You know the drill. You land on a new website, eager to read an article or check a product price, and before the page even finishes loading, it appears: the dreaded cookie banner. A pop-up, a slide-in, a full-screen overlay demanding you "Accept All," "Manage Preferences," or navigate a labyrinth of toggles designed by a corporate lawyer.</p>
<p>Most people do the same thing: they sigh, their eyes glaze over, and they click "Accept All" with the muscle memory of a weary soldier.</p>
<p>This daily ritual of digital whack-a-mole is the result of well-intentioned privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. The goal was noble: to give users control over their data. But the execution? It's a colossal failure. It has created a web experience that is more annoying, less transparent, and arguably no more private.</p>
<p>The problem isn't the <em>what</em>. It's the <em>where</em>. The law placed the burden of consent on millions of individual websites, when it should have targeted the one tool we all use to access them: <strong>the browser.</strong></p>
<h2>The Insanity of the Status Quo</h2>
<p>Imagine if every time you got into your car, you had to manually approve the engine's use of oil, the tires' use of air, and the radio's use of electricity. It’s absurd, right? You’d set your preferences once, and the car would just work.</p>
<p>Yet, that’s exactly what we do online. We are asked the same questions, by every single website, every single day. This approach is broken for three simple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Consent Fatigue is Real:</strong> We're so bombarded with these requests that they’ve become meaningless. The banners are an obstacle to be cleared, not a choice to be considered. True consent requires a conscious, informed decision, not an exasperated click to get the pop-up out of the way.</li>
<li><strong>It Punishes the Little Guys:</strong> A giant corporation can afford a team of lawyers and expensive Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) to create a compliant (and often deliberately confusing) banner. But what about the small blogger, the local restaurant, or the indie developer? For them, it's another technical and legal headache, forcing them to install clunky, site-slowing plugins just to avoid a potential lawsuit.</li>
<li><strong>It Doesn't Actually Give Us Control:</strong> The illusion of choice is not choice. When the options are "Accept All" or "Spend Five Minutes in a Menu of Legalese," the system is designed to push you toward the path of least resistance.</li>
</ol>
<h2>A Simple, Radical Idea: Put Consent in the Browser</h2>
<p>Now, imagine a different internet.</p>
<p>When you set up your browser—be it Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge—you go through a simple, one-time setup. It asks for your privacy preferences in plain English:</p>
<p><strong>How do you want to handle your data?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Essential Only:</strong> "Only allow data necessary for websites to function (e.g., keeping me logged in, remembering my shopping cart)."</li>
<li><strong>Performance &amp; Analytics:</strong> "Help creators improve their sites by letting them see anonymous data about how I use them."</li>
<li><strong>Personalized Experience:</strong> "Allow sites to use my data for personalized content and relevant advertising."</li>
<li><strong>Custom:</strong> Fine-tune your settings for specific data types.</li>
</ul>
<p>You make your choice once. <em>Set it and forget it.</em></p>
<p>From that moment on, the responsibility shifts. Your browser becomes your personal privacy enforcer, and the law would require it to act on your behalf. Based on your one-time choice, it would be responsible for allowing or declining cookies from every site you visit. If a website tries to use a cookie with an unclear or undeclared purpose? The browser simply blocks it—no questions asked.</p>
<p>It's much more realistic and effective to make a handful of browsers follow the law than it is to force millions of websites to do the same thing. This isn't just a theory—it's the exact lesson we learned from the failure of the "Do Not Track" signal. DNT relied on websites to voluntarily honor a user's choice, and most simply didn't. Even if it were legally binding, you can't possibly police millions of websites to ensure they comply. By contrast, you can easily check that a few major browsers are actively enforcing the settings you choose. Browser-side enforcement solves the problem by turning a polite request into an unbreakable rule.</p>
<h2>The World We Could Have</h2>
<p>This browser-centric model would fix everything that’s wrong with the current system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For Users: Real Control &amp; A Cleaner Web.</strong> Your choice would be meaningful because you’d make it once, thoughtfully. The result? A faster, cleaner, and radically less annoying internet experience. You could easily review or change your global settings at any time, right in your browser.</li>
<li><strong>For Website Owners: A Massive Burden Lifted.</strong> Suddenly, millions of developers, creators, and small business owners are freed from the role of digital janitor. They no longer need to install ugly, performance-killing scripts. Compliance becomes automatic. The web becomes more accessible and innovative.</li>
<li><strong>For Regulators: Easier Enforcement.</strong> Instead of trying to police millions of websites, regulators could focus on a handful of major browser developers. Are they implementing the standard correctly? Are they honoring the user's choice? It’s a much more efficient and effective system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>From a Tangled Mess to a Simple Tool</h2>
<p>Some might call this a radical change, but the truly radical thing is the convoluted system we've accepted as normal.</p>
<p>Right now, the internet runs on a fragile, sprawling patchwork of compliance tools. Think about the sheer absurdity of it. Every individual website owner is forced to bolt on a third-party Consent Management Platform (CMP). That platform must then be perfectly configured to talk to dozens of different ad-tech vendors, analytics scripts, and embedded services. All of this has to work flawlessly while navigating the subtle legal differences between GDPR, CCPA, and a growing list of other regulations.</p>
<p>It’s an ecosystem where countless platforms are all trying to talk to each other, duplicating effort and overcomplicating the simple act of a user saying "yes" or "no." We've built a million different, shaky bridges to solve a problem that requires only one.</p>
<p>A browser-based approach cuts through this entire tangled web.</p>
<p>It replaces millions of individual, often-conflicting systems with <strong>one, single source of truth</strong>: your browser.</p>
<p>This isn’t about building a new, complex system. It’s about <strong>dismantling a monstrously inefficient one.</strong></p>
<p>It’s about freeing developers and small businesses from being amateur privacy lawyers. It’s about creating a standard that is clear for users, simple for creators, and effective for regulators.</p>
<p>It's time to take the consent dialog out of the websites we visit and put it where it always belonged: in our hands, via our browsers.</p><!-- CONTENT END 2 -->

					The NVIDIA Inception startup projects that space-based data centers will offer 10x lower energy costs and reduce the need for energy consumption on Earth.				</p>
			
			
		</div>

	
	
		<div>
<div><p>Extraterrestrial data centers are just on the horizon. Soon, an AI-equipped satellite from Starcloud, a member of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/startups/?nvid=nv-int-tblg-295718-vt33">NVIDIA Inception</a> program for startups, will orbit the Earth.</p>
<p>It’s a large step toward the startup’s ultimate goal to bring state-of-the-art data centers to outer space. This can be a part of the solution to address challenges faced by rising AI demands, including energy consumption and cooling requirements for data centers on Earth.</p>
</div>

	</p>
</div>

<div><p>“In space, you get almost unlimited, low-cost renewable energy,” said Philip Johnston, cofounder and CEO of the startup, which is based in Redmond, Washington. “The only cost on the environment will be on the launch, then there will be 10x carbon-dioxide savings over the life of the data center compared with powering the data center terrestrially on Earth.”</p>
<p>Starcloud’s upcoming satellite launch, planned for November, will mark the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/">NVIDIA H100 GPU’s</a> cosmic debut — and the first time a state-of-the-art, data center-class GPU is in outer space.</p>
<p>The 60-kilogram Starcloud-1 satellite, about the size of a small fridge, is expected to offer 100x more powerful GPU compute than any previous space-based operation.</p>

<div>
	<h2>How Data Centers in Space Can Increase Sustainability</h2><div><p>Instead of relying on fresh water for cooling through evaporation towers, as many Earth-based data centers do, Starcloud’s space-based data centers can use the vacuum of deep space as an infinite heat sink.</p>
<p>Emitting waste heat from infrared radiation into space can conserve significant water resources on Earth, since water isn’t needed for cooling. Constant exposure to the sun in orbit also means nearly infinite solar power — aka no need for the data centers to rely on batteries or backup power.</p>

	<p>Starcloud projects the energy costs in space to be 10x cheaper than land-based options, even including launch expenses. “In 10 years, nearly all new data centers will be being built in outer space,” Johnston predicts.</p></div>

<div>
	<h2>Applications for Space-Based Data Centers</h2><div><p>An early use case for extraterrestrial data centers is the analysis of Earth observation data, which could inform applications for detecting crop types and predicting local weather.</p>
<p>Plus, real-time data processing in space offers immense benefits for critical applications such as wildfire detection and distress-signal response. Running <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/ai-inference/">inference</a> in space, right where the data’s collected, allows insights to be delivered nearly instantaneously, reducing response times from hours to minutes.</p>

	</p>
</div>

<div><p>Earth observation methods include optical imaging with cameras, hyperspectral imaging using light wavelengths beyond human vision and synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imaging to build high-resolution, 3D maps of Earth.</p>
<p>SAR, in particular, generates lots of data — about 10 gigabytes per second, according to Johnston — so in-space inference would be especially beneficial when creating these maps.</p>
<p>“Starcloud needs to be competitive with the type of workload you can run on an Earth-based data center, and NVIDIA GPUs are the most performant in terms of training, fine-tuning and inference,” Johnston said, explaining why the company chose to use NVIDIA accelerated computing on its upcoming satellite launch.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm very sad to announce that Dr. Gregory B. Newby (gbnewby) has died after a short battle with cancer. Dr. Newby was CEO of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation for more than 20 years and, in that role, worked very closely with Distributed Proofreaders. He was also a voting member of the Distributed Proofreader Foundation board.
</p><p>Born in Canada, Dr. Newby grew up in the US. He returned to Canada, however, to work for the government in the Yukon Territory as he continued his direction of Project Gutenberg.
</p><p>In a recent interview, Greg described how he, a life-long reader, became excited about the possibilities of ebooks back in 1987 when someone emailed him a copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -- "I immediately realized what a tremendous thing that was." He cared deeply about Project Gutenberg's mission. "You know," he told the podcast interviewer, "That keeps me going ... having a positive impact and getting all that literature into people's hands."
</p><p>In 2023, Dr. Newby collaborated with Microsoft and MIT to produce the Project Gutenberg Open Audiobook Collection of AI-narrated audiobooks. This initiative was named one of "The Best Inventions of 2023" by TIME magazine.
</p><p>Greg's vision saw the ebooks (many of them produced here at Distributed Proofreaders) made available through Project Gutenberg grow to more than 75,000.
</p><p>Dr. Newby and his tireless leadership of Project Gutenberg was a close partner of Distributed Proofreaders and will be greatly missed here.
</p><p>The official announcement is <a href="https://www.pgdp.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=84636" title="forumtopic:84636">here</a>.

<p>In today’s world, internet access is essential for education, health, and safety. </p>



<p>Yet, many people in East and North Greenland still struggle with slow or unreliable connections. That is about to change.</p>



<h2>Faster and More Stable</h2>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;68f873b7acfab&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://media.mgdk.dk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/shutterstock_2570841733_31n5Asv-1024x683.jpg" alt="Greenland"><figcaption>Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Greenland’s national telecom company, Tusass, has signed a new agreement with the French company Eutelsat<strong> </strong>to provide satellite internet through OneWeb, reports Danish News Media <a href="https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/groenland/groenland-satser-paa-fransk-selskab-frem-elon-musk-s-satellitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DR</a>.</p>



<p>These satellites will bring faster and more stable coverage to towns and settlements that do not have underwater cables or radio links.</p>



<h2>Closing the Gap</h2>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;68f873b7ad5f7&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://media.mgdk.dk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/Shutterstock_733835062-1024x532.jpg" alt="Grönland, Greenland"><figcaption>Vadim_N / Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tusass director Toke Binzer said the new service will improve life in remote areas such as Tasiilaq, Ittoqqortoormiit, and Qaanaaq. </p>

<p>He explained that customers in these regions have waited too long for reliable service. The goal is to close that gap and bring them online at a much higher standard.</p>



<h2>An Improvement</h2>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;68f873b7ada92&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://media.mgdk.dk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/Shutterstock_2434412393-1024x512.png" alt="Satellite, space, orbit, tech, global"><figcaption>Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Eutelsat is a major player in global satellite communications. Its OneWeb satellites orbit closer to Earth than traditional ones, which allows for faster and more reliable signals. </p>



<p>The company says the partnership will help connect isolated communities, support critical infrastructure, and improve maritime safety and rescue operations.</p>



<p>The first area to benefit will be Tasiilaq, which is expected to gain access before the end of the year. Other communities will follow as Tusass expands the network.</p>



<h2>Starlink Was Considered</h2>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;68f873b7aded0&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://media.mgdk.dk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Elon-Musk-Grok-1024x532.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Photo Agency / Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tusass had also been in talks with Starlink, owned by Elon Musk, but chose to continue working with Eutelsat. </p>



	<div x-data="{
        posts: [],
        loadPosts() {

<p>Binzer said it was not about which company was better, but about trust and long-term cooperation. Tusass already works with Eutelsat and knows their systems well.</p>



<h2>Maintaining Greenlandic Control</h2>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;68f873b7ae2be&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://media.mgdk.dk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Shutterstock_2538006591-1-1024x512.jpg" alt="Grønland, greenland, flag"><figcaption>ACERS_FOTO/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some Greenlandic politicians have warned that the country must keep control of its telecom infrastructure. </p>



<p>They fear that opening the market to foreign providers could threaten national security. For now, Tusass remains the sole provider of telecommunications in Greenland.</p>



<p>Binzer said the company will keep an open mind for future partnerships, but the priority remains clear. Greenland’s communication systems must stay under Greenlandic control.</p>

You never come across another detainee for security reasons and there's a type of social isolation which makes life difficult".</p><p>At the end of last week, Sarkozy was received at the Élysée Palace by President Emmanuel Macron, who told reporters on Monday "it was normal that on a human level I should receive one of my predecessors in that context".</p><p>Macron stressed on Tuesday that it was not his role "to comment on or criticise judicial decisions", but he said it was normal that for many in France the sight of "a president jailed by this judicial decision would provoke comment".</p><p>In a further measure of official support for the ex-president, Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin said he would go to visit him in prison as part of his role in ensuring Sarkozy's safety and the proper functioning of the jail.</p><p>"I cannot be insensitive to a man's distress," he added.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251015-170100-8e96f025b0-web-2.31.4-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bcfb/live/dd525d10-ae4e-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Reuters Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy leaves his house with his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy on the day of his incarceration at the Sante prison to begin his five-year prison sentence for criminal conspiracy over attempts to raise campaign funds from Libya, in Paris, France, October 21, 2025."><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Nicolas Sarkozy has maintained his innocence and has lodged an appeal</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><ul><li><b id="read-more:">Read more:</b> <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp98kepmj9lo">Former French president Sarkozy given five-year sentence after Libya case</a></li></ul></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ever since he left office in 2012, Sarkozy has been dogged by criminal inquiries and for months had to wear an electronic tag around his ankle after a conviction last December for trying to bribe a magistrate for confidential information about a separate case.</p><p>Late next month, France's highest administrative court will give its verdict on Sarkozy's appeal against a six-month jail term in another illegal campaign financing case known as the Bygmalion affair.</p><p>Ahead of his arrival at La Santé prison, Sarkozy gave a series of media interviews, telling La Tribune: "I'm not afraid of prison.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Strix Halo is the codename for AMD’s highest end mobile chip, which is used in the Ryzen AI MAX series. It combines a powerful CPU with 16 Zen 5 cores and a large GPU with 20 RDNA 3.5 Workgroup Processors (WGPs). The sizeable iGPU makes Strix Halo particularly interesting because GPUs have high bandwidth requirements. Strix Halo tackles that with a 256-bit LPDDR5X-8000 setup combined with 32 MB of memory side cache. The latter is often referred to as Infinity Cache, or MALL (Memory Attached Last Level). I’ll refer to it as Infinity Cache for brevity.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png" width="847" height="714" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:714,&quot;width&quot;:847,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Il1z!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bdb0948-6a82-4441-927a-4dcdce851029_847x714.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Infinity Cache has been around since RDNA2 in AMD’s discrete consumer GPU lineup, where it helped AMD hit high performance targets with lower DRAM bandwidth requirements. However, Infinity Cache’s efficacy has so far been difficult for me to evaluate. AMD’s discrete GPUs have performance monitoring facilities accessible through AMD’s developer tools. But those tools stop providing information past L2. Strix Halo stands out because it has an Infinity Cache implementation, and all the accessible performance monitoring features typical of a recent AMD GPU. That includes programmable performance counters at Infinity Fabric and memory controllers. It’s an opportunity to finally get insight into how well AMD’s Infinity Cache does its job in various graphics workloads.</p><p>Special thanks goes out to ASUS for sampling their ROG Flow Z13. This device implements AMD’s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 with 32 GB of LPDDR5X in a thin and light form factor. It superficially represents a convertible tablet from Microsoft’s Surface line, and is remarkably portable for a device with gaming credentials. Without ASUS’s help, this article wouldn’t have been possible.</p><p>AMD’s Infinity Fabric aims to abstract away details of how data travels across the chip. It does so by providing endpoints with well defined interfaces to let blocks make or handle memory requests. Infinity Fabric also provides a set of programmable performance counters. AMD documents a single DATA_BW performance event that counts data beats at endpoints. DATA_BW targets an endpoint via its 8-bit instance ID, and can count either reads or writes. AMD never documented Infinity Fabric instance IDs for Strix Halo. So, I did some guessing by generating traffic at various blocks and observing bandwidth counts at all possible instance IDs.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png" width="959" height="411" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:411,&quot;width&quot;:959,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cH9c!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c7e404-6987-45a7-8816-916580073352_959x411.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Instance IDs start from the Coherent Stations (CS-es), just like on server platforms. CS blocks sit in front of memory controllers and ensure cache coherency by probing another block if it might have a modified copy of the requested cacheline. If it doesn’t, which is most of the time, the CS will pass the request on to its attached Unified Memory Controller (UMC). Because CS blocks observe all requests to physical memory backed by DRAM, it’s a logical place to implement a memory side cache. That’s exactly what AMD does on chips with Infinity Cache. Cache hits let the CS avoid going to the UMC.</p><p>Strix Halo has 16 memory controllers and CS instances, each handling a 16-bit LPDDR5X channel. The GPU occupies the next eight instance IDs, suggesting it has a wide interface to Infinity Fabric. CPU core clusters come next. Each octa-core Zen 5 Core Complex (CCX) connects to Infinity Fabric via one endpoint. Miscellaneous blocks follow. These include the NPU, media engine, the display engine, and a mystery.</p><p>Cache misses usually cause a request to the next level in the memory hierarchy, while cache hits do not. Therefore, my idea is to compare traffic levels at the CS and UMC levels. Traffic that shows up at the CS but not at the UMCs can be used as a proxy for Infinity Cache hits. There are a few problems with that approach though.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png" width="1101" height="358" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:358,&quot;width&quot;:1101,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxOO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bf475d-4ec5-4a2b-b748-bb0094222fc8_1101x358.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>First, Strix Halo only provides eight Infinity Fabric performance counters. I have to use two counters per endpoint to count both read and write data beats, so I can only monitor four CS-es simultaneously. Memory traffic is interleaved across channels, so taking bandwidth observed at four CS-es and multiplying by four should give a reasonably accurate estimate of overall bandwidth. But interleaving isn’t perfectly even in practice, so I expect a few percentage points of error. The UMC situation is easier. Each UMC has its own set of four performance counters, letting me monitor all of them at the same time. I’m using one counter per UMC to count Column Address Strobe (CAS) commands. Other available UMC events allow monitoring memory controller frequency, bus utilization, and ACTIVATE or PRECHARGE commands. But that stuff goes beyond what I want to focus on here, and collecting more data points would make for annoyingly large spreadsheets.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png" width="800" height="216" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:216,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HXhV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2caf6cd2-64db-48f1-bd75-d9fbf4cd3632_800x216.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Cross-CCX traffic presents a second source of error as mentioned above. If a CS sends a probe that hits a modified line, it won’t send a request to the UMC. The request is still being satisfied out of cache, just not the Infinity Cache that I’m interested in. I expect this to be rare because cross-CCX traffic in general is usually low compared to requests satisfied from DRAM. It’ll be especially rare in the graphics workloads I’m targeting here because Strix Halo’s second CCD tends to be parked in Windows.</p><p><span>CPU-side traffic in general presents a more significant issue. Strix Halo’s Infinity Cache narrowly targets the GPU, and </span><a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/p/amds-strix-halo-under-the-hood" rel="">only GPU-side memory requests cause cache fills</a><span>. CPU memory accesses will be counted as misses in a hitrate calculation. That may be technically correct, but misses the point of Infinity Cache. Most memory traffic comes from the GPU, but there’s enough CPU-side traffic to create a bit more of an error bar than I’d like. Therefore, I want to focus on whether Infinity Cache is handling enough traffic to avoid hitting DRAM bandwidth bottlenecks.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png" width="1412" height="451" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:451,&quot;width&quot;:1412,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aNVH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7b48d2a-ec15-44ef-bfba-cd5edcffd261_1412x451.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Traffic captured at the CCD endpoints and two of the GPU’s (multiplied by 4)</figcaption></figure></div><p>A final limitation is that I’m sampling performance counters with a tool I wrote years ago. I wrote it so I could look at hardware performance stats just like how I like looking at Task Manager or other monitoring utilities to see how my system is doing. Because I’m updating a graphical interface, I sample data every second and thus have lower resolution compared to some vendor tools. Those can often sample at millisecond granularity or better. That opens the window to underestimating bandwidth demands if a bandwidth spike only occurs over a small fraction of a second. In theory I could write another tool. But Chips and Cheese is an unpaid hobby project that has to be balanced with a separate full time job as well as other free time interests. Quickly rigging an existing project to do my bidding makes more efficient use of time, because there’s never enough time to do everything I want.</p><p>I logged data over some arbitrarily selected graphics workloads, then selected the 1-second interval with the highest DRAM bandwidth usage. That should give an idea of whether Strix Halo comes close to reaching DRAM bandwidth limits. Overall, the 32 MB cache seems to do its job. Strix Halo is able to stay well clear of the 256 GB/s theoretical bandwidth limit that its LPDDR5X-8000 setup can deliver.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png" width="1254" height="765" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:765,&quot;width&quot;:1254,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C1NN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e44e20-a4f7-46ad-9eff-3849449cf6d6_1254x765.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Approximate CS-side bandwidth demands do indicate several workloads can push uncomfortably close to 256 GB/s.

Strix Halo has the same 2 MB of graphics L2 cache that AMD’s older 7000 series “Phoenix” mobile chip had, despite more than doubling GPU compute throughput. Unsurprisingly, the GPU can draw a lot of bandwidth across Infinity Fabric. 3DMark Time Spy again stands out. If AMD wanted to simply scale up DRAM bandwidth without spending die area on cache, they would need well over 335 GB/s from DRAM.</p><p>Curiously, Digital Foundry notes that Strix Halo has very similar graphics performance to the PS5. The PS5 uses a 256-bit, 14 GT/s GDDR6 setup that’s good for 448 GB/s of theoretical bandwidth, and doesn’t have a memory side cache like Strix Halo. 448 GB/s looks just about adequate for satisfying Time Spy Extreme’s bandwidth needs, if just barely. If Strix Halo didn’t need to work in power constrained mobile devices, and didn’t need high memory capacity for multitasking, perhaps AMD could have considered a GDDR6 setup. To bring things back around to Infinity Cache, it seems to do very well at that interval above. It captures approximately 73% of memory traffic going through Infinity Fabric, which is good even from a hitrate point of view.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png" width="1456" height="729" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:729,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yi5W!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5319a316-0b50-475c-8e70-29c8fa1fe6c5_1520x761.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The two bar graphs above already hint at how bandwidth demands and cache hitrates vary across workloads.

Plotting the percentage of traffic at the CS not observed at the UMCs as a proxy for hitrate further emphasizes that point.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png" width="1456" height="736" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:736,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wEdj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F487baf64-b146-4177-b647-e92b33c1cef3_1515x766.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Resolution settings can impact cache hitrate as well.

Taking a simplistic view and tripling maximum observed 8K bandwidth demands would give a figure just north of 525 GB/s. But Strix Halo’s iGPU clearly wasn’t built with such a scenario in mind, and AMD’s selected combination of cache capacity and DRAM bandwidth works well enough at all tested resolutions. While high resolutions create the most DRAM traffic, 1080P shows the heaviest bandwidth demands at the Infinity Fabric level.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png" width="1360" height="753" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:753,&quot;width&quot;:1360,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q1FQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a35935a-a75a-4e3a-9148-1f5411cbff0e_1360x753.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>3DMark Wild Life Extreme is a better example because it’s a lightweight benchmark designed to run on mobile devices.

Over a decade ago, Intel created “halo” iGPU variants and paired a 128 MB eDRAM cache while sticking with a typical 128-bit client memory bus. AMD’s console chips use large and fast DRAM buses. The PS5 is one example. Strix Halo does a bit of both. It combines modest cache capacity with a more DRAM bandwidth than typical client chips, but doesn’t rely as much on DRAM bandwidth as console chips.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png" width="1456" height="774" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:774,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FxEQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a3cead-075c-4b4e-b4e4-f7c89bbba388_1600x851.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Those varied approaches to the bandwidth problem are fascinating. Watching how Infinity Cache behaves in various graphics workloads has been fascinating as well. But everything would be so much more fun if AMD’s tools provided direct data on Infinity Cache hitrates. That applies to both integrated and discrete GPUs. Infinity Cache is a well established part of AMD’s strategy. It has been around for several generations, and now has a presence in AMD’s mobile lineup too. I suspect developers would love to see Infinity Cache hitrates in addition to the data on GPU-private caches that AMD’s current tools show.</p><p><span>If you like the content then consider heading over to the </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChipsandCheese" rel="">Patreon</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4EMPH66SBGVSQ" rel="">PayPal</a><span> if you want to toss a few bucks to Chips and Cheese.

<p>And Oxycyte was ideal for the group’s 2021 Ig Nobel-winning efforts. The experiments involved intra-anally administering oxygen gas or a liquid oxygenated perfluorocarbon to the unfortunate rodents and porcines. Yes, they gave the animals enemas. They then induced respiratory failure and evaluated the effectiveness of the intra-anal treatment. The result: Both treatments were pretty darned effective at staving off respiratory failure with no major complications.</p>

<p>So far, so good. The next logical step was to determine if EVA could work in human patients, too. “Patients with severe respiratory failure often need mechanical ventilation to survive, but these therapies can cause further lung injury,” the authors wrote in this latest paper. EVA “could give the lungs a chance to rest and heal.”</p>
<p>The team recruited 27 healthy adult men in Japan, each of whom received a dose of non-oxygenated perfluorodecalin via the anus. They were asked to retain the liquid for a full hour as the dosage slowly increased from 25 to 1,500 mL. Twenty of the men successfully completed the experiment. Apart from mild temporary abdominal bloating and discomfort—which proved to be dosage dependent and resolved with no need for medical attention—they experienced no adverse effects.</p>
<p>“This is the first human data and the results are limited solely to demonstrating the safety of the procedure and not its effectiveness,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1102615">said co-author Takanori Takebe</a> of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and the University of Osaka in Japan. “But now that we have established tolerance, the next step will be to evaluate how effective the process is for delivering oxygen to the bloodstream.”</p>

  <p><em>[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]</em></p><p>Niagara Falls is one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world. With a vertical drop of more than 50 meters or 164 feet and a flow rate that often exceeds 2800 cubic meters per second or 100,000 cubic feet per second, it’s one of North America’s crown jewels. Roughly ten million people visit the falls every year just to catch a glimpse of the curtains of water pouring over the edge and the constant clouds of mist at the bottom. But Niagara Falls isn’t just a tourist attraction. The special geology and hydrology of this region, situated between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, have resulted in some fascinating feats of infrastructure, from shipping to electricity to water control. It’s basically a microcosm of all the things I love. The falls themselves have required quite a bit of engineering over the years, and they’ve even been shut off for maintenance. Let’s take a little tour of the Niagara Peninsula (even though it’s really an isthmus), and I’ll show you some of the things that aren’t usually listed in a guidebook. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering.</p><p>Let’s get oriented first. This is a map of the isthmus. We’ve got Lake Erie to the south, Lake Ontario to the north, Buffalo and western New York to the East, and Ontario, Canada, to the west. The Niagara River runs northward, connecting the two great lakes. And right in the middle, it plunges off the Niagara Escarpment, creating the famous falls. On the US side, there are the American Falls and the smaller Bridal Veil Falls. And on the Canadian side is the Horseshoe Falls where a majority of the river flows. It’s pretty impressive to see in person, but it’s actually not entirely a benefit. Because these falls pose a major problem for shipping.</p><p>The Great Lakes form the largest inland freshwater transportation system in the world. Since the 19th century, they’ve served as the backbone for moving iron ore, coal, grain, and manufactured goods between the American heartland and the Atlantic Ocean. Ore from Minnesota and grain from the Midwest can travel by ship all the way to steel mills or export terminals on the East Coast. Barges and freighters are efficient at moving bulk cargo in a way rail and trucks can’t match. For a time, the Niagara Escarpment was a natural bottleneck between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, preventing goods from moving directly between the upper lakes and the Atlantic. Freight had to be offloaded and portaged around the falls before it could continue its journey. The Erie Canal solved the problem somewhat, starting in 1825, bypassing Lake Ontario. But it could only accommodate smaller vessels, and even before the Canal opened, another solution was being planned.</p><p>The Welland Canal runs through the peninsula west of the Niagara River, connecting two massive areas by shipping traffic for the first time in 1829. The canal fueled the early growth of cities along the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River - including Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, Chicago, Toronto, Montreal, and Quebec City - and it’s been rebuilt and moved several times over its life. The Welland Canal is really a titanic engineering achievement and, were it not positioned next to one of the natural wonders of the world, it would probably be famous in its own right. Because of the huge difference in elevation between the two lakes created by the escarpment, eight separate locks are required to allow ships to traverse between them. And all different kinds do - from personal leisure craft to the lakers that stay in fresh water to the salties that travel between the lakes and the ocean through the St. Lawrence Seaway.</p><p>Starting on the upstream, Lake Erie side of the canal, the first lock isn’t really for lifting or lowering ships so much as for control. The level of Lake Erie actually fluctuates throughout the year, and there are longer-term trends as well. Wind storms also raise the level locally similar to the way storm surge works during hurricanes. The control lock does just that: it controls the level in the downstream canal. It prevents excess water from rushing down the canal when the lake is high, kind of like an airlock on a spaceship keeps air from rushing out when astronauts step outside for a spacewalk.</p><p>Downstream of the control lock, the canal splits in two. The original pathway of the canal flows through the eponymous town of Welland, while the larger and newer section of canal, the Welland Bypass… well, it bypasses Welland to the east. If you look carefully, you’ll also notice a small river, the Welland River, which passes underneath both the original and bypass canals. On the way downstream from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, shipping traffic passes over aqueducts that pass over a natural river. A hydrological wonderland!</p><p>Continuing downstream from the aqueducts, the remaining seven locks are lift locks, more like what you think of when you imagine a lock. Notice how they’re clustered tightly around the terrain and not distributed evenly along the length of the canal. That’s the Niagara escarpment, the same geological feature that the water cascades down at the falls. This is the elevation diagram of the entire Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway system from Lake Superior to the Atlantic Ocean, and you can see that this drop is the biggest one of the whole thing. And that’s pretty important for another part of the infrastructure on the peninsula.</p><p>The power available from a moving fluid is directly proportional to the flow rate multiplied by the height of the drop. In most hydropower applications, that height is created artificially by a dam. There aren’t that many places in the world where you have both a large volume of flowing water and a significant natural drop in elevation. But that combination made Niagara Falls the birthplace of large-scale electric power in North America. In 1895, the Niagara Power Company opened the Edward Dean Adams Power Plant, built with Westinghouse AC generators based on the ideas and patents of Nikola Tesla. The plant served as the basis for the modern electrical grids we have today, and many of the fundamental concepts are basically unchanged.</p><p>But the power infrastructure at Niagara Falls definitely has changed. Where the Adams Power Plant put out about 40 megawatts of power in 1895, now the combined capacity from the region is in the neighborhood of 5 gigawatts. But in both cases, it wasn’t as simple as putting a turbine at the base of the falls. While it might be technically possible to generate power by placing a water wheel directly in the stream of a waterfall like a kid’s bath toy, it’s not the most efficient way (plus it would take away from the beauty). The water used to power the hydroelectric plants on both the US and Canadian sides of the Niagara River is water that never actually flows over the falls. Instead, it’s diverted into five massive tunnels - two on the US side and three on the Canadian side.</p><p>Like most tunnels, you can’t really see the extent of the hydro tunnels at Niagara Falls. There are a few conspicuous clues though, like these gigantic buildings. These interesting protrusions from the landscape house enormous steel doors, nearly 60 feet tall, that can drop down into the tunnels and close off the flow for inspections and maintenance. Both the Ontario and New York sides of the river feature similar structures.</p><p>From the tunnels, water flows into major hydropower plants on both sides of the border: the twin Adam Beck stations on the Canadian side and Robert Moses station on the US side. Then it’s released into the the lower part of the river below the falls. When you add them up, that’s 39 turbines with a combined capacity of more than 4000 megawatts. It’s a tremendous amount of power generation in one place. But actually, that’s not all of it.</p><p>These tunnels divert 50-75% of the flow of the Niagara River. That wide range in percentage of diversion isn’t because we don’t know how much is diverted, but because we actually control how much water is diverted, depending on the tourist requirements agreed upon in a treaty by both nations. During the day in peak tourist season, more water is allowed to flow over the falls to ensure the grandeur of the falls is on full display for the huge crowds of tourists that visit every year. At night and during the winter, more of the flow is diverted to generate power. That’s all managed by this structure upstream of the falls: the international control dam.</p><p>I’ve always thought this is an interesting dam, since it doesn’t even go all the way across the river. But it doesn’t need to. This structure’s not meant to create a reservoir; it just subtly adjusts the level in the river to control how much water flows over the falls versus into the hydropower intakes. The US side of the Niagara River is pretty shallow, so that side acts kind of like an uncontrolled spillway. Then, the gates on the Canadian side can be adjusted to balance the competing demands on water between tourism and power.</p><p>But there’s one big problem with those competing needs: they both have the same timing. We want thunderous cascades of water over the falls during the day when tourists are visiting, but daytime is also when the demand for electricity is highest. It’s like if solar panels only worked at night. To accommodate this, both the US and Canada have pumped storage plants. At night, excess electricity is used to pump diverted water into reservoirs, essentially storing both the power and the extra water that’s available during off-peak hours. Then, during the day, the water is released back into the forebay of the power plants. You get a little extra power from that drop out of the reservoir into the forebays, so both sides have small hydropower facilities to capture that. But more importantly, you get a lot more water during the day than would otherwise be available to run through the big plants, making more power when it’s needed most. And there’s just something funny to me that the infrastructure is duplicated on both sides of the river, like neither country was willing to be one-upped by the other.</p><p>All of this diversion noticeably reduces the flow of water over the falls. Even when they are at ‘full blast’ during the day in the tourist season, only 50% of the flow of the Niagara River makes it over the falls. You can imagine how powerful the falls would be if 100% of the flow were to cascade over. It might seem like this diversion detracts from the majesty of the falls, but in another sense, it actually preserves it. </p><p>All waterfalls undergo some degree of erosion as the water and sediment suspended in it scours away the rocks and soil underneath. Without any diversion, Niagara Falls would be receding towards Lake Erie at a rate of about 3 feet every year. At the end of the last ice age, the falls were right at the edge of the Niagara Escarpment, but thousands of years of erosion have caused them to work their way upstream. You can actually see how far it’s already progressed by looking at this elevation map. Over the last 12,000 years or so, the falls have migrated by erosion to their current location. By diverting a significant portion of the flow, the power plants have actually slowed the rate of erosion to approximately one foot per year, which will help preserve the falls for a longer period.</p><p>While flow on the falls is downregulated by diversion for hydropower, the falls are never ‘turned off’...except for the one time in the 1960s. The smaller American Falls (and nearby Bridal Veil Falls) have a pile of loose rocks and boulders, called talus, at their base. This pile of rocky debris actually extends a good fraction of the way up the falls, and officials worried that the falls might ultimately transition into a series of rapids cascading down the slope of talus rather than remaining a majestic waterfall. So, in 1969, the Army Corps of Engineers built a temporary cofferdam between the New York shoreline and Goat Island, diverting the water over the Canadian Horseshoe Falls and leaving the American Falls dry(ish)!</p><p>After the engineers got a chance to inspect the situation, they determined that the best course of action was just to leave the majority of the talus in place, since it seemed to be stabilizing the cliff face. Sometimes, doing mostly nothing is a decision you make as an engineer, even if you have to do a monumental amount of work to come to that conclusion. So the cofferdam was taken out, and water has flowed continuously over all the falls since then.</p><p>It really highlights the complexity of Niagara Falls. On the one hand, you have one of the natural wonders of the world, an absolutely enormous set of waterfalls that inspire awe and wonder in the countless travelers who are lucky enough to take in the view. The same thing that makes it impressive for tourists (the big drop) makes it valuable for power and a major challenge for shipping. And out of that comes all kinds of fascinating infrastructure, not only to facilitate the tourism but the other stuff too: a major canal with locks and aqueducts, the international dam control gates, pumped storage reservoirs, epic tunnels, towering gates, massive hydropower plants, and so much more. It’s really a pretty remarkable place for engineering.</p>

I was lounging in my pajamas, idly scrolling through Netflix, having spent the morning reading news stories, occasionally tweeting, and watching TV. It was a rare day off.<br></p><p>Then my phone lit up with a notification. I glanced down at the message.<br></p><p>“Anna, Lindsey Halligan here,” it began.&nbsp;</p><p>Lindsey Halligan—the top prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia—was texting me. As it turned out, she was texting me about a criminal case she is pursuing against one of the president’s perceived political enemies: New York Attorney General Letitia James.<br></p><p>So began my two-day text correspondence with the woman President Donald Trump had installed, in no small part, to bring the very prosecution she was now discussing with me by text message.<br></p><p>Over the next 33 hours, Halligan texted me again.<br></p><p>And again.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And again.&nbsp;</p><p>And again.<br></p><p>Through the whole of our correspondence, however, there is something Halligan never said: She never said a word suggesting that she was not “on the record.”</p><p>It is not uncommon for federal prosecutors to communicate with the press, both through formal channels and sometimes informally. My exchange with Halligan, however, was highly unusual in a number of respects. She initiated a conversation with me, a reporter she barely knew, to discuss an ongoing prosecution that she is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/27/us/politics/trump-comey-justice-department.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">personally handling</a>. She mostly criticized my reporting—or, more precisely, my summary of someone else’s reporting. But several of her messages contained language that touched on grand jury matters, even as she insisted that she could not reveal such information,&nbsp; which is protected from disclosure by prosecutors under federal law.<br></p><p>As a legal journalist covering the Justice Department, I had never encountered anything quite like my exchange with Halligan. Neither had my editor. Over the last several days, he and I spoke with multiple former federal officials and journalists who cover the justice system. None could recall a similar instance in which a sitting U.S. attorney reached out to chastise a reporter about matters concerning grand jury testimony in an active case.</p><p><a href="https://givebutter.com/journalism" target="_blank" data-sf-ec-immutable=""><img src="https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/support-lawfare8495e13b-9c80-42f6-ac96-e96789089124.png?sfvrsn=86c5a5d4_3" height="62" width="206" alt="" sf-size="69672"></a></p><p>Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre confirmed the authenticity of the texts at 4:34 p.m.&nbsp;today, responding to my questions about the exchange with a statement that reads in its entirety:</p><blockquote>You clearly didn’t get the response you wanted—which was information handed over to you without having to dig into the facts of the case to craft a truthful story—so you thought you’d “tattletale” to main justice. Lindsay [sic] Halligan was attempting to point you to facts, not gossip, but when clarifying that she would adhere to the rule of the law and not disclose Grand Jury information, you threaten to leak an entire conversation. Good luck ever getting anyone to talk to you when you publish their texts.</blockquote><p>After I reached out to the department for comment on Halligan’s texts, Halligan texted me yet again, for the first time in several days, insisting that our entire correspondence had been off the record. Our full exchange, linked below, allows readers to make their own judgments on that question.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>***</strong><br></p><p>As with many Trumpworld stories, this one began with someone getting sacked. That someone was Erik Siebert, Halligan’s predecessor as the U.S. Attorney in eastern Virginia, who was removed—or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/erik-siebert-comey-letitia-james.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">forced to resign</a>—last month.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-attorney-plans-resign-amid-pressure-trump-after/story?id=125750006" data-sf-ec-immutable="">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/erik-siebert-comey-letitia-james.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">reports</a>, Siebert had raised doubts that the evidence was strong enough to pursue criminal charges against two of President Trump’s longtime adversaries: New York Attorney General Letitia James, who won a civil fraud verdict against the Trump Organization, and former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump had fired during his first term in office and had long blamed for the so-called “Russiagate” investigation. For years, Trump has publicly said that Comey and James should be punished for <em>something</em>. But Siebert <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/erik-siebert-comey-letitia-james.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">reportedly balked</a> at the idea of bringing criminal charges that he thought lacked merit. After news of his objections surfaced in the press, he abruptly departed.<br></p><p>The fallout was swift. That weekend, in the wake of Siebert’s departure, Trump went on a social media tirade, demanding that the attorney general, Pam Bondi, move swiftly to prosecute his perceived foes. “They’re all guilty as hell,” Trump wrote of Comey and James in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Sept. 20 Truth Social post</a>—which, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-doj-inside-political-enemies-17f13f72?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcfTHPLdgzc-PAS8WDsHnRql46_qbUhtVoQI_2jHzEAnNx7-HjZ-vcW9AKaI4Y%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f5867a&amp;gaa_sig=l3iUZaUHTpvyS-LcsEihIdrkS6SCC3U5smjqlzOwEFzBi90n3wQPvHgRcDULXJnNdDGaZo4ABNjlgf8JcXAV7w%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">according to the Wall Street Journal</a>, may have been intended as a private message. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”<br></p><p>By the following Monday morning, Trump had installed a new top prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia: Halligan, his former personal attorney, who until now had never prosecuted a case. Despite her lack of prosecutorial experience—and reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/27/us/politics/trump-comey-justice-department.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">against the urging</a> of veteran prosecutors in her office—Halligan pressed forward. Within days of her arrival, she secured an <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/former-fbi-director-james-comey-indicted" data-sf-ec-immutable="">indictment against Comey</a> for false statements to Congress and obstruction. Two weeks after that, she persuaded a separate grand jury to <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/ny-attorney-general-letitia-james-indicted-in-eastern-district-of-virginia" data-sf-ec-immutable="">indict James for mortgage fraud</a>.<br></p><p>This is around when I entered the picture—on Saturday, Oct. 11.<br></p><p>Until she texted me, I’d spent much of that morning catching up on news stories about the case Halligan brought against James, which had just been handed up on Thursday, Oct. 9.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-justice-department-s-dangerously-weak-case-against-letitia-james" data-sf-ec-immutable="">The indictment</a> accuses the New York attorney general of misrepresenting how she intended to use a Norfolk, Virginia property when she applied for a loan to purchase it back in 2020.<br></p><p>Specifically, prosecutors say that she told lenders the property would be used as a “second home” when, in reality, she used it as a “rental investment property, renting the property to a family of (3).” By misrepresenting the purpose of the property, the indictment alleges, James was able to obtain a more favorable mortgage rate.&nbsp;<br></p><p>While many <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-indictment-of-letitia-james-and-the-collapse-of-impartial-justice" data-sf-ec-immutable="">commentators</a> ridiculed the case, <a href="https://x.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/1970164891265778057" data-sf-ec-immutable="">a </a><a href="https://x.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/1970164891265778057" data-sf-ec-immutable="">few</a> were quick to proclaim that Halligan had an <a href="https://x.com/HansMahncke/status/1976405182092136675" data-sf-ec-immutable="">“airtight”</a> case against James.<br></p><p>I was decidedly <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-justice-department-s-dangerously-weak-case-against-letitia-james" data-sf-ec-immutable="">among the skeptics</a>. Putting aside the apparently retaliatory nature of the charges, it wasn’t clear to me that the facts alleged in <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/ny-attorney-general-letitia-james-indicted-in-eastern-district-of-virginia" data-sf-ec-immutable="">the indictment</a> amounted to a crime at all. The mortgage agreement James signed, which used standard Fannie Mae language, required her to treat the property as a “second home,” mandating that she keep it “available” for her personal use. The agreement explicitly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/second-home-rider-rewrite-11555599871?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcUT8LvIU2CXmeDCoIMsludAJmjr5issT4tfkgias5sFkphmFK88OqBU7bdpYI%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f2ab4b&amp;gaa_sig=azS6fiwCJVPkqbgw8qwqhY-r0TwcXalD5-U0w2DxFeykdbxDzOkFjzkILYm3LToufUtoVji9kLdpb3tPriUGNA%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">allowed James to rent</a> the home after one year of ownership, and it <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/second-home-rider-rewrite-11555599871?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcUT8LvIU2CXmeDCoIMsludAJmjr5issT4tfkgias5sFkphmFK88OqBU7bdpYI%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f2ab4b&amp;gaa_sig=azS6fiwCJVPkqbgw8qwqhY-r0TwcXalD5-U0w2DxFeykdbxDzOkFjzkILYm3LToufUtoVji9kLdpb3tPriUGNA%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">allowed occasional renting</a> within the first year.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Though <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/ny-attorney-general-letitia-james-indicted-in-eastern-district-of-virginia" data-sf-ec-immutable="">the indictment</a> notes that James declared “thousand(s)” of dollars in rent on “tax form(s),” it provides scant details about the circumstances of the supposed rental arrangement, including the timing and amount collected.&nbsp; Without knowing those details, I found it difficult to assess whether James had even violated the mortgage contract—much less whether she’d committed a crime by fraudulently entering into it or making false statements on her application intending to deceive anyone.<br></p><p>All of which is why, last Saturday, I took particular interest in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">New York Times story</a> about the Norfolk home at the center of the James case. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">The report</a> revealed that the property is occupied by James’s grand-niece, Nakia Thompson. Several times a year, the report said, James stays at the property with Thompson and her children, who have lived there since James purchased the home in 2020.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">further reported</a> that Thompson appeared before a Norfolk grand jury in June, testifying that “she had lived in the house for years and that she did not pay rent.” According to the report, Thompson was not asked to testify again, and the grand jury that voted to indict James was seated in Alexandria rather than Norfolk.&nbsp;</p><p>As I saw it, the Times report tended to undermine the indictment’s central claim: that James used the home as a “rental investment property.” The evidence, assuming the Times report is accurate, would be exculpatory, I reasoned, in that it tends to show that James did not primarily use the property as a means to collect rent.<br></p><p>I decided to share the article on X, formerly Twitter, as I often do when notable developments arise in relation to the legal cases I cover for<em> Lawfare</em>. Shortly after noon, I tapped out <a href="https://x.com/AnnaBower/status/1977046307970895925" data-sf-ec-immutable="">a post</a>, linking to the Times article and summarizing it as follows:</p><blockquote>NYT reports that Letitia James’s great niece lives in the home that is the subject of the indictment. The niece reportedly testified before a *different* grand jury, telling them that she had lived there for many years without paying rent. James visits regularly.”<br></blockquote><p>I included <a href="https://x.com/AnnaBower/status/1977046307970895925" data-sf-ec-immutable="">two screenshots</a> from the story, one of which highlighted this quotation: “Ms. Thompson testified to a grand jury in Norfolk that she had lived in the house for years and that she did not pay rent.”</p><p><img src="https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/screenshot-2025-10-20-at-5-25-44-pm.png?sfvrsn=7447e92c_3" alt="" sf-size="100"></p><p>Not long after that, at 12:48 p.m., I followed up with a <a href="https://x.com/AnnaBower/status/1977053748511097105" data-sf-ec-immutable="">second observation</a>: “This is important exculpatory evidence bc the indictment accuses James of seeking a ‘second home’ mortgage when in reality she intended to use it as an ‘investment’ home by renting it.”</p><p><img src="https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/screenshot-2025-10-20-at-5-27-50-pm.png?sfvrsn=34af51be_3" alt="" sf-size="100"></p><p>I didn’t think much of the tweets at the time. Sharing other journalists’ reporting is a routine part of how I try to keep people apprised of the cases I follow.<br></p><p>But the prosecutor who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/lindsey-halligan-no-coordinate-letitia-james-indictment-doj" data-sf-ec-immutable="">personally presented</a> James’s case to the grand jury apparently saw my tweets very differently.<br></p><p><strong>***</strong></p><p>When I received the 1:20 p.m. connection request on Signal—an encrypted messaging service that many journalists use to communicate with sources—my first reaction was that the user identified as “Lindsey Halligan” couldn’t actually be Halligan.<br></p><p>“Anna, Lindsey Halligan here,” the first message read. “You are reporting things that are simply not true. Thought you should have a heads up.”<br></p><p>The user on the other end had selected a setting to make all messages in the chat disappear after eight hours, so I took screenshots of the exchange as it happened to make sure a record of the back-and-forth was preserved. Those <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190909-signal-screenshots/" data-sf-ec-immutable="">screenshots are all available </a><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190909-signal-screenshots/" data-sf-ec-immutable="">here</a>.<br></p><p>Even as I took this precaution, I assumed the exchange was a hoax because, while it is not unusual for lawyers to reach out to me about my reporting or commentary, it is highly unusual for a U.S. attorney to do so regarding an ongoing prosecution—particularly in a high-profile case in which her conduct is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbKHyNhaaCM" data-sf-ec-immutable="">already the subject</a> of <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/lindsey-halligan-is-already-making-mistakes-prosecuting-james-comey-10799728" data-sf-ec-immutable="">immense public scrutiny</a>. Halligan has publicly said little about the cases she is pursuing against the president’s enemies. And I didn’t believe she would message me to complain about a tweet that merely summarized other journalistic coverage of grand jury testimony.<br></p><p>With all that in mind, I hypothesized that the message was from someone impersonating Halligan, either to troll me or as a part of some kind of disinformation campaign.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But there was an easy way to validate my correspondent’s claim to be Halligan. I’d met Halligan once before, a few years ago in West Palm Beach, Florida. At the time, the Justice Department was investigating Trump’s unlawful retention of classified materials and the FBI had executed a search at Mar-a-Lago. Halligan was one of the former and future president’s personal lawyers litigating over the search and the handling of seized materials.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Our meeting was happenstance: I ran into her and another Trump lawyer, James Trusty, at a restaurant inside The Breakers hotel, where I dined after <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/mar-lago-showdown-federal-court" data-sf-ec-immutable="">covering a hearing</a> before Judge Aileen Cannon for<em> Lawfare</em>. When I introduced myself to the pair, they’d made no secret of their dissatisfaction with how I’d characterized <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/mar-lago-showdown-federal-court" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Trusty’s presentation</a> during the hearing—particularly, my use of verbs like “gripe” and “complain” to describe his arguments to the judge.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Guardian would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/01/trump-lawyers-resign-criminal-investigation" data-sf-ec-immutable="">later report</a> that Trusty had been overheard telling Halligan that he had no interest in talking to reporters from <em>Lawfare</em> on account of <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/projects-series/archived-projects/the-trump-trials">our coverage</a>. Still, my conversation with them that evening was otherwise pleasant enough. And I suspected that the real Halligan would remember me.<br></p><p>So I accepted the Signal request and typed out a response, explaining that I needed some additional details to confirm her identity. “Can you tell me where we first met, and who you were with?” I asked.<br></p><p>The person purporting to be “Lindsey Halligan” responded one minute later: “Breakers; Trusty. Got your name from your X account.”<br></p><p>This changed things. I had never spoken publicly about my run-in with Halligan and Trusty at The Breakers. So it seemed exceedingly unlikely that a Halligan impersonator would be able to accurately answer the question, let alone within one minute.<br></p><p>As improbable as it had seemed just minutes ago, it now appeared that I really was texting with interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Later in the week, I verified that the text exchange had genuinely been with Halligan—or, at least, with Halligan’s phone. I obtained her cell phone number from an independent source and added the number as a contact on my phone. Signal immediately associated the phone number with the “Lindsey Halligan” account with which I had been texting.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But that was later. For now, I was pretty sure my correspondent was Halligan. So I did what any reporter would do: I started asking questions.<br></p><p>“Ok, I’m all ears,” I said after thanking her. “What am I getting wrong?”<br></p><p>“Honestly, so much,” Halligan replied. “I can’t tell you everything but your reporting in particular is just way off.” She then said it was clear to her that I jump to “biased conclusions” based on what I read rather than “truly looking into the evidence.”<br></p><p>I felt confident that Halligan was alluding to one of the tweets I’d posted that afternoon. Other than the tweets, I hadn’t published anything of substance about the James case; my colleague, Molly Roberts, has been <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-justice-department-s-dangerously-weak-case-against-letitia-james" data-sf-ec-immutable="">running</a><a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-justice-department-s-dangerously-weak-case-against-letitia-james" data-sf-ec-immutable=""> point</a> on that matter for <em>Lawfare</em>.&nbsp; What’s more, Halligan had mentioned that she found my Signal contact on my X profile, suggesting that she had been looking at my tweets.<br></p><p>To confirm, I sent Halligan a link to <a href="https://x.com/AnnaBower/status/1977046307970895925" data-sf-ec-immutable="">the post</a> in which I summarized Thompson’s grand jury testimony <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">as reported by</a> the Times. “Are you saying that something I said in this post is inaccurate?” I asked. “And if so, what?”<br></p><p>Halligan replied: “You’re assuming exculpatory evidence without knowing what you’re talking about. It’s just bizarre to me. If you have any questions, before you report, feel free to reach out to me. But jumping to conclusions does your credibility no good.”&nbsp;</p><p>Halligan’s real beef seemed to be with the Times, not me, though she wasn’t saying what was wrong with the Times’s story either. I brought this up in my response, pointing out that my post explicitly credited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/politics/letitia-james-indictment-house.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">the Times story</a>, not my own reporting. “Did they get something wrong?” I asked.<br></p><p>“Yes they did but you went with it!” she said. “Without even fact checking anything!!!!”&nbsp;</p><p>Then she added this: “And they are disclosing grand jury info - which is also not a full representation of what happened. I guess I expect them to do that but I was surprised by you running with it.”<br></p><p>Note that there is nothing improper about the New York Times disclosing grand jury information. The rules of grand jury secrecy, codified in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_6" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Rule 6(e) of t</a><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_6" data-sf-ec-immutable="">he Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure</a>, don’t apply to the press. And they don’t bind defense attorneys or witnesses either. So if, say, Thompson or her lawyers had dished to the New York Times about her testimony and the Times had reported about her account, nobody would be violating any rule.<br></p><p>On the other hand, it is <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_6" data-sf-ec-immutable="">generally improper</a> for prosecutors to disclose matters that took place before a grand jury. Rule 6(e) very explicitly covers “an attorney for the government,” and it very specifically prohibits those it covers—subject to certain exceptions—from “disclos[ing] a matter occurring before the grand jury.” And the Justice Manual, which serves as the official statement of Justice Department policies, places <a href="https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-11000-grand-jury" data-sf-ec-immutable="">detailed restrictions</a> on prosecutors’ use of matters before the grand jury. The matters reported on by the Times are matters of which Halligan would be intimately aware, as she is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/letitia-james-case-explained" data-sf-ec-immutable="">reported</a> to have personally presented the case to the grand jury.&nbsp;</p><p>Avoiding grand jury secrecy violations is one reason Justice Department officials so <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/02/robert-mueller-russia-probe-secret-243345" data-sf-ec-immutable="">frequently offer </a><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/02/robert-mueller-russia-probe-secret-243345" data-sf-ec-immutable="">“no comment”</a> on ongoing investigations or cases, preferring instead that the department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-opening-statement-senate-judiciary-committee" data-sf-ec-immutable="">“speak through its court filings.</a><a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-opening-statement-senate-judiciary-committee" data-sf-ec-immutable="">”</a> And that’s why my dialogue with Halligan struck me as so unusual. Reaching out to a reporter to complain about tweets concerning another publication’s coverage of grand jury testimony seemed uncharacteristically risky for a government lawyer.<br></p><p>I told Halligan that I’d be happy to retract or correct anything I had tweeted that was untrue. “But I can’t do that if I don’t know what the supposed error is,” I said. “Can you be more specific?”<br></p><p>She directed me to the indictment. “It says she received thousand(s) of dollars in rent,” she said, presumably referring to James. Then she added: “I can’t tell you grand jury stuff.”<br></p><p>At this point, I broadly understood Halligan to be conveying a few things to me.&nbsp; The first is that the Times story did indeed disclose grand jury information, but that she believed some part of its account was either inaccurate or misleading or lacked the full context of what occurred. Though she hadn’t explicitly said <em>what</em> grand jury information the Times had disclosed, I interpreted the focus of her ire to be the paper’s account of Thompson’s testimony, which I’d summarized in my tweet.<br></p><p>The second point is that Halligan seemed to be responding in some way to the substance of Thompson’s reported testimony—specifically, that she did not pay rent—by directing me to the indictment, which alleged that James reported “thousand(s)” of dollars in rental income on “tax form(s).”<br></p><p>This did not seem to me to be much of a conflict. I had interpreted the Times to be saying that Thompson was not <em>currently</em> paying rent and had gone for years without doing so, not that she had <em>never</em> paid any rent at any point.<br></p><p>The indictment’s wording on this point is odd and ambiguous. It conspicuously omits the timing and the amount of money in rental income James supposedly reported on her “tax form(s).” And, while the “tax form(s)” are not publicly available, James’s state ethics disclosures are.<br></p><p><a href="https://whitecollarfraud.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2018-to-2023-Letitia-James-Financial-Disclosures.pdf" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Those disclosures report</a> rental income on the Norfolk property only once, back in 2020, for a sum of between $1,000 and $5,000. That James might have collected a relatively small sum of rental income at some point half a decade ago does not contradict the idea that Thompson has lived there for years without paying rent. Nor does it show that James violated her mortgage agreement, given that the contract <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/second-home-rider-rewrite-11555599871?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdYiN0zOEWG_ZmXuGCu-GNKwV6h7TzaVn-erMKvObNnWA-xJFXhbN2Hg3-tVtc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f67b82&amp;gaa_sig=UFQK17cjRwHmmxL76ytAQ1iOgcGHrbi-djFnm7QlRklZPyVT0P8ss7U4l_T-XXGvD3vEgpiWtkpv3DNdKldNNQ%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">allowed occasional rentals</a>, even during the first year.</p><p>To be sure, it’s possible that the evidence at trial will show otherwise. But the indictment Halligan had filed, coupled with the publicly available facts, don’t promise that it will. And the specific allegation she’d pointed me to did not on its face contradict the testimony I’d summarized in my tweet.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond that, though, I still couldn’t understand precisely <em>what </em>Halligan was trying to tell me. Was she suggesting that Thompson had lied to the grand jury? Or that the Times had mischaracterized Thompson’s testimony? Or something else entirely?<br></p><p>I explained my thinking to Halligan in my next response, writing as follows:</p><blockquote>I read the NY Times report as saying that Nakia testified that she lived in the house for years without paying rent. Though the indictment says there were thousands of dollars of rent paid *at one point,* I don’t see that as inconsistent with her testimony as reported by the NY Times. James’s ethics disclosures report between $1,000-$5,000 in rent back in 2020. But after that, she didn’t disclose additional rental income. I’m still not sure I understand what’s incorrect about the NY Times account or my summary of it.<br></blockquote><p>Halligan replied:</p><blockquote><p>Anna,</p><p>You’re biased. Your reporting isn’t accurate. I’m the one handling the case and I’m telling you that. If you want to twist and torture the facts to fit your narrative, there’s nothing I can do. Waste to even give you a heads up.<br></p></blockquote><p>In turn, I reminded Halligan that it was she who had approached me to tell me that I’d compounded or repeated something inaccurate in the Times’s account of Thompson’s testimony. “I am happy to correct it, but I can’t do so without a sense of what I supposedly got wrong,” I said.<br></p><p>“Continue to do what you have been and you’ll be completely discredited when the evidence comes out,” she replied.</p><p>I still wasn’t sure what I’d supposedly gotten wrong, or why she’d contacted me, or what to make of it all.</p><p>And for what it’s worth, the Times doesn’t know either. In a statement to <em>Lawfare</em>, the paper said that the Justice Department had raised no issue with the Times about its story: “We’re confident in the accuracy of our reporting. The DOJ declined to comment before publication and has not raised any concerns with us since the story was published more than a week ago.”</p><p>It was clear that Halligan and I had reached a point of diminishing returns.</p><p>“I’d love to talk further when you are at liberty to be specific,” I said.</p><p>And we left it there—at least for a few hours.</p><p><strong>***</strong></p><p>Later that evening, I followed up with Halligan. She’d seemed frustrated by the end of our conversation that afternoon. But she’d also told me that I could “feel free” to reach out to her if I had any questions. And I wanted to find out if she was serious about that.<br></p><p>“I’m curious for your thoughts more broadly,” I wrote at 9:19 p.m. on Saturday. “What are you most frustrated that reporters aren’t focusing on or writing about with respect to this case?”<br></p><p>“No frustration generally,” she replied. “You’re the only reporter I reached out to.”<br></p><p>The next day, I tried again. I asked if I should expect additional charges against James, as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trumps-favored-prosecutor-is-moving-at-full-steam-8b3cdecb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdHnHePvJ-PT4MBAvwmJkH923hWWmBtw12kyV8tZglO8BT9Ic6LhUnXCe72q1c%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f2af08&amp;gaa_sig=_EIG6DY_NytNy0l-whyS6zFJbDSawqC9W_bnxH1Ljrvo5WIQjD6PWVblfMOaR-NGqAsiAX7RNhHINQCOmY9lyg%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">the </a><a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trumps-favored-prosecutor-is-moving-at-full-steam-8b3cdecb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdHnHePvJ-PT4MBAvwmJkH923hWWmBtw12kyV8tZglO8BT9Ic6LhUnXCe72q1c%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68f2af08&amp;gaa_sig=_EIG6DY_NytNy0l-whyS6zFJbDSawqC9W_bnxH1Ljrvo5WIQjD6PWVblfMOaR-NGqAsiAX7RNhHINQCOmY9lyg%3D%3D" data-sf-ec-immutable="">Wall Street Journal</a> had reported over the weekend.<br></p><p>“You don’t report fairly!” Halligan replied. Then she added: “I can’t discuss any potential charges with reporters. If evidence arises that warrants further charges, I’ll look into it!”<br></p><p>I was genuinely confused. Only the previous day, she had essentially invited me to fact-check other outlets’ reporting before tweeting about them. Now she was refusing to engage when I did exactly that. “I thought you said I was welcome to reach out to you about what other outlets are reporting,” I said.<br></p><p>She wrote back: “Why do you report on what other outlets are reporting? If I was you, I’d develop sources myself and out compete them all!”<br></p><p>I expressed my confusion in my next message: “What was the purpose of reaching out to me, if not to open a line of communication? Was it just to insult my reporting?”<br></p><p>“No, it was for you to correct it, which you refused to do,” she replied.<br></p><p>We’d come full circle, back to my tweet summarizing the Times article. Something about it had seemed to strike a nerve with Halligan, but I couldn’t figure out exactly what or why.<br></p><p>“I am more than happy to correct it, but you still haven’t told me what’s incorrect!” I said. “What precisely is wrong with the tweet?”<br></p><p>Halligan didn’t respond.<br></p><p>Over the next several days, I followed up twice more, asking Halligan for her perspective on a variety of questions I had about the James case. My texts went unanswered.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>***</strong><br></p><p>Halligan had said quite a lot during our correspondence, although much of it was hard for me to parse. But there was an important thing she had <em>not</em> said during the entirety of our communications: “Off the record” or “On background” or anything whatsoever about the terms on which we were talking.&nbsp;</p><p>As anyone who professionally engages with the media as routinely as Halligan would know, the default assumption when a reporter speaks with a public official is that everything is “on the record,” meaning that anything the source says can be printed with attribution. If the source wishes to speak confidentially, she can negotiate how the information will be used. “On background” means that the information the source provides to a journalist can be published, so long as the journalist doesn’t reveal the source’s name or identifying information. “Off the record” means the reporter can’t print what the source tells them at all. There are other variations too. But with any condition, a fundamental premise is that the reporter must <em>agree </em>to speak on that basis.<br></p><p>In the course of my work as a journalist, I frequently agree to speak with sources on background or off the record. I take my duty of confidentiality seriously and I have never burned a source by revealing confidential communications.<br></p><p>I certainly would have been willing to speak with Halligan on background or off the record. But she never raised the terms on which we were speaking at any point during the two days in which we exchanged texts.&nbsp;<br></p><p>After Saturday evening’s message, she went radio silent. By the end of the week, this much was clear: U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan was ghosting me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>***</strong><br></p><p>Even now, I remain mystified by Halligan’s texts to me. She is currently the most scrutinized prosecutor in the country, widely seen as hand-picked to prosecute her boss’s political enemies.&nbsp; Even the slightest misstep could be seized on and picked apart by defense counsel representing James, who <a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/cnc/date/2025-10-14/segment/03" data-sf-ec-immutable="">analysts expect</a> will<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/10/15/letitia-james-indictment-defense-interview-00607888" data-sf-ec-immutable=""> seek dismissal</a> of her charges based on selective or vindictive prosecution.<br></p><p>It’s not as if Halligan didn’t understand the rules of engagement with the press. For years, she worked as a member of Trump’s criminal defense team, which routinely courted media attention, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/politics/trumps-lawyers-jack-smith-justice-department.html" data-sf-ec-immutable="">accusing</a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/us/politics/trumps-lawyers-jack-smith-justice-department.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1760992934198748&amp;usg=AOvVaw3nRuG0WRHhDM_2ia4jaIKA" data-sf-ec-immutable=""> prosecutors</a> of improper leaks. And now, as a prosecutor herself, she has accused former FBI director Comey of lying about whether he authorized a colleague at the bureau to serve as an anonymous source in news reports about an ongoing investigation. A central issue in that case, which Halligan reportedly also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/26/politics/james-comey-indictment-trump-prosecution" data-sf-ec-immutable="">presented to the grand jury herself</a>, concerns the nature of interactions between reporters and federal law enforcement sources.<br></p><p>So the irony was hard to ignore when, just days after she texted me, Halligan <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/lindsey-halligan-ousts-more-prosecutors-eastern-district-virginia" data-sf-ec-immutable="">reportedly fired</a> two senior career prosecutors for supposedly “leaking ‘unauthorized’ information to the press.” That same week, she released a statement in response to <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trumps-doj-punitive-firings-public-scoldings-pressure-prosecute-foes-rcna237622" data-sf-ec-immutable="">an MSNBC story</a> about a separate case against a Democratic state lawmaker. “EDVA enforces a strict zero-tolerance policy on the unauthorized disclosure of information concerning ongoing investigations or cases,” she said. In the same story, Justice Department spokesman Chad Gilmartin is quoted saying: “While we do not confirm the existence of, nor comment on, specific investigations outside of our public filings, any Department employee who leaks deliberative or investigative developments only jeopardizes the integrity of investigations and the incredible work of federal law enforcement.”&nbsp;</p><p>For someone so attuned to the risks of speaking out of turn—and so willing to punish others for allegedly doing so—Halligan’s decision to reach out to me over text remains baffling.<br></p><p>She knew I was a journalist. She approached me. She invited my questions. She even encouraged me to stop chasing other reporters’ stories and focus on my own.<br></p><p>Turns out, she gave me a great one.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Epilogue</em></strong><br></p><p>Earlier today, I reached out to the Justice Department’s Office of Public Affairs, seeking comment for this story. In addition to a transcript of my Signal exchange with Halligan, I also outlined some of my questions related to the story: Were these authorized communications? Is it consistent with DOJ policy or other applicable guidance for senior Justice Department officials to discuss ongoing prosecutions on Signal disappearing messages? Does the Department take the position that the contents of the messages are consistent with its legal obligations and DOJ policy? Does Halligan deny that these were in fact her texts? Does the Justice Department dispute any of the facts reported in the New York Times article discussed in my exchange with Halligan?<br></p><p>I told the Justice Department that my deadline was 4:15 p.m.<br></p><p>In response, the department sent the statement quoted at the outset of this piece. In addition, just a few minutes before the deadline, my dormant Signal connection with Halligan suddenly came alive again.<br></p><p>At 4:10 p.m., she texted me: “By the way—everything I ever sent you is off record. You’re not a journalist so it’s weird saying that but just letting you know.”<br></p><p>I responded: “I’m sorry, but that’s not how this works. You don’t get to say that in retrospect.”<br></p><p>Halligan was unpersuaded: “Yes I do. Off record.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I am really sorry. I would have been happy to speak with you on an off the record basis had you asked,” I said. “But you didn’t ask, and I still haven’t agreed to speak on that basis. Do you have any further comment for the story?&nbsp;</p><p>To my surprise, she kept going: “It’s obvious the whole convo is off record. There’s disappearing messages and it’s on signal. What is your story? You never told me about a story.”<br></p><p>I didn’t respond. It was time to publish my story. I’ll text it to her.<em></em><br></p><p><em>Postscript: Read </em><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190909-signal-screenshots/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""><em>the full exchange between </em></a><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26190909-signal-screenshots/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""><em>Lindsey Halligan and </em>Lawfare’<em>s Anna Bower here</em></a><em>.</em><br></p>

        <h2>Magit Is Amazing!</h2>
        <p>
            I was reading a post about Jujutsu version control system the other day and that just made me realize how awesome is Magit!

    <article>
        <p>I’ve been hearing a lot about <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jujutsu</a>
 VCS lately, and when I say a lot I mean maybe 5 times this year. But that is a lot for a new VCS I would say.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/switch-to-jujutsu-already-a-tutorial/?utm_source=changelog-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>
 I came across mostly goes through the flexibility of Jujutsu VCS over <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git</a>
, or at least that’s as far as I managed to read before I lost interest. I was thinking “<em>you can easily do this using Git???</em>”, but then I realized that I’ve actually never used Git for almost anything besides cloning repositories… I’ve always been using <a href="https://magit.vc/" title="Magit! 🪄" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magit</a>
 for almost everything.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think whether it would have been better if I started using Git CLI and then switched to Magit, that way I would really understand why it’s called that way, rather than taking all the amazing work behind it for granted. But I think afterall I wouldn’t have discovered Git commands so early in my career if I had just used the Git CLI from the start. I remember I was stashing my code changes back in my early career while other coworkers were struggling to move to another branch without losing their changes.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure this isn’t all what Jujutsu is about, but now I really don’t feel like giving it a try anytime soon because of that article.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the grand tradition of tech outages turning everyday life into a farce, Monday's massive Amazon Web Services (AWS) disruption didn't just take down <a href="https://quasa.io/media/instagram-launches-location-sharing-maps-inspired-by-snapchat">Snapchat</a>, <a href="https://quasa.io/media/ryan-kaji-the-13-year-old-multimillionaire-building-a-virtual-empire-in-roblox">Roblox</a>, and <a href="https://quasa.io/media/fortnite-set-to-return-to-iphone-in-australia-as-epic-wins-partial-victory-against-apple-and-google">Fortnite</a> - it left thousands of sleep-deprived users sweating bullets in their own beds. While the world scrambled to reload their feeds, owners of Eight Sleep's high-tech Pod3 mattress covers discovered a chilling reality: their "smart" sleep sanctuaries had no offline mode. Zero. Zilch. In a world where even your fridge can survive a Wi-Fi blackout, who knew your bed couldn't?</p>

<p><img alt="" height="188" src="https://quasa.io/storage/photos/00/photo_2025-10-20_19-32-46.jpg" width="300">The outage, which AWS confirmed stemmed from "increased error rates and latencies" in its US-EAST-1 region, rippled across the internet starting around 3 a.m. ET on October 20, 2025. By mid-morning, Downdetector had logged over eight million reports, with everything from banking apps to gaming platforms grinding to a halt.</p>

<p>But amid the chaos, one corner of the web lit up with uniquely absurd complaints: Eight Sleep's support site and social channels flooded with pleas from users whose mattresses had effectively gone on strike.</p>

<p>These $2,000+ gadgets, billed as AI-powered sleep coaches that track heart rate, monitor sleep stages, and dynamically adjust temperature via water-cooled coils, suddenly reverted to being glorified foam bricks.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="447" src="https://quasa.io/storage/photos/00/image%20-%202025-10-20T194135.824.jpg" width="300">Picture this: You're tucked in, ready for a night of optimized REM cycles, when your app pings an error. No more tweaking the chill to a crisp 55°F or firing up the "cool mode" for those midnight hot flashes.</p>

<p>The core temperature control? Utterly crippled without the cloud. Users reported the app freezing on loading screens, refusing to connect, and leaving them stranded in whatever thermal hell their last setting dictated.</p>

<p>Eight Sleep's system, which relies on backend servers for everything from real-time adjustments to data syncing, had no fallback. "It's unacceptable," fumed one early complainant on X, echoing the frustration of many who shelled out for "seamless" smart sleep only to face analog purgatory.</p>

<p>The hits kept coming. Smart sleep tracking? Dead in the water—no logging of phases, no biometric insights, just a void where your sleep score should be. Preset schedules, like the cheekily named "Prepare Bed for Sleep" routine that cues gentle warming or ambient vibes, fizzled out entirely, as all automations demand an internet lifeline to Eight Sleep's servers.</p>

<p>Even physical controls fared poorly: Touch panels on the Hub (the mattress's brain box) became unresponsive or glitchy, with some users noting they were "extremely inconvenient" at best - designed more as app backups than standalone saviors. And in the outage's cruelest twist, a handful of Pods straight-up froze. One Reddit thread devolved into a chorus of "my bed is bricked," with owners unable to reboot without cloud clearance.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="447" src="https://quasa.io/storage/photos/00/image%20-%202025-10-20T194138.665.jpg" width="300">Then there's the tweet that broke the internet's funny bone - and possibly a few marriages. Tech enthusiast Alex Browne, armed with an Eight Sleep Pod3, had programmed his mattress to preemptively heat up by +9°F above room temperature before bedtime. "I like it warm to ease in," he explained in a viral post that racked up thousands of likes and eye-rolls.</p>

<p>But when AWS went dark, the system locked into that toasty preset, disabling any cooling override. Browne spent the night marinating in his own perspiration, tweeting updates like a man betrayed: "Backend outage means I'm sleeping in a sauna.</p>

<p>Eight Sleep confirmed - no offline mode yet, but they're 'working on it'." Commenters piled on with dystopian jabs: "Next up: Subscription paywalls for your pillow fluffiness" and "Jeff Bezos is personally cranking my thermostat." By evening, as AWS reported "significant recovery," Browne's saga had morphed into a meme goldmine, spotlighting the absurdity of outsourcing your snooze to the cloud.</p>

<p>Eight Sleep isn't alone in this IoT vulnerability - AWS powers a staggering chunk of the smart home ecosystem, from Ring doorbells to Alexa plugs, all of which blinked out during the outage.</p>

<p>But mattresses? That's peak irony. Humans have napped on rocks for millennia without needing server pings, yet here we are, one faulty data center away from nocturnal disaster. The company, which touts over 50 clinical studies on its tech, has faced prior scrutiny too—like a 2024 security report uncovering exposed AWS keys that let engineers remotely SSH into users' beds, raising hackles about data privacy and backdoor access. (Imagine your ex tweaking the vibes from afar.)</p>

</ul>

<p>As the dust settles - with AWS mostly back online by 6 a.m. ET and Eight Sleep restoring controls - this episode serves as a wake-up call (pun intended). Smart tech promises utopia, but without robust offline fallbacks, it's just expensive fragility. For now, if you're an Eight Sleep devotee, keep a fan handy - and maybe a low-tech backup plan. Because in the words of one sweat-soaked survivor: "What won't they cloud-ify next? My dreams?"</p></div></div>]]></description>

</svg><p><span data-astro-cid-dlsoufvo="">I am a programmer.</span>  A coder. A keyboard cowboy. A hacker. My day is spent
punching keys; catalyzing code. It’s fun; it’s my identity. The editor, Vim, is
my workshop, my sanctum<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>. Here, I hone my craft, sharpen my tools, expand my
capabilities through curiosity, and for a while, escape into a trance-like
flow. A full-screen terminal window with nothing between me and thought but
INSERT mode. At the altar of Bram<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>, I spin reality’s yarn out of thin air
into bits beaming through silicon. A completely imagined, non-tangible world
with IRL ramifications. A place in which I find comfort in craft and
creativity. Time disappears into puzzle-solving. Where connecting pieces
matters more than completing a picture. Craft springs from fingers to buffer. I
program and fade away into flow and composition.</p><p>In the late 1950s at MIT, a new and electrifying culture was emerging. Hands-on,
experimental, and anti-establishment. I like to imagine myself there, sitting
at the slate-blue L-shaped console. Typing away at the Flexowriter<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> as it
spits out punched paper tape programs to be fed to the nearby wall of metal
uprights, tangled wire, and early transistors; the “Tixo”<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup>. Waiting with
bated breath, as enthralling beeps emanate from the machinery while it runs the
program: will it succeed? I imagine the Hackers—as they came to be known—around
me, pointing at code and offering advice on how to achieve “The Right
Thing”<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup>: the perfect program, pristine, elegant, and succinct. I can sense
the original culture of programming pouring out of them as they passionately
embody <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">“The Hacker Ethic”</a> while
sharing stubs of their own paper programs to guide me on my quest.</p><p>It was there—in the computing crucible of building 26—that the craft of coding
was cast. Nearly 70 years ago, members of the Tech Model Railroad Club immersed
themselves in the language of machines to pursue a mastery of digital wizardry.
The sublime magic of manipulating formal languages to solve increasingly
challenging cryptic conundrums and—core to the culture—sharing findings with
other students of the dark arts of software sorcery.</p><p>The ghosts of ancient Hackers past still roam the machines and—through the
culture they established—our minds. Their legacy of the forging of craft
lingers. A deep and kinetic craft we’ve extended and built a passionate
industry on. We are driven by the same wonder, sense of achievement, and
elegance of puzzle-solving as they were. Still driven by “The Right Thing.”
These constitutional ideas, the very identity of programmers, are increasingly
imperiled. Under threat. The future of programming, once so bright and
apparent, is now cloaked in foreboding darkness, grifts, and uncertainty.</p><hr><p>In fact, if we are to trust the billion-dollar AI industry, the denizens of
Hacker News (and its overlords), and the LinkedIn legions of LLM lunatics, the
future of software development has little resemblance to programming.
Vibe-coding—what seemed like a meme a year ago—is becoming a mainstay.</p><p>Presently (though this changes constantly), the court of vibe fanatics would
have us write specifications in Markdown instead of code. Gone is the deep
engagement and the depth of craft we are so fluent in: time spent in the
corners of codebases, solving puzzles, and uncovering well-kept secrets.
Instead, we are to embrace scattered cognition and context switching between a
swarm of Agents that are doing our thinking for us. Creative puzzle-solving is
left to the machines, and we become mere operators disassociated from our
craft.</p><hr><p>Some—more than I imagined—seem to welcome this change, this new identity:
“Specification Engineering.” Excited to be an operator and cosplaying as Steve
Jobs to “Play the Orchestra”. One could only wonder why they became a
programmer in the first place, given their seeming disinterest in coding. Did
they confuse Woz with Jobs?</p><p>I can’t imagine (though perhaps I’m not very imaginative) that Prompt, Context,
or Specification “Engineering”<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-6" id="user-content-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup> would lead to a bright and prosperous
profession for programmers. It reeks of a devaluation of craft, skill, and
labor. A new identity where our unique set of abstract thinking skills isn’t
really required; moving us into a realm already occupied by product managers
and designers.</p><p>Inside companies, power dynamics are shifting as this new identity is pushed.
In a mad dash to increase productivity in the wrong place<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-7" id="user-content-fnref-7" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup>, developers are
forced to use LLMs in increasingly specific ways. Conform or be cast out. Use
the products that herald our obsolescence, or resign. Scarcely has management
mandated such specifics of our tools before. Tools, like those of a chef or
carpenter, that we’ve taken great pride in curating and honing ourselves:
careful configuration of our editor, tinkering with dot files, and dev
environments. As part of the craft, we’ve been dedicated and devoted to
personalizing our toolsets to match our thinking. It feels like a violation to
have this be decreed by management, who have little to no connection to the
day-to-day, and who should instead be concerned with outcomes, process, and
facilitating creativity. For decades, programmers have been pampered within
companies. These narratives offer a new way for management to tip the balance
back in their favor.</p><hr><p>Some—with glee and anticipation—liken LLMs and their impact to the transition
from low-level to high-level languages: from Assembly to Fortran. This, I
think, is wrong in a couple of ways: firstly, because the leap we made with
Fortran was rooted in programming, Fortran didn’t try to eliminate a craft but
built on top of it. Fortran didn’t remove the precision and expressibility of
programmatic formalisms, but expanded them. Secondly, Fortran was always
successful in producing the right outcome given its input. None of these things
is true in the world of LLMs. I can practically hear the cultists cry out:
“You’re just using it wrong” as they move the goalposts to fit an ever-changing
narrative. But we can’t expect AI tools to have the same outcomes as
programming languages. They are designed based on a different set of rules and
parameters.</p><p>There aren’t enough swear words in the English language to adequately describe
how frustrating computers and programming can be, but we have at least always
been able to count on them for precision: to perform exactly as instructed
through programming. It is perhaps because of our reliance and trust in the
precision of computers that we seem so primed to believe chatbots when they
gaslight us into thinking they did what we asked of them<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-8" id="user-content-fnref-8" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">8</a></sup>.</p><p>LLMs and the work with them are naturally imprecise. Both in the properties of
Large Language Models, and in the very manner we instruct them:
misinterpretable natural languages. Curious that we chose this approach to
computing, given how much we, programmers, cringe at non-determinism. We prefer
predictability, compositionality, idempotence, and integration tests that
aren’t flaky. LLM code represents the opposite of that: inconsistent chaos.</p><p>Dijkstra, in <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html">“On the foolishness of ‘natural language
programming’,”</a>
wrote, rather poignantly: “We have to challenge the assumptions that natural
languages would simplify work.” And: “The virtue of formal texts is that their
manipulation, in order to be legitimate, need to satisfy only a few simple
rules; they are, when you come to think of it, an amazingly effective tool for
ruling out all sorts of nonsense that, when we use our native tongues, are
almost impossible to avoid.”</p><hr><p>There’s a movement to distance AI-assisted development (Agents in the driver’s
seat) from vibe-coding by imposing rigor and bureaucracy, but it ignores the
fundamental nature of the beast. I find that I don’t read the code an LLM
generates for me as closely as I would if I had written it myself or had
reviewed it in a PR. There seems to be something innate to LLM coding that
makes my eyes glaze over. I gloss. Overwhelmed and bored. Blindly accepting
spiked pitfalls, provided CI passes and the program compiles. Not checking if
the tests are even set up to run, or if it pulled in a nonexistent library or
implemented a whole one itself. Of course, I pay the price later, when I fall
into my own trap and realize that hours of work were built on a broken bedrock.
Or maybe I don’t notice till someone calls me out in a pull request, a bug
report, or when I’m paged for an incident.</p><p>A review or synopsis of a book can never replace the experience of reading it
yourself: contemplating ideas for hours and 100s of pages as each sentence is
carefully consumed. In the same way, skimming summaries of completed AI tasks
robs us of forming a deep understanding of the domain, the problem, and the
possible solutions; it robs us of being connected to the codebase. Taking the
plunge into the abyss of one’s ignorance to reveal, learn, and understand a
topic and its implications is both gratifying and crucial to good software.
Ownership, agency, and deep, fulfilling work have been replaced with scattered
attention spent between tabs of Agents.</p><p>Joan Didion, the great American essayist, famously wrote: <a href="https://lithub.com/joan-didion-why-i-write/">“I write entirely to
find out what I’m thinking, what I’m looking at, what I see and what it
means.”</a> Peter Naur explores this
same concept in his work, <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf">“Programming as Theory
Building.”</a> Naur’s “Theory” embodies
the understanding of a codebase. How it operates, its formalisms, and its
representations of the real world. A context and insight that is only gained
from immersion. Naur describes the “Theory” as the primary outcome of
programming, the actual product, as opposed to the software it resulted in.
Only with a well-developed “Theory” can one effectively apply extensions and
bug fixes to codebases. With the ambivalent glances at code that comes with
vibing, building such a theory is difficult. Naur would deem it impossible, I’m
sure.</p><p>Good design emerges from immersion. From steeping. From back-and-forth work in
the text buffer and, often, away from the keyboard. It’s impossible to hold a
whole codebase in our minds. We must dive into modules, classes, and functions
to sharpen our blurry mental models. Read and write code to <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119124">extend our
cognition</a>, regain familiarity,
and understanding of the problem domain.</p><p>Once a semblance of context has been conjured, and through a plentitude of poor
attempts, we can finally uncover the solution. The dissonance of bad design
must be felt: it’s only when we write repulsive and repetitive code that we
realize that there is a better, more succinct, elegant, compositional, and
reusable way. It causes pause. A step back to think about the problem deeply.
Start over. Rinse repeat. Diametrically, AI Agent work is frictionless; we
avoid alternative solutions and can’t know if what we accept is flawless,
mediocre, terrible, or even harmful. Quality is crafted by iteration—how else
might we imagine good designs if we never explore objectionable ones?</p><hr><p>The cognitive debt of LLM-laden coding extends beyond disengagement of our
craft. We’ve all heard the stories. Hyped up, vibed up, slop-jockeys with
attention spans shorter than the framework-hopping JavaScript devs of the early
2010s, sling their sludge in pull requests and design docs, discouraging
collaboration and disrupting teams. Code reviewing coworkers are rapidly losing
their minds as they come to the crushing realization that they are now the
first layer of quality control instead of one of the last. Asked to review;
forced to pick apart. Calling out freshly added functions that are never
called, hallucinated library additions, and obvious runtime or compilation
errors. All while the author—who clearly only skimmed their “own” code—is
taking no responsibility, going “whoopsie, Claude wrote that. Silly AI, ha-ha.”</p><p>Meddling managers and penny-pinching execs are pushing (hopefully unknowingly)
for fewer human interactions on teams. Isolated and bereft of connection, we
are now empowered and encouraged to build walls around our work experience.
Reaching for LLMs rather than people when we need a pair programmer, someone to
ping pong solutions with, prototype, sketch architectures with, or help answer
expert questions about esoteric parts of the codebase. We no longer require
onboarding buddies, mentors, or peers; instead, we can talk to machines. With
LLMs, avoiding human contact is so easy that it might just become the norm. The
future really <em>is</em> bright…</p><hr><p>It’s disturbing how agreeable we are to the AI hype narrative and actively
participate in the planned erasure of our craft<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-9" id="user-content-fnref-9" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">9</a></sup>, and so willingly offer up
our means of thinking. We were the lucky ones who got to earn a living from our
hobbies. Even if we produce punctilious and rigid processes to counter slop—as
some support with a striking similarity to the waterfall model of yore—we’ve
still outsourced the fun part of the job and replaced it with directorial
drudgery. What’s next, TPS reports?</p><p>LLMs seem like a nuke-it-from-orbit solution to the complexities of software.
Rather than addressing the actual problems, we reached for something far more
complex and nebulous to cure the symptoms. I don’t really mind replacing <code>sed</code>
with Claude or asking it for answers about a library or framework that, after
hours of hunting through docs, I still seek clarity on<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-10" id="user-content-fnref-10" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">10</a></sup>. But I profoundly
do not want to be merely an operator or code reviewer: taking a backseat to the
fun and interesting work. I want to drive, immerse myself in craft, play <em>in</em>
the orchestra, and solve complex puzzles. I want to remain a programmer, a
craftsperson.</p><p>I prefer my tools to help me with repetitive tasks (and there are many of those
in programming), understanding codebases, and authoring correct programs. I
take offense at products that are designed to think for me. To remove the
agency of my own understanding of the software I produce, and to cut
connections with my coworkers. Even if LLMs lived up to the hype, we would
still stand to lose all of that and our craft. Humans matter more than machines
and their backing corporations, who are profiting while the rest of us chase
the new American Dream they sell. As payment, we offer our critical thinking
skills, our fun, our craft, our privacy, and perhaps, our planet.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                <p>
Text adventures are weird. They are so weird I don’t know how to write this
article, so prepare to read something even more rambly than usual. Normally,
when this happens, I decide not to publish the article. But
</p>

<ol>
<li>I really want to share my enthusiasm for text adventures, and</li>

<li>I needed something to link to when I wrote that article on <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/lessons-from-creating-first-text-adventure.html">what I learned
from creating my text adventure</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Let’s go!
</p>
<section id="outline-container-text-adventures-have-awesome-properties">
<h2 id="text-adventures-have-awesome-properties">Text adventures have awesome properties</h2>
<p>
Here’s a list of cool properties of text adventures.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-freedom">
<h2 id="freedom">Freedom</h2>
<div id="text-orgd362409">
<p>
Text adventures give the player a lot of freedom.
</p>

<p>
In graphical games, the player character can act in at best a handful of
significantly different ways in any given situation<label for="fn.1">1</label><span><sup>1</sup> Not counting small
variations. Using different types of attack is still attacking, for example.
Entering into dialogue is still one action, however deep the dialogue is.</span>. In a
text adventure, the player character typically has ten or twenty meaningfully
different ways to act in any given situation.
</p>

<p>
This freedom is liberating: even though the player cannot literally do anything
they want, a well-designed text adventure really makes it seem as though they
could, by having programmed generic interactions between actions and objects.
This freedom can also be used to good effect to give the user alternatives for
solving puzzles.<label for="fn.2">2</label><span><sup>2</sup> Such as when, faced with a foosball table, one solution can
be to <code>TAKE BALL. PUT BALL IN GOAL</code>.</span>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-non-graphical-and-non-literal-experiences">
<h2 id="non-graphical-and-non-literal-experiences">Non-graphical and non-literal experiences</h2>
<div id="text-org3e383cd">
<p>
By being non-graphical, text adventures have the benefit of conveying things
without having to represent them literally. In a graphical game, if we wish to
represent a large city, we must model a literal large city, with thousands of
buildings. In a text adventure, we can instead describe the city such that it
feels large, whicle modelling only very few buildings.
</p>

<p>
Another example of the ingraphicality of the medium is that text adventures can
represent non-visual effects; we can model other senses than vision, like smell
and touch.
</p>

<p>
With text, we can also present an abstract space much easier than with graphics,
which tend to the literal.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-cheaper-dynamic-environments">
<h2 id="cheaper-dynamic-environments">Cheaper dynamic environments</h2>
<p>
Text adventures can more easily support dynamic environments. In a graphical
game, dynamic environments require complicated physics and animations. This – in
addition to the effort of graphical and sound design – makes graphical games
more expensive to create than text adventures. Many of the greatest text
adventures of all time were developed as pet projects by single developers in
their spare time.<label for="fn.3">3</label><span><sup>3</sup> From what I understand, text adventures are even used to
prototype narratives and mechanics in some big game studios.</span>
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-mature-technology">
<h2 id="mature-technology">Mature technology</h2>
<div id="text-org8924178">
<p>
If all of the above is not intriguing enough, let’s also mention that text
adventures are a mature technology. They were some of the first computer games
ever created. It’s difficult to find a computer that cannot run text adventures.
</p>

<p>
Great! But what … are they?

<p>
I have played a few text adventures the past months, and here’s a brief excerpt
from one<label for="fn.4">4</label><span><sup>4</sup> <i>The Dreamhold</i>; Andrew Plotkin; self-published; 2004. <a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Fifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2Fdreamhold.z8">Playable
online.</a></span>. This transcript begins when we have exited the starting area, and just
begun to explore what lies beyond.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
CURVING HALL, WEST END
</p>

<p>
The curving corridor ends here, in a blank plaster wall relieved by a single
window. The window looks out on a strange subterranean prospect to the west. You
can return east, pass through the archway to the north, or try the closed door
to the south.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; look at window</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A broad glass pane looks out over a dark cavern. This end of the corridor seems
to be deep underground. A natural cave spreads out below; its mammoth columns
and cascades of flowstone are only dimly picked out by the candlelight behind
you. The farther reaches are hidden in darkness. But the shining waterfall
before you is easily visible. A stream pours in from your right, tumbles from a
ledge, and plummets into a pit beneath the window. The water seems to sparkle
with some natural phosphorescence.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; break window</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The glass ignores your assault.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; enter archway</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
ARBORETUM
</p>

<p>
The walls here are painted white and are utterly undecorated. An archway leads
south. In the center of the room stands an earthenware tub. From it sprouts a
tangle of vines, broad fan-like leaves, and an enormous golden flower. The
luxuriant growth clashes, you think, with the room’s stark emptiness.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; look at flower</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The plant sits alone in its pot, in the center of the empty room. The golden
flower is nearly the size of your head. It rises from a tangle of vines and
leaves that would better suit an unexplored south-coast swamp than someone’s
home.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; take flower</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The plant’s stems look too thick to break.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; smell flower</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You lean forward and take a deep breath of the
flower’s aroma.
</p>

<p>
Memory nearly bursts through.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This moves us to
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
DANK JUNGLE (IN THE EARTHENWARE TUB)
</p>

<p>
You are standing waist-deep in an empty earthenware tub, in the midst of a
trackless jungle.
</p>

<p>
Heavy, entangled trunks and vines loom in every direction, as far as you can see
– and you can’t see far. The sky is entirely obscured by layers of vegetation.
Only a murky green light filters down to you. But golden flowers dot the trees,
like bursts of sun.
</p>

<p>
An iron key is balanced neatly on the edge of the tub.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; take key</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Taken.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; get out of tub</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You swing your legs out of the tub, and find the world swinging around you…
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This moves us to
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
ARBORETUM
</p>

<p>
The walls of the room are painted in green slashes, like the trunks of uncounted
trees, and splashed with gold. An archway leads south. A hint of sweet-rank
perfume touches you as you breathe.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>&gt; inventory</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You are carrying an iron key.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
We explored a space in a building set into a cave, and smelling the flower got
us transported … into a memory? Or literally miniaturised and into the tub? We
were able to bring the iron key, after all. Did we even emerge into the same
room, given that the description changed? It’s not made clear, and this
ambiguity is okay in text – each reader will get to play their own preferred
version of the game.
</p>

<p>
Of course, this is a game by an author that is known for abstract mechanics.
There are also games that are far more traditional in their mechanics. When I
stop playing <i>Plundered Hearts</i><label for="fn.5">5</label><span><sup>5</sup> <i>Plundered Hearts</i>; Infocom; Infocom; 1987.
<a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Feblong.com%2Finfocom%2Fgamefiles%2Fplunderedhearts-r26-s870730.z3">Playable online</a>.</span> I can almost hear the chirping of the jungle and the lapping
of the waves against the island where I’m stalking around a large house trying
to figure out how to get into the ongoing ball.
</p>

<p>
It shouldn’t come as a surprise. Novels – and spoken stories – have transported
readers to fantastical locations for ages. But I still didn’t know text
adventures could be so immersive.
</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="outline-container-interaction-in-text-adventures">
<h2 id="interaction-in-text-adventures">Interaction in text adventures</h2>
<div id="text-org285bcf1">
<p>
The bright reader has already figured out how interaction works in text
adventures: the game prints a brief paragraph of text describing the players’
immediate environment or the result of their last action, followed by a prompt
sign, after which the player types in what they want to do next.<label for="fn.6">6</label><span><sup>6</sup> There are
technical differences here between <i>narrator</i>, <i>player character</i>, and <i>player</i>
but we’ll brush past that for the moment.</span>
</p>

<p>
The instructions the player types into the prompt look like English, but they
follow a fairly strict format used in almost all text adventures by convention.
These are recognised by a component of the game called the <i>parser</i>. Despite the
strict format, some of the joy of playing these text adventures is trying
something crazy, like in <i>Plundered Hearts</i> when we stand on the balcony above
the ballroom, see the rope on which the chandelier is attached, type <code>SWING ON
ROPE</code> … and the player character comes crashing down onto the dancing guests
with a big “Aiieeee!” It’s outside the conventional commands, but it makes sense
and the author catered for it.
</p>

<p>
Text adventures typically take a simulationist approach to narration. This means
the author has not specified what happens in any given situation. Instead, what
happens next is determined mechanistically by the player’s actions given the
current world state. Maybe we need to cross a violent river, but it’s up to us
if we want to block it, re-route it, magically freeze it, or jetpack over it.
The progress is gated on being able to cross, not how that ability is achieved.
</p>

<p>
The violent river is an example of a <i>puzzle</i>, which are usually strewn
throughout text adventures. These puzzles are used to pace the narrative, and
avoid dumping everything on the player at once. Obstacles get placed in the way
of progress, and the player needs to find ways around them to experience more of
the story.
</p>

<p>
The puzzle-pacing of text adventures means they can often contain a lot more
detail and flavour text than a corresponding novel, because the player slowly
uncovers the text they are most interested in, and are free to ignore the
rest.<label for="fn.7">7</label><span><sup>7</sup> Well, any information needed to solve puzzles cannot be ignored, of
course. Old school games tended to hide such information in the most innocuous
places, requiring careful searching of every nook and cranny to proceed. Modern
games, by contrast, tend to be more forgiving and hint more actively at which
locations are important to search.</span>

<h2 id="puzzle-types-in-text-adventures">Puzzle types in text adventures</h2>
<div id="text-org66a4f32">
<p>
At some point I would like to do a formal comparison of text adventure puzzles
by way of grounded theory<label for="fn.8">8</label><span><sup>8</sup> That is the only hammer I have for extracting
structure and meaning from unstructured accounts.</span>. That is out of scope of this
article, so we’ll look at one sloppy categorisation of interest:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Lock-and-key: we must possess a specific item to get past an obstacle. We find
the item by observing the environment carefully.</li>
<li>Lock-and-password: we must perform a specific action to get past an obstacle.
We learn about the action by observing the environment. Tougher puzzles
require astuter observation, sometimes even catching on to background
patterns.</li>
<li>Change-the-self: we must alter our appearance to get past an obstacle. This
can be considered a combination of key- and password-based puzzles: we must
find the item that masks our appearance, and then be perceptive enough to know
when to wear it.</li>
<li>Change-an-item: converting one item to another is fairly common, either by
performing the right action on it or by combining it with the right other items.</li>
<li>Change-the-environment: we must rearrange the environment in a way that makes
actions possible that were previously unthinkable, unreasonable, or nonsensical.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are some puzzle types that might not fit into the above categories.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Waiting-based puzzles: where just quietly waiting for one or more turns makes
something happen.</li>
<li>Persistance-based puzzles: where doing something once has an effect that is
not quite useful, but doing it many times has an effect that is very useful.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Either of these could be considered lock-and-password puzzles, only with the
password being to repeat an action.
</p>

<p>
We could also categorise puzzles into what sort of simulation they are based on,
e.g. whether they simulate human senses<label for="fn.9">9</label><span><sup>9</sup> Requiring observing the environment
in particular ways, or manipulating the senses of others such as shouting to
wake someone up.</span>, or physical systems<label for="fn.10">10</label><span><sup>10</sup> Getting items to increase leverage,
throwing things at other things to dislodge them, getting something large to
block a view, etc.</span>, or machines<label for="fn.11">11</label><span><sup>11</sup> Figuring out how to run a bread dispensing
machine, or how an orrery evolves to bring an item closer to the ground.</span>, or
magic systems<label for="fn.12">12</label><span><sup>12</sup> These simulations need to be internally consistent, but they
may not correspond to any natural laws we know from our world.</span>, or the desires
of other people<label for="fn.13">13</label><span><sup>13</sup> Giving people things, showing them things, feeding animals,
etc.</span>.
</p>

<div id="text-orgb3a1b39">
<p>
Text adventures are generally free<label for="fn.14">14</label><span><sup>14</sup> In the sense of gratis, but also
sometimes libre.</span>. They spawned out of the culture of free sharing at <abbr>mit</abbr> and
other universities, and they are passion projects to date. Most games are
released in competitions, and all big competitions have rules that stipulate
playing the game must be free. There are good reasons to try playing them, and
few reasons not to.
</p>

<p>
At this point, you know more about text adventures than I did when I started
out. Here are some games I have played and which I think aren’t terrible for a
beginner:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Fifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fcompetition97%2Ftads%2Fglow%2Fglow.gam">Glowgrass (1997)</a>: You crash land in an overgrown Ancient settlement, and the
eerie starts to take on a familiar face as you end up learning more about what
has happened.</li>

<li><a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Fifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2FViolet.zblorb">Violet (2008)</a>: If you can successfully type the command <code>WRITE</code> you win the
game. But boy are there many distractions when a distractable person just
needs to write.</li>

<li><a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Fifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2Fdreamhold.z8">The Dreamhold (2004)</a>: You wake up in a wizard’s Dreamhold with no memory. As
you explore, some things come back to you. Eventually you gather all masks and
you figure out what you need to do to finish what you started.</li>

<li><a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Feblong.com%2Finfocom%2Fgamefiles%2Fplunderedhearts-r26-s870730.z3">Plundered Hearts (1987)</a>: You are a woman stuck between men who have violent
business to finish with each other. Somehow you end up rescuing your pirate
hero multiple times.</li>

<li><a href="https://iplayif.com/?story=https%3A%2F%2Fifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2FLostPig.zblorb">Lost Pig (2007)</a>: You are an orc and you lost your pig. Now you must find it.
You’ll make a friend along the way. This game has fairly difficult puzzles,
but it is incredibly responsive; even silly actions (<code>BURN TAPESTRY</code>) have
effects programmed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are all games that are either <i>merciful</i> or <i>polite</i> on the <a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/essays/cruelty-revisited.html">Zarfian
cruelty scale</a>, meaning you might be able to die, but the game will not let you
continue to play after failure has become certain.<label for="fn.15">15</label><span><sup>15</sup> In contrast, games that
are <i>cruel</i> will happily let you put the game into an unwinnable state with no
way to tell that that has even happened.</span> Create a savegame after every time
you’ve made progress (with the <code>SAVE</code> command) and you’ll never lose much
progress.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/play-if-card.pdf">Zarf’s <abbr>if</abbr> cheat sheet</a> contains some useful commands that tend to work in many
games. It’s fine to not be able to solve a puzzle. Sometimes they are hard. Make
sure you have examined <i>everything</i> carefully for hints. If you still cannot
progress, see if you can play with a friend. If you have no friends, look up
hints or a walkthrough.<label for="fn.16">16</label><span><sup>16</sup> My personal rule is that if I have come up with a
solution that <i>ought</i> to have worked, but wasn’t programmed with the appropriate
response, I allow myself to cheat and look at the solution in a walkthrough.
Often the solution is the same as I had thought of, only it expected a variation
on the wording I used. E.g. <code>WAVE MIRROR IN MOONLIGHT</code> might not work, but <code>PUT
MIRROR IN MOONBEAM</code> does.</span>
</p>

<p>
Give it a fair shot. It takes a few games until one is familiar enough with the
conventions to navigate the game smoothly, but it’s worth it, I think. Opens up
a whole world.

<h2 id="appendix-a--text-adventure-vs--interactive-fiction">Appendix A: Text adventure vs. interactive fiction</h2>
<div id="text-org618619f">
<p>
A brief note on terminology is in place. I call these games <i>text adventures</i>,
but a lot of people these days prefer the term <i>interactive fiction</i>. Here’s how
that happened.
</p>

<p>
In the mid-1970s, a couple of avid cavers programmed a text-based virtual cave
exploration simulator on a large mainframe computer. They named the simulator
<i>Colossal Cave Adventure</i>, and it got colloquially known as <i>Adventure</i>. This
was the first game of its kind, and it spawned an entirely new genre. Much like
the game <i>Rogue</i> spawned the genre of roguelikes, the game <i>Adventure</i> spawned
the genre of <i>text adventures</i>.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes these game-defined genres change names. First person shooters used
to be known as <i>Doom clones</i>, but as they branched away from the formula of the
original <i>Doom</i>, they needed a more generic name. This has happened also with
text adventures. These types of games soon branched out to include less
adventurous mechanics, and a new name was needed. One big developer in
particular, Infocom, went with <i>interactive fiction</i>, in part to try to sell the games to
a broader market of readers. That name stuck around as the more inclusive
term.<label for="fn.17">17</label><span><sup>17</sup> Some interactive fiction games aren’t even parser-based, but
choice-based: instead of asking the player to type in what they want to do, they
stop at story beats and give the player a list of alternatives for how to
proceed.</span>
</p>

<p>
There are three reasons I still speak of text adventures:
</p>

<ol>
<li>I have not yet branched out to these other games. The games I’ve played (and
started to make) are still fairly firmly planted in the simulationist,
puzzle-paced <i>Adventure</i> tradition. If I specifically played the games that
came out just after Doom and mimicked it closely, I would similarly say I
play <i>Doom clones</i>, not first person shooters.</li>

<li>I dislike the term <i>interactive fiction</i> because it’s provably too long. Just
as with “first person shooter”, which is universally abbreviated <abbr>fps</abbr>,
nobody bothers saying or writing “interactive fiction”. They abbreviate it to
<abbr>if</abbr> instead. And <i>that</i> is such an overloaded combination of characters that
it becomes impossible to perform a web search for. I don’t like that.</li>

<li>A minor reason is that if I wanted a good work of fiction, I’d pick up a
book. I play text adventures for the interactivity in a simulated world, and
there I want good game mechanics before a good narrative. Calling it interactive
fiction puts the emphasis on the narrative over the game, which is not what I’m
looking for.</li>
</ol>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>A step-by-step guide to building a key-value database from scratch.</p></header><p>If you were to build your own database today, not knowing that databases exist already, how would you do it? In this post, we'll explore how to build a <strong>key-value database</strong> from the ground up.</p>
<p>A key-value database works more or less like objects in JavaScript—you can store values using a key and retrieve them later using that same key:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>$</span><span> </span><span>db</span><span> </span><span>set</span><span> </span><span>'hello'</span><span> </span><span>'world'</span></p><p><span>$</span><span> </span><span>db</span><span> </span><span>get</span><span> </span><span>'hello'</span></p><p><span>world</span></p></pre></div>
<p>Let's find out how they work!</p>
<hr>
<div><h2>The Humble File</h2><p>Databases were made to solve one problem:</p><div><header><h4>Problem</h4></header><p>How do we store data <strong>persistently</strong> and then <strong>efficiently</strong> look it up later?</p></div><p>The typical way to store any kind of data persistently in a computer is to use a <span> <em>file</em> </span>. When we want to store data, we add the key-value pair to the file:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li></ol></div><p>When we want to look for a specific key, we iterate through the pairs to see if there's a matching key:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li></ol></div><p>For updates, we'll find the key and replace the value in-place:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li></ol></div><p>And for deletes, we'll delete the record from the file:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li></ol></div><p>Easy! We're done right?</p></div>
<hr>
<h3>Mutable Updates</h3>
<p>This approach, simple as it is, doesn't actually work very well in practice. The problem lies with the way we're doing updates and deletes—they're wholly inefficient.</p>
<p>To a computer, our file looks something like this—nothing more than a long sequence of bytes:</p>
<div><p>001:Lorem␣ipsum\n018:dolor␣sit\n005:adipiscing␣elit.\n014:Vestibulum␣varius\n002:vel␣mauris\n007:consectetur␣adipiscing␣elit.\n010:Vestibulum␣varius\n016:vel␣mauris\n003:consectetur␣adipiscing␣elit.</p></div>
<p>When we go to update or delete a record, we're currently updating that record in-place, which means we potentially have to <em>move</em> all of the data that comes after that record:</p>
<div><p><span>001:Lorem␣ipsum\n018:dolor␣sit\n<span>005:adipiscing␣elit.<span><span>␣vel␣mauris</span></span></span><span>\n014:Vestibulum␣varius\n002:vel␣mauris\n007:consectetur␣adipiscing␣elit.\n010:Vestibulum␣varius\n016:vel␣mauris\n003:consectetur␣adipiscing␣elit.</span></span></p></div>
<p>In this case, updating the record <code>005</code> to "<code>adipiscing␣elit.␣vel␣mauris</code>" means moving all of the records that come after it by 11 bytes (the length of the added string "<code>␣vel␣mauris</code>"). This can quickly get really costly, especially as our database grows in size!</p>
<hr>
<div><h3>Append-Only Files</h3><p>One way to work around the update problem is to <strong>make records immutable</strong>. In other words, we add the constraint that we can only <em>add</em> new records to the end of the file and never update or delete existing ones.</p><p>With this approach, updates are treated the same as inserts—just add a new record to the end of the file:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li></ol></div><p>But now we have another problem—there are duplicate keys in the file!</p><p>To work around this, we have to change our search algorithm to look for the <em>last</em> occurrence of the key instead of the first:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li></ol></div><p>To delete records, we create a special "tombstone" record that marks the key as deleted. There's no single way to do this, but one way is to use a special value like <code>null</code>:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li></ol></div><p>And there we have it! We have a key-value database that uses a file as its storage mechanism. Using it, we can store, find, update, and delete key-value pairs.</p></div>
<hr>
<p>Now this implementation isn't perfect; right now, there are two major issues:</p>
<ol><li><p><strong>The file can get very large</strong>. Since we're only appending to the file, the file will grow infinitely over time. Not good!</p></li><li><p><strong>Searching is slow</strong>. To search for a specific key, we have to potentially iterate through all records in the database. For a database with millions of records, this can take a while!</p></li></ol>
<p>How can we fix these problems?</p>
<hr>
<div><h2>Keeping Files Small</h2><div><header><h4>Problem</h4></header><p><strong>How do we make sure the file doesn't grow indefinitely?</strong> Because we're using an append-only file, we need some mechanism to periodically "shrink" the file so it doesn't eventually take over our entire hard drive.</p></div><p>Take a look at our database here after a few updates and deletes:</p><div><ol><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 1 "Lorem ipsum"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 18 "dolor sit"</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 7 "adipiscing elit."</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>delete</span><span> 7</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>set</span><span> 10 "consectetur adipiscing elit."</span></li><li><span>$ <!-- -->db<!-- --> </span><span>delete</span><span> 1</span></li></ol></div><p>Our database file has six entries, but only two represent actual records—the rest are either deleted or contain stale data. If we can clear all the irrelevant data, we can shrink the file by over 66%!</p></div>
<hr>
<h3>Segments and Compaction</h3>
<div><p>Here's an idea: once a file exceeds a certain size, we'll <span> <em>close</em> </span> the file and create a new one. While the new file ingests new data (in the same way we've been doing so far), we'll <em>compact</em> the old file by deleting all of its irrelevant data.</p><p>Meaning, we stop adding new data to the file.</p></div>
<p>Here, we've set the maximum file size to seven records. Notice that the database is full—try clicking on "Add" to add a new record and notice what happens:</p>

<p>Now, our database consists of two different files which we'll call <strong>segments</strong>. Each segment will usually become a lot smaller after compaction, which means we can merge them together as part of the compaction process.</p>
<p>With that, we've made a mechanism to stop our database from growing indefinitely!</p>
<hr>
<h2>Your First Index</h2>
<p>Our next problem is on search performance:</p>
<div><header><h4>Problem</h4></header><p><strong>How do we make searching fast?</strong> Right now, we have to iterate through all of the records in the database to find a specific key. This is super slow!</p></div>
<p>What if we use <em>objects</em>? That's right, these little guys:</p>

<p>JavaScript objects, otherwise known as <em>hash tables</em> or <em>dictionaries</em>, are really efficient at storing and looking up key-value pairs:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>hashTable</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span></p><p><span>  hello: </span><span>"world"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>  foo: </span><span>"bar"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>  baz: </span><span>"qux"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>};</span></p><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>value</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> hashTable[</span><span>"hello"</span><span>]; </span><span>// "world"</span></p></pre></div>
<p>It doesn't matter how many records there are—the time it takes to look up and retrieve a value in a hash table is more or less constant. The catch is they must live <em>in memory</em>.</p>
<hr>
<details><summary><p><h3>Aside: <!-- -->In-Memory vs. On-Disk</h3></p></summary><div><p>When you write a variable in your code, the computer will "remember" the value of that variable only for as long as the program is running.</p><p>This program will always print <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> because the value of <code>x</code> "resets" every time we run the program. This is because <code>x</code> is stored <span> <em>in-memory</em> </span>, and any value stored in memory is discarded when the program stops.</p><p>If we want our data to "stick" between runs, we'll need to store it <span><em>on-disk</em></span>—in other words, a file.</p><p>This time, <code>x</code> will print <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> the first run, and <code>4</code> and <code>5</code> the second run.</p><p>The tradeoff to persistence is performance—accessing data from memory is about 80x faster on average than accessing it from disk.</p></div></details>
<hr>
<p>Here's how the index will work. For every record that we have in our database, we'll store that record's <strong>offset</strong>—the number of bytes from the beginning of the file to the start of the record—in the index:</p>
<div><p>file.txt</p><div><p>1:Lorem␣ipsum\n</p><div><p><span>Waiting<span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></p><p data-name="next-record" data-file="true"><span>1<!-- -->:<!-- -->Lorem␣ipsum<!-- -->\n</span></p></div></div></div>
<p>The second record, <code>18: dolor sit</code>, for example, has an offset of 15 because:</p>
<ol><li><p>Each character is 1 byte large;</p></li><li><p>The first record is 13 characters long (<code>1:Lorem ipsum</code>);</p></li><li><p>The first record ends with a newline character, which is (at most) 2 bytes long;</p></li></ol>
<p>This gives us an offset of <code>13 + 2 = 15</code>.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that we need an index for each segment because the offset is relative to the start of the file—in other words, the start of each segment.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Searching With Indices</h3>
<p>Using an index, our search algorithm can now run a lot more efficiently:</p>
<ol><li><p>Starting at the most recent segment, look up the key in the index;</p></li><li><p>If the key is found, read the record at the offset;</p></li><li><p>If the key is not found, move on to the next segment;</p></li><li><p>Repeat (2) and (3) until the key is found or all segments have been searched.</p></li></ol>

<hr>
<h3>Updating Indices</h3>
<p>An index is only useful if it's in sync with our data. Whenever we update, delete, or insert a record, we have to change the index accordingly:</p>

<p>Notice what this implies—<strong>writing to the database is slower with an index!</strong> This is one of the tradeoffs of using an index; we can search for data much faster at the cost of slower writes.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Tradeoffs</h3>
<p>An index is great because it lets us query our database much faster, but there are some problems with our specific hash table implementation:</p>
<ol><li><p><strong>Keys have to fit in memory</strong>. Since we're using an in-memory hash table as our index, all of the keys in our database must fit in memory. This means there's a limit on the number of keys we can store!</p></li><li><p><strong>Range queries are inefficient</strong>. Our index wouldn't help for search queries; if we wanted to find all the records between the keys <code>12</code> and <code>18</code>, for example, we'd have to iterate through the entire database!</p></li></ol>
<hr>
<h2>Sorted String Tables</h2>
<p>Here's an idea: what if we <strong>ensure our database is always sorted by key?</strong> By sorting our data, we can immediately make range queries fast:</p>

<hr>
<h3>Sparse Indices</h3>
<p>One benefit of sorting our data is that we no longer need to store the offset of <em>every</em> record in memory.</p>
<p>Take a look at this database with four records. Since there's no logical order to the records, there's no way to determine where a record is without storing its key or searching through the entire database.</p>

<p>Knowing that <code>10</code> has an offset of <code>50</code> doesn't help us find where <code>18</code> is.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now if these records were sorted, we could determine the location of each record using <em>any</em> of the keys in the index, even if it's not the key we're looking for.</p>
<p>Let's say our database is sorted but we only had the offset for the key <code>10</code>:</p>

<p>Let's say we want to find the key <code>18</code>. We know that <code>18</code> is greater than <code>10</code>, which means it must be after <code>10</code> in the database. In other words, we can start searching for <code>18</code> from <code>10</code>'s offset—<code>36</code> in this case.</p>

<p>While this is certainly slower than having the offset for <code>18</code> directly, it's still faster than looping through the database in its entirety.</p>
<p>The real unlock here lies in being able to control the trade-off between memory and performance: <strong>a denser index means faster lookups, but more memory usage</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Sorting in Practice</h3>
<p>Ensuring our database is always sorted is much easier said than done; by definition, sorting data requires moving around records as new ones get added—something that cannot be done efficiently when we're storing data on-disk. This brings us to our problem:</p>
<div><header><h4>Problem</h4></header><p><strong>How do we keep our data sorted <em>and</em> append-only?</strong> It's too slow to sort the data on-disk every time we add a new record; is there another way?</p></div>
<hr>
<p>The trick is to first <strong>sort the data in memory</strong>, and <em>then</em> write it to disk.</p>
<ol><li><p>When we add a new record, add it to a sorted in-memory list;</p></li><li><p>When our in-memory list gets too large, we'll write it to disk;</p></li><li><p>When we want to read a record, we'll read the in-memory list first, and then the disk if necessary.</p></li></ol>

<p>The data structure used to store the in-memory list is usually one optimized for sorted data like a <strong>balanced binary search tree</strong> or more commonly, a <strong>skip list</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, the main downside of having some of your data in-memory is that it's not persistent—if the program crashes or the computer shuts down, all of the data in the in-memory list is lost.</p>
<p>The fix here is thankfully pretty straightforward—every time we add a record to the list, <strong>we also write it to an append-only file on disk</strong>. This way, we have a backup in case a crash does happen (which it most certainly will).</p>

<p>The append-only file doesn't need to be sorted nor does it need to have every record in the database; only the ones that are currently in memory.</p>
<hr>
<div><div><p>With that, we have our very own key-value database! Let's recap how it works.</p><p>Our database starts out empty. When we go to add a new record, we'll add it to a <strong>sorted in-memory list</strong>, keeping a copy in an append-only file in case of crashes.</p><figure></figure></div><div><p>When the in-memory list gets too large, we'll <em>flush</em> the list by writing all of the records to a file in sorted order. In the process, we'll keep note of each record's offset in an <strong>index</strong> so we can efficiently look them up later.</p><figure><div></div></figure></div><div><p>When we want to look up a record, we'll first check the in-memory list. If the record isn't there, we'll check the index to see if it's in the on-disk file.</p><figure><div></div></figure></div><div><p>Once a file is saved to disk, it's considered <strong>immutable</strong> which means we can only ever read from the file and never update it. To work around this, we'll treat updates and deletes the same as inserting new records—add them to the in-memory list.</p><figure></figure></div><div><p>Treating updates and deletes as new records means our file will only ever grow larger. To prevent this, we'll occassionally <em>compact</em> the on-disk files by deleting all duplicate records.</p></div></div>
<hr>
<h2>LSM Trees</h2>
<p>What we just built actually exists in the real world—it's called <strong>an LSM or Log-Structured Merge Tree</strong>.</p>
<p>An LSM tree works by combining an in-memory list (often called a <em>memtable</em>) with an on-disk file (typically called a <em>sorted string table</em> or SST) to create a really fast key-value database.</p>
<p>LSM trees are the underlying data structure used for large-scale key-value databases like <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb">Google's LevelDB</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon's DynamoDB</a>, and they have proven to perform really well at scale—on Prime Day 2020, DynamoDB peaked at 80 <em>million</em> requests per second!</p>
<p>Now, LSM trees aren't perfect, and they're certainly not the only way to structure a database. In fact, relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL use a completely different structure called a <strong>B-Tree</strong> to store their data—but that's a deep dive for another post.</p>
<p>For now, thanks for reading!</p></article></div>]]></description>
