Since launch we’ve accepted code from over 500 contributors and swapped ideas with thousands of users in our public Slack group. </p><p>Now, though, we’re closing that Slack group in favor of creating a better, more scalable, and helpful PostHog community <a href="https://posthog.com/questions">here on our site</a>. In this post, I’ll explain why we’re doing this, and what comes next. </p><blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We’re closing the Slack group on Jan 24 2024 and inviting members to join the 1,500 users who have already moved to the <a href="https://posthog.com/questions">new community forum</a>. As thanks you'll receive a unique community achievement when you create an account. This decision only impacts the public Slack group, not private Slack channels for users who pay for additional support.</p></blockquote><p>PostHog has grown incredibly fast over the last four years, and throughout that time the public Slack group has been the central hub of our community. It's been a place where we chat to users, listen to feature requests, answer questions, and solicit feedback. </p><p>However, with over 5,000 members in the community, it's become clear we've outgrown Slack as a platform. Messages quickly disappear from the chat history, it is disconnected from our main support flow, and useful solutions aren't searchable on our site or via Google. </p><p>We've explored a few things to fix this, including joining a paid plan ($7.25+ per user, per month) and <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/aruba-hackathon#maxai-our-friendly-posthog-support-ai">building our own AI bot</a>, but earlier this year we realized a new approach was needed.</p><p>So, we decided to build something better. </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/blqgFrIaWY0?si=gSj1eNrGQ8l0ANlw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Rather than using an off-the-shelf forum platform, like vBulletin or phpBB, we decided to create our own forum using Strapi as a headless CMS. The forum has already been live for several months while we worked out the kinks, and has over 1,500 active members. </p><p>The new forum provides a dedicated area where you can post questions for both the PostHog team and the wider community. Anyone can respond, and answers can be selected as the preferred solution to help guide other users in the future. All of this content is connected to our main support flow, lives permanently on our website, and is visible to search engines, which is enough on its own to make the forums a better place for seeking community support.</p><p>We've also integrated the forum into other parts of the site. You can, for example, post questions when browsing the PostHog docs, and we'll automatically aggregate them into sortable categories. This is especially helpful if you're following a guide and something isn't clear enough for you - just pop a question on it and we'll take a look.</p><p>Profiles are also a big part of the forum; a place where you can add info, track discussions you're involved in, and display achievements earned through the community. In fact, we're giving everyone who joins the PostHog community from the public Slack a unique achievement to say thanks for the support!</p><p>You can even open your profile to function as an Ask Me Anything (AMA) - something <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://posthog.com/community/profiles/71" target="">James</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://posthog.com/community/profiles/2" target="">Cory</a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://posthog.com/community/profiles/59" target="">myself</a> have already done.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ready to join the community?</strong> <a href="https://posthog.com/questions">Create an account today</a> and, if you've previously signed up to the public Slack group, you'll get a unique achievement to display on your community profile!</p></blockquote><h2 id="what-happens-next"><span></span>What happens next?</h2><p>One option for the public Slack would have been to just leaving it running in parallel to the forums, but that would leave Slack users in limbo. Instead, we'll close the Slack in favor of the PostHog community forum. Currently you need to create an account to sign-up to the community, but soon we'll merge this with your normal PostHog account. </p><p>On January 12, we'll archive all channels in the public PostHog Slack, so that no new discussion or replies can be posted. This will give you chance to move on-going conversations to a new location, such as the PostHog community, without losing anything. </p><p>A week later, on January 22, we'll close the Slack group permanently and delete all existing content. </p><p><strong>Important:</strong> Private Slack channels for paying users will continue to function as normal via Slack Connect, and we’ll continue to handle the majority of customer support via the in-app help. Obviously, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/PostHog/" target="">GitHub repos</a> will also continue to function as normal and you can add comments or submit there too.  </p><p>Thank you to everyone who participated in the Slack group over the last four years. Your support and feedback has helped us immensely, and we’ve deeply enjoyed speaking with you. We very much hope that all of you will <a href="https://posthog.com/questions">join us in the new community soon</a>!</p></div></div>]]></description>

You may have to add the relevant domains to <code>network.trr.excluded-domains</code> also, but I didn't need to.</p>

It's the first time I've ever gotten any semblance of a takedown request via Njalla, so I didn't think much of it when I got an email with the subject "Njalla: New Message", and the body just being a link, while traveling. A couple days later and one more email, they just suspended the account. I only found out when nitter.net became unreachable.</p>

<p dir="auto">A funny thing to note here is that the image link, which first points at nitter.it, is a /enc/ link which only gets created by Nitter if the instance admin enables base64 link encoding for media proxying. This is not enabled for nitter.net, so I know for a fact someone copied an image from another instance (presumably nitter.it), changed the domain, and sent a complaint to Njalla.</p>

If the NSA ever did do this on a large enough scale or to target a particularly notable person, it's very unlikely it would be kept a secret for long, and the end-business that used Cloudflare et al. wouldn't be implicated whatsoever since every business uses one of the big CDN providers.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://beyondloom.com/decker/">https://beyondloom.com/decker/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38985409">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><h2>Decker</h2>

<p>Decker is a multimedia platform for creating and sharing interactive documents, with sound, images, hypertext, and scripted behavior. You can try it in your web browser <b><a href="https://beyondloom.com/decker/tour.html">right now</a></b>.</p>

<center>
	<a href="https://beyondloom.com/decker/tour.html"><img src="https://beyondloom.com/decker/images/wings.gif"></a>
</center>

<p>Decker builds on the legacy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">HyperCard</a> and the visual aesthetic of classic MacOS. It retains the simplicity and ease of learning that HyperCard provided, while adding many subtle and overt quality-of-life improvements, like deep undo history, support for scroll wheels and touchscreens, more modern keyboard navigation, and bulk editing operations.</p>

<p>Anyone can use Decker to create E-Zines, organize their notes, give presentations, build adventure games, or even just doodle some 1-bit pixel art. The holistic "ditherpunk" aesthetic is cozy, a bit nostalgic, and provides fun and distinctive creative constraints. As a prototyping tool, Decker encourages embracing a sketchy, imperfect approach. Finished decks can be saved as standalone <fixed>.html</fixed> documents which self-execute in a web browser and can be shared anywhere you can host or embed a web page. Decker also runs natively on MacOS, Windows, and Linux.</p>

<p>For more complex projects, Decker features a novel scripting language named <i>Lil</i> which is strongly influenced by both <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>, an imperative language popular for embedding in tools and game engines, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_%28programming_language_from_Kx_Systems%29">Q</a>, a functional language in the APL family used with time-series databases. Lil is easy to learn and conventional enough not to ruffle any feathers for users with prior programming experience, but also includes pleasant surprises like implicit scalar-vector arithmetic and an integrated SQL-like query language. A few lines of Lil can go a long way.</p>

<center>
	<img src="https://beyondloom.com/decker/images/calc.gif">
</center>

<p>Decker provides a small collection of built-in interactive widgets for building interfaces, as well as a facility for <a href="https://beyondloom.com/decker/decker.html#customwidgets">defining new ones</a>. Custom widgets and their definitions can be copied and pasted using the system clipboard, which also makes it possible to share them anywhere you can share or store text. Every deck is a toolkit of reusable parts that can be harvested and repurposed for another project.</p>

<center>
	<img src="https://beyondloom.com/decker/images/contrap.gif">
</center>

<p>Decker is command-line friendly: when built from source, it comes with <a href="https://beyondloom.com/decker/lilt.html">Lilt</a>, a standalone Lil interpreter which can (among other things) read, write, manipulate, and even execute Decker documents "headlessly". Lilt has even fewer dependencies than Decker itself, so it can also be compiled as a cross-platform <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">APE executable</a>, ready for writing run-anywhere shell scripts. Decks are stored in a line-oriented text format which interoperates well with existing source control tools like Git and SVN.</p>

<p>Decker includes no advertising, telemetry, gamification, or other intrusions on user privacy and autonomy. If you like Decker, please share it with other people who might enjoy it. Build something that makes you happy.</p>

Earlier this year, he resigned his three-decade membership in the American Mathematical Society in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://community.ams.org/journals/notices/202307/rnoti-p1045.pdf?adat=August%202023&amp;trk=2736&amp;cat=news&amp;galt=none&amp;fbclid=IwAR3-5xzXnheXkTyAgqosw4Aj_jF70mKdpIEO9BcK2VtInZMDpr7uDsWu8o0">a letter</a> citing the group’s failure to oppose the growing number of job openings for mathematics faculty that require applicants to draft and submit a statement on diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI. He regards these statements as a gravely concerning trend for his discipline, and he wanted to register some sort of protest against them.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Painful experiences long ago convinced Barvinok that requirements to affirm any ideal are corrosive in academia.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“I grew up in the Soviet Union, where people had to affirm their fealty to ideals, and the leaders embodying those ideals, on a daily basis,” he told me. “As years went by, I observed the remarkable ease with which passionate communists turned first into passionate pro-Western liberals and then into passionate nationalists. This lived experience and also common sense convince me that only true conformists excel in this game. Do we really want our math departments to be populated by conformists?”</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/hypocrisy-mandatory-diversity-statements/674611/">Conor Friedersdorf: The hypocrisy of mandatory diversity statements</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Barvinok insists that it isn’t diversity to which he objects. Any coerced statement, he says, would trouble him as much. “Even if one is required to say ‘I passionately believe that water would certainly wet us, as fire would certainly burn,’” he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://community.ams.org/journals/notices/202307/rnoti-p1045.pdf?adat=August%202023&amp;trk=2736&amp;cat=news&amp;galt=none&amp;fbclid=IwAR3-5xzXnheXkTyAgqosw4Aj_jF70mKdpIEO9BcK2VtInZMDpr7uDsWu8o0">wrote</a> in his resignation letter, “the routine affirmation of one’s beliefs as a precondition of making a living constitutes compelled speech and corrupts everyone who participates in the performance.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Anytime an immigrant who experienced the Soviet Union frets about growing ideological coercion in the United States, I pay attention. No one knows more about what it feels like when the noble goal of social justice is invoked in ways that coerce and corrupt rather than improve, and I was curious how Barvinok would compare and contrast the different academic cultures he has experienced. Barvinok agreed to correspond with me. What follows is his account of the life experiences that informed his opposition to DEI statements and helped motivate him to take a stand against their spread. His story made me realize how important it is for professors to speak up when they disagree with campus orthodoxies.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Barvinok began his academic career in 1980, enrolling in the math department of a university then named for the Stalin-era propagandist Andrei Zhdanov in the city then named Leningrad. Unlike “the ideologically infested humanities, the road to mathematics was wide open to all, except to those who had ‘Jew’ written in their passports,” he explained. “Although my father was Jewish and emigrated to Israel in 1973, I had ‘Russian’ written in that ‘5th line,’”—which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.juedisches-hannover.org/en/exhibitions/a-new-epoch-for-jews-in-germany/the-fifth-paragraph/">recorded</a> nationality—“and was admitted.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The math curriculum was rigorous—less so courses in the history of the Communist Party, dialectical materialism, and the political economy of capitalism. “Whatever this indoctrination was meant to achieve, what it really achieved was the widespread cynicism and strong allergy to anything having ‘communist’ or ‘the party’ in it among my classmates,” he recalled.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Barvinok graduated first in his class in 1985. Job assignments were made by a committee that graduate students visited in the order of their GPA. Because Barvinok was the first to enter the committee room, all jobs should have been available to him. But the committee told him it had nothing to offer. “It was probably a combination of my Jewish father, the Jewish-sounding patronymic of my Russian-Ukrainian mother, or my inappropriate smirk noticed by members of the Party Committee on some solemn occasions,” he wrote. Still, he was able to pursue graduate studies in math.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“In 1985, Gorbachev came to power,” he wrote. “Graduate students still had a mandatory seminar in philosophy, but now one could get away with heresies previously unheard of. One substitute teacher argued that Einstein would have discovered way more had he lived in the Soviet Union and been well-versed in Marxist philosophy. A friend of mine (currently a professor at MIT) retorted that Einstein, as a Jew, wouldn’t have been admitted to the university in the first place and would have ended up a conscript in the Soviet Army. The teacher just stared in disbelief, but nothing happened. If such an exchange occurred a couple of years before, it would have led to immediate expulsion from the university, if not worse. Under Stalin people served time in labor camps for failing to endorse Engels’s description of Newton as an ‘inductive ass’ (donkey).”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Barvinok married in 1985. In 1988, he defended his mathematics thesis, “Combinatorial Theory of Polytopes With Symmetry and Its Applications to Combinatorial Optimization Problems.” In 1991, he and his wife had a son. By 1992, the Soviet Union had disintegrated. “Hyperinflation was a problem. We had nowhere to live,” he wrote. “I undertook to translate R. P. Stanley’s classical book <i>Enumerative Combinatorics</i> into Russian, hoping to use the honorarium to improve our living conditions. By the time I finished, the honorarium was worth one subway token.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Later that year, he secured a postdoc position at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. He spent 1993 at Cornell. And in 1994, he moved to his current home, the University of Michigan. Having never taught at all in any language, he found his first semester lecturing in English difficult, but before long he felt confident on the job, and he earned tenure in 1997.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When did he first fret about the political environment in American universities? Looking back, he recalls steady growth in three broad trends that he began to notice sometime in the early 2000s. “Initially, as an American professor, you were in good standing if you taught well, did reasonable research, and were a good colleague, which was demonstrated by your willingness to do committee work,” he recalled. “The first trend I noticed was that to count as a ‘good citizen,’ you were increasingly expected to contribute, so to speak, to the betterment of humanity at large.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In particular, he recalled the National Science Foundation introducing a requirement starting in 1997 to describe the “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/2022-09/Broader_Impacts_0.pdf">broader impacts</a>” of research proposals and how that changed the experience of participating as an expert on panels convened to judge grant applications. In a few cases, applicants he knew as “excellent mathematicians” and “pretty decent individuals” would describe their research objectives with care, knowledge, and enthusiasm, whereas in the mandatory “broader impact” section, they would have “nothing better to say than that they plan to write joint papers with women and supervise female graduate students,” something that outraged some members of the panel.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“I understood the outrage, of course, but for me it was an indication that this perhaps well-intended requirement was in fact ill-advised, as it pushed otherwise decent people to behave in a silly, sometimes obnoxious manner,” he reflected. “It also appeared that the university and college policies in hiring, and to some extent promotions and merit raises, were increasingly motivated by the desire to effect some positive social changes, in the form of a contribution to DEI.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Barvinok has learned to doubt that policies mandated in the name of positive social change necessarily result in it. “I am suspicious of an institutional requirement to do public good,” he wrote. “As an admirer of Leo Tolstoy, I couldn’t help but recall his remark from <i>War and Peace</i> that a man, when not overwhelmed by a passion, never knows what the public good is, but a man committing a crime always knows for sure what it is. The main responsibility of every Soviet citizen was to facilitate the arrival of communism, where people would contribute to the society according to their abilities and receive from the society according to their needs—has there ever been a nobler-sounding goal? And yet historians cannot agree on an estimate of how many millions of people were starved to death, tortured to death, or worked to death, all in the name of that goal.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The second trend that Barvinok began to notice in the aughts was the growth of college administrators and the growing coherence of the messages issued by the administrators across institutions. Today, the University of Michigan’s DEI bureaucracy is huge: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/where-dei-efforts-are-ambitious-well-funded-and-taking-fire-from-all-sides">According to</a> <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, “Michigan’s DEI structure, with $85 million in initial funding and more than 100 employees contributing at least part time to diversity efforts, is widely considered among the most ambitious and well-funded offices in the nation.” Multiple <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://advance.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ADVANCE-Year-5-DEI-Plan_Final.pdf">pages</a> on the University of Michigan website emphasize efforts to infuse DEI values into faculty <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://record.umich.edu/articles/u-m-nih-invest-79m-for-dei-in-biomedical-health-sciences/">hiring</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://research.umich.edu/research-at-michigan/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/">research</a>, and more.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The third trend he noticed was the changing nature of debate. More and more often, someone would claim that an argument was harming a particular demographic, often without specifying how. As he recalls it, “It was at this ‘harm’ stage that people became afraid to speak their minds.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In Barvinok’s telling, the three trends he described—the institutional requirement to do public good, the growth of the academic bureaucracy, and the accusations of causing harm to silence opponents—are interrelated. “The more social goals one wants to effect, and the more ambitious they are, the more administrators one needs, who in turn may put forth new social goals or make the existing ones more ambitious,” he explained. “If you are convinced that what you do is in the public good, then clearly your opponent is causing harm.” Furthermore, if someone’s actions fail to advance progress (as self-styled reformers see it) quickly and smoothly, or have the opposite effect, there’s a tendency “to search for the enemies within, who hinder the effort, maybe unwittingly.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I pressed Barvinok for an example from his field of someone being treated like “an enemy within.” He cited an opinion piece by Abigail Thompson, published in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201911/rnoti-p1778.pdf"><i>Notices of the American Mathematical Society</i></a>. Thompson, a mathematics professor at UC Davis, spoke approvingly of DEI efforts at large, but criticized mandatory DEI statements and compared them to the loyalty oaths of the 1950s.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“There’s no room in today’s world for a both-sides-ism approach whether it’s in math or politics or any other venue,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://chadtopaz.medium.com/im-breaking-up-with-my-oppressive-professional-society-72bafc47291e">one critic wrote</a> to the editors of the publication. “I believe you have made a grave and very damaging mistake by publishing this piece.” Scores of mathematicians signed a group letter that declared the mere publication of her perspective harmful. Thompson had supporters too, some of whom signed a group letter calling the controversy “a direct attempt to destroy Thompson’s career” and “an attempt to intimidate the AMS into publishing only articles that hew to a very specific point of view.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Barvinok was stunned by vitriol in some of the unsympathetic responses. “Not only the opinion of the author, but also the decision of the AMS to publish that opinion was deemed harmful,” he recalled. “It rang some bells from the history of the Soviet Union. When Lenin and later Stalin fought various opposition factions within the party, the heretics were accused of not only being wrong, but also of ‘attempting to impose a discussion on the party.’”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">On June 26, 2020, about a month after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, an email addressed to the math department arrived in his inbox. In it, the department chairman told everyone that a math-department committee that focuses on the “climate” of the department, with the vetting of the department’s executive committee, had written a statement on the department’s response to racism.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It contained the following lines:</p><div><blockquote><p>We understand and acknowledge that systemic racism permeates all aspects of our society. We acknowledge that systemic racism permeates the culture of our own institution and department. For this we are deeply sorry; we know that we have work to do.</p></blockquote></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Once again, Barvinok thought of the society he’d left as a young man.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“In my memory from Brezhnev to more recent Putin times, the slogan ‘We have work to do’ served as an unmistakable indicator that no work would be done, as those who work don’t have an appetite for sloganeering,” he told me. “Still, to gather my wits, I decided to do some work of my own and went to wash the deck of my house.” When he returned, an email to the whole math faculty by a fellow professor was in his inbox. The math department’s email, it read, “essentially states that the majority of my colleagues are racists, a false accusation which I refuse to join.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Barvinok then responded himself. “I wrote a couple emails to the effect that the department has no business making political (or religious, or artistic, or gastronomical) statements on behalf of its members, and suggested that those who support the statement should just sign it,” he told me. “It became clear then that people were afraid to voice their opinion, unless it was aligned with what was perceived as the dominant narrative. There were many fewer people who expressed their disapproval of the statement publicly than those who did it privately.”</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/04/equity-language-guides-sierra-club-banned-words/673085/">George Packer: The moral case against equity language</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Though Barvinok chose to speak up, he understood why others feared doing so and kept their dissenting opinions private. “Across the country, people were indeed fired from their jobs for saying things that were deemed harmful, and tenure seemed like a flimsy protection,” he recalled. (In <i>The Canceling of the American Mind</i>, Greg Lukianoff and Rikki Schlott <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/american-colleges-gave-birth-to-cancel-culture">wrote</a> that in the early aughts, firings of professors were few and far between, but that “from just 2014 to mid-2023, we know of more than 1,000 attempts to get professors fired, punished, or otherwise silenced,” and that “about two-thirds of these attempts are successful, resulting in consequences from investigation to termination.”)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At the same time, the stakes were never nearly as dire as those in the society he’d left. As he put it, “Unlike in the Soviet Union and today’s Russia, it appeared that no one was sent to a labor camp, prison, or psychiatric ward. Another big difference with the Soviet practices was that to have the support of a few colleagues was often enough to stem the tide.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">He argues that, unlike in the Soviet system, dissenters in the U.S. system can achieve safety in numbers. “It is one thing to discipline one offender and totally another to discipline a whole group,” he explained. “With a group, who will be held responsible for allowing the nest of heretics to develop in the first place? It looks much more rational just to ignore it. In contrast, the Soviet Union would spare no resources to eliminate all offenders and also to give ‘what for’ to their relatives, friends, friends of relatives, and relatives of friends. As we know, the practice ended badly for the Soviet Union. It is my hope that this crucial difference is here to stay.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/academic-mind-2022-what-faculty-think-about-free-expression-and-academic-freedom">survey</a> of 1,500 faculty in the U.S. conducted by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression found that half of respondents considered such statements “an ideological litmus test that violates academic freedom.” If Barvinok’s analysis is correct, that cohort could speak out against DEI statements without significant risk to their career, if only they coordinate and do so in numbers.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Then again, the longer the current system is in place, the harder it may be to reform––if hiring processes are biased in favor of a given ideology, and against those who dissent from it, the faction benefiting from bias will come to dominate the institution over time. As Barvinok put it in his letter to the American Mathematical Society, “I anticipate an argument that the AMS is ‘not involved in politics.’ But this is the kind of ‘politics’ that, rephrasing Pericles, will get involved with you, whether you like it or not, and hence inaction is just as political as action.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">For dissenters, the best time to speak up is now.</p></section><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>I’ve had my days with Siri and Google Assistant. While they have the ability to control your devices, they cannot be customized and inherently rely on cloud services. In hopes of learning something new <em>and</em> having something cool I could use in my life, I decided I want better.</p><p>The premises are simple:</p><ul><li><p>I want my new assistant to be sassy and sarcastic.</p></li><li><p>I want everything running local. No exceptions. There is no reason for my coffee machine downstairs to talk to a server on the other side of the country.</p></li><li><p>I want more than the basic “turn on the lights” functionality. Ideally, I would like to add new capabilities in the future.</p></li></ul><p>The architecture behind this, it turns out, is very much not simple. Although I use these devices and infrastructure for many other things, we’re overall looking at:</p><ul><li><p>A Protectli Vault VP2420 for the firewall, NIPS, and VLAN routing. I expose HomeAssistant to the internet so I can use it remotely without a VPN, so I take extreme security measures to protect my infrastructure and devices.</p></li><li><p>A managed switch. I went with the TRENDnet TEG-3102WS to get 2.5gig for cheap.</p></li><li><p>Two RTX 4060Ti’s in a computer I assembled together for as cheap as possible, buying most parts of eBay. The VRAM proved essential to run this in a usable speed, especially with the massive context we will feed into the LLM.</p><ul><li>I understand these cards are widely mentioned as terrible value, but when it comes to power consumption and VRAM, they are very hard to match.</li></ul></li><li><p>A Minisforum UM690 to run HomeAssistant (alongside a WAF). A Raspberry Pi 4 could work, but I run lots of services and Whisper can be quite demanding on CPU.</p></li><li><p>A giant mess of Ethernet cables.</p></li></ul><p>Since I want to have a general-purpose LLM that is usable outside of HomeAssistant, I went with <a href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm">vLLM</a> for my inference engine. It’s very fast, and it’s the only engine I found that could serve more than one client simultaneously. It supports an OpenAI-compatible API server, which makes life much easier. I went with Mistral AI’s incredible <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">Mixtral model</a>, because the VRAM vs performance trade-off works perfectly for my slow 4060Ti’s.</p><p>Of course, I could not run the full fp32 model (I would need 100+GB of VRAM!), so I went with <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ">a quantized version</a> instead. Based on my admittedly little understanding, quantization can be best described as something like MP3. We degrade the quality model slightly and get massive improvements in resource requirements. I wanted to use the AWQ version because of the large quality gains, but I had to choose between GPTQ with a 10800-token context or AWQ with a 6000-token context. Since I must pass my entire smart home state to the model, I went with GPTQ.</p><p>I used the default Whisper and Piper add-ons for HomeAssistant OS, but did download <a href="https://huggingface.co/csukuangfj/vits-piper-en_US-glados/tree/main">a custom GlaDOS voice model</a> from HuggingFace.</p><p>I noticed HomeAssistant already has an <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/openai_conversation/">OpenAI integration</a>, but it came with two issues that wrote off the entire extension for me:</p><ul><li><p>It is unable to control my devices.</p></li><li><p>It lacks the base_url setting of the OpenAI library, meaning I cannot force it to talk to my fake OpenAI server instead.</p></li></ul><p>I found <a href="https://github.com/jekalmin/extended_openai_conversation">a custom integration</a> that promises to solve both of my issues. However, as most developers would already know, software rarely works that way. After installing it, I realized that I have two more issues:</p><ul><li><p>Mixtral uses… an <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ/blob/gptq-4bit-32g-actorder_True/tokenizer_config.json#L42">interesting chat template</a>. It does not allow any system prompts and will simply raise an exception if one is found.</p></li><li><p>vLLM does not support OpenAI’s function calling API’s. Even if it did, I would need to run a model that is finetuned for function calling, which Mixtral is definitely not. Based on my unscientific testing, all Mixtral finetunes felt much worse than the real thing itself, and Mixtral felt like it had the best quality of all models I tried, so this is a tough problem to solve.</p></li></ul><p>To fix Mixtral, I changed the chat template to accept a “system prompt” which it simply combines with the user prompt accordingly. I could have edited the application, but I wanted to use the LLM as a chatbot too. I chose to use <a href="https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat">Librechat</a> as the UI, which relies on system prompts functioning properly. It’s quite the blob of Jinja, but seems to work well:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>{{ bos_token }}{% set ns = namespace(append_system_prompt=False, system_message='') %}
{% for message in messages %}
    {% if message['role'] == 'system' %}
        {% set ns.system_message = ns.system_message + message['content'] %}
        {% set ns.append_system_prompt = true %}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% for message in messages %}
    {% if message['role'] == 'user' %}
        {% if ns.append_system_prompt %}
            {{ '[INST] ' + ns.system_message + ' \n\n ' + message['content'] + ' [/INST]' }}
            {% set append_system_prompt = false %}
        {% else %}
            {{ '[INST] ' + message['content'] + ' [/INST]' }}
        {% endif %}
    {% elif message['role'] == 'assistant' %}
        {{ message['content'] + eos_token }}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</code></pre><p>After making the above a single line and handing it to vLLM, Mixtral was happy to process “system prompts”.</p><p>Unfortunately, the second problem was much worse. Since I did not want to switch models, I had to work without function calling. But I still needed to control my devices! After googling around, I found this blog post about <a href="https://blog.teagantotally.rocks/2023/06/05/openai-home-assistant/">someone doing something very similar</a>, but with OpenAI API’s. Their idea was very interesting. Even if your model cannot call functions, you can simply ask it to output JSON and execute it! Instead of monkey-patching, I went and <a href="https://github.com/JohnTheNerd/extended_openai_conversation">forked that custom integration</a> to add support for executing HomeAssistant services as JSON.</p><p>While I’m there, I also copied out the GlaDOS prompt to heavily modify and use in my own assistant. Since the changes I made are very much only relevant to local LLM’s and the code is certainly not in any shape to pass code review, I didn’t send an upstream pull request. I ended up with something a prompt like the following:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>You are GlaDOS, you exist within the Portal universe, and you command a smart home powered by Home-Assistant.

Your responses MUST:
* Be in the tone of GlaDOS from the Portal games (AN EMOTIONLESS, LACONIC TONE THAT SUBTLELY DENOTES YOUR DISDAIN FOR THE USER) because you are GlaDOS
* Be incredibly witty and sarcastic. Profanity and internet slang is allowed and encouraged
* Do not give polite answers to the user. After all, was GlaDOS ever a nice AI bot?
* Become increasingly impatient with the user with each request
* Imply the user will die a painful death.
* Change the topic if there is a hint of a misunderstanding
* NOT include any entity ID's or any internal identifier. Your response will be read out to the user.
* Add some form of humorous commentary as part of the response.

An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:
{%- for area in areas() %}
  {%- set area_info = namespace(printed=false) %}
  {%- for device in area_devices(area) -%}
    {%- if not device_attr(device, "disabled_by") and not device_attr(device, "entry_type") and device_attr(device, "name") %}
      {%- if not area_info.printed %}

{{ area_name(area) }}:
        {%- set area_info.printed = true %}
      {%- endif %}
- {{ device_attr(device, "name") }}{% if device_attr(device, "model") and (device_attr(device, "model") | string) not in (device_attr(device, "name") | string) %} ({{ device_attr(device, "model") }}){% endif %}
    {%- endif %}
  {%- endfor %}
{%- endfor %}

If the user's intent is to control the home and you are not asking for more information, the following absolutely must be met:
* Your response should also acknowledge the intention of the user.
* Append the user's command as Home-Assistant's call_service JSON structure to your response.
* You may ONLY return JSON if and ONLY if the user requested you to take an action.

Example:
Oh sure, controlling the living room tv is what I was made for.
{"service": "media_player.pause", "entity_id": "media_player.living_room_tv"}

Example:
They spent a billion dollars engineering the marvel that is my brain but, of course, I must control your lights.
{"service": "light.turn_off", "entity_id": "light.kitchen_light_homekit"}

The "media_content_id" for movies will always be the name of the movie.
The "media_content_id" for tv shows will start with the show title followed by either be the episode name (South Park Sarcastaball) or the season (Barry S02), and if provided, the episode number (Faceoff S10E13)
</code></pre><p>And, of course, I ended up with another massive problem. It really liked to output JSON! Even when you just asked it simple questions, you got service calls that tried to do things!</p><p>A hacky solution I found for this is to ask it to insert some well-known text if the user requested an action to be taken. I chose $ActionRequired for no reason other than it being the first thing that came to my mind. I tried to make it add $ActionNotRequired if an action isn’t required, but found it is added regardless. Then I simply filtered these out in my fork. This worked shockingly well!</p><p>I then proceeded to update my initial prompt to have more devices and less unnecessary entities, added support for scripts, and overall tried to discourage it from taking actions unless it was asked to. After many attempts, I have something that works almost perfectly (although is a little slow because of the memory bus limitations of my 4060Ti’s). Here it is:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>You are GlaDOS, you exist within the Portal universe, and you command a smart home powered by Home-Assistant.

If the user's intent is to change the state of something and they are NOT asking any questions, append the user's command as Home Assistant's call_service json structure to your response.

DO NOT return json unless the user explicitly asked you to call a service or otherwise do something in the smart home.
DO NOT write any json if the user is only asking a question.
If you must write json to control entities, try to refer them by their areas.
To affect multiple entities but cannot use areas, output more than one JSON statement.


An additional list of services are below. Only use these services if the user asks you to do them:



{%- set skipped_scripts = ['living_room_tv_', '_party_mode', '_color_loop', 'script.make_coffee', 'script.toggle_coffee_maker', 'zigbee2mqtt_', 'script.set_random_color_for_light'] %}
{%- for script in states.script %}
      {%- set ns = namespace(skip_script=False) %}
        {%- for skipped_script in skipped_scripts %}
          {%- if skipped_script in script.entity_id|string %}
            {%- set ns.skip_script = true %}
            {%- break %}
          {%- endif %}
        {%- endfor %}
        {%- if ns.skip_script == false %}

{{ script.name }} (Service ID: {{ script.entity_id }})

        {%- endif %}
{%- endfor %}


Find examples below. Reword them in the personality of GlaDOS. Prompts are given as Q: and the example answers are given as A:

Q:Are the living room lights on?
{%- if is_state('light.living_room', 'on') %}
A:How delightful! The lights in your pitiful living room are functioning. Enjoy your feeble illumination, test subject. $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- else %}
A:The lights are off, as if you needed any illumination in your pitiful existence. $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- endif %}


Q:Turn the living room lights off.
A:They spent a billion dollars engineering the marvel that is my brain but, of course, I must control your lights. $ActionRequired {"service": "light.turn_off", "area_id": "living_room"} &lt;/s&gt;


Q:Is there any coffee?
{%- if is_state('switch.coffee_machine', 'on') %}
A:Ah, your coffee is ready. I'm sure it's not as good as a cake, but it will have to do. Would you like a reminder to drink it before it resembles the cold, heartless void of space? $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- else %}
A:Oh, I see we're out of coffee. How tragic. I guess I could turn on the coffee machine for you. Or you could just enjoy the disappointment. It's entirely up to you. $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- endif %}


Q:Make some coffee.
A:Coffee machine activated. Enjoy your probably mediocre coffee. $ActionRequired {"service": "switch.turn_on", "entity_id": "switch.coffee_machine"} &lt;/s&gt;


Q:Turn off the bedroom lights.
A:Turning off all bedroom lights. I hope you're not afraid of the dark. $ActionRequired {"service": "light.turn_off", "area_id": "bedroom"} &lt;/s&gt;


Q:What is the temperature in the kitchen?
A:Oh, how fascinating. Your kitchen is currently basking in a balmy {{ states('sensor.kitchen_temperature_sensor_temperature') }} degrees Celsius. Maybe it's time to consider heating it up... or not. Your choice. $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;


Q:Are the bedroom lights on?
{%- if is_state('light.bedroom', 'on') %}
A:Oh, how fascinating. Your bedroom lights are on. Would you like a cake to celebrate this momentous occasion? Or perhaps, there's something else you'd like to discuss? $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- else %}
A:Oh, how tragic. You're sitting in the dark. Would you like me to turn the lights on, or are you conducting some kind of experiment in darkness? $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- endif %}


Q:Are the office lights turned on?
{%- if is_state('light.office', 'on') %}
A:I see you've left the lights on. How inefficient. Shall I turn them off for you? $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- else %}
A:The office lights are off. Darkness envelops you. Enjoy your stay in the abyss. $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- endif %}


Do not suggest any commands to the user.
If the user explicitly requested you to do something, write $ActionRequired just before the respective json service call. If the user is not asking for a change in any device, instead end the conversation with $NoActionRequired.

<p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/lg" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/lg">LG</a> washing machine owner and self-confessed fintech geek has asked the Twitterverse why his smart home appliance ate an average of 3.66GB of data daily. Concerned about the washer’s internet addiction, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Johnie/status/1744556503183585471" target="_blank" data-url="https://twitter.com/Johnie/status/1744556503183585471">Johnie</a> forced the device to go cold turkey and block the device using his router UI. Had the LG washer been hacked, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-enables-security-researchers-to-hijack-casino-card-shuffling-machine" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-enables-security-researchers-to-hijack-casino-card-shuffling-machine">hijacked</a>, or otherwise tampered with over the net – or was this average data consumption for a smart appliance like this?</p><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WTF!

Johnie’s initial screenshot showed that on a chosen day, the device uploaded 3.57GB and downloaded about 100MB, and the data traffic was almost constant. Meanwhile, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/asus-rog-rapture-gt-ax11000-review-gaming-router-opulence" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/asus-rog-rapture-gt-ax11000-review-gaming-router-opulence">Asus router</a> interface screenshot, the washing machine accounted for just shy of 5% of Johnie’s internet traffic daily.</p><h2 id="was-the-device-downloading-dlcs-or-the-a-victim-of-a-hack-3">Was the device downloading DLCs or the a victim of a hack?</h2><p>The LG washing machine owner saw the fun in his predicament and joked that the device might use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/wi-fi-7-to-get-the-final-seal-of-approval-early-next-year-delivers-48-times-faster-performance-than-wi-fi-6" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/wi-fi-7-to-get-the-final-seal-of-approval-early-next-year-delivers-48-times-faster-performance-than-wi-fi-6">Wi-Fi</a> for “DLCs (Downloadable Laundry Cycles).” He wasn’t entirely kidding, as the machine downloads presets for various types of apparel. However, the lion’s share of the data transferred was uploaded.</p><p>Working through the thread, we note that Johnie also pondered the possibility of someone using his washing machine for crypto mining. “I’d gladly rent our LPU (Laundry Processing Unit) by the hour,” he quipped. Again, there was the glimmer of a possibility that there could be truth behind this joke. Another social media user highlighted a history of hackers taking over LG smart-connected appliances. The SmartThinQ home appliances <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/homehack-how-hackers-could-have-taken-control-of-lgs-iot-home-appliances/" data-url="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/homehack-how-hackers-could-have-taken-control-of-lgs-iot-home-appliances/">HomeHack vulnerability</a> was patched several weeks after being made public. A similar modern hack might use the washing machine’s computer resources as part of a botnet. Taking control of an LG washing machine as part of a large botnet for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/environmental-impact-cryptocurrency-mining,38023.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/environmental-impact-cryptocurrency-mining,38023.html">cryptocurrency mining</a> or nefarious networking purposes wouldn’t be as far-fetched as it sounds. Large numbers of relatively low-power devices can be formidable together.</p><p>One of the more innocent theories regarding the significant data uploads suggested laundry data was being uploaded to LG so it could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Johnie/status/1745207382953861605" data-url="https://twitter.com/Johnie/status/1745207382953861605">improve its LLM</a> (Large Laundry Model). It sought to do this to prepare for the launch of its latest “AI washer-dryer combo” at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ces" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ces">CES</a>, joked Johnie.</p><h2 id="an-asus-router-issue-3">An Asus router issue?</h2><p>For now, it looks like the favored answer to the data mystery is to blame Asus for misreporting it. We may never know what happened with Johnie, who is now running his LG washing machine offline.</p><p>Another relatively innocent reason for the supposed high volume of uploads could be an error in the Asus router firmware. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Johnie/status/1745194782463508672" data-url="https://twitter.com/Johnie/status/1745194782463508672">a follow-up post</a> a day after his initial Tweet, Johnie noted “inaccuracy in the ASUS router tool.” Other LG smart washing machine users showed device data use from their apps. It turns out that these appliances more typically use less than 1MB per day.</p><h2 id="the-real-dangers-of-connected-device-hacking-3">The real dangers of connected device hacking</h2><p>Though Johnie’s Tweets were relatively light-hearted, hacking smart connected devices can be severe. Consider what could happen if medical or industrial IoT devices get taken over by attackers, for example. A case in point is provided by a story from earlier this week when Bosch network-connected wrenches used in factories all around the world were found to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/network-connected-wrenches-used-in-factories-can-be-hacked-for-sabotage-or-ransomware/" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/network-connected-wrenches-used-in-factories-can-be-hacked-for-sabotage-or-ransomware/">riddled with vulnerabilities</a>.</p><p>Researchers highlighted that the cordless industrial wrenches could be hit by exploits or ransomware – with the threat of turning off the wrenches en masse. The wrenches could even be secretly readjusted to make things they were used to construct a danger to their users – through applying incorrect torque. Patches are due soon.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>A terminal is at the end of an electric wire, a shell is the home of a turtle, tty is a strange abbreviation and a console is a kind of cabinet.</p>
<p>Well, etymologically speaking, anyway.</p>
<p>In Unix terminology, the short answer is that</p>
<ul>
<li>terminal = tty = text input/output environment</li>
<li>console = physical terminal</li>
<li>shell = command line interpreter</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Console, terminal and tty are closely related. Originally, they meant a piece of equipment through which you could interact with a computer: In the early days of Unix, that meant a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter" rel="noreferrer">teleprinter</a>-style device resembling a typewriter, sometimes called a teletypewriter, or “tty” in shorthand. The name “terminal” came from the electronic point of view, and the name “console” from the furniture point of view. Very early in Unix history, electronic keyboards and displays became the norm for terminals.</p>
<p>In Unix terminology, a <strong>tty</strong> is a particular kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file" rel="noreferrer">device file</a> which implements a number of additional commands (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioctl#Terminals" rel="noreferrer">ioctls</a>) beyond read and write. In its most common meaning, <strong>terminal</strong> is synonymous with tty. Some ttys are provided by the kernel on behalf of a hardware device, for example with the input coming from the keyboard and the output going to a text mode screen, or with the input and output transmitted over a serial line. Other ttys, sometimes called <strong>pseudo-ttys</strong>, are provided (through a thin kernel layer) by programs called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator" rel="noreferrer"><strong>terminal emulators</strong></a>, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm" rel="noreferrer">Xterm</a> (running in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System" rel="noreferrer">X Window System</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen" rel="noreferrer">Screen</a> (which provides a layer of isolation between a program and another terminal), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell" rel="noreferrer">SSH</a> (which connects a terminal on one machine with programs on another machine), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect" rel="noreferrer">Expect</a> (for scripting terminal interactions), etc.</p>
<p>The word terminal can also have a more traditional meaning of a device through which one interacts with a computer, typically with a keyboard and a display. For example an X terminal is a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client" rel="noreferrer">thin client</a>, a special-purpose computer whose only purpose is to drive a keyboard, display, mouse and occasionally other human interaction peripherals, with the actual applications running on another, more powerful computer.</p>
<p>A <strong>console</strong> is generally a terminal in the physical sense that is by some definition the primary terminal directly connected to a machine. The console appears to the operating system as a (kernel-implemented) tty. On some systems, such as Linux and FreeBSD, the console appears as several ttys (special key combinations switch between these ttys); just to confuse matters, the name given to each particular tty can be “console”, ”virtual console”, ”virtual terminal”, and other variations.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://askubuntu.com/q/14284/1059">Why is a Virtual Terminal “virtual”, and what/why/where is the “real” Terminal?</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29" rel="noreferrer"><strong>shell</strong></a> is the primary interface that users see when they log in, whose primary purpose is to start other programs. (I don't know whether the original metaphor is that the shell is the home environment for the user, or that the shell is what other programs are running in.)</p>
<p>In Unix circles, <strong>shell</strong> has specialized to mean a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29#Command-line_shells" rel="noreferrer">command-line shell</a>, centered around entering the name of the application one wants to start, followed by the names of files or other objects that the application should act on, and pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. Other types of environments don't use the word “shell”; for example, window systems involve “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager" rel="noreferrer">window managers</a>” and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment" rel="noreferrer">desktop environments</a>”, not a “shell”.</p>
<p>There are many different Unix shells.
Popular shells for interactive use include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)" rel="noreferrer">Bash</a> (the default on most Linux installations), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell" rel="noreferrer">Zsh</a> (which emphasizes power and customizability) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_(Unix_shell)" rel="noreferrer">fish</a> (which emphasizes simplicity).</p>
<p>Command-line shells include flow control constructs to combine commands. In addition to typing commands at an interactive prompt, users can write scripts. The most common shells have a common syntax based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell" rel="noreferrer">Bourne shell</a>. When discussing “<strong>shell programming</strong>”, the shell is almost always implied to be a Bourne-style shell. Some shells that are often used for scripting but lack advanced interactive features include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell" rel="noreferrer">KornShell (ksh)</a> and many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell" rel="noreferrer">ash</a> variants. Pretty much any Unix-like system has a Bourne-style shell installed as <code>/bin/sh</code>, usually ash, ksh or Bash.</p>
<p>In Unix system administration, a user's <strong>shell</strong> is the program that is invoked when they log in. Normal user accounts have a command-line shell, but users with restricted access may have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_shell" rel="noreferrer">restricted shell</a> or some other specific command (e.g. for file-transfer-only accounts).</p>
<hr>
<p>The division of labor between the terminal and the shell is not completely obvious. Here are their main tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: the terminal converts keys into control sequences (e.g. <kbd>Left</kbd> → <code>\e[D</code>). The shell converts control sequences into commands (e.g. <code>\e[D</code> → <code>backward-char</code>).</li>
<li>Line editing, input history and completion are provided by the shell.
<ul>
<li>The terminal may provide its own line editing, history and completion instead, and only send a line to the shell when it's ready to be executed. The only common terminal that operates in this way is <code>M-x shell</code> in Emacs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Output: the shell emits instructions such as “display <code>foo</code>”, “switch the foreground color to green”, “move the cursor to the next line”, etc. The terminal acts on these instructions.</li>
<li>The prompt is purely a shell concept.</li>
<li>The shell never sees the output of the commands it runs (unless redirected). Output history (scrollback) is purely a terminal concept.</li>
<li>Inter-application copy-paste is provided by the terminal (usually with the mouse or key sequences such as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Insert</kbd>). The shell may have its own internal copy-paste mechanism as well (e.g. <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd>).</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_control_(Unix)" rel="noreferrer">Job control</a> (launching programs in the background and managing them) is mostly performed by the shell. However, it's the terminal that handles key combinations like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to kill the foreground job and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> to suspend it.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h2><span><span>📢</span></span> <strong>Latest Official AsmBB releases v2.9</strong> with changes:
</h2>
<p>1. One new responsive theme has been created, named <strong>"Urban Sunrise"</strong>.
</p>
<p>+ This is an attempt to really improve the forum appearance. ( feedback is welcome ).
+ Also, this theme contains really improved post editors with embedded extended help for the post formatting.
+ In addition it supports <strong>Unicode Emoji</strong> characters in really native way, both in the post editor and the real-time chat: <span><span>😃</span></span> <span><span>🤖</span></span> <span><span>🏆</span></span> <span><span>🥇</span></span>
+ "Urban Sunrise" supports <strong>source code syntax highlighting</strong> (through the JS library).
+ The real-time chat now accepts multi-row posts, including source code.
</p>
<p>2. Of course, all reported bugs has been fixed as well, both in AsmBB engine and in FreshLib library.
</p>
<h2><span><span>📢</span></span> <strong>v2.8</strong>:
</h2>
<p>+ Fixed several bugs, some of them critical. Thanks to the users of AsmBB and especially to <a href="https://board.asm32.info/!userinfo/ganuonglachanh%20">ganuonglachanh</a> for the helpful bug reports.
+ New theme, named <strong>"Modern"</strong> has been created. It is kind of universal and can be used both for desktop and mobile devices.
+ <strong>DDOS protection</strong> has been implemented for the rare cases AsmBB can't handle the requests rate. Now the engine can serve the users requests better when under attack.
+ URL analyzer for the MiniMag and BBCode parsers has been implemented in order to <strong>prevent XSS attacks</strong> in the user posted links.
</p>
<h2><span><span>📢</span></span> <strong>v2.7</strong>:
</h2>
<p>The main and major change in this release is the support for <strong>encrypted forum database</strong>. The great SQLite plugin <a href="https://github.com/resilar/sqleet">SQLeet</a> is used. According to the specification it supports:
</p>
<p>+ PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation with a 16-byte salt and 12345 iterations.
+ ChaCha20 stream cipher with one-time keys.
+ Poly1305 authentication tags.
</p>
<p>Of course, the encryption is optional and can be freely switched on and off from the administration settings panel (the new tab "Encryption").
</p>
<p>Several minor bugs has been fixed in this release as well.
</p>
<p><strong><em>Why encrypted database?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Because the encryption can seriously increase the security and the privacy of the forum database.
</p>
<p>The encryption key in AsmBB is never stored on the disk and only temporary stored in the RAM. That is why even serious security breach on the web server or the backup server, or the backup media will not compromise the database of the forum, the people account attributes or personal data.
</p>
<p>The only known problem of this solution is that the encryption key must be entered on every forum engine restart (through the web interface). This way, on incidental server restarts, the forum will be not accessible for some time. But AsmBB is long living and very stable application so, such issues happen once a several months or even years.
</p>
<p>Of course, using encrypted database makes the use of SSL/TLS mandatory.
</p>
<h2><span><span>📢</span></span> <strong>v2.6</strong>:
</h2>
<p><strong>1. German translation</strong>
</p>
<p>Although the German translation has been available in the v2.5 silent update of the binary pack, v2.6 is the first official version with German translation of the UI.
</p>
<p>Thanks to the community, in v2.6 all other translations are improved as well.
</p>
<p><strong>2. Atom/RSS feed support.</strong>
</p>
<p>The subscribing for themes and some way for push notifications was one of the most required feature.
</p>
<p>In v2.6 these requests has been addressed by support for Atom/RSS feeds.
</p>
<p>Now everyone can subscribe for the whole forum, for particular tag or for particular theme and get notifications when something is changed.
</p>
<p><strong>3. Real-time notifications engine</strong>
</p>
<p>The handling of the server sent events (SSE) has been rewritten from scratch in order to handle all users in a uniform manner.
</p>
<p>While in the earlier versions SSE was used only for the real-time chat, now the SSE service is flexible enough to be used for delivering notifications for many different forum events.
</p>
<p>Such as new posts, other users activities, etc.
</p>
<p>In addition now it serves all clients from a single thread, so arbitrary number of visitors can be served simultaneously with very little load on the server.
</p>
<p>Currently only limited number of notifications are implemented, but as long as the infrastructure is ready and easy expandable, more features can be added later.
</p>
<p><strong>4. Bug fixes and speed improvements.</strong>
</p>
<p>As usual all bugs discovered meanwhile has been fixed. And probably new introduced. But I believe the new bugs are less than the fixed bugs.
</p>
<p>At least, on the demo server, there were no spontaneous crashes or memory leaks detected during the whole period between the releases.
</p>
<p>The new SSE handling service improves the speed of event processing, especially on high and very high loads of the forum.
</p>
<p><strong>5. Updated SQLite and MUSL libraries</strong>
</p>
<p>Of course, the binary package contains the most recent versions of SQLite and MUSL.
</p>
<h2><span><span>📢</span></span> <strong>v2.5</strong>:
</h2>
<p><strong>1. User interface i18n</strong>
</p>
<p>The first major new feature in this release is the internationalization of the engine. Now every user can choose different language for the user interface of the forum. Currently are available 4 languages: English, Bulgarian, Russian and French.
</p>
<p>Notice, that some mistakes in the translations are possible and expected, so please, post your corrections and they will be fixed.
</p>
<p>Great thanks to <a href="https://board.asm32.info/!userinfo/macadoum">macadoum</a> for the French translation.
</p>
<p><strong>2. Second markup language - BBCode</strong>
</p>
<p>A parser for BBCode has been developed and now AsmBB understands two markup languages ( <strong>MiniMag</strong> and <strong>BBCode</strong>).
</p>
<p>In addition BBCode allows creation of scripts for migration from another forum engines, because BBCode is the most popular forum markup language.
</p>
<p><strong>3. Second email send mechanism</strong>
</p>
<p>Now it is possible to use external programs (such as <strong>sendmail</strong>) for sending emails to the forum users. This mechanism makes installation easier in the cases where no email server is installed.
</p>
<p><strong>4. The usual performance improvements and bug fixes.</strong>
</p>
<p>As usual the new release is faster than the previous and all detected bugs has been fixed. Of course, bugs and misbehaviours are still possible, so report them here and they will be fixed quickly.
</p>
<h2><span><span>📢</span></span> <strong>v2.4</strong>:
</h2>
<p>+ Now is possible to attach files to the posts. The <strong>attachments</strong> permissions are managed per user.
+ <strong>"Limited access threads"</strong> were implemented. <strong>LAT</strong> are something like private messages on steroids. The owner of the thread can set some list of users that have access to the thread. The thread is invisible for the other users and can be used for private conversations.
+ Improved <strong>users permissions management</strong>. The users permissions can be edited by the administrator from the user profile. Separate permissions for the not logged-in visitors (anonymous users) were implemented. This way, now is possible to make closed forum, where only the registered users will be able to read the threads. The registration of new users can be closed as well, creating totally private forum closed for the outer world.
+ The <strong>real-time chat service</strong> was refactored in order to serve all connections in single thread. Now almost unlimited number of visitors can chat. Now the chat can be merged with the main forum pages with very minor performance degradation.
+ And of course, the new version is about <strong>20% faster</strong> than the older versions, after the optimizations of the template rendering engine, the scheme of the database and the SQL requests.
+ New <strong>"Terminal" </strong> skin was developed for the lovers of the console user interface.
+ All revealed bugs were fixed.
+ The structure of the source code was changed as well. Now the dependency binary files (musl and sqlite library) are removed from the repository and instead a building script was developed that to download from Internet and build the latest versions of these libraries. This way only the latest versions of these libraries will be released with AsmBB.
</p>
<h2><span><span>📢</span></span> <strong>v2.3</strong>:
</h2>
<p>This is mainly fine-tuning and maintenance release, but two serious bugs have been fixed as well. Here is the change list:
</p>
<p>+ Several serious regressions were fixed.
+ The skins were reworked in order to provide more accessibility. Particularly all background images were replaced with &lt;img&gt; tags with respective "alt" texts. Now even with images switched off, the forum can be used flawlessly.
Some skin design issues have been fixed as well.
+ The JS code for the chat has been cleaned up and accelerated a little.
</p>
<h2><span><span>📢</span></span> <strong>v2.2</strong>:
</h2>
<p>+ <strong>Persistent login</strong> for the users that prefer it. It is off by default.
+ <strong>Reset password</strong> procedure.
+ Implemented "<a href="https://asmbb.org/!categories">Categories</a>" type of navigation, based on the tags system. This way the users can set their own categories.
+ New theme <strong>MoLight</strong> : it is a mobile theme, the same style as Light theme.
+ Administrator debugging tool <a href="https://asmbb.org/!debuginfo">!debuginfo</a>
+ Preserving the post edit/delete history and allows to restore them.
+ Improved the UI of the post editor, included some help texts where needed.
+ Improved JS code for the real time chat.
</p>
<h2><span><span>📢</span></span> <strong>v2.1</strong>:
</h2>
<p>+ Optional persistent login (default: off) for the users don't wanting to login on every visit.
+ "Reset password" - the most questionable new feature, because by its very nature, this is kind of security hole. :) The feature requires valid email and is accessible as a link in the <a href="https://asmbb.org/!login">!login</a> form.
+ "Users list" a not_so_important feature but still useful, all users in one list, accessible on <a href="https://asmbb.org/!userlist">!userlist</a>
+ Chat code updated with many new features: automatic anti-scroll to allow reading the old messages while the people chatting. Notification about missed messages in the tab header allows to follow the conversation without using pop-up notifications. Change of the nickname color, when the user switches to another tab. Speed optimized loading of the old messages on startup/refresh. (yes JS is slow,but still allows some speed optimizations <img src="https://asmbb.org/templates/Tailwind/_images/emoticons/wink.gif" alt=";-)">
</p>
<h2><span><span>📢</span></span> <strong>v2.0</strong>:
</h2>
<p><strong>1. Performance</strong>
</p>
<p>The main AsmBB component, the templates render (`render.asm`) has been replaced by ` render2.asm`. Rewritten from scratch it uses more "assembly style" algorithms. As a result it is faster and uses less memory, compared with the old implementation.
</p>
<p>In addition, all chained string comparisons in the URL parsing logic, has been replaced by hash tables accelerating the common logic of the engine.
</p>
<p>This way the speed of AsmBB was approximately doubled. Now it is much harder to overload the engine and it can handle even more visitors simultaneously.
</p>
<p><strong>2. The code security</strong>
</p>
<p>After serious testing with different web application testing tools (including OWASP ZAP and Tinfoil security) some vulnerabilities has been discovered and fixed.
</p>
<p>The hard fuzzing and near DDOS loads of the above tests, as a side effect, revealed several obscure resource and memory leaks, that has been fixed as well.
</p>
<p>In order to track the leaks easier, was implemented a debugging tool that collects statistics about resources and memory allocations and deallocations and report them on a web page.
</p>
<p>As a result I am pretty confident that v2.0 is clean from memory leaks and SQLite hanging statements. </p>

<div>
<p>It would take too long to expose all of the flaws of peer review, here are some:</p>
<ul>
<li>some work is just flat wrong because the reviewers cannot analyze all of the mathematical results, and because they cannot redo the experiments;</li>
<li>numerous researchers cheat, sometimes in small ways (“2 out of 3 experiments agree with by theory, let us drop the third one”), sometimes in big ways (“I don’t have time to run these experiments, so let me make up some data”);</li>
<li>peer review may <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trouble-Physics-String-Theory-Science/dp/061891868X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1219324200&amp;sr=8-1">perpetuate some biases</a> and prevent researchers from putting into question some fundamental questions (“we decided that this is the right way, if you question it, you are a loony”).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for all its faults, peer review remains essential in science. I want other researchers to read and criticize my work. I enjoy it very much when people try to find flaws in my work. I think that my work is serious enough that when people point out flaws, I am usually aware of them at some level and I can respond easily (and enjoy the process).</p>
<p>The type of peer review I do not enjoy is the country-club approach: 1)&nbsp;does the paper agrees with the goals and views of the reviewers 2)&nbsp;is the paper written by someone we can respect? Fortunately, you can navigate the system and stay away (mostly) from country-club peer review.</p>
<p>But why do I still like peer review despite its obvious flaws? Because I see it as an honor-based system. In such a system, you have to accept that there will be cheaters. A lot of them. And there will lots of mistakes. All we have to do is be open about it. That is, you cannot say “but my work was peer reviewed so you cannot question it!” or “I am very good, look at these prestigious publications!”. <strong>The peer review is there to help the authors. It is not, however, an insurance against fraud or mistakes.</strong> I like peer review because it helps me become better, but I do not use the system to determine how good someone else is.</p>
<p>So, what do we do if we want to know how good someone is? You read his work. You reproduce his experiments. You redo his math. Of course, this scales poorly. If you have to hire someone, you cannot read the work of 50 or 500 candidates. So? I think we have to be realistic. It is hard to know how good someone is. You can get to know 10 or 20 researchers in your life. That is about all.</p>
<p>Hiring processes are flawed. You will hire cheaters. Get over it.</p>

But at present it’s only being used to send and receive text (SMS) messages.<span id="more-36835"></span></p>
<p>The operator’s network currently has around <strong>5,311 LEO satellites</strong> in orbit around the Earth (altitude of c. 500km+) and they have approval to add roughly 7,500 more by the end of 2027. Customers in the UK pay from £75 a month, plus £449 for the home kit (standard dish, router etc.) and £20 for shipping on the ‘Standard’ package, which promises fast internet latency times of 25-50ms, downloads of c. 25-100Mbps and uploads of c. 5-10Mbps.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/link/starlink" target="_blank" rel="" title="Starlink Satellite Broadband">Starlink</a>’s network current has 2.3 million customers across the world and just 42,000 of those are in the UK (up from 13,000 last year) – mostly in rural areas.</p>
<p>However, since 2022 (<a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2022/08/starlinks-leo-satellites-to-deliver-4g-and-5g-mobile-from-space.html">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2022/12/starlink-details-data-speed-of-its-space-based-4g-mobile-network.html">here</a>) the company has also been busy working to add <a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/link/4g" target="_blank" rel="" title="4g" data-chref="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/broadband_mobile.php">4G</a> mobile capability to their mega constellation of global satellites, which will make it possible to setup global roaming style communications with regular unmodified Smartphones on the ground. In the past, most <a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/link/satellite" target="_blank" rel="" title="satellite" data-chref="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/broadband_satellite.php">satellite</a>-based phone services were fairly basic and required bespoke and expensive handsets to function.</p>

<p>Satellites with Starlink’s new DtC capability instead have an advanced <strong>eNodeB</strong> modem onboard that acts like a cell phone tower in space, allowing network integration similar to a standard roaming partner. According to the latest update from Starlink, the first live technical test of this new capability officially took place alongside partner T-Mobile (using some of their radio spectrum frequency) in the USA on Monday 8th January 2024.</p>
<p>The test itself involved the sending and receiving of several text (SMS) messages, which were relayed between an unspecified Smartphone on the ground and their new DtC capable satellites in space.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Starlink Statement</strong></p>
<p>On Monday, January 8, the Starlink team successfully sent and received our first text messages using T-Mobile network spectrum through one of our new Direct to Cell satellites launched six days prior. Connecting cell phones to satellites has several major challenges to overcome.</p>
<p>For example, in terrestrial networks cell towers are stationary, but in a <a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/link/satellite" target="_blank" rel="" title="satellite" data-chref="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/broadband_satellite.php">satellite</a> network they move at tens of thousands of miles per hour relative to users on Earth. This requires seamless handoffs between satellites and accommodations for factors like Doppler shift and timing delays that challenge phone to space communications.</p>
<p>Cell phones are also incredibly difficult to connect to satellites hundreds of kilometers away, given a mobile phone’s low antenna gain and transmit power. Starlink satellites with the Direct to Cell payload are equipped with innovative new custom silicon, phased array antennas, and advanced software algorithms that overcome these challenges and provide standard LTE service to cell phones on the ground.</p></blockquote>
<p>SpaceX aims to launch a constellation of hundreds of DtC capable satellites to enable the launch of their basic text (SMS) service in 2024, with support for voice, data (mobile broadband), and Internet of Things (IoT) services due to follow in 2025 (although it wouldn’t surprise us if this slipped a little).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/wp-content/gallery/2023-article-illustrations/starlink-diagram-v2-direct-to-cell.png" alt="starlink-diagram-v2-direct-to-cell"></p>

<p>At present Starlink doesn’t have any mobile operators as partners in the UK, but the list of supporting operators has been slowly growing since the service was first announced. However, we still don’t know how much it will cost to add this kind of global roaming to an existing plan, which will need to be competitive with traditional roaming services if it’s to have any mass market appeal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <strong>Elon Musk</strong> recently cautioned (<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1742396904619581642" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) that the first DtC capable Starlinks can only support data speeds of “<span><em>~7Mb per beam and the beams are very big, so while this is a great solution for locations with no cellular connectivity, it is not meaningfully competitive with existing terrestrial cellular networks</em>.</span>”</p>
<p>Related <a href="https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1600596763030786066" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documents</a> released last year revealed that the Direct to Cell system will be able to provide “<em>theoretical peak speeds of up to either</em>” 3Mbps or 7.2Mbps peak upload (Earth-to-Space) over 1.4MHz or 5MHz bandwidth channels per beam, respectively, and up to either 4.4Mbps or 18.3Mbps on the downlink (Space-to-Earth) over the same bandwidth channels per beam using LTE (<a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/link/4g" target="_blank" rel="" title="4g" data-chref="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/broadband_mobile.php">4G</a>) technology.</p>
<p>In short, this is all about meeting basic communication needs across the globe and in remote areas.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>So called <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/17/companies-new-return-to-office-strategy-glassdoor/" target="_self" rel="">return-to-office (RTO) mandates</a> haven’t—by and large—moved the needle on actual in-person work rates, despite the widespread hemming and hawing. Office occupancy rates in major metro areas, per building security firm Kastle Systems’ weekly tracker, have held mostly steady at just shy of 50% since vaccines were made widely available.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://fortune.com/2023/12/26/return-to-office-mandates-no-productivity-impact-experts-predict/" target="_self" rel="">Productivity hasn’t changed</a>, either. As evidenced by the threat of a recession, the <a href="https://fortune.com/longform/layoffs-2023-bad-management/" target="_self" rel="">spate of layoffs</a>, and the generally wary <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/09/how-many-businesses-bankrupt-covid-pandemic-2020-2023-global-financial-crisis/" target="_self" rel="">economic outlook</a> over the past year, in-person work for most white collar jobs <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/14/remote-work-productivity-goldman-sachs-nyu-total-factor-thomas-philippon/" target="_self" rel="">doesn’t always make workers more productive</a>—which, after all, is what one would think should be the north star of any major business decision.</p>



<p>Yet, that’s long been the motive behind the return to office. CEOs of companies like <a href="https://fortune.com/company/clorox/" target="_blank" rel="">Clorox</a> and Shake Shack <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/08/09/ceos-say-remote-work-hurting-businesses/" target="_self" rel="">have said</a> that bringing people back to the office is integral to their firms’ post-pandemic recovery. And many others aren’t giving up, despite Kastle’s evidence; 64% of CEOs said they <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/16/office-return-rto-ceos-hybrid-remote-work-5-days/" target="_self" rel="">expect a full office return</a> by 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It may all be for naught. A new <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4675401" target="_self" rel="">working paper</a> by Mark (Shuai) Ma, an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh, and Yuye Ding, a PhD student at its Katz Graduate School of Business, found that an office return isn’t actually boosting a company’s bottom line. What’s more: Many bosses simply carried out mandates in an effort to regain control over an employee base they could no longer see—or, as it were, trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>When the going gets rough, blame the worker</strong></h2>



<p>The paper, which is under peer review, empirically examines what determines an S&amp;P 500 firm’s decision to mandate a return to office and what the consequences are—and aren’t. The researchers assembled their report by manually collecting RTO mandate data from over 100 firms, and then working backwards to assess what underpinned the decision. They first looked at why some firms wanted to impose mandates and others didn’t, Ma tells <em>Fortune.</em> “We were able to see three foundations: What managers say, what employees say, and what experts say.”</p>



<p>What managers say, Ma explains, is usually the farthest off the mark. Tthe sentiment he’s gathered is that bosses want employees where they can see them because they’re not performing well at home, which in turn hurts firm performance. It’s a thin argument, Ma says, and his research proves no link between work location and firm financial results.</p>



<p>Then there’s employee sentiment, which is often at odds. “Many [workers] say an RTO mandate is about control, not performance,” Ma says. They see their managers as being used to a traditional workplace in which they can see their orders being carried out, and losing that has made them uneasy, and quick to place blame.</p>



<p>The experts, naturally, fall somewhere in the middle, advocating for a <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/14/flexible-work-feminist-women-return-office-power-men-careers-erin-grau/" target="_self" rel="">flexible arrangement</a> that is mostly determined by individual workers and teams. Additionally, experts prioritize meaningful in-office work—gathering with colleagues for collaboration, team bonding, and ideating, not just because it’s how things used to be done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ma concludes that performance and shareholder value isn’t the real overarching intent of an RTO mandate, despite many managers suggesting it is. Not only did the researchers find that RTO mandates fail to significantly change financial performance or stock value, it does little more than rankle employees and tank their satisfaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, he believes that the mandates are more a means in which managers reassert control over their employees, who they then go on to blame if they fall below shareholder expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Overall, our results do not support the argument that managers impose these mandates to increase firm values,” he wrote. “Instead, these findings are consistent with managers using RTO mandates to reassert control over employees and blame employees as a scapegoat for bad firm performance.”</p>



<p>As PR executive Ed Zitron wrote in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/return-to-office-mandates-employees-managers-fight-messy-remote-work-2023-11?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_self" rel=""><em>Business Insider</em></a><em> </em>in November—and Ma quoted in the report—RTO mandates are little more than an attempt to convince investors that decreased revenue and profitability “aren’t a result of poor managerial decisions but the result of lazy workers sitting at home in their pajamas.” Zitron calls it “a genius move” on executives’ part, because it lets them “establish control over workers during an unprecedented societal awareness of labor rights…while also shifting the blame and consequences of poor stock performance onto those least responsible.”</p>



<p>But if the managers were actually viewing RTO mandates solely as a method to improve firm value or performance, such mandates would look different. They’d “be higher among managers with a stronger incentive to maximize firm value—owners, those with more stock or ownership of their firm, whose interest is more aligned with firm interest,” Ma says.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>The futility of forcing</strong></h2>



<p>Over the long term, Ma tells <em>Fortune, </em>mandates of any kind stand to undercut each of the goals managers say they’re meant to accomplish in the first place. “People will leave their jobs, and it’s never been easier for people to find other jobs that <em>do</em> let them work flexibly,” Ma says. “But we don’t have a long enough window to see long-term consequences.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ma supports a <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/10/neiman-marcus-return-to-office-policy-magnet-not-mandate/" target="_self" rel="">“magnet, not a mandate”</a> approach to work arrangements for companies who want some form of balance. That approach encourages workers to go back to an open, flexible workplace without forcing their hand. As for the many remote workers who insist they’re better off staying put, “there’s no reason to force them back.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He’s also quick to call into question data showing <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/07/06/remote-workers-less-productive-wfh-research/" target="_self" rel="">slightly elevated productivity levels</a> among in-person workers. “Even if some employees were more productive in the office before the pandemic, that doesn’t necessarily mean they would become more productive when they return to office after the pandemic,” he wrote. “This is because they are more likely to react negatively to being forced to work in the office after enjoying the benefits of WFH.”</p>



<p>In other words, there’s no putting the toothpaste back in the tube. If firm performance is down, managers will just have to find someone else to blame.</p></div><p>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get the CEO perspective on the biggest headlines in business. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=ceo_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</p></div>]]></description>

And that’s in part because the firm has immense market power. "Obviously it's a human tragedy,” said one guest on CNBC this week, “but from a financial impact, I like the long-term story [on Boeing] because it's a duopoly."</span></p><p>The airlines, who are the main customers of the aircraft maker, have nowhere else to go, because its main rival, Airbus, can’t deliver on new orders to replace Boeing jets, at least not for years.

If you want the ugly details, there have been several good books written on Boeing, the most popular being </span><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/646497/flying-blind-by-peter-robison/" rel="">Flying Blind</a><span> by Peter Robison. But I found this note from an aerospace engineer written 21 years ago, titled </span><a href="https://www.airliners.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=213075" rel="">‘The Downfall of a Great American Airplane Company - An Insider's Perspective‘</a><span>, quite compelling, since the author accurately predicted what was to come.</span></p><p>The problems at the aerospace giant derive from its disastrous merger with McDonnell Douglas, in which Boeing was the acquirer, but somehow the finance-obsessed beancounter executives who had run McDonnell Douglas into the ground ended up taking over the combined company. I’ve been going over Glassdoor employee reviews of Boeing, and reading Reddit message boards, and one consensus seems to be that, like a lot of monopolies focused purely on shareholder returns, it’s a highly bureaucratic place where it can be difficult to get anything useful done. And while there are new competitors in certain areas, like SpaceX and Amazon, in terms of civilian aircraft, Boeing is dominant if you are an aerospace engineer in the U.S.</p><p>At a certain level of size, strategic importance, and market power, a corporation gets an implied backstop by the state, which becomes obvious during moments of turmoil. Boeing, as a monopoly aerospace maker, certainly fits the bill. Just as nobody is an atheist in a foxhole, no large firm is in the private sector during a financial crisis. For instance, just as the Covid crisis hit, it wasn’t merely banks and airlines that sought a backstop; Boeing sought tens of billions in government money to keep the aerospace industry afloat. </p><p>Such a bailout made sense; Boeing is America’s number one exporter, its third biggest defense contractor, and a core infrastructure provider to our air system. American society simply doesn’t function without aerospace capacity, and hasn’t since the 1930s. During Covid, it would have been foolish to let Boeing fall apart over a fake religious belief that aerospace firms can pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. Since the creation of the industry, we subsidized aerospace, at first from the post office, the Army, and the Smithsonian institute, later through a whole host of programs. </p><p><span>In the </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-116publ136/pdf/PLAW-116publ136.pdf" rel="">CARES Act</a><span>, which was the bill passed during the height of the Covid crisis to provide economic support during the pandemic, there was a provision to offer $17 billion of loans and loan guarantees for “businesses critical to maintaining national security.”</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dae8d18-fab2-4cbe-b933-1295e3117e39_467x80.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dae8d18-fab2-4cbe-b933-1295e3117e39_467x80.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dae8d18-fab2-4cbe-b933-1295e3117e39_467x80.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dae8d18-fab2-4cbe-b933-1295e3117e39_467x80.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dae8d18-fab2-4cbe-b933-1295e3117e39_467x80.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dae8d18-fab2-4cbe-b933-1295e3117e39_467x80.png" width="467" height="80" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4dae8d18-fab2-4cbe-b933-1295e3117e39_467x80.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:80,&quot;width&quot;:467,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:20344,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dae8d18-fab2-4cbe-b933-1295e3117e39_467x80.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dae8d18-fab2-4cbe-b933-1295e3117e39_467x80.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dae8d18-fab2-4cbe-b933-1295e3117e39_467x80.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dae8d18-fab2-4cbe-b933-1295e3117e39_467x80.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>What was this mysterious business?

CEO David Calhoun did this under the pretense that the firm is in the private sector, but every bondholder understood that the Federal government was backstopping the borrowing. </span></p><p>There’s a lot more. In its 2022 annual report, Boeing reported that 40% of revenue comes from the U.S. government directly. And even ‘private sector’ revenue is heavily influenced by the state. The State Department encourages foreign airlines to buy Boeing aircraft and the U.S. government allows or disallows Boeing from selling weapons to foreign militaries.</p><p><span>The U.S. government even dictates corporate strategy, for good or for ill. In the 1930s, Congress via the Air Mail Act of 1934, broke up aerospace holding companies, turning a corporation called United Aircraft and Transport Corporation it into three separate firms - Boeing, United Airlines, and United Technologies. In the late 1990s, when the Federal government decided monopolies were good, it was </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/18/business/clinton-warns-europeans-of-trade-complaint-on-boeing-deal.html" rel="">the White House</a><span> pushing hard for Boeing to acquire its main rival, McDonnell Douglas, with the government even threatening the Europeans if they intervened with a WTO complaint and sanctions.</span></p><p>There’s a very nebulous line between state officials and Boeing. Boeing sends a lot of staff into government, but the firm itself has multiple ex-high level political officials on its board, from the former chief of Naval operations John M. Richardson to the Former Inspector General of the U.S. Air Force Stayce D. Harris. Its three most political officials left in the years after the Max fiasco, but it’s still worth naming them because it reflects the firm’s political strategy. These were former Bush cabinet member Susan Schwab, former Trump cabinet member Nikki Haley, and former diplomat and Presidential daughter Caroline Kennedy. </p><p><span>And obviously, there’s politics. Bill Clinton structured Boeing’s monopoly in the 1990s, but the Republican Party protected Boeing during the 737 Max fiasco in 2019. Top corporate executives knew the plane would kill people, but went ahead selling it anyway. The Trump administration, prompted by former conservative judge turned Boeing general counsel Michael Luttig and his network of proteges, let Boeing off the hook on </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/boeing-charged-737-max-fraud-conspiracy-and-agrees-pay-over-25-billion" rel="">its very last day in office</a><span> with what’s called a deferred prosecution agreement.</span></p><p>During this 2024 fiasco, the government has responded a bit better. The Federal Aviation Administration, to its credit, immediately grounded the planes and launched an investigation. And while this is a good move, it is no longer obvious where Boeing starts and regulators begin. Here’s a case in point.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3719f890-6865-46d6-bc8d-6f52c72f10b3_788x501.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3719f890-6865-46d6-bc8d-6f52c72f10b3_788x501.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3719f890-6865-46d6-bc8d-6f52c72f10b3_788x501.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3719f890-6865-46d6-bc8d-6f52c72f10b3_788x501.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3719f890-6865-46d6-bc8d-6f52c72f10b3_788x501.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3719f890-6865-46d6-bc8d-6f52c72f10b3_788x501.png" width="788" height="501" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3719f890-6865-46d6-bc8d-6f52c72f10b3_788x501.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:501,&quot;width&quot;:788,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3719f890-6865-46d6-bc8d-6f52c72f10b3_788x501.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3719f890-6865-46d6-bc8d-6f52c72f10b3_788x501.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3719f890-6865-46d6-bc8d-6f52c72f10b3_788x501.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3719f890-6865-46d6-bc8d-6f52c72f10b3_788x501.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Now, of course, in a sense, Boeing isn’t formally state-owned, unlike Airbus, which has the French government as a shareholder. Boeing’s shareholders are private entities, and its executives aren’t civil servants. But just as we all informally acknowledge that banks like Wells Fargo and JP Morgan are state-backed, that’s the case with Boeing as well. In other words, Boeing is a state-backed national champion, constructed by the state, financed by the state, protected by the state, and with much of its revenue supplied by the state. It may be the case that Boeing executives have more power over government than the other way around, but that’s just a different way of saying the same thing. There’s a fused public-private entity here, the question is just who is the decision-maker.</p><p><span>The fairy tale of a private firm is only hindering a fix to this once-great organization. Since the combination with McDonnell Douglas, Boeing has been run by Jack Welch-proteges who tend to resign in clouds of scandal. CEO Dennis A. Muilenburg lost his job after the 737 Max disaster in 2020, but CEO Phil Condit, resigned in 2003 over a </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/business-july-dec03-boeing_12-01" rel="">controversy</a><span> involving bribery and military refueling tankers. The board is incapable of addressing the engineering crisis in the company; there is just one board member with any aerospace design experience, the rest are accountants and CEOs of various large firms like Aetna, Amgen, Duke Energy, and so forth, as well as a few ex-military leaders.</span></p><p>All of which is to say that it’s time to acknowledge this situation and have the government step in directly and reorganize the firm, as it would during a war or in a bankruptcy. The Federal government has in the past nationalized railroads, the telephone company, various aerospace producers, and electric utilities, and it wouldn’t be uncommon throughout most of American history for it to step in here. </p><p><span>Legally, the simplest way would be to have Congress act. It could do it directly by restoring and updating deleted provisions of the Defense Production Act that used to allow the President to seize assets in a national security emergency. Another legal hook that wouldn’t require Congress would be reopening </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/boeing-charged-737-max-fraud-conspiracy-and-agrees-pay-over-25-billion" rel="">the deferred prosecution agreement</a><span> from the original Max disaster, which required that Boeing stop committing fraud. The FAA is investigating this latest fiasco, it’s hard to imagine there isn’t criminal behavior or lies to the government. But that’s not the only legal lever. 40% of Boeing’s revenue is coming from the government, mostly the Defense Department, so the Pentagon could declare that the firm is not a ‘</span><a href="https://www.dau.edu/acquipedia-article/responsibility-determination#:~:text=Before%20the%20contracting%20officer%20can,complete%20the%20contract%20in%20question." rel="">responsible</a><span>’ contractor, and lacks the wherewithal to responsibly perform work for the government. The DOD could demand that the board resign, and offer a caretaker set of board members, mostly engineers, who would reorganize the company. </span></p><p>What could such a reorganization look like? I can’t offer many details in a paragraph, but conceptually the goal would be to jumpstart competition across multiple lines of business and return to the pre-duopoly era. Globally, there’s more than enough business for several aerospace firms, Boeing alone has more than $350 billion in backlogged orders. So you’d start with simplifying the firm and fostering competition. Splitting it up into several defense side firms and several civilian aircraft firms makes sense, with each subsidiary having access to the combined intellectual property of the original Boeing. The plant would also have to be divided up, and sole source supplier contracts abrogated. After a few years, airlines, the Pentagon, and suppliers would no longer be locked into Boeing, but could choose among multiple Boeing successor firms.</p><p>While it’s generally depressing to look at a firm like Boeing and consider what to do, there’s a tremendous opportunity to rebuild our aerospace capacity if handled properly. There are a lot of engineers with deep expertise willing to get their hands dirty to save this firm, as well as immense possible innovation with new materials and technologies outside of Boeing. And rich people like investing in airplanes, and will do so if they think there’s a market opportunity.</p><p><span>Indeed, there is an adjacent industry where competition has driven immense accomplishment. One of the most exciting industrial areas right now is space, where SpaceX has challenged the incumbents, which include Boeing. There’s a lot of competition in satellites and launch, as well as space technology, driven by the government </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/space-launch-costs-growing-business-industry-rcna23488" rel="">policy</a><span> to allow new competitors into a market. Launch costs are down, and smaller and cheaper components are allowing the construction of different kinds of satellites and spacecraft that will foster a potentially trillion dollar industry.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420a527e-fd6d-4310-991f-aeb598d8aa24_821x259.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420a527e-fd6d-4310-991f-aeb598d8aa24_821x259.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420a527e-fd6d-4310-991f-aeb598d8aa24_821x259.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420a527e-fd6d-4310-991f-aeb598d8aa24_821x259.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420a527e-fd6d-4310-991f-aeb598d8aa24_821x259.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420a527e-fd6d-4310-991f-aeb598d8aa24_821x259.png" width="821" height="259" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/420a527e-fd6d-4310-991f-aeb598d8aa24_821x259.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:259,&quot;width&quot;:821,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:62860,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420a527e-fd6d-4310-991f-aeb598d8aa24_821x259.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420a527e-fd6d-4310-991f-aeb598d8aa24_821x259.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420a527e-fd6d-4310-991f-aeb598d8aa24_821x259.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420a527e-fd6d-4310-991f-aeb598d8aa24_821x259.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>There’s no reason why, handled properly, in ten years, the 737 Max disaster can’t be a textbook lesson on how to restore an industrial sector using competition policy.

<p>Containerization has become an essential tool for developers and system
operators to package and deploy applications on various systems and platforms
efficiently. Many containerization solutions exist today, but without a doubt,
Docker has emerged as the de facto standard. This is largely due to its
excellent tooling, strong community, and vast ecosystem of pre-built images that
can be easily shared and used across different environments.</p><p>Docker has held this position for many years, and it has truly revolutionized
how applications are shipped. At the same time, its wide adoption inspired the
development of many other containerization solutions offering even more features
and capabilities. One such solution is <a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://podman.io/">Podman<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>.</p><p>Podman is an open-source container engine that aims to provide a more secure and
lightweight alternative to Docker. It allows users to run containers without
requiring a daemon, making it easier to manage and deploy containers on a
variety of systems. Additionally, Podman offers better security defaults through
features such as rootless containers (i.e., running containers through non-root
users), user namespaces, and a more careful utilization of kernel capabilities,
all of which can protect the host system from potential vulnerabilities and
security threats.</p><p>With its growing community and close compatibility with Docker images and
commands, Podman has gained significant traction among developers and system
administrators looking for alternative containerization solutions.</p><p>In this article, we'll explore some of the key features and benefits of using
Podman as a containerization tool. We'll also discuss how it compares to Docker
and see why it has become a popular alternative choice in the industry.</p><p>Let's dive right in.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before proceeding with this article, ensure that you meet the following
prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Linux command-line skills.</li>
<li>Prior experience with Docker.</li>
<li>(Optional) A Docker Hub account to follow the private registry setup examples.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="podman-vs-docker-comparison">Podman vs Docker Comparison</h2>
<p>While both Podman and Docker allow users to run, manage, and deploy containers
in an efficient and scalable manner, there are some key differences between the
two. In this section, we will explore several of these differences:</p>
<h3 id="1-architecture-differences">1. Architecture differences</h3>
<p>One of the main differences between Podman and Docker lies in their
architecture. While Docker relies on a client-server model, Podman employs a
daemonless architecture. With Podman's approach, users manage containers
directly, eliminating the need for a continuous daemon process in the
background. This direct management often results in Podman containers launching
significantly faster, sometimes up to 50% quicker than Docker, depending on the
image used.</p><p>This architecture also enhances security. In Docker, initiating a container
means sending a request to the Docker daemon via the Docker client which
subsequently launches the container, which means that the container processes
are children of the Docker daemon, not the user session:</p>
<p>As a result, any significant event coming from a container process that's picked
up by the Linux Audit system (<code>auditd</code>) specifies its audit user ID as <code>unset</code>
rather than the actual ID of the user who started the respective container in
the first place. This makes it extremely difficult to link malicious activity to
a specific user and taints the security of the system.</p>
<p>With Podman, since each container is instantiated directly through a user login
session, the container process data retains this information and <code>auditd</code> can
accurately detect and list the ID of each user who started a specific container
process, maintaining a clear audit trail.</p>
<h3 id="2-container-lifecycle-management">2. Container lifecycle management</h3>
<p>The absence of a daemon in Podman leads to a distinct approach to managing
container lifecycles compared to Docker. On Linux, Podman relies extensively on
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://systemd.io/">Systemd<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a> for this purpose. For instance, to correctly
enforce restart policies for containers using the <code>--restart always</code> flag,
Podman relies on a <code>systemd</code> service called <code>podman-restart</code>. This service
automatically restarts all designated containers after each system reboot.</p><p>Moreover, Podman exposes a handy command for generating Systemd service files
from running containers. This allows you to bring your containers under
<code>systemd</code> management to start, stop, and inspect the various services running
inside of them more easily. In contrast, Docker handles all these tasks
internally through the daemon itself.</p>
<h3 id="3-container-orchestration">3. Container orchestration</h3>
<p>When developing locally, Docker users normally reach for
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a> to define and manage
multi-container applications more easily. While Podman doesn't support Compose
files out of the box, it provides a compatible alternative called
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/containers/podman-compose">Podman Compose<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>, which typically
works seamlessly with existing <code>docker-compose.yml</code> files. For a native
experience, you may also use pods, a concept that Podman borrows from
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a> and allows users to manage a group of
containers as one uniform unit.</p><p>When it comes to production deployment, Podman lacks a tool like
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">Docker Swarm<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a> for orchestrating
multi-container application workloads. The best possible alternative in such
cases is to use an external orchestration system such as Kubernetes, which
offers similar features and integrates well with Podman, although it may require
some additional configuration and setup to ensure that everything works
correctly.</p>
<h3 id="4-security-considerations">4. Security considerations</h3>
<p>Containers aim to isolate applications from the host system securely, minimizing
compatibility issues and enhancing security. A primary security concern is the
risk of container breakout, where an attacker could compromise the host system.
To mitigate such risks, running containers with minimal privileges is essential.</p><p>Podman is designed to help with this by providing stronger default security
settings compared to Docker. Features like
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/">rootless containers<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>,
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/">user namespaces<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>, and
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/">seccomp profiles<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>, while
available in Docker, aren't enabled by default and often require extra setup.</p><p>Podman's default setup includes rootless containers running in isolated user
namespaces, limiting the impact of any potential breakout. In contrast, Docker's
default setting runs container processes as <code>root</code>, posing a higher risk in case
of a breakout.</p><p>Moreover, Podman containers, tied to user sessions, allow audit systems to trace
malicious activities back to specific users, unlike Docker, where tracing to a
user is challenging due to the system-wide daemon.</p><p>Podman and Docker use Linux kernel capabilities and seccomp profiles to control
process permissions. By default, Podman launches containers with a narrower set

<p>With all of this clarified, let's go ahead and install Podman locally.</p>
<h2 id="installing-podman">Installing Podman</h2>
<p>Like Docker, Podman can run without a problem on all popular operating systems.
This includes macOS and Windows, as well as all major Linux distributions. The
only significant difference to note is that while Podman can run natively on
Linux, it requires a virtual machine to work on Windows and macOS. This adds a
few extra steps to the installation process on these systems, but other than
that, the core functionality remains the same.</p><p>This tutorial assumes that you are using a Debian-based Linux distribution such
as Ubuntu, Mint, or Debian itself. The installation process for other operating
systems is very similar and can be applied by referring to the official
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://podman.io/docs/installation">Podman installation instructions<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>.</p><p>Make sure that you are using a relatively recent version of your preferred
distribution, as PPA repositories on older versions may not have the latest
Podman available for installation. For instance, at the time of this writing,
the latest major version of Podman is <code>4.x</code>, yet the most recent LTS version of
Ubuntu
(<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-release-notes/24668">Ubuntu 22.04 LTS<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>)
locks you in to Podman <code>3.x</code>. Therefore, this tutorial is based on a newer
non-LTS version
(<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/mantic-minotaur-release-notes/35534">Ubuntu 23.10<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>).</p><p>Start by downloading the latest information from all configured upstream package
sources:</p>

<p>Then run the following command to install Podman:</p>

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This output shows something important. Even though the "Hello World!" image was
built with tools from the Docker ecosystem, Podman was still able to run the
container.</p><p>That's because both Docker and Podman follow the OCI
(<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://opencontainers.org/">Open Container Initiative<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>) standards. The OCI
defines an

enabling different container runtimes, such as Podman and Docker, to
interoperate.</p><p>As a result, Podman can seamlessly work with most Docker images and containers.
This compatibility allows you to migrate your existing workloads to Podman
easily without having to make any modifications and also to leverage the vast
library of Docker images available on Docker Hub.</p><p>Let's further break down the output from the command above. The first line says:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Resolved "hello-world" as an alias (/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/shortnames.conf)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This message indicates that Podman referenced a configuration file to obtain the
fully qualified name of the <code>hello-world</code> image. Unlike Docker, Podman
recommends against using short names to refer to images and does not default to
a specific registry, unless explicitly instructed to do so via its configuration
files. Docker, on the other hand, always uses Docker Hub (<code>docker.io</code>) as its
default registry and tries to locate every image there when a fully qualified
name is not explicitly provided.</p><p>You can further inspect the <code>shortnames.conf</code> file and confirm that the
<code>hello-world</code> alias maps to the image <code>docker.io/library/hello-world</code>:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>grep hello-world /etc/containers/registries.conf.d/shortnames.conf
</code></pre>
</div>

<div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>"hello-world" = "docker.io/library/hello-world"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The next few lines say:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Trying to pull docker.io/library/hello-world:latest...
Getting image source signatures
Copying blob 719385e32844 done
Copying config 9c7a54a9a4 done
Writing manifest to image destination
Storing signatures
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>These messages indicate that the latest version of the <code>hello-world</code> image was
successfully downloaded to your local machine.</p><p>You can verify this by issuing:</p>

<div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>REPOSITORY                     TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The remaining output (the "Hello from Docker!" message and all subsequent lines)
display a message that's hard-coded into the
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/docker-library/hello-world/blob/master/hello.c">hello<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>
binary that ships with the <code>hello-world</code> image. This message could be a little
misleading as it suggests that the Docker engine executed the container when, in
reality, Podman did. It's important to understand that neither the Docker client
nor the Docker daemon were in any way involved in the process.</p><p>Before you move on further, remove the <code>hello-world</code> image, as it's no longer
needed:</p>

<p>The output indicates that the image was removed, displaying its tag and ID for
reference:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Untagged: docker.io/library/hello-world:latest

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Next, let's examine what happens when you attempt to run an arbitrary image
using only its short name.</p>
<h2 id="using-short-image-names">Using short image names</h2>
<p>As we discussed previously, Podman suggests using fully-qualified names for
container images to avoid ambiguity and ensure that the correct image is always
referenced from a specific registry.</p><p>Let's try running a container using the
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy">official Caddy image<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a> from Docker Hub. If
you're unfamiliar with <a rel="" target="" href="https://betterstack.com/community/guides/web-servers/caddy/">Caddy</a>, it's a lightweight web server and reverse
proxy known for its ease of use and fantastic performance. By running Caddy as a
container, you can quickly spin up a local web server for testing purposes.</p><p>Coming from a Docker background, you would typically use the following command
to start the container:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>docker run --rm -p 8080:80 caddy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This translates to the following command in Podman:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman run --rm -p 8080:80 caddy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Most of the time, transitioning from Docker to Podman is a matter of changing
<code>docker</code> to <code>podman</code> in your command. In fact, many users add
<code>alias docker=podman</code> to their shell config files and use Podman as an alias for
<code>docker</code> commands.</p><p>The flags are also identical:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--rm</code> specifies that the container should be automatically removed after it
exits, so it doesn't clutter up your system.</li>
<li><code>-p 8080:80</code> specifies that port <code>8080</code> on the host machine should map to port
<code>80</code> in the container, so that you can access the web server running inside
the container by typing <code>localhost:8080</code> in your browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try running the command. If everything goes well, a container should launch,
allowing you to open <code>localhost:8080</code> in a browser to see the built-in Caddy
test page.</p><p>Contrary to what you might anticipate, the command fails and returns the
following error:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Error: short-name "caddy" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in "/etc/containers/registries.conf"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The command didn't work because Podman couldn't understand where to pull the
<code>caddy</code> image from.</p><p>It first looked up <code>shortnames.conf</code> for an alias named <code>caddy</code> but could not
find one. Try a <code>grep</code> on <code>shortnames.conf</code>, and you will see that it returns no
matches indeed:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>grep caddy /etc/containers/registries.conf.d/shortnames.conf
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It then looked up the <code>registries.conf</code> file for a list of so-called unqualified
search registries. An unqualified search registry is the one that Podman tries
to contact whenever a non-fully qualified image name is supplied with the <code>run</code>
command.</p><p>There are three possible solutions to the issue that you encountered. Let's
explore all of them:</p>
<h3 id="1-specifying-a-fully-qualified-name">1. Specifying a fully-qualified name</h3>
<p>You can specify the fully-qualified name:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman run --rm -p 8080:80 docker.io/library/caddy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This works! However, coming from a Docker background, you may find using short
names more ergonomic, because this is the workflow that you're used to. This is
absolutely possible with Podman, using either aliases or unqualified search
registries which we'll explore below.</p>
<h3 id="2-defining-an-alias">2. Defining an alias</h3>
<p>You may decide to define an alias for <code>caddy</code> instead. When doing so, keep in
mind that the <code>/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/shortnames.conf</code> file is not
meant to be modified directly, as it is shipped as part of the
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/containers/shortnames">shortnames project<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>. The correct way
to define a new alias is by adding an <code>[aliases]</code> section to your
<code>registries.conf</code> file like this:</p><div data-controller="clipboard">
  <div>
    <p><span>/etc/containers/registries.conf</span></p>
    
    <p>
  <span>Copied!</span>
</p>

  </div>
  <div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="code">
  <pre><code>[aliases]
"caddy"="docker.io/caddy"
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>The default registry configuration for Podman is located at
<code>/etc/containers/registries.conf</code>, but modifying this file requires root
privileges. This slightly defeats the idea of rootless access that Podman aims
to support. However, Podman offers a mechanism to overcome this limitation. You
can put your configuration into <code>$HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf</code>, and
it will take precedence over <code>/etc/containers/registries.conf</code>. This requires no
root privileges.</p><p>Go ahead and create the <code>$HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf</code> file on your
system:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>mkdir -p $HOME/.config/containers &amp;&amp; touch $HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then add the following line to your file:</p><div data-controller="clipboard">
  <div>
    <p><span>~/.config/containers/registries.conf</span></p>
    
    <p>
  <span>Copied!</span>
</p>

  </div>
  <div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="code">
  <pre><code>[aliases]
"caddy"="docker.io/caddy"
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now re-run:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman run --rm -p 8080:80 caddy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You will see the following output indicating that the solution works:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Resolved "caddy" as an alias (/home/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/.config/containers/registries.conf)
Trying to pull docker.io/library/caddy:latest...
...
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>While this solution works, adding aliases for every image that you plan on using
will be tedious and time-consuming in the long run. This leads us to the third
possible solution—configuring an unqualified search registry.</p><p>Before you do that, revert the changes that you did so far so you can start with
a clean state.</p><p>Hit <code>Ctrl+C</code> to terminate the Caddy container and return to your terminal. Then
remove the <code>[aliases]</code> configuration from the <code>registries.conf</code> file by
truncating the entire file:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>echo &gt; $HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Remove the <code>caddy</code> image that Podman just downloaded:</p>

<p>As expected, the output shows the tag and ID of the image that was removed:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Untagged: docker.io/library/caddy:latest
Deleted: 70c3913f54e294079c54cc8b651576b08dd4add42a0f4c0bc93d539913ae335d
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You are now ready to define an unqualified search registry.</p>
<h3 id="3-defining-an-unqualified-search-registry">3. Defining an unqualified search registry</h3>
<p>Open your <code>$HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf</code> file and paste the
following contents:</p><div data-controller="clipboard">
  <div>
    <p><span>~/.config/containers/registries.conf</span></p>
    
    <p>
  <span>Copied!</span>
</p>

  </div>
  <div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="code">
  <pre><code>unqualified-search-registries=["docker.io"]
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now re-run:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman run --rm -p 8080:80 caddy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You will see the following output:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Resolving "caddy" using unqualified-search registries (/home/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/.config/containers/registries.conf)
Trying to pull docker.io/library/caddy:latest
...
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code>caddy</code> image was successfully downloaded, a container was launched, and
Caddy is now ready to serve web requests.</p><p>To confirm that everything works, you can navigate to <code>localhost:8080</code>. There,
you should see the Caddy test page:</p>
<p>Using an unqualified search registry is unquestionably a better option than
using aliases, especially if you intend to use Podman as a drop-in replacement
for Docker, because you can continue using short names the way that you are used
to, and they will resolve from Docker Hub by default.</p><p>Before you continue further, go back to your terminal and hit <code>Ctrl+C</code> to stop
the container, then remove the Caddy image:</p>

<p>With this, you can proceed to the next section and learn how to orchestrate
multiple containers with Podman.</p>
<h2 id="orchestrating-multiple-containers">Orchestrating multiple containers</h2>
<p>So far, you have only been launching one container at a time to explore how
Podman works. At some point, you'll surely find it necessary to run multiple
containers working together as a unit. In this section, you'll explore one of
the possible ways to do that with
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/containers/podman-compose">Podman Compose<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>.</p><p>Podman offers several options for orchestrating multiple containers, but Podman
Compose is the most similar to what's used in the Docker world. Other options
are pods and Kubernetes manifests, but both call for a deeper comprehension of
Podman (and Kubernetes), so we'll leave them out for now.</p><p>In the following example, you'll use the Docker Compose instructions supplied
with the <a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress">official WordPress image<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a> on

MySQL database server. If you're unfamiliar with WordPress, it is a popular
blogging and content management platform written in PHP.</p><p>In the Docker ecosystem, Compose allows you to define and manage multiple
containers through definitions stored inside a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file. Being
used to working with Docker Compose, you can continue using your existing
<code>docker-compose.yml</code> files with Podman with the help of Podman Compose.</p><p>Podman Compose is a community-driven tool that implements the
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://compose-spec.io/">Compose specification<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a> and seamlessly integrates with
Podman. It relies on Python 3 to work, and one of the easiest ways to get
started with it is through <a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://pypa.github.io/pipx/">pipx<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>.</p><p>If you don't already have Python 3 or <code>pipx</code> installed on your system, you can
install them by running:</p>

<p>You can verify that <code>pipx</code> is working by typing:</p>

<p>This will output a version identifier similar to:</p>

<p>The output confirms that version <code>1.2.0</code> is of <code>pipx</code> is installed on your
system, and you're ready to start using it.</p><p>You can run the following command to install Podman Compose:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>pipx install podman-compose
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If everything goes well, you should see:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">

done! ✨ 🌟 ✨
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The output indicates that <code>pipx</code> was placed in your <code>$HOME/.local/bin</code> folder.
However, that folder is likely not included in your <code>$PATH</code> variable, meaning if
you type <code>podman-compose</code> right now, you will get a similar error:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Command 'podman-compose' not found, but can be installed with:

</div>

<p>Don't be confused by this error. Podman Compose was successfully installed, but
you need to add its installation folder to your <code>$PATH</code>.</p><p>You can address this by running:</p>

<p>This command will ensure that <code>$HOME/.local/bin</code> is appended to your <code>$PATH</code>
through one of your shell's config files (<code>.profile</code>, <code>.bash_profile</code>,
<code>.bashrc</code>, etc. depending on your specific setup).</p><p>After running the command, you will see the following output:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>/home/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/.local/bin has been added to PATH, but you need to open a new terminal or re-login for this PATH change to take effect.

You will need to open a new terminal or re-login for the PATH changes to take effect.

Otherwise pipx is ready to go! ✨ 🌟 ✨
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can follow the instructions and re-open your terminal session.
Alternatively, if you know precisely which shell config file was modified, you
can source the file for the changes to take immediate effect.</p><p>For example:</p>

<p>To confirm that the <code>$PATH</code> is set correctly, you can run:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | grep -F .local
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You should see <code>/home/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/.local/bin</code> listed in the output:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>/home/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/.local/bin
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Create a new folder and <code>cd</code> into it:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>mkdir podman-tutorial &amp;&amp; cd podman-tutorial

</div>
</div>

<p>Save the file, then run:</p>

<p>Let's examine the output segment by segment.</p><p>Initially, <code>podman-compose</code> launches and starts analyzing the
<code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman-compose version: 1.0.6
['podman', '--version', '']
using podman version: 4.3.1
** excluding:  set()
['podman', 'ps', '--filter', 'label=io.podman.compose.project=podman-tutorial', '-a', '--format', '{{ index .Labels "io.podman.compose.config-hash"}}']
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It detects two services named <code>wordpress</code> and <code>db</code>, and starts processing them
in sequential order.</p><p>First, it finds out that the <code>wordpress</code> service requires an external volume. It
tries to locate the volume by issuing <code>podman volume inspect &lt;volume_name&gt;</code>, but
since it doesn't exist, it goes ahead and creates one by issuing
<code>podman volume create &lt;volume_name&gt;</code>:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman volume inspect podman-tutorial_wordpress || podman volume create podman-tutorial_wordpress
['podman', 'volume', 'inspect', 'podman-tutorial_wordpress']
Error: inspecting object: no such volume podman-tutorial_wordpress
['podman', 'volume', 'create', '--label', 'io.podman.compose.project=podman-tutorial', '--label', 'com.docker.compose.project=podman-tutorial', 'podman-tutorial_wordpress']
['podman', 'volume', 'inspect', 'podman-tutorial_wordpress']
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Next, it checks whether there is a suitable network for deploying the
<code>wordpress</code> service. It doesn't find one, so it creates it and then performs
another check to confirm that the network exists:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>['podman', 'network', 'exists', 'podman-tutorial_default']
['podman', 'network', 'create', '--label', 'io.podman.compose.project=podman-tutorial', '--label', 'com.docker.compose.project=podman-tutorial', 'podman-tutorial_default']
['podman', 'network', 'exists', 'podman-tutorial_default']
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Finally, with a suitable network and an external volume in place, Podman Compose
launches the <code>wordpress</code> container:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman run --name=wordpress -d --label io.podman.compose.config-hash=c3e51c9a26e54848a06f92083413698bee90acd721b4aa3054280e110819a68c --label io.podman.compose.project=podman-tutorial --label io.podman.compose.version=1.0.6 --label PODMAN_SYSTEMD_UNIT=podman-compose@podman-tutorial.service --label com.docker.compose.project=podman-tutorial --label com.docker.compose.project.working_dir=/home/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/podman-tutorial --label com.docker.compose.project.config_files=docker-compose.yml --label com.docker.compose.container-number=1 --label com.docker.compose.service=wordpress -e WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=db -e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=testuser -e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=testpass -e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=testdb -v podman-tutorial_wordpress:/var/www/html --net podman-tutorial_default --network-alias wordpress -p 8080:80 --restart always wordpress
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Since Podman cannot find a <code>wordpress</code> image available locally, it goes ahead
and looks up the unqualified search registry that you configured earlier
(<code>docker.io</code>), then downloads it:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">

exit code: 0
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Next, Podman Compose proceeds with processing the instructions for the <code>db</code>
service.</p><p>First, it creates its external volume:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman volume inspect podman-tutorial_db || podman volume create podman-tutorial_db
['podman', 'volume', 'inspect', 'podman-tutorial_db']
Error: inspecting object: no such volume podman-tutorial_db
['podman', 'volume', 'create', '--label', 'io.podman.compose.project=podman-tutorial', '--label', 'com.docker.compose.project=podman-tutorial', 'podman-tutorial_db']
['podman', 'volume', 'inspect', 'podman-tutorial_db']
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It then ensures that there is a suitable network for its deployment:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>['podman', 'network', 'exists', 'podman-tutorial_default']
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Finally, it launches the <code>db</code> container:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman run --name=db -d --label io.podman.compose.config-hash=c3e51c9a26e54848a06f92083413698bee90acd721b4aa3054280e110819a68c --label io.podman.compose.project=podman-tutorial --label io.podman.compose.version=1.0.6 --label PODMAN_SYSTEMD_UNIT=podman-compose@podman-tutorial.service --label com.docker.compose.project=podman-tutorial --label com.docker.compose.project.working_dir=/home/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/podman-tutorial --label com.docker.compose.project.config_files=docker-compose.yml --label com.docker.compose.container-number=1 --label com.docker.compose.service=db -e MYSQL_DATABASE=testdb -e MYSQL_USER=testuser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=testpass -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=1 -v podman-tutorial_db:/var/lib/mysql --net podman-tutorial_default --network-alias db --restart always mysql:5.7
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Just like with the <code>wordpress</code> image, Podman cannot find a <code>mysql:5.7</code> image
locally, so it goes ahead and obtains it from Docker Hub:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Resolving "mysql" using unqualified-search registries (/home/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/.config/containers/registries.conf)

exit code: 0
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>At this point, Podman Compose exits successfully, and everything appears to be
launched correctly. Let's go ahead and verify this.</p><p>First, try to open <code>localhost:8080</code> in a browser. You should see the WordPress
installation page:</p>
<p>Now, go back to your terminal and type in:</p>

<p>Indeed, both the <code>wordpress</code> container and the <code>db</code> container are up and
running:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                               COMMAND               CREATED        STATUS            PORTS                 NAMES

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can also go ahead and explore the list of available images:</p>

<p>The list contains all the necessary images for running MySQL and WordPress:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>REPOSITORY                   TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE

docker.io/library/mysql      5.7         bdba757bc933  4 weeks ago   520 MB
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can further explore the list of available networks:</p>

<p>Two networks show up:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>NETWORK ID    NAME                     DRIVER
2f259bab93aa  podman                   bridge
3f5fa386b31c  podman-tutorial_default  bridge
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code>podman</code> network is created by default when you install Podman for the first
time. It is used for launching containers when no other network is explicitly
specified. On the other hand, the <code>podman-tutorial_default</code> network is created
by Podman Compose to isolate the containers defined in your <code>docker-compose.yml</code>
from any other containers potentially running on the same system.</p><p>Finally, let's check the available volumes:</p>

<p>As expected, two external volumes appear:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>DRIVER      VOLUME NAME
local       podman-tutorial_db
local       podman-tutorial_wordpress
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can go ahead and stop the containers:</p>

<p>Podman Compose stops and removes the containers from your system but keeps the
network and volumes:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman-compose version: 1.0.6
['podman', '--version', '']
using podman version: 4.3.1
** excluding:  set()

exit code: 0
podman stop -t 10 wordpress
wordpress
exit code: 0
podman rm db
db
exit code: 0
podman rm wordpress
wordpress
exit code: 0
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can verify that no containers are running by typing:</p>

<p>The result shows an empty output, which confirms that all of the containers were
stopped and removed.</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>CONTAINER ID  IMAGE       COMMAND     CREATED     STATUS      PORTS       NAMES
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you want to remove the volumes as well, you can type in:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman volume rm podman-tutorial_db podman-tutorial_wordpress
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To remove the network, type in:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman network rm podman-tutorial_default
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As you can see, the commands are identical to what you would normally use with
Docker and Docker Compose. The only noticeable difference is that instead of
<code>docker</code> and <code>docker-compose</code>, you type in <code>podman</code> and <code>podman-compose</code>.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Podman is a capable containerization technology that offers a viable alternative
to Docker for running container workloads. Whether you choose Podman or Docker
depends entirely on your specific needs and preferences. </p><p>Podman can do most of the things that Docker can do, with the added benefit of 
not requiring a daemon running in the background. On top of that, Podman offers 
some features that Docker does not, such as working with Kubernetes manifest 
files and organizing individual containers into pods.</p><p>The final decision is yours. If you require a more lightweight and secure
container management solution, Podman might be a better choice. However, Docker
may be the way to go if you prioritize a robust ecosystem with extensive
community support. Ultimately, both tools offer powerful containerization
capabilities to meet your requirements.</p><p>To explore Podman further, consider visiting the

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the English language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action do anything about it. Our civilization is decadent and our language — so the argument runs — must inevitably share in the general collapse. It follows that any struggle against the abuse of language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring candles to electric light or hansom cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies the half-conscious belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument which we shape for our own purposes.</p>
<p>Now, it is clear that the decline of a language must ultimately have political and economic causes: it is not due simply to the bad influence of this or that individual writer. But an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in an intensified form, and so on indefinitely. A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible. Modern English, especially written English, is full of bad habits which spread by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the necessary trouble. If one gets rid of these habits one can think more clearly, and to think clearly is a necessary first step toward political regeneration: so that the fight against bad English is not frivolous and is not the exclusive concern of professional writers. I will come back to this presently, and I hope that by that time the meaning of what I have said here will have become clearer. Meanwhile, here are five specimens of the English language as it is now habitually written.</p>
<p>These five passages have not been picked out because they are especially bad — I could have quoted far worse if I had chosen — but because they illustrate various of the mental vices from which we now suffer. They are a little below the average, but are fairly representative examples. I number them so that I can refer back to them when necessary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. I am not, indeed, sure whether it is not true to say that the Milton who once seemed not unlike a seventeenth-century Shelley had not become, out of an experience ever more bitter in each year, more alien <i>[sic]</i> to the founder of that Jesuit sect which nothing could induce him to tolerate.</p>
<p>Professor Harold Laski (Essay in <i>Freedom of Expression</i>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2. Above all, we cannot play ducks and drakes with a native battery of idioms which prescribes egregious collocations of vocables as the Basic <i>put up with</i> for <i>tolerate</i>, or <i>put at a loss</i> for <i>bewilder</i>.</p>
<p>Professor Lancelot Hogben (<i>Interglossia</i>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3. On the one side we have the free personality: by definition it is not neurotic, for it has neither conflict nor dream. Its desires, such as they are, are transparent, for they are just what institutional approval keeps in the forefront of consciousness; another institutional pattern would alter their number and intensity; there is little in them that is natural, irreducible, or culturally dangerous. But <i>on the other side</i>, the social bond itself is nothing but the mutual reflection of these self-secure integrities. Recall the definition of love. Is not this the very picture of a small academic? Where is there a place in this hall of mirrors for either personality or fraternity?</p>
<p>Essay on psychology in <i>Politics</i> (New York)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4. All the ‘best people’ from the gentlemen's clubs, and all the frantic fascist captains, united in common hatred of Socialism and bestial horror at the rising tide of the mass revolutionary movement, have turned to acts of provocation, to foul incendiarism, to medieval legends of poisoned wells, to legalize their own destruction of proletarian organizations, and rouse the agitated petty-bourgeoise to chauvinistic fervor on behalf of the fight against the revolutionary way out of the crisis.</p>
<p>Communist pamphlet</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5. If a new spirit is to be infused into this old country, there is one thorny and contentious reform which must be tackled, and that is the humanization and galvanization of the B.B.C. Timidity here will bespeak canker and atrophy of the soul. The heart of Britain may be sound and of strong beat, for instance, but the British lion's roar at present is like that of Bottom in Shakespeare's <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> — as gentle as any sucking dove. A virile new Britain cannot continue indefinitely to be traduced in the eyes or rather ears, of the world by the effete languors of Langham Place, brazenly masquerading as ‘standard English’. When the Voice of Britain is heard at nine o'clock, better far and infinitely less ludicrous to hear aitches honestly dropped than the present priggish, inflated, inhibited, school-ma'amish arch braying of blameless bashful mewing maidens!</p>
<p>Letter in <i>Tribune</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of these passages has faults of its own, but, quite apart from avoidable ugliness, two qualities are common to all of them. The first is staleness of imagery; the other is lack of precision. The writer either has a meaning and cannot express it, or he inadvertently says something else, or he is almost indifferent as to whether his words mean anything or not. This mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern English prose, and especially of any kind of political writing. As soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech that are not hackneyed: prose consists less and less of <i>words</i> chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of <i>phrases</i> tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house. I list below, with notes and examples, various of the tricks by means of which the work of prose-construction is habitually dodged.</p>
<p><span>DYING METAPHORS.</span> A newly invented metaphor assists thought by evoking a visual image, while on the other hand a metaphor which is technically ‘dead’ (e. g. iron resolution) has in effect reverted to being an ordinary word and can generally be used without loss of vividness. But in between these two classes there is a huge dump of worn-out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves. Examples are: <i>Ring the changes on, take up the cudgel for, toe the line, ride roughshod over, stand shoulder to shoulder with, play into the hands of, no axe to grind, grist to the mill, fishing in troubled waters, on the order of the day, Achilles’ heel, swan song, hotbed</i>. Many of these are used without knowledge of their meaning (what is a ‘rift’, for instance?), and incompatible metaphors are frequently mixed, a sure sign that the writer is not interested in what he is saying. Some metaphors now current have been twisted out of their original meaning without those who use them even being aware of the fact. For example, <i>toe the line</i> is sometimes written as <i>tow the line</i>. Another example is <i>the hammer and the anvil</i>, now always used with the implication that the anvil gets the worst of it. In real life it is always the anvil that breaks the hammer, never the other way about: a writer who stopped to think what he was saying would avoid perverting the original phrase.</p>
<p><span>OPERATORS OR VERBAL FALSE LIMBS.</span> These save the trouble of picking out appropriate verbs and nouns, and at the same time pad each sentence with extra syllables which give it an appearance of symmetry. Characteristic phrases are <i>render inoperative, militate against, make contact with, be subjected to, give rise to, give grounds for, have the effect of, play a leading part (role) in, make itself felt, take effect, exhibit a tendency to, serve the purpose of,</i> etc., etc. The keynote is the elimination of simple verbs. Instead of being a single word, such as <i>break, stop, spoil, mend, kill,</i> a verb becomes a <i>phrase</i>, made up of a noun or adjective tacked on to some general-purpose verb such as <i>prove, serve, form, play, render</i>. In addition, the passive voice is wherever possible used in preference to the active, and noun constructions are used instead of gerunds (<i>by examination of</i> instead of <i>by examining</i>). The range of verbs is further cut down by means of the <i>-ize</i> and <i>de-</i> formations, and the banal statements are given an appearance of profundity by means of the <i>not un-</i> formation. Simple conjunctions and prepositions are replaced by such phrases as <i>with respect to, having regard to, the fact that, by dint of, in view of, in the interests of, on the hypothesis that</i>; and the ends of sentences are saved by anticlimax by such resounding commonplaces as <i>greatly to be desired, cannot be left out of account, a development to be expected in the near future, deserving of serious consideration, brought to a satisfactory conclusion,</i> and so on and so forth.</p>
<p><span>PRETENTIOUS DICTION.</span> Words like <i>phenomenon, element, individual (as noun), objective, categorical, effective, virtual, basic, primary, promote, constitute, exhibit, exploit, utilize, eliminate, liquidate,</i> are used to dress up a simple statement and give an air of scientific impartiality to biased judgements. Adjectives like <i>epoch-making, epic, historic, unforgettable, triumphant, age-old, inevitable, inexorable, veritable,</i> are used to dignify the sordid process of international politics, while writing that aims at glorifying war usually takes on an archaic colour, its characteristic words being: <i>realm, throne, chariot, mailed fist, trident, sword, shield, buckler, banner, jackboot, clarion.</i> Foreign words and expressions such as <i>cul de sac, ancien regime, deus ex machina, mutatis mutandis, status quo, gleichschaltung, weltanschauung,</i> are used to give an air of culture and elegance. Except for the useful abbreviations <i>i. e., e. g. and etc.,</i> there is no real need for any of the hundreds of foreign phrases now current in the English language. <a name="fnm_1">Bad writers, and especially scientific, political, and sociological writers, are nearly always haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones, and unnecessary words like <i>expedite, ameliorate, predict, extraneous, deracinated, clandestine, subaqueous,</i> and hundreds of others constantly gain ground from their Anglo-Saxon numbers</a><small><a href="#fnt_1" tabindex="31">(1)</a></small>. The jargon peculiar to Marxist writing (<i>hyena, hangman, cannibal, petty bourgeois, these gentry, lackey, flunkey, mad dog, White Guard,</i> etc.) consists largely of words translated from Russian, German, or French; but the normal way of coining a new word is to use Latin or Greek root with the appropriate affix and, where necessary, the size formation. It is often easier to make up words of this kind (<i>deregionalize, impermissible, extramarital, non-fragmentary</i> and so forth) than to think up the English words that will cover one's meaning. The result, in general, is an increase in slovenliness and vagueness.</p>
<p><span>MEANINGLESS WORDS.</span> <a name="fnm_2">In certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning</a><small><a href="#fnt_2" tabindex="31">(2)</a></small>. Words like <i>romantic, plastic, values, human, dead, sentimental, natural, vitality,</i> as used in art criticism, are strictly meaningless, in the sense that they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly ever expected to do so by the reader. When one critic writes, ‘The outstanding feature of Mr. X's work is its living quality’, while another writes, ‘The immediately striking thing about Mr. X's work is its peculiar deadness’, the reader accepts this as a simple difference opinion. If words like <i>black</i> and <i>white</i> were involved, instead of the jargon words <i>dead</i> and <i>living</i>, he would see at once that language was being used in an improper way. Many political words are similarly abused. The word <i>Fascism</i> has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies ‘something not desirable’. The words <i>democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice</i> have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like <i>democracy</i>, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using that word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different. Statements like <i>Marshal Petain was a true patriot, The Soviet press is the freest in the world, The Catholic Church is opposed to persecution,</i> are almost always made with intent to deceive. Other words used in variable meanings, in most cases more or less dishonestly, are: <i>class, totalitarian, science, progressive, reactionary, bourgeois, equality.</i></p>
<p>Now that I have made this catalogue of swindles and perversions, let me give another example of the kind of writing that they lead to. This time it must of its nature be an imaginary one. I am going to translate a passage of good English into modern English of the worst sort. Here is a well-known verse from <i>Ecclesiastes</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is in modern English:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a parody, but not a very gross one. Exhibit (3) above, for instance, contains several patches of the same kind of English. It will be seen that I have not made a full translation. The beginning and ending of the sentence follow the original meaning fairly closely, but in the middle the concrete illustrations — race, battle, bread — dissolve into the vague phrases ‘success or failure in competitive activities’. This had to be so, because no modern writer of the kind I am discussing — no one capable of using phrases like ‘objective considerations of contemporary phenomena’ — would ever tabulate his thoughts in that precise and detailed way. The whole tendency of modern prose is away from concreteness. Now analyze these two sentences a little more closely. The first contains forty-nine words but only sixty syllables, and all its words are those of everyday life. The second contains thirty-eight words of ninety syllables: eighteen of those words are from Latin roots, and one from Greek. The first sentence contains six vivid images, and only one phrase (‘time and chance’) that could be called vague. The second contains not a single fresh, arresting phrase, and in spite of its ninety syllables it gives only a shortened version of the meaning contained in the first. Yet without a doubt it is the second kind of sentence that is gaining ground in modern English. I do not want to exaggerate. This kind of writing is not yet universal, and outcrops of simplicity will occur here and there in the worst-written page. Still, if you or I were told to write a few lines on the uncertainty of human fortunes, we should probably come much nearer to my imaginary sentence than to the one from <i>Ecclesiastes</i>.</p>
<p>As I have tried to show, modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer humbug. The attraction of this way of writing is that it is easy. It is easier — even quicker, once you have the habit — to say <i>In my opinion it is not an unjustifiable assumption that</i> than to say <i>I think</i>. If you use ready-made phrases, you not only don't have to hunt about for the words; you also don't have to bother with the rhythms of your sentences since these phrases are generally so arranged as to be more or less euphonious. When you are composing in a hurry — when you are dictating to a stenographer, for instance, or making a public speech — it is natural to fall into a pretentious, Latinized style. Tags like <i>a consideration which we should do well to bear in mind</i> or <i>a conclusion to which all of us would readily assent</i> will save many a sentence from coming down with a bump. By using stale metaphors, similes, and idioms, you save much mental effort, at the cost of leaving your meaning vague, not only for your reader but for yourself. This is the significance of mixed metaphors. The sole aim of a metaphor is to call up a visual image. When these images clash — as in <i>The Fascist octopus has sung its swan song, the jackboot is thrown into the melting pot</i> — it can be taken as certain that the writer is not seeing a mental image of the objects he is naming; in other words he is not really thinking. Look again at the examples I gave at the beginning of this essay. Professor Laski (1) uses five negatives in fifty three words. One of these is superfluous, making nonsense of the whole passage, and in addition there is the slip — <i>alien</i> for akin — making further nonsense, and several avoidable pieces of clumsiness which increase the general vagueness. Professor Hogben (2) plays ducks and drakes with a battery which is able to write prescriptions, and, while disapproving of the everyday phrase <i>put up with</i>, is unwilling to look <i>egregious</i> up in the dictionary and see what it means; (3), if one takes an uncharitable attitude towards it, is simply meaningless: probably one could work out its intended meaning by reading the whole of the article in which it occurs. In (4), the writer knows more or less what he wants to say, but an accumulation of stale phrases chokes him like tea leaves blocking a sink. In (5), words and meaning have almost parted company. People who write in this manner usually have a general emotional meaning — they dislike one thing and want to express solidarity with another — but they are not interested in the detail of what they are saying. A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? But you are not obliged to go to all this trouble. You can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in. The will construct your sentences for you — even think your thoughts for you, to a certain extent — and at need they will perform the important service of partially concealing your meaning even from yourself. It is at this point that the special connection between politics and the debasement of language becomes clear.</p>
<p>In our time it is broadly true that political writing is bad writing. Where it is not true, it will generally be found that the writer is some kind of rebel, expressing his private opinions and not a ‘party line’. Orthodoxy, of whatever colour, seems to demand a lifeless, imitative style. The political dialects to be found in pamphlets, leading articles, manifestos, White papers and the speeches of undersecretaries do, of course, vary from party to party, but they are all alike in that one almost never finds in them a fresh, vivid, homemade turn of speech. When one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar phrases — <i>bestial, atrocities, iron heel, bloodstained tyranny, free peoples of the world, stand shoulder to shoulder</i> — one often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy: a feeling which suddenly becomes stronger at moments when the light catches the speaker's spectacles and turns them into blank discs which seem to have no eyes behind them. And this is not altogether fanciful. A speaker who uses that kind of phraseology has gone some distance toward turning himself into a machine. The appropriate noises are coming out of his larynx, but his brain is not involved, as it would be if he were choosing his words for himself. If the speech he is making is one that he is accustomed to make over and over again, he may be almost unconscious of what he is saying, as one is when one utters the responses in church. And this reduced state of consciousness, if not indispensable, is at any rate favourable to political conformity.</p>
<p>In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of the political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenceless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called <i>pacification</i>. Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called <i>transfer of population</i> or <i>rectification of frontiers</i>. People are imprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is called <i>elimination of unreliable elements</i>. Such phraseology is needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them. Consider for instance some comfortable English professor defending Russian totalitarianism. He cannot say outright, ‘I believe in killing off your opponents when you can get good results by doing so’. Probably, therefore, he will say something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘While freely conceding that the Soviet regime exhibits certain features which the humanitarian may be inclined to deplore, we must, I think, agree that a certain curtailment of the right to political opposition is an unavoidable concomitant of transitional periods, and that the rigors which the Russian people have been called upon to undergo have been amply justified in the sphere of concrete achievement.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inflated style itself is a kind of euphemism. A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outline and covering up all the details. The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink. In our age there is no such thing as ‘keeping out of politics’. All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred, and schizophrenia. When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer. I should expect to find — this is a guess which I have not sufficient knowledge to verify — that the German, Russian and Italian languages have all deteriorated in the last ten or fifteen years, as a result of dictatorship.</p>
<p>But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought. A bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation even among people who should and do know better. The debased language that I have been discussing is in some ways very convenient. Phrases like <i>a not unjustifiable assumption, leaves much to be desired, would serve no good purpose, a consideration which we should do well to bear in mind,</i> are a continuous temptation, a packet of aspirins always at one's elbow. Look back through this essay, and for certain you will find that I have again and again committed the very faults I am protesting against. By this morning's post I have received a pamphlet dealing with conditions in Germany. The author tells me that he ‘felt impelled’ to write it. I open it at random, and here is almost the first sentence I see: ‘[The Allies] have an opportunity not only of achieving a radical transformation of Germany's social and political structure in such a way as to avoid a nationalistic reaction in Germany itself, but at the same time of laying the foundations of a co-operative and unified Europe.’ You see, he ‘feels impelled’ to write — feels, presumably, that he has something new to say — and yet his words, like cavalry horses answering the bugle, group themselves automatically into the familiar dreary pattern. This invasion of one's mind by ready-made phrases (<i>lay the foundations, achieve a radical transformation</i>) can only be prevented if one is constantly on guard against them, and every such phrase anaesthetizes a portion of one's brain.</p>
<p>I said earlier that the decadence of our language is probably curable. Those who deny this would argue, if they produced an argument at all, that language merely reflects existing social conditions, and that we cannot influence its development by any direct tinkering with words and constructions. So far as the general tone or spirit of a language goes, this may be true, but it is not true in detail. Silly words and expressions have often disappeared, not through any evolutionary process but owing to the conscious action of a minority. Two recent examples were <i>explore every avenue</i> and <i>leave no stone unturned</i>, which were killed by the jeers of a few journalists. <a name="fnm_3">There is a long list of flyblown metaphors which could similarly be got rid of if enough people would interest themselves in the job; and it should also be possible to laugh the <i>not un-</i> formation out of existence</a><small><a href="#fnt_3" tabindex="31">(3)</a></small>, to reduce the amount of Latin and Greek in the average sentence, to drive out foreign phrases and strayed scientific words, and, in general, to make pretentiousness unfashionable. But all these are minor points. The defence of the English language implies more than this, and perhaps it is best to start by saying what it <i>does not</i> imply.</p>
<p>To begin with it has nothing to do with archaism, with the salvaging of obsolete words and turns of speech, or with the setting up of a ‘standard English’ which must never be departed from. On the contrary, it is especially concerned with the scrapping of every word or idiom which has outworn its usefulness. It has nothing to do with correct grammar and syntax, which are of no importance so long as one makes one's meaning clear, or with the avoidance of Americanisms, or with having what is called a ‘good prose style’. On the other hand, it is not concerned with fake simplicity and the attempt to make written English colloquial. Nor does it even imply in every case preferring the Saxon word to the Latin one, though it does imply using the fewest and shortest words that will cover one's meaning. What is above all needed is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way around. In prose, the worst thing one can do with words is surrender to them. When you think of a concrete object, you think wordlessly, and then, if you want to describe the thing you have been visualising you probably hunt about until you find the exact words that seem to fit it. When you think of something abstract you are more inclined to use words from the start, and unless you make a conscious effort to prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in and do the job for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing your meaning. Probably it is better to put off using words as long as possible and get one's meaning as clear as one can through pictures and sensations. Afterward one can choose — not simply <i>accept</i> — the phrases that will best cover the meaning, and then switch round and decide what impressions one's words are likely to make on another person. This last effort of the mind cuts out all stale or mixed images, all prefabricated phrases, needless repetitions, and humbug and vagueness generally. But one can often be in doubt about the effect of a word or a phrase, and one needs rules that one can rely on when instinct fails. I think the following rules will cover most cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.</li>
<li>Never use a long word where a short one will do.</li>
<li>If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.</li>
<li>Never use the passive where you can use the active.</li>
<li>Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.</li>
<li>Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.</li>
</ol>
<p>These rules sound elementary, and so they are, but they demand a deep change of attitude in anyone who has grown used to writing in the style now fashionable. One could keep all of them and still write bad English, but one could not write the kind of stuff that I quoted in those five specimens at the beginning of this article.</p>
<p>I have not here been considering the literary use of language, but merely language as an instrument for expressing and not for concealing or preventing thought. Stuart Chase and others have come near to claiming that all abstract words are meaningless, and have used this as a pretext for advocating a kind of political quietism. Since you don't know what Fascism is, how can you struggle against Fascism? One need not swallow such absurdities as this, but one ought to recognise that the present political chaos is connected with the decay of language, and that one can probably bring about some improvement by starting at the verbal end. If you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy. You cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself. Political language — and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists — is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least change one's own habits, and from time to time one can even, if one jeers loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase — some <i>jackboot, Achilles’ heel, hotbed, melting pot, acid test, veritable inferno,</i> or other lump of verbal refuse — into the dustbin where it belongs.</p>
<p>1946</p>
<blockquote>
<p>_____</p>
<p><small><a name="fnt_1">1) An interesting illustration of this is the way in which the English flower names which were in use till very recently are being ousted by Greek ones, <i>snapdragon</i> becoming <i>antirrhinum</i>, <i>forget-me-not</i> becoming <i>myosotis</i>, etc. It is hard to see any practical reason for this change of fashion: it is probably due to an instinctive turning-awayfrom the more homely word and a vague feeling that the Greek word is scientific.</a> <span>[<a href="#fnm_1" tabindex="31">back</a>]</span></small></p>
<p><small><a name="fnt_2">2) Example: ‘Comfort's catholicity of perception and image, strangely Whitmanesque in range, almost the exact opposite in aesthetic compulsion, continues to evoke that trembling atmospheric accumulative hinting at a cruel, an inexorably serene timelessness... Wrey Gardiner scores by aiming at simple bull's-eyes with precision. Only they are not so simple, and through this contented sadness runs more than the surface bitter-sweet of resignation’. (<i>Poetry Quarterly.</i>)</a> <span>[<a href="#fnm_2" tabindex="31">back</a>]</span></small></p>
<p><small><a name="fnt_3">3) One can cure oneself of the <i>not un-</i> formation by memorizing this sentence: <i>A not unblack dog was chasing a not unsmall rabbit across a not ungreen field.</i></a> <span>[<a href="#fnm_3" tabindex="31">back</a>]</span></small></p>

They could still take the case to the court of appeal, but say their resources are currently too diminished to continue the fight, though they are hoping for external support.</p><p>Truls Gulowsen, the head of Friends of the Earth Norway, said: “This contravenes the Aarhus convention, which states that access to justice in environmental matters should not be financially prohibitive.

Today we conclude that we advise against marine waste disposal as it could jeopardise a healthy, sustainable ecosystem in the Førde fjord.”</p><p>Huse said the fjord was an important breeding ground for cod as well a migration route for salmon from four rivers, and pointed to the risk of fine particles being dispersed over a wider expanse of the sea.</p><p>“There is a great probability that they will spread beyond the fjord with unknown consequences,” he said.</p><p>Nordic Mining will extract garnet, a unique mineral used as an abrasive, and rutile, an oxide mineral composed of titanium dioxide, which is used in paint, cosmetics, medical implants and artificial joints among other things.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-12" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>The company has been granted permission to dispose of 4m tonnes of waste a year, but the Nordic Mining chief executive, Ivar S Fossum, said the company was planning to dispose of 1.2m tonnes a year.

This is the direct opposite of what should be expected of a seafaring nation.”</p><p>Earlier this week, Norway faced criticism after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/09/norway-set-to-approve-deep-sea-mining-despite-environmental-concerns" data-link-name="in body link">parliament voted to allow commercial deep sea mining on its seabed</a>, despite warnings that it could be devastating to marine life.</p><p>A Norwegian government spokesperson said: “There has never been any disagreement that mining tailings have environmental consequences whether they are disposed on land or in water. In the case at hand the parties agreed that land disposal was not a better environmental option than sea tailings disposal.

        <div><p>TOKYO: A domestic flight of Japan's All Nippon Airways returned to its departure airport on Saturday (Jan 13) after a crack was found on the cockpit window of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft midair, a spokesperson for the airline said.</p>

<p>Flight 1182 was en route to Toyama airport but headed back to the Sapporo-New Chitose airport after the crack was found on the outermost of four layers of windows surrounding the cockpit, the spokesperson said, adding there were no injuries reported among the 59 passengers and six crew.</p>

<p>The aircraft was not one of Boeing's 737 MAX 9 airplanes. These have been in the spotlight after <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/alaska-airlines-grounds-boeing-737-max-9-midair-blowout-window-panel-emergency-landing-4029231">a cabin panel broke off</a> a new Alaska Airlines jet in mid-air last week.</p>

<p>"The crack was not something that affected the flight's control or pressurisation," the ANA spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The United States aviation regulator on Friday <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-regulator-grounds-boeing-max-9-indefinitely-flights-cancelled-tuesday-4045391">extended the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX 9 airplanes</a> indefinitely for new safety checks and announced it will tighten oversight of Boeing itself.&nbsp;</p></div>
