          <blockquote>
            <p>In 2011, I became curious about nicotine gum/patches as a possible alternative stimulant to <a href="https://gwern.net/modafinil" id="gwern-modafinil" title="'Modafinil', Gwern 2009">modafinil</a>: its much shorter half-life makes it more useful for evenings or scenarios like needing a quick alert on a long drive. I looked briefly into the nicotine/tobacco research to see whether there was convincing evidence that nicotine on its own, without any tobacco or smoke-related delivery mechanism, is either more harmful than most stimulants or likely to lead to severe addiction to tobacco as a ‘gateway drug’.</p>
            <p>The psychological effects of nicotine as a stimulant are long established by a scattershot literature, so there are possible benefits.</p>
            <p>Cost-wise, much of the nicotine/tobacco literature willfully conflates the two, leading to misleading attribution of the harm of tobacco to nicotine; many associations with harm are confounded by past or present tobacco use (eg. <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/2020-kenkel.pdf" id="kenkel-et-al-2020" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="E-Cigarettes and Respiratory Disease: A Replication, Extension, and Future Directions"><span><span> <span>et al</span> <span>2020</span></span></span></a>), but when pure nicotine is examined, as in patch/GUM NRT, the harms appeared minimal: like all stimulants, nicotine may raise blood pressure somewhat, and is addictive to some degree, but the risks do not appear much more strikingly harmful than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#bodyContent">caffeine</a> or modafinil (and certainly appear less than the many commonly-used amphetamines). Animal experiments are, like usual, highly ambiguous, of low quality, and of doubtful relevance to humans. There is little evidence from the NRT literature that ‘never-smokers’ like myself are all that likely to become highly addicted, and minimal epidemiological evidence of harm from NRT use over the past 3 decades it has been available.</p>
            <p>‘Vaping’ is another story: few experiments have been done, and its popularity is recent enough that any harms are poorly understood other than it can’t possibly be remotely as harmful as tobacco smoking, and its delivery mechanism plausibly is much more addictive than gum/patch delivery would be.</p>
            <p>Overall, I am personally comfortable using nicotine gum (but not vaping) once in a while, and have done so since 2011 without any noticeable problems or escalation in usage frequency.</p>

        <p>One of the reasons tobacco became so popular in the 1600s, along with tea &amp; coffee (for their caffeine), was that nicotine is a powerful stimulant. Obvious enough; it affects <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Central_nervous_system" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#bodyContent">tons of systems</a>. Less obvious is that nicotine has many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Medical" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#bodyContent">beneficial effects</a> (and these benefits may be related to <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/animal-smoking-studieshtml" data-link-icon="OB" data-link-icon-type="text">anomalous</a> <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/smoking-followuphtml" data-link-icon="OB" data-link-icon-type="text">smoking</a> <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/what-anti-smoking-evidencehtml" data-link-icon="OB" data-link-icon-type="text">results</a><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>); the infamous deadliness of smoking would seem to be almost solely from the smoke, not the nicotine. Even less obvious is that nicotine itself may not be especially addictive, and its addictiveness is genetically modulated<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. (If nicotine was all that was going on, why do smokers struggle so much with their transition to NRT en route to quitting entirely? And why do so many people use nicotine gum or patches occasionally for long periods without being addicted, or quitting easily?)</p>
        <p>All of the harm seems to stem from tobacco, and tobacco smoking in particular; this is not necessarily obvious because almost everyone casually conflates tobacco with nicotine (especially public education programs<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>), treating them as a single synonymous evil I dub “nicbacco”. When someone or something says that “nicotine” is harmful and you drill down to the original references for their claims, the references often turn out to actually be talking about tobacco rather than nicotine gums or patches<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Other methodological issues include comparing to current smokers rather than former smokers or failing to control for the subjects being the sort of people who would begin such a societally-disapproved activity like smoking; the studies typically aren’t designed properly even for showing an effect: you need a study which finds deficits in smokers but not in non-smokers <em>or</em> former smokers (eg. <a href="https://www.medlive.cn/uploadfile/2011/1013/20111013114126307.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Smoking-related prospective memory deficits in a real-world task"><span><span><span title="et al">Heffernan</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2011</span></span></span></a> or <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/414283" data-link-icon="JAMA" data-link-icon-type="text,sans,quad" title="Smoking History and Cognitive Function in Middle Age From the Whitehall II Study"><span><span><span title="et al">Sabia</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2008</span></span></span></a>/<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/2012-sabia.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Impact of smoking on cognitive decline in early old age: the Whitehall II cohort study"><span><span><span title="et al">Sabia</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2012</span></span></span></a> although neither enables nicotine inferences since there was no nicotine-only control group). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_vaping_lung_illness_outbreak" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_vaping_lung_illness_outbreak#bodyContent">2019 United States outbreak of lung illness linked to vaping products</a> offers a case in point of this prejudice: despite every sign pointing to adulterants added to illegal THC/marijuana vaping fluids by fly-by-night operators rather than nicotine (such as the decades of nicotine vaping by millions of people not causing them to land overnight in hospital ICUs), the outbreak has been used as an excuse to ban <em>legal nicotine</em> vaping fluids instead—which is like banning aspirin as a response to the opiate crisis because they’re both used for pain relief and they both come in pill form, and some OD victims also used aspirin recently, so that makes them pretty much the same thing, right?</p>

          <p><span>Another thorough and contrarian piece is Frenk &amp; <span><span>Dar’s</span><span>2002</span></span> book,</span> <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/2002-frenkdar.pdf" id="frenk-et-al-2002" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="'A Critique of Nicotine Addiction', Frenk et al 2002"><em>A Critique of Nicotine Addiction</em></a>. I don’t entirely agree with their take-no-prisoners arguments, since additional work since 2002 has clearly shown that nicotine alone <em>does</em> <span>have some addictive properties: for example, Le <span><span title="et al">Foll</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2007</span></span>,</span> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000230" id="foll-et-al-2007" data-link-icon="plos" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="'High Reinforcing Efficacy of Nicotine in Non-Human Primates', Foll et al 2007">“High Reinforcing Efficacy of Nicotine in Non-Human Primates”</a> found that given enough development, squirrel monkeys would push levers up to 600 times for an injection. But on the other hand, as Le Foll et al comment:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Surprisingly, reinforcing effects of nicotine alone have often been difficult to demonstrate directly in controlled laboratory studies with both animals and humans as experimental subjects. Consequently, there has been continuing controversy in the literature about the validity of previous findings of reinforcing effects of nicotine in experimental animals and human subjects <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/1992-robinson.pdf" id="robinson-pritchard-1992" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="'The Role of Nicotine in Tobacco Use', Robinson &amp; Pritchard 1992">[3]</a>, <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/1992-west.pdf" id="west-1992" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="'Nicotine addiction: a re-analysis of the arguments', West 1992">[4]</a>, <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/2002-dar.pdf" id="dar-frenk-2002" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="'Nicotine Self-Administration in Animals: A Reevaluation', Dar &amp; Frenk 2002">[5]</a>, <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/2004-dar.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="'Do smokers self-administer pure nicotine?

          <p>Or “Brain science, addiction and drugs” 2008:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The results showed that 40% of smokers receiving the [anti-nicotine] vaccine gave up smoking for nearly six months of follow-up; the highest smoking cessation rate (57%) was associated with the highest antibody response. These results are better than those seen in most nicotine replacement trials, but it is interesting that an unusually high proportion (31%) of the smokers receiving placebo also quit smoking for up to six months [Holman J (2005). “Helping patients kick the habit”. American Diabetes Association, DOC News 2, 1-2].</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>My take away is that there is addiction but it’s drastically overestimated by almost everyone and may been conflated with the habit-formation capability; the latter makes nicotine doubly valuable, but the former means we will want to be more careful with the nicotine than with modafinil or caffeine, where the main consequence of carelessness is tolerance rendering the stimulant useless or messing up our sleep for a few days.</p>
          <p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus#Health_effects" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus#bodyContent">snus</a>, a sort of chewing tobacco, has been studied extensively in Sweden where it is very popular and has been credited with large reductions in the smoking rate<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, and with little hard evidence of harm from snus use<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. Smokeless tobacco in general is hugely more safe than smoking (<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/nov/12/20051112-102753-2328r/">“Smokeout: Not as easy as ABC”</a>, <em>Washington Times</em>):</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Modern smokeless tobacco products contain nicotine in addictive doses to satisfy smokers’ cravings. University research has documented that smokers who switch to smokeless tobacco reduce their risk for all smoking-related illnesses, including oral cancer. On average, smokers live 8 years less than those who never used tobacco; smokeless users lose just 15 days. Statistically, smokeless users have about the same risk of dying as automobile users.</p>

            <p>“People are unreasonably afraid of nicotine”, Dr.&nbsp;Shiffman said. “The majority of smokers believe that nicotine causes cancer and is a big player in the harm caused by cigarettes.” In fact, carbon monoxide, tar and the countless toxic particles in cigarette smoke are what promote illness. Although smokers may become dependent on nicotine, it does not appear to raise the risk of cancer, lung disease or heart disease. Early reports that people who smoked cigarettes while wearing a patch stood an increased risk of heart attack proved unfounded years ago.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Dr.&nbsp;Siegel, whose graduate school manuscripts Dr.&nbsp;Glantz used to read, says e-cigarette pessimists are stuck on the idea that anything that looks like smoking is bad. “They are so blinded by this ideology that they are not able to see e-cigarettes objectively,” he said. Dr.&nbsp;Glantz disagrees. “E-cigarettes seem like a good idea,” he said, “but they aren’t.”…Public health experts like to say that people smoke for the nicotine but die from the tar. And the reason e-cigarettes have caused such a stir is that they take the deadly tar out of the equation while offering the nicotine fix and the sensation of smoking. For all that is unknown about the new devices - they have been on the American market for only seven years - most researchers agree that puffing on one is far less harmful than smoking a traditional cigarette…E-cigarette skeptics have also raised concerns about nicotine addiction. But many researchers say that the nicotine by itself is not a serious health hazard. Nicotine-replacement therapies like lozenges and patches have been used for years. Some even argue that nicotine is a lot like caffeine: an addictive substance that stimulates the mind. “Nicotine may have some adverse health effects, but they are relatively minor,” said Dr.&nbsp;Neal L. Benowitz, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who has spent his career studying the pharmacology of nicotine…“Part of the furniture for us is that the tobacco industry is evil and everything they do has to be opposed,” said John Britton, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Nottingham in England, and the director for the U.K. Center for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies. “But one doesn’t want that to get in the way of public health.”</p>

                  <blockquote>
                    <p><span>Dozens of studies have assessed the effects of nicotine on cognition in healthy, nicotine-naïve samples including studies of memory (<span><span title="et al">McClernon</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2003</span></span>), attention (<span><span title="et al">Froeliger</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2009</span></span>) and inhibitory control (Potter and Newhouse, 2004). In a recent meta-analysis of 48 studies in which nicotine was administered to non-smokers or only minimally deprived smokers (<span><span title="et al">Heishman</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2010</span></span>), nicotine was shown to have positive effects on multiple domains including attention and working memory. Twenty-nine studies specifically assessed non-smokers and among those, positive effects were observed for reaction time on tests of sustained (or alerting) attention and working memory.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Studies of the effects of nicotine on inhibitory control were not included in the meta-analysis, but a handful of studies suggest potential positive effects of nicotine on this domain. Two small studies have observed acute (<span><span title="et al">Levin</span> <span>et al</span> <span>1998</span></span>) and chronic (<span><span title="et al">McClernon</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2006</span></span>) transdermal nicotine administration to result in trends toward decreases in errors of commission on a CPT task. Moreover, nicotine has been shown to reduce CPT commission errors in nonsmokers with schizophrenia (<span><span title="et al">Barr</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2007</span></span>), non-smokers low in attentiveness (Poltavski and Petros, 2006); and decrease stop signal reaction time in adolescents nonsmokers with ADHD (Potter and Newhouse, 2004). Despite these findings, nicotine was not shown to improve response inhibition in adults with ADHD as measured with a CPT task (<span><span title="et al">Levin</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2001</span></span>).</span></p>

                <p>“Our brains normally make these associations between things that support our existence and environmental cues so that we conduct behaviors leading to successful lives. The brain sends a reward signal when we act in a way that contributes to our well being,” said Dr.&nbsp;John A. Dani, professor of neuroscience at BCM and co-author of the study. “However, nicotine commandeers this subconscious learning process in the brain so we begin to behave as though smoking is a positive action.” Dani said that environmental events linked with smoking can become cues that prompt the smoking urge. Those cues could include alcohol, a meal with friends, or even the drive home from work. To understand why these associations are so strong, Dani and Dr.&nbsp;Jianrong Tang, instructor of neuroscience at BCM and co-author of the report, decided to record brain activity of mice as they were exposed to nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco.</p>
                <p>…“The brain activity change was just amazing,” Dani said. “Compared to injections of saline, nicotine strengthened neuronal connections-sometimes up to 200 percent. This strengthening of connections underlies new memory formation.”…“We found that nicotine could strengthen neuronal synaptic connections only when the so called reward centers sent a dopamine signal. That was a critical process in creating the memory associations even with bad behavior like smoking.”</p>

                <p>I have had success working around ‘Ugh’ reactions to various activities. I took the direct approach. I (intermittently) use nicotine lozenges as a stimulant while exercising. Apart from boosting physical performance and motivation it also happens to be the most potent substance I am aware of for increasing habit formation in the brain…</p>
                <p>And I do use nicotine for studying at times (usually patches that I have cut into the desired dose). Partly for learning mental habits and partly for enhanced focus and motivation without the agitation that comes (with methamphetamine (at least, for me)). Again, I don’t swear by it but it works…<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
                <p>I have never smoked a cigarette. Nor have I ever had a remote tendency towards addiction to any substance. That is even one of the reasons I gave when describing why this is an effective technique for me personally. I am more at risk of becoming addicted to discussing substances on the Internet than the substances themselves….</p>
                <p>I should note that the role nicotine lozenges are taking here is not primarily as a training reward, like giving the rat electronically stimulated orgasms when it presses the lever. Nicotine isn’t particularly strong in that role compared to alternatives (such as abusing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate#bodyContent">Ritalin</a>), at least when it is not administered by a massive hit straight into the brain via the lungs. No, the particular potency of nicotine is that it potentates the formation of habits for activities undertaken while under the influence by means more fundamental than a ‘mere’ stimulus-reward mechanism. Habits that are found to be harder to extinct than an impulse to take a drug. This is what makes smoking so notoriously hard to quit even with patches and makes the use of fake cigarettes to suck on useful.<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

            <p>The price is not an issue. Nicotine in the US is not as expensive as one might intuitively guess from sky-high cigarette prices &amp; widespread tobacco smuggling; perhaps due to the intrinsic low cost of nicotine or because it is politically unpalatable to tax products which are largely used by people quitting smoking, prices for a 2mg dose of nicotine is easily in the 15-20 cents range:</p>

            <p>2mg may be too much for a non-smoker like me, in which case prices per dose drop further. Nor have I looked hard<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> for low prices; just grabbed random hits on Amazon. You could probably drive it down to the 5-10 cents range with canny shopping and buying in bulk (nicotine is an insecticide, not a perishable foodstuff, so you could buy years’ worth - just like with <a href="https://gwern.net/melatonin" id="gwern-melatonin" title="'Melatonin', Gwern 2008">melatonin</a>). One difficulty with gum, however, is that it’s hard to subdivide: nicotine evaporates from gum and so cutting up a 4mg piece of gum into 4 1mg pieces forces you to either use them all within a few hours, waste some pieces, or store them in some sort of air-tight wrapper for later use.</p>

                <p>You could become addicted despite everything. Hypothetically, this could then lead to tobacco use with all the attendant ills.</p>
                <p>This is a truly subjective one. Former smokers probably should not be monkeying about with nicotine. Some people are scared this might happen; others aren’t worried at all. Given what I’ve read about nicotine not being addictive but strengthening habits (see previous quotes from Wedrifid), I think this fear might be overblown.</p>

              <p>People who were addicted to the nicotine gum could easily find our questionnaire, because it was listed on top of the list in Google. In spite of this effective enrolment strategy, we identified only two never-users of tobacco among daily gum users, which suggests that NRT use in never-users of tobacco is a rare phenomenon.

In two surveys in the USA, 2.7% and 4.6% of school drug counsellors indicated that nicotine patches and gums were abused by adolescents, but these “NRT abusers” were mainly smokers who used NRT while smoking, and only 7% to 16% of these “NRT abusers” were never smokers [<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/2005-hyland.pdf" id="hyland-et-al-2005" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="'Drug Counselor Report of Adolescents Abuse of Nicotine Replacement Therapy', Hyland et al 2006">27</a>].

              <p><span>…Taking a substance over a longer time than intended is a criterion for drug dependence (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), but long-term use does not necessarily imply dependence, because dependence requires other criteria, in particular unsuccessful attempts to quit and withdrawal symptoms upon cessation. Post-marketing data from the U.S., reported by the manufacturers, indicated that only 39 cases of dependence on the nicotine gum were reported per million prescriptions (<span><span title="et al">Spyker</span> <span>et al</span> <span>1996</span></span>). However, the limitations of post-marketing surveillance data are well known (</span><a href="https://gwern.net/doc/biology/1999-brewer.pdf" id="brewer-colditz-1999" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Post-marketing surveillance and adverse drug reactions: Current perspectives and future needs">Brewer &amp; Colditz, 1999</a><span>), and survey data indicate that the prevalence of dependence on the nicotine gum in over-the-counter settings is substantially higher than that, at about 1% of ever users (<span><span title="et al">Hughes</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2004</span></span>). About one third of smokers report having ever used NRT products (</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1748084/pdf/v014p00359a.pdf" data-link-icon="nlm-ncbi" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-archive="/doc/www/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cacdd4df20d20420f032a348a1e9026123719754.pdf" title="When California smokers use nicotine replacement therapy, most are trying to quit smoking">Al-Delaimy, Gilpin, &amp; Pierce, 2005</a>). Thus, even if only 1% of users became dependent on the gum, this would still represent tens of thousands of people…Even though some users may be dependent on the gum, it must be emphasized that there is no known adverse consequence of long-term use of NRT, except for the financial cost, and that the potential benefits (ie. prevent late relapse) far outweigh the drawbacks. This is probably why dependence on the nicotine gum has been generally downplayed in the literature (<a href="https://www.hri.global/files/2011/07/13/West_-_Abuse_Liability_-_copyright_refused.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-archive="/doc/www/www.hri.global/b972f9499e9e5d8846a6c1d9e487d829eff52c5c.pdf" title="A comparison of the abuse liability and dependence potential of nicotine patch, gum, spray and inhaler"><span><span><span title="et al">West</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2000</span></span></span></a> [see also <a href="https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/14/1/49.full" data-link-icon="bmj" data-link-icon-type="text,tri,sans" title="A prospective study of off-label use of, abuse of, and dependence on nicotine inhaler"><span><span><span title="et al">Hughes</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2005</span></span></span></a>]).</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>About 35% of users reported becoming addicted, but this was heavily dependent upon variety of nicotine. Among users who smoked normal tobacco cigarettes, 65% reported addiction. Among those who smoked e-cigarettes, only 25% reported addiction (and again, since there’s no time data, it’s possible these people switched to e-cigarettes because they were addicted and not vice versa). Among users of nicotine gum and lozenges, only 7% reported addiction, and only 1% reported major addiction. Although cigarettes are a known gigantic health/addiction risk, the nootropic community’s use of isolated nicotine as a stimulant seems from this survey (subject to the above caveat) to be comparatively but not completely safe.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>One approach to estimating addictiveness of nicotine gum or patches is to borrow a strategy from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3611984/" id="fagerström-eissenberg-2012" data-link-icon="nlm-ncbi" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Dependence on Tobacco and Nicotine Products: a case for product-specific assessment"><span><span><span>Fagerstrom &amp; Eissenberg</span><span>2012</span></span></span></a> in looking at the success of various studies’ control groups (using nicotine gums or patches) in quitting during those studies:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The intention here was not to estimate the effect of the treatment but rather its placebo to determine how difficult it is to stop using a certain form of tobacco/nicotine product. Therefore, the success rate in the placebo group is used as indicators for difficulty abstaining. Table 2 shows that cigarette smokers, independent of treatment, show a success rate of roughly 10% with little variation (range 9.8-11.2). Those seeking to stop ST use have roughly more than double the success rate of cigarette smokers (range 19.1-33.0). In the study (<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/2013-tonnesen.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Varenicline to Stop Long-term Nicotine Replacement Use: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial">Tønnesen &amp; Mikkelsen, 2012</a>), where 69 long-term users of pure nicotine mostly in the form of gum, in average seven years, a success rate of 36% was observed. Those who become long-term users of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are recognized as heavy dependent smokers (<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/1988-hajek.pdf" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Long-term use of nicotine chewing gum. Occurrence, determinants, and effect on weight gain">Hajek, Jackson, &amp; Belcher, 1988</a>), which also seemed to be true in this study. Their cigarette consumption before quitting was 24.5 per day and their recalled FTCD score from when they were smoking was a high 6.7. It can be hypothesized that this type of smoker would have had no better success rate in stopping than the 10% seen normally but when coming off long-term NRT, it was 36%. The 36% was obtained from a 1-year follow-up. Several of the smokeless studies reported success rates from 6 months. It is of interest to note that the authors excluded long-term patch users since it would have been unlikely to see a difference between active and placebo treatment due to the ease by which they normally can stop. Moreover, it is much more infrequent to observe long-term patch use (Shiffman, Hughes, Pillitteri, &amp; Burton, 2003). It seems as a patch is not very likely to be able to support a compulsive use pattern due to its little behavioral involvement and or pharmacokinetic nicotine uptake pattern. The data in Table 2 lead us to conclude that quitting cigarette smoking is more difficult than quitting ST (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2997603/" id="fagerström-et-al-2010" data-link-icon="nlm-ncbi" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Stopping smokeless tobacco with varenicline: randomized double blind placebo controlled trial">Fagerström, Gilljam, Metcalfe, Tonstad, &amp; Messig, 2010</a>) and, although there is only one study from the NR category, that quitting these products may be easiest (Tønnesen &amp; Mikkelsen, 2012).</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>What does this imply for any never-smoker (not predisposed to tobacco use) using nicotine gum/patches judiciously and self-monitoring for signs of dependence, well aware of the dangers of tobacco use? Given the lack of observations despite large datasets, the low rates of dependence in smokers, the ease of quitting nicotine gum, and so on, my personal opinion is that the risk of dependency should be much lower than the smoker risks of 1-20% and then the risk even lower of then progressing to tobacco use. (In considering cost-benefit, it’s worth remembering that tobacco use has been quit successfully by many millions despite the notorious difficulty, and that the health outcomes of quitters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation#Health_benefits" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation#bodyContent">gradually heal</a> to the baseline of non-smokers.)</p>

          <p>So what’s the upshot?

The negatives universally seem to be long-term negatives, and even if nicotine turns out to be something I haul out only in a crisis or every few weeks, it would still have been worth investigating.</p>

Are they right? I don’t know. As deliciously contrarian as it would be to go around shocking people by seriously advocating tobacco use, it’s not a subject I’m interested in tackling. In philosophy, one is taught to not “try to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proving_too_much" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proving_too_much#bodyContent">prove too much</a>” (inviting people to <a href="https://gwern.net/modus" id="gwern-modus" title="'One Man’s Modus Ponens', Branwen 2012"><em>modus tollens</em> your <em>modus ponens</em></a>), to not do more philosophy than one <em>has</em> to; in programming, you learn to not become an “architecture astronaut” solving some hugely abstract version of your actual problem - such overreach invites disaster.</p>
          <p>It’s much easier for me to defend use of nicotine, so that’s all I try to do: nicotine is pretty much harmless, the studies are clear, the relevant areas &amp; studies comprehensible with not <em>too</em> much work, and I feel I can discuss it with a clean conscience. Really, about the worst you can say about pure nicotine use is that it might be a gateway to tobacco or that one’s blood pressure might increase, which are issues that can be easily addressed empirically via additional studies/surveys or by eg. measuring one’s own blood pressure after taking nicotine, respectively.</p>
          <p>But if I wanted to defend tobacco itself, I have abruptly expanded my task by <em>orders of magnitude</em>: now I need to deal with all the anti-smoking correlational studies, I need to defend an idiosyncratic interpretation of how the tobacco industry’s products have evolved over the last century, I need to defend not just nicotine but all the other substances in tobacco which might override its benefits, I need to explain why the nigh-universal consensus against tobacco is wrong and to give a historical account of how such an error could come into exist and then expand to be universal. This is an <em>incredible</em> amount of work; any one of these points represents more work than this entire article and plausibly more work than this entire site. One could (and men have) spent entire careers working on small parts of the puzzle just outlined.</p>
          <p>It’s also bad from the rhetorical point of view: defending tobacco requires me to engage in what looks like <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer" data-link-icon="LW" data-link-icon-type="text" data-url-html="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer?format=preview&amp;theme=classic">partisan</a> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics" data-link-icon="LW" data-link-icon-type="text" data-url-html="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics?format=preview&amp;theme=classic">politics</a> &amp; revisionist history. It is challenging beliefs that are, rightly or wrongly, deeply entrenched. Many people have enough flexibility to think, even if a relative died horribly of lung cancer, that nicotine was only the addictive stimulating agent and the <em>real</em> killer was the smoke or the tar or something, and so are willing to consider that nicotine - on its own - might be useful. They are not willing to consider the whole package.</p>
          <p>You can see the difference in the tasks by comparing this one page to the multiple threads in Imminst alone with <em>scores</em> of pages in each. One is short and clear and easily evaluated on its own terms (I hope), and has met with neutral or positive reactions from everyone I’ve asked to read it; the other comes off as a crank laying out an entire worldview, filled with ad hominems, bad faith, and clearly has not changed anyone’s minds.</p>

              <p>It’s generally assumed that the tobacco industry held off regulation for so many decades simply because it spent so very much on lobbying; but lobbying isn’t omnipotent (look at Prohibition).

              <p>I was reading the Wikipedia nicotine article and thought that the figure cited for estimated American cases of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#bodyContent">ADHD</a> caused by nicotine - 500,000 - seemed remarkably high and suspected it and the previous sentence were not about nicotine at all, but tobacco. I was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicotine&amp;diff=523718473&amp;oldid=523176039" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicotine&amp;diff=523718473&amp;oldid=523176039#bodyContent">partially right</a>: both were about tobacco, but also lead! Sloppy work even for Wikipedia. I don’t think that any malice was involved, just the general assumption that ‘nicbacco’ is harmful and the distinction between nicotine and tobacco unimportant.</p>
              <p>Another example is a breathless media article <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/children-exposed-to-nicotine-in-utero-have-lower-reading-scores/" data-url-archive="/doc/www/scitechdaily.com/7459c763817f10b7b69dafe80664ba9fb85bffff.html">“Children Exposed to Nicotine in Utero Have Lower Reading Scores”</a> on <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nicotine/2012-cho.pdf" id="cho-et-al-2012" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="Prenatal Exposure to Nicotine and Impaired Reading Performance"><span><span><span title="et al">Cho</span> <span>et al</span> <span>2012</span></span></span></a>: here we can’t blame the media or Wikipedia editors because the paper itself (a longitudinal correlational study) has “nicotine” in its title and abstract (a total of 8 times), though the abstract quietly mentions it is <em>actually</em> a study of “maternal smoking”, and so of little interest to anyone interested in nicotine because there are hundreds or thousands of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding#bodyContent">confounding</a> substances in tobacco smoke (on top of what smoking while pregnant says about the mothers in the first place, something which is only partially controllable for); the authors construct a sort of nicotine exposure index based on daily cigarette consumption &amp; nicotine-content of brands, but as far as I can tell, they never analyze whether the results based on this index are the same as if they had analyzed it the same way for eg. total cigarettes smoked or total tar content. This is not to say that nicotine has no impact on developing brains (many useful drugs or stimulants are contraindicated for non-adults), but their results do not seem to warrant their description. I was amused in 2013 when a Pubmed alert brought me word of a 2013 paper led by Cho titled “Prenatal Exposure to Nicotine and Impaired Reading Performance”; besides the title, the abstract uses the word “nicotine” 7 times and “maternal smoking” just 1 time - and replicates the above procedure yet again. With research like this, is it any wonder that ‘nicbacco’ is alive and well in phrases like “nicotine-stained”?<a href="#fnref4" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

I totally get it.” Yet for years Quik has endured the skepticism and downright hostility of many of her fellow neuroscientists as she has published some three dozen studies revealing the actions of nicotine within the mammalian brain. “The whole problem with nicotine is that it happens to be found in cigarettes”, she told me. “People can’t disassociate the two in their mind, nicotine and smoking. It’s not the general public that annoys me, it’s the scientists. When I tell them about the studies, they should say, ‘Wow.’ But they say, ‘Oh well, that might be true, but I don’t see the point.’ It’s not even ignorance.

                <p>A study involving sixty-seven people with mild cognitive impairment, in which memory is slightly impaired but decision-making and other cognitive abilities remain within normal levels, found “significant nicotine-associated improvements in attention, memory, and psychomotor speed,” with excellent safety and tolerability….”…And we’ve seen absolutely no withdrawal symptoms. There doesn’t seem to be any abuse liability whatsoever in taking nicotine by patch in nonsmokers. That’s reassuring.” That’s not reassuring: it’s totally bizarre. Nicotine has routinely been described in news accounts as among the most addictive sub-stances known. As the New York Times Magazine famously put it in 1987, “nicotine is as addictive as heroin, cocaine or amphetamines, and for most people more addictive than alcohol.” But that’s just wrong. <em>Tobacco</em> may well be as addictive as heroin, crack, alcohol, and Cherry Garcia combined into one giant crazy sundae. But as laboratory scientists know, getting mice or other ani-mals hooked on nicotine all by its lonesome is dauntingly difficult. As a 2007 paper in the journal Neuropharmacology put it, “Tobacco use has one of the highest rates of addiction of any abused drug. Paradoxically, in animal models, nicotine appears to be a weak reinforcer.” That same study, like many others, found that other ingredients in tobacco smoke are necessary to amp up nicotine’s addictiveness. Those other chemical ingredients - things like acetaldehyde, anab-asine, nornicotine, anatabine, cotinine, and myosmine - help to keep people hooked on tobacco. On its own, nicotine isn’t enough.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>Watching TV for an average of six hours a day could shorten the viewer’s life expectancy by almost five years, indicates <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/46/16/1144.2.abstract" data-link-icon="bmj" data-link-icon-type="text,tri,sans">research published online in the <em>British Journal of Sports Medicine</em></a>. The impact rivals that of other well known behavioural risk factors, such as smoking and lack of exercise, the study suggests. Sedentary behaviour - as distinct from too little exercise - is associated with a higher risk of death, particularly from heart attack or stroke. Watching TV accounts for a substantial amount of sedentary activity, but its impact on life expectancy has not been assessed, say the authors. They used previously published data on the relationship between TV viewing time and death from analyses of the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab), as well as Australian national population and mortality figures for 2008, to construct a lifetime risk framework.</p>
                <p>…Based on these figures, and expected deaths from all causes, the authors calculated that an individual who spends a lifetime average of six hours a day watching TV can expect to live just under five fewer years than someone who does not watch TV. These figures compare with the impact of other well known lifestyle factors on the risk of death from cardiovascular disease after the age of 50, including physical activity and obesity. For example, other research has shown that lifelong smoking is associated with the shortening of life expectancy by more than 4 years after the age of 50, with the average loss of life from one cigarette calculated to be 11 minutes - equivalent to half an hour of TV watching, according to the authors’ risk framework.</p>

                <p>“People with memory loss should not start smoking or using nicotine patches by themselves because there are harmful effects of smoking and a medication such as nicotine should only be used with a doctor’s supervision,” Newhouse said. “But this study provides strong justification for further research into the use of nicotine for people with early signs of memory loss which may help us determine whether benefits persist over long periods of time and provide meaningful improvement.”</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>In human populations, cigarettes and alcohol generally serve as gateway drugs, which people use first before progressing to marijuana, cocaine, or other illicit substances. To understand the biological basis of the gateway sequence of drug use, we developed an animal model in mice and used it to study the effects of nicotine on subsequent responses to cocaine. We found that pretreatment of mice with nicotine increased the response to cocaine, as assessed by addiction-related behaviors and synaptic plasticity in the striatum, a brain region critical for addiction-related reward. Locomotor sensitization was increased by 98%, conditioned place preference was increased by 78%, and cocaine-induced reduction in long-term potentiation (LTP) was enhanced by 24%. The responses to cocaine were altered only when nicotine was administered first, and nicotine and cocaine were then administered concurrently. Reversing the order of drug administration was ineffective; cocaine had no effect on nicotine-induced behaviors and synaptic plasticity. Nicotine primed the response to cocaine by enhancing its ability to induce transcriptional activation of the FosB gene through inhibition of histone deacetylase, which caused global histone acetylation in the striatum. We tested this conclusion further and found that a histone deacetylase inhibitor simulated the actions of nicotine by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-html="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)#bodyContent">priming</a> the response to cocaine and enhancing FosB gene expression and LTP depression in the nucleus accumbens. Conversely, in a genetic mouse model characterized by reduced histone acetylation, the effects of cocaine on LTP were diminished. We achieved a similar effect by infusing a low dose of theophylline, an activator of histone deacetylase, into the nucleus accumbens. These results from mice prompted an analysis of epidemiological data, which indicated that most cocaine users initiate cocaine use after the onset of smoking and while actively still smoking, and that initiating cocaine use after smoking increases the risk of becoming dependent on cocaine, consistent with our data from mice. If our findings in mice apply to humans, a decrease in smoking rates in young people would be expected to lead to a decrease in cocaine addiction.</p>

Despite the large number of patients in the analysis, few adverse cardiovascular outcomes (myocardial infarction, stroke, tachycardia, arrhythmia, angina) were reported, and no excess of these outcomes was detected among patients assigned to nicotine-patch use. The incidences of several minor adverse effects were clearly elevated among the nicotine-patch groups, especially sleep disturbances, nausea or vomiting, localised skin irritation and respiratory symptoms, but the background rates and risk ratios varied considerably across studies. The incidence of nausea or vomiting appeared to be lowest when the patch dose was tapered. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that very large studies would be needed to assess the effect of the patch, if any, on serious, rare outcomes.</p>

              <p>It can be entertaining to read nicotine research papers - the reviews especially resemble a bad-news-good-news comedy sketch where for every couple pieces of good news, there’s bad news. (One rather wonders, if nicotine is doing all these helpful things, what the mortality rate would be for nicotine-<em>free</em> cigarettes.) For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2750958/" id="gahring-rogers-2006" data-link-icon="nlm-ncbi" data-link-icon-type="svg" title="'Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expression and function on nonneuronal cells', Gahring &amp; Rogers 2006">“Neuronal Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Expression and Function on Nonneuronal Cells”</a><span>, <span><span>Gahring &amp; Rogers</span><span>2006</span></span>:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>Of the thousands of proven carcinogens and toxic agents contained within a cigarette, nicotine, while being the addictive agent, is often viewed as the least harmful of these compounds.</p>
                <p>Subsequent studies<sup>2-4</sup> have suggested that chronic nicotine administration might in fact play a beneficial role in slowing the progression of this disease. While this finding is controversial, there is now ample evidence supporting a therapeutic benefit from nicotine in Parkinson’s<sup>5</sup> disease, and as a neuroprotectant to toxic insults such as excitotoxins<sup>6-10</sup> or Beta-amyloid derived peptides.<sup>10-12</sup> Understanding the mechanistic basis for these and other similarly interesting findings,13 including a cognitive benefit from nicotine,<sup>2</sup> would be of obvious importance….This extended expression of nAChRs is of importance because, in addition to their regulation by endogenous agonists such as acetylcholine, choline, and the exogenous compound nicotine, their impact upon peripheral processes can be quite diverse as exemplified by their ability to in some cases enhance (Crohn’s disease) disease or in other cases diminish (ulcerative colitis) progression.<sup>17-20</sup>…While smoking is a major causative factor for lung cancer, relatively few smokers generate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which has an incidence rate of ~20%, even among very heavy and long-term smokers.<sup>61</sup></p>
                <p>…While nicotine has anti-inflammatory properties in this disease, the therapeutic value of nicotine does not exceed that of more conventional treatments such as aminosalicylates.<sup>48</sup></p>
                <p>Therefore, while cells are present that are primed for activation, the immune and inflammatory response may be dampened, as has been observed in many smokers.<sup>62</sup> Expanding upon this possibility, Floto and Smith<sup>64</sup> suggested that the inflammatory response to the stimulatory components of tobacco may be counteracted by the anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine, which offers a rational explanation for why few smokers generate pulmonary Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis. It has also been pointed out that there is a significantly lower incidence of sarcoidosis in smokers<sup>65</sup> and decreased incidence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) precipitins that develop during allergic alveolitis as occurs both in humans and guinea pigs.<sup>66,67</sup>…A notable outcome of this effect may be that the anti-inflammatory properties of nicotine actually enhance the survival of influenza virus in mice and induce significantly higher titers of virus following infection.<sup>63</sup> Pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumonia, is also more frequent in smokers.<sup>90</sup>…While nicotine may inhibit macrophage function to promote pneumonia, it has also been reported that the generation of hypersensitivity pneumonia (HP) is lower in smokers than nonsmokers. HP is caused by inhalation of antigens such as Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, which induces farmer ’s lung (once contracted, however, smoking worsens disease).</p>

</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Spray is a small debugger for C code that comes with minimal mental overhead. All functionality aims to be simple and easy to grasp.</p>
<p dir="auto">In Spray you can easily control the execution of running programs, and inspect and modify their state.</p>
<p dir="auto">I started work on Spray out of curiosity about the mysterious inner workings of debuggers. In addition, I want to explore ways in which debugging can be made more approachable.</p>

</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-️-installation" dir="auto"><a href="#️-installation">💿️ Installation</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Parts of the Spray frontend are written in Scheme and embedded into the application using <a href="https://www.call-cc.org/" rel="nofollow">CHICKEN Scheme</a> which compiles Scheme to C. Currently, you need to have <a href="https://code.call-cc.org/#download" rel="nofollow">CHICKEN installed</a> to build Spray. In the future it's possible that the generated C files are provided instead so that you only need a C compiler.</p>
<p dir="auto">Spray depends on <a href="https://github.com/davea42/libdwarf-code/releases">libdwarf</a>
so if you want to build Spray, you need to install libdwarf first. Then, to install Spray you clone this repository and run <code>make</code>. Note the you
have to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4438292" rel="nofollow">clone all the submodules</a> too.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/d4ckard/spray.git
cd spray
make"><pre>git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/d4ckard/spray.git
<span>cd</span> spray
make</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The compiled binary is named <code>spray</code> and can be found in the <code>build</code> directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use <code>spray</code> as a regular command you need to <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/322773" rel="nofollow">add it to your <code>$PATH</code></a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-️-running-spray" dir="auto"><a href="#️-running-spray">🏃‍♀️ Running Spray</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Ensure that the binary you want to debug has debug information enabled, i.e. it was compiled with the <code>-g</code> flag. Also, you should disable all compile-time optimizations to ensure the best output.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Spray is only tested using Clang. The debug information generated by different compilers for the same piece of code varies. Thus, <code>clang</code> should be used to compile the programs you want to debug using Spray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The first argument you pass to <code>spray</code> is the name of the binary that should be debugged (the debugee). All subsequent arguments are the arguments passed to the debugee.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="clang -g examples/free_uninit.c
spray a.out"><pre>clang -g examples/free_uninit.c
spray a.out</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">starts a debugging session with the executable <code>a.out</code>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-️-commands" dir="auto"><a href="#️-commands">⌨️ Commands</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Spray's REPL offers the following commands to interact with a running program.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-reading-and-writing-values" dir="auto"><a href="#reading-and-writing-values">Reading and writing values</a></h3>
<table>

    <tr>
        <td rowspan="3"><code>print</code>, <code>p</code></td>
        <td><code>&lt;variable&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Print the value of the runtime variable.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;register&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Print the value of the register.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;address&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Print the value of the program's memory at the address.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="3"><code>set</code>, <code>t</code></td>
        <td><code>&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Set the value of the runtime variable.</td>

    <tr>
	<td><code>&lt;address&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code></td>
        <td>Set the value of the program's memory at the address.</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p dir="auto">Register names are prefixed with a <code>%</code>, akin to the AT&amp;T assembly syntax. This avoids name conflicts between register names and variable names. For example, to read the value of <code>rax</code>, use <code>print %rax</code>. You can find a table of all available register names in <code>src/registers.h</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">A <code>&lt;value&gt;</code> can be a hexadecimal or a decimal number. The default is base 10 and hexadecimal will only be chosen if the literal contains a character that's exclusive to base 16 (i.e. one of a - f). You can prefix the literal with <code>0x</code> to explicitly use hexadecimal in cases where decimal would work as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">An <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> is always a hexadecimal number. The prefix <code>0x</code> is again optional.</p>

        <td></td>
        <td>Continue execution until the next breakpoint.</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p dir="auto">It's possible that the location passed to <code>break</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>print</code>, or <code>set</code> is both a valid function name and a valid hexadecimal address. For example, <code>add</code> could refer to a function called <code>add</code> and the number <code>0xadd</code>. In such a case, the default is to interpret the location as a function name. Use the prefix <code>0x</code> to explicitly specify an address.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-filters" dir="auto"><a href="#filters">Filters</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">The <code>print</code> and <code>set</code> commands can be followed by a filter, to change how output is displayed. For example, if you want to inspect the binary data in the rdx register, you can enter <code>print %rdx | bin</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Filters are separated from the command by a pipe symbol: <code>&lt;command&gt; '|' &lt;filter&gt;</code>. Currently, only one filter can be used at a time.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following table shows how different filters format the same 64-bit word with the value 103.</p>

It's been an exciting week in the KDE space as along with <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/KDE-Plasma-6-Alpha">releasing Plasma 6.0 Alpha</a>, they have also committed to shipping Plasma 6.0 with the Wayland session being enabled by default.
</p><p>
Plasma 6.0 will still have X11 support but out-of-the-box it will attempt to use the Wayland session. Prominent KDE developer Nate Graham shared this highlight along with other interesting KDE achievements for this past week:
</p><p>
- KDE Plasma 6.0 will be Wayland by default. The remaining blocker bugs are being addressed and the developers feel it's good enough to have the Wayland session by default for Plasma 6.0.
</p><p>
- An overhaul to the Breeze app style.
</p><p>
- Preliminary support for playing HDR-capable games on HDR-capable displays with the Plasma Wayland session.
</p><p>

    <p>My story, and how this is all possible</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction:</h3>

<p>This post will be relatively long, and not of the technical or humorous content that I hope to write in the future,
  simply because the tl;dr just doesn’t cut it here. You don’t just throw out words like “dev-log from my prison cell” and not
  follow through with a story… Not if you expect anyone to read your blog anyway :P</p>

<p>My name is Preston Thorpe, I’m 31 years old and I’ve spent just under 10 years of my life in Prison (all for non-violent drug crimes.)
  I am currently incarcerated at Mountain View Correctional Facility in Charleston, Maine. More importantly, far more importantly, I am a software developer,
  open source maintainer, contributor and all around enthusiast. I am a Rust fanatic (and currently rather <code>Ocaml</code> curious), and I am one of those
  Arch linux(btw), Neovim, Alacritty, Tmux, tiling window manager loving geeks that do everything possible from the command line.</p>

<p>Idk who will even end up reading this, but thats the whole idea of blogs right? Ideally maybe the Primeagen will read it at some point,
  I feel like it’s right up his alley. I have lots of respect for him, I really appreciate him sharing his own story and particularly the message
  of working hard for what you want, and also to stay away from bullshit/drugs. He has actually been a pretty big inspiration for me in the tech world
  and I’ve been following him for over a year now. So on the off-chance that you’re reading this: Thanks for being the only source of entertainment I’ve
  allowed myself for the last year+.</p>

<p><strong>Anyway…</strong></p>

<p>The (relatively) short version: I was a stupid 17yr old computer geek, spending my highschool years in the ‘05-‘09 warez and torrent scenes(r.i.p. oink.cd) and was kicked out of my parents house for being a stupid 17yr old like many kids are, but instead of ending up broke and homeless sleeping in my car or on couches (I did that for a bit too though), and coming back to Mom + Dad’s apologetic, as I’m sure was their plan; I ended up stumbling head-first into the world of the pre silk-road/Dark-web internet wholesale drugs. This was a place where chemicals could be bought for pennies from sketchy companies in India, China, and there were vendors in Canada, Holland, Germany, etc that sold bulk of whatever you wanted all by email referral.</p>

<p>So instead of coming back home broke and apologetic, I ended up trafficking pretty enormous amounts of stuff into the country and making tens of thousands of
dollars a week, very much unapologetically. At age 20, I was arrested the first time. I was caught (mostly) with MDMA coming in the mail from Vancouver.
Fortunately for me, this was my first offense, otherwise I’m sure they would have been happy to charge me for the many many more packages they probably could have
proved that I had received.</p>

<p><strong>Prison:</strong></p>

<p>I have found that I adapt pretty well to just about whatever situation I happen to be put in, Prison was no different. Although, these people were very different
from the hippie/raver/music festival people I dealt with on the street. These people were hardcore addicts, who many of were into crimes and a lifestyle that I
had no part of. The thing about prison is that it has its own sub-culture, it’s own lingo, it’s own set of morality.. and this is enforced by an extremely negative
group-think, strict mindset that we are criminals: we hate cops, we hate rats, pedophiles, thieves(only if you steal from other inmates, you can steal whatever
you want from any grandma on the street) and anyone that has ever “PC”‘d (asked for Protective Custody due to fear of violence from another inmate(s)).
This mindset is strictly enforced on everyone living in population, and spending a few years around such negativity will change anyone. In prison, there is
nothing to do: except get tattoos, work out, and wait for some kind of drama to unfold so you can either watch something go down, or participate in it.</p>

<p>A few years later, I left prison with $0 in my pocket (lawyers and commissary are expensive, and nobody pays you what they owe you when you come in),
to a rooming house with hallways that smelled like crack-smoke and were filled with parole officers and junkies. I was left with the difficult choice
of either living there and walking to a temp agency with hopes of making $10.50/hour doing manual labor (without an ID or social security card at this point),
or getting on a bus to NYC to see some associates, and coming back in a week or so with $15-25k in my pocket and living in comfy luxury hotels until
I could rent an apartment… I chose the latter, obviously, and was back in prison after 14mo.</p>

<p>I have been incarcerated now on this sentence since May of 2017, I came in with a terrible attitude, a terrible outlook on life, and no hope for my future.
I have spent almost 3 years all-together in 22-23hr solitary confinement over the years (10% of my life?), and at one point I had truly become one of the people
that looked at me when I first came to prison at age 20, and asked “Is this your first bid?”, to which everyone replies “first? I”m not coming back here!”,
to which there is always laughter from the older heads. Everyone says that, but everyone comes back…</p>

<p><strong>Growing up:</strong></p>

<p>My shenanigans and the ‘influence’ I had in the relatively small prison system that I came from, ended up getting me put on an inter-state transfer list
after 13mo in solitary confinement (for no disciplinary action.) “Safety and security of the facility” is the official reason it says on my classification
paperwork. Little did I know, this would be the best thing that would ever happen to me.</p>

<p>Because I had no disciplinary action, and I guess very some fortunate timing, I got transferred to Maine, which is not a state that I thought was even
an option as it does not have a reputation for taking ‘problem’ inmates from other states.</p>

<p>The prison system in Maine is different from all others, as the inmate population is insulated from most of the street/prison gangs that generally run
things. Not having to deal with the Politics and the drama was refreshing, and a bit of a shock at first. Quickly I realized that my time could just be
spent on myself, trying to improve my life or just do what I wanted with my time. I began to focus my time on things like teaching myself about organic chemistry, and finance, options trading, and I began for the first time to realize that I might be capable of more than what I had resided on, and that I could end doing whatever I put my mind to.</p>

<p>I had previously accepted my fate, as one must when you get a 10+ year sentence, otherwise you’ll go insane constantly thinking about what you could have done different or what you could have been doing with your life. But I had accepted my fate, as a criminal. I had accepted the identity, and the lifestyle, and the misery, and the mindset that comes along with it.</p>

<p>One day, I woke up and looked around me, and had what can only be described as an epiphany. All of a sudden, all the conversations I would hear about drugs
and war stories, all just sounded like absolute bullshit to me, and I was suddenly ashamed that I ever participated in it. From that point, I no longer
felt like it was okay or normal that I was locked up in a cage, and the acceptance and self-identity as being a ‘criminal’ no longer felt like something
I was okay with.</p>

<p>When it was available to me, I enrolled in College through the University of Maine Augusta, and before classes even started, I was completely enthralled
with the idea of learning how to program again (it had been 15 years since I had done some PHP + simple websites, so not a lot had left over). Who else
has an opportunity to spend 12+ hours a day learning something for years? With no other obligations or responsibilities? It all of a sudden clicked,
that I would dedicate the remainder of my time to learning everything I could about computer science, and teaching myself software development.</p>

<p>During the pandemic, staff were sympathetic to the residents here, who were unable to see loved ones, and unable to spend their time on the internet
when everything was shut down and we were locked in our rooms like they had. This brought about the internet being brought into a prison system,
for probably the first time in the country. Being technically inclined, led me the opportunity to work for the education department and I ended up
helping considerably in getting things working properly. And I still do.</p>

<p>After helping with the network for some time and implementing some software solutions for the DOC, when I asked for permission to seek remote
employment, they obliged. I was one of the first people in the country to to be allowed to be on “remote work-release” from a medium security prison.</p>

<p>I believe this highlights the fact that you cannot take opportunities that you are not given, and I would <em>never</em> 
be in the position I am now: a completely changed man, working full-time from my cell, with a career doing what I
love not only programming, but also helping improve the system.(<a href="https://unlockedlabs.org/">details</a>); if this opportunity wasn’t given to me in
the form of a laptop and limited internet access. This is an incredibly rare situation, Maine is the <em>only</em> state in
the country where these particular opportunities exist at all (and for a limited number of residents, currently just
those enrolled in College, and there are many restrictions).</p>

<p>I would like to bring whatever awareness possible to the importance of education and rehabilitation for those
2.2 million Americans currently incarcerated (particularly those affected by the war on drugs, like myself, who
has spent 1/3 of his life imprisoned for non-violent drug crimes). Access to education and technology is severely
limited in the U.S. prison system and I am incredibly fortunate to be in a situation where I am permitted to have
remote employment and access to participate in things like Open source projects.</p>

<p>I am very grateful for the opportunity, but I recognize that this is very much the exception and not the rule, and the
success of the Maine model of corrections should highlight the absolutely embarrassing lack of opportunities in the rest
of the system, to do anything but become a bitter, broke criminal; deprived of not just your freedom, family, financial
security and reputation, but also of your self-identity as someone worth investing in changing. We need to do better as a
society, and understand that, yes, there are people in the system that deserve this kind of punishment, but a large majority
of our prison population are just regular people… non-violent drug offenders like myself. There are plenty more, like me,
that are capable of being responsible, productive, tax paying members of society if given the opportunity, but you cannot
expect anyone to change when you just lock them up in a cage with a bunch of other criminals where there is a subculture of 
endless negativity.</p>

<p>If you are interested in helping support the education of incarcerated and justice-impacted individuals, please consider donating to a company like the one I currently work for, <a href="https://unlockedlabs.org/">Unlocked Labs</a> or similar non-profits like <a href="https://thelastmile.org/">The Last Mile</a> or <a href="https://www.recidiviz.org/">Recidiviz</a> that are working to improve the system of mass-incarceration and provide opportunities for the incarcerated to learn and grow.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this…</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Exclusive</span> Facebook-owner Meta and Google's YouTube now face criminal complaints in Ireland for alleged unlawful surveillance of EU citizens via tracking scripts.</p>
<p>Privacy consultant Alexander Hanff, who has occasionally <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/Author/Alexander-Hanff">contributed</a> to <em>The Register</em>, has challenged Meta's collection of data without explicit consent under Ireland's computer abuse law. He told <em>The Register</em> he's also in the process of filing a similar criminal complaint against YouTube over its use of scripts to detect ad blocking extensions in people's web browsers.</p>
<p>"I have notified Pearse Street <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.garda.ie/en/">Garda</a> that I want to give a statement to them for the purpose of the criminal complaint and will be sending them additional information over the weekend," Hanff told us last night. "They have got back in touch this afternoon acknowledging the complaint and asking for further information."</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I want to give a statement to them for the purpose of the criminal complaint and will be sending them additional information over the weekend</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two weeks ago, Hanff <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/26/privacy_advocate_challenges_youtube/">filed a civil complaint</a> to the Irish Data Protection Commission against YouTube's browser interrogation system, which detects ad blocking software and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/06/youtube_ad_blockers_opinion/">refuses to play</a> videos unless adverts are allowed or subscription money handed over. The regulators are right now waiting on a reply from Google to provide an update on the status of that claim.</p>
<p>Pointing to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/01/eu_data_meta_networking/">decisions</a> by courts and data protection authorities in Europe that have disallowed behavioral advertising without explicit consent, Hanff argues that Meta has been processing data for behavioral ad targeting without a legal basis to do so for at least the past five years. And thus it follows, he says, that deploying and executing scripts that monitor behavior and gather data, is also unlawful.</p>

    

<p>"Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd for a period of not less than five years from May 25, 2018 to present, illegally deployed surveillance technology to my computers for the purpose of monitoring my behavior, as they had no reasonable excuse or lawful authority to do so," Hanff alleged to <em>The Register</em>.</p>

        


        

<p>Meta also during those years "illegally intercepted transmission of data within an information system (my computing devices) for the purpose of monitoring my behavior," he further alleged.</p>
<p>The Instagram giant has a variety of advertising, analytics, and tracking scripts and they change periodically, but one example would be the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/">Meta Pixel</a>, which Meta describes as "a snippet of JavaScript code that allows you to track visitor activity on your website."</p>

        

<p>Hanff believes these activities fall under Ireland's computer abuse law, specifically Sections 2 and 5 of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/act/11/enacted/en/print#sec2">Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Act 2017</a>.</p>
<p>Section 2 says, "A person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, intentionally accesses an information system by infringing a security measure shall be guilty of an offense."</p>
<p>And Section 5 says, "A person who, without lawful authority, intentionally intercepts any transmission (other than a public transmission) of data to, from or within an information system (including any electromagnetic emission from such an information system carrying such data), shall be guilty of an offense."</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Meta deploying scripts for the purpose of surveillance despite my Do Not Track setting and without any consent would constitute a criminal offense</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hanff claimed Meta's processing of personal data for the purpose of behavioral advertising has been unlawful since GDPR took effect on May 25, 2018.</p>
<p>"As you know from the letter I received from the European Commission in relation to the detection of ad blockers – Do Not Track (DNT) is regarded as a setting or other application within the web browser to signal denial of consent as per Recital 66 of 2009/136 (Citizens’ Rights Directive) as such given that I have DNT enabled (and always have had) Meta deploying scripts to my terminal equipment for the purpose of surveillance of my activities (behavioral profiling) despite my DNT setting and without any consent would be a breach of Section 2 above and therefore constitute a criminal offense," Hanff claimed.</p>

        

<p>"Meta Platforms Ireland were not authorized to deploy these scripts to my devices and should have known they were not authorized to do so as a result of the Do Not Track signal sent from my browser."</p>
<p>Pointing to Section 5, Hanff alleged that since the deployment of the scripts was illegal and Meta circumvented the DNT signal when it deployed those scripts, it's clear any interception of behavior within his device (mouse movements, clicks, and so on), would also be illegal.</p>

</ul>
<p>With regard to YouTube, Hanff said the issue is essentially the same except that it involves YouTube's attempts to detect ad blocking software using scripts.</p>
<p>"I consider YouTube’s script to be spyware – aka surveillance technology, as it is deployed without my knowledge or authorization to my device for the sole purpose of intercepting and monitoring my behavior (whether or not ads load in my browser or are blocked by an ad blocker)," he explained.</p>
<p>"I chose to go down the criminal complaint route because historically, EU regulators have been absolutely terrible at enforcing the ePrivacy Directive – and I mean really bad, I would argue even negligent; and as someone who has been fighting these issues for 15 years under the ePrivacy Directive, I decided to change tactics and pursue action under criminal law as I am not willing to wait another 15 years for regulators to do their job and enforce the law – neither can I afford the risk of incredibly high costs by pursuing civil litigation which would take years and see Google and Meta drown me with legal fees."</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I am not willing to wait another 15 years for regulators to do their job and enforce the law</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He expressed skepticism when asked about the adequacy of settable browser flags like Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control to deal with unwelcome data gathering. Consent for any non-necessary code interaction – scripts, analytics, third-party fonts, and so on – should be the norm, as required under EU law, he argued.</p>
<p>Hanff said his hope is that filing these complaints will send a clear message to corporations that they need to stop deploying surveillance technologies on people's devices.</p>
<p>"Additionally, the Irish law I am using holds directors, managers or other officers who willfully cause such an offense to be committed (through policy or authorization, for example) liable of the same offense and are not shielded by the legal entity they work for," he said.</p>
<p>"It is my hope that such a liability might force corporate officers to reconsider signing off on illegal behavior under a fear of liability as clearly these decisions are being made by someone and they need to know they can and will be held to account."</p>
<h3>Why now</h3>
<p>As to the timing, Hanff said there's been a shift over the past 24 months in the actions taken to curtail behavioral advertising and online surveillance, pointing to decisions affecting Meta and TikTok. But he suggests more pressure should be applied because the regulatory process moves too slowly and the financial penalties have been to small to change corporate behavior.</p>
<p>"Regulators have let us down and are absolutely (in my opinion) partly responsible for the erosion of our fundamental rights and the expansion of these illegal behaviors, by failing to do their jobs and take strong enforcement action against violators," he claimed.</p>
<p>"As a result, it is now considered as the normal way to conduct online business, which is an incredibly bad reflection of the regulators and has significantly eroded trust of the public that their complaints will ever be dealt with at all – let alone in a meaningful way."</p>
<p>"This needs to change," Hanff continued. "For example, I have had a complaint with CNIL since 2019 against Withings – an incredibly simple complaint to deal with (the law and case law is incredibly clear on the issue I have complained about) yet still there has not been any result – and I see this with all of the complaints I have lodged with supervisory authorities across the EU since 2018. It is not acceptable and cannot continue."</p>
<p>Meta and Google declined to comment. We've also asked the Irish cops for further comment. ®</p>

    <h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">The Go Blog</a></h2>
    

    
      
      
      
      <p><img src="https://go.dev/doc/gopher/gopherdrink.png" height="219" width="223"></p><p>Today we celebrate the fourteenth birthday of the Go open source release!
Go has had a great year, with two feature-filled releases and other important milestones.</p>
<p>We released <a href="https://go.dev/blog/go1.20">Go 1.20 in February</a>
and <a href="https://go.dev/blog/go1.21">Go 1.21 in August</a>,
focusing more on implementation improvements
than new language changes.</p>
<p>Profile-guided optimization (PGO),
<a href="https://go.dev/blog/pgo-preview">previewed in Go 1.20</a>
and
<a href="https://go.dev/blog/pgo">released in Go 1.21</a>,
allows the Go compiler to read a profile of your program
and then spend more time optimizing the parts
of your program that run most often.
In Go 1.21, workloads typically get between
2% and 7% CPU usage improvements from enabling PGO.
See “<a href="https://go.dev/blog/pgo">Profile-guided optimization in Go 1.21</a>” for an overview
and the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/pgo" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">profile-guided optimization user guide</a>
for complete documentation.</p>
<p>Go has provided support for gathering coverage profiles during <code>go test</code>
<a href="https://go.dev/blog/cover">since Go 1.2</a>.
Go 1.20 added support for gathering coverage profiles in binaries
built by <code>go build</code>,
allowing you to gather coverage during larger integration tests as well.
See “<a href="https://go.dev/blog/integration-test-coverage">Code coverage for Go integration tests</a>” for details.</p>
<p>Compatibility has been an important part of Go since
“<a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">Go 1 and the Future of Go Programs</a>”.
Go 1.21 improved compatibility further
by expanding the conventions for use of GODEBUG
in situations where we need to make a change,
such as an important bug fix,
that must be permitted but may still break existing programs.
See the blog post
“<a href="https://go.dev/blog/compat">Backward Compatibility, Go 1.21, and Go 2</a>”
for an overview and
the documentation
“<a href="https://go.dev/doc/godebug">Go, Backwards Compatibility, and GODEBUG</a>” for details.</p>
<p>Go 1.21 also shipped support for built-in toolchain management,
allowing you to change which version of the
Go toolchain you use in a specific module
as easily as you change the versions of other dependencies.
See the blog post
“<a href="https://go.dev/blog/toolchain">Forward Compatibility and Toolchain Management in Go 1.21</a>”
for an overview and the documentation
“<a href="https://go.dev/doc/toolchain">Go Toolchains</a>”
for details.</p>
<p>Another important tooling achievement was the
integration of on-disk indexes into
gopls, the Go LSP server.
This cut gopls’s startup latency and memory usage by 3-5X
in typical use cases.
“<a href="https://go.dev/blog/gopls-scalability">Scaling gopls for the growing Go ecosystem</a>”
explains the technical details.
You can make sure you’re running the latest gopls by running:</p>
<pre><code>go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
</code></pre>
<p>Go 1.21 introduced new
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/cmp/">cmp</a>,
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/maps/">maps</a>,
and
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/slices/">slices</a>
packages — Go’s first generic standard libraries —
as well as expanding the set of comparable types.
For details about that, see the blog post
“<a href="https://go.dev/blog/comparable">All your comparable types</a>”.</p>
<p>Overall, we continue to refine generics
and to write talks and blog posts explaining
important details.
Two notable posts this year were
“<a href="https://go.dev/blog/deconstructing-type-parameters">Deconstructing Type Parameters</a>”,
and
“<a href="https://go.dev/blog/type-inference">Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Type Inference – And a Little Bit More</a>”.</p>
<p>Another important new package in Go 1.21 is
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/log/slog/">log/slog</a>,
which adds an official API for
structured logging to the standard library.
See “<a href="https://go.dev/blog/slog">Structured logging with slog</a>” for an overview.</p>
<p>For the WebAssembly (Wasm) port, Go 1.21 shipped support
for running on WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) preview 1.
WASI preview 1 is a new “operating system” interface for Wasm
that is supported by most server-side Wasm environments.
See “<a href="https://go.dev/blog/wasi">WASI support in Go</a>” for a walkthrough.</p>
<p>On the security side, we are continuing to make sure
Go leads the way in helping developers understand their
dependencies and vulnerabilities,
with <a href="https://go.dev/blog/govulncheck">Govulncheck 1.0 launching in July</a>.
If you use VS Code, you can run govulncheck directly in your
editor using the Go extension:
see <a href="https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/govulncheck-ide" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> to get started.
And if you use GitHub, you can run govulncheck as part of
your CI/CD, with the
<a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/golang-govulncheck-action" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub Action for govulncheck</a>.
For more about checking your dependencies for vulnerability problems,
see this year’s Google I/O talk,
“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSt6FhsPT8c&amp;ab_channel=TheGoProgrammingLanguage" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Build more secure apps with Go and Google</a>”.)</p>
<p>Another important security milestone was
Go 1.21’s highly reproducible toolchain builds.
See “<a href="https://go.dev/blog/rebuild">Perfectly Reproducible, Verified Go Toolchains</a>” for details,
including a demonstration of reproducing an Ubuntu Linux Go toolchain
on a Mac without using any Linux tools at all.</p>
<p>It has been a busy year!</p>
<p>In Go’s 15th year, we’ll keep working to make Go the best environment
for software engineering at scale.
One change we’re particularly excited about is
redefining for loop <code>:=</code> semantics to remove the
potential for accidental aliasing bugs.
See “<a href="https://go.dev/blog/loopvar-preview">Fixing For Loops in Go 1.22</a>”
for details,
including instructions for previewing this change in Go 1.21.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you">Thank You!</h2>
<p>The Go project has always been far more than just us on the Go team at Google.
Thank you to all our contributors and everyone in the Go community for
making Go what it is today.
We wish you all the best in the year ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Heard of the <a href="https://sovereigntechfund.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sovereign Tech Fund</a>? I hadn’t, but the GNOME project has bagged itself a whopping €1 million investment from them.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/2023/11/09/gnome-recognized-as-public-interest-infrastructure/">GNOME plans</a> to use the cash to <em>“modernize the platform, improve tooling and accessibility, and support features that are in the public interest”</em>, adding that the following projects and initiatives will benefit directly during 2024: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Improve the current state of accessibility</strong></li>



<li><strong>Design and prototype a new accessibility stack</strong></li>



<li><strong>Encrypt user home directories individually</strong></li>



<li><strong>Modernize secrets storage</strong></li>



<li><strong>Increase the range and quality of hardware support</strong></li>



<li><strong>Invest in Quality Assurance and Developer Experience</strong></li>



<li><strong>Expand and broaden freedesktop APIs</strong></li>



<li><strong>Consolidate and improve platform component</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Whether you’ve been using Linux for a fresh minute or a veritable eon you’ll know GNOME is a core pillar in the FOSS movement.</p>



<p>GNOME is the default desktop environment in the most popular Linux distributions,&nbsp;its apps are used by millions of people worldwide,&nbsp;and GNOME-backed technologies underpin experiences across a dizzying array of devices, platforms, and industries.  </p>



<p>With the Sovereign Tech Fund’s aim of supporting the <em>“…development, improvement and maintenance of open digital infrastructure”</em>, its synergies with the GNOME project are clear.</p>

<p>The Sovereign Tech Fund is a German government-funded initiative run by Adriana Groh and Fiona Krakenbürg,&nbsp;who have ‘many years of experience in promoting open-source technologies’ at national and international levels. </p>



<p>On its website, the Fund notes: <em>“…the open source ecosystem, while incredibly successful, is also increasingly fragile. Many more people are using the software than contributing to it. It is time to invest in digital commons, volunteer communities and [open source] to build the digital world we want to see.”</em></p>



<p>Previous recipients of investment from the fund include curl, Fortran, WireGuard, OpenSSH, the Yocto Project, and a collaboration with OpenJS Foundation to ‘<a href="https://sovereigntechfund.de/en/projects/verbesserung-der-infrastruktur-und-sicherheit-des-javascript-okosystems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve Javascript Ecosystem Infrastructure and Security</a>‘.</p>



<p>So while I might not have heard of it, I’m glad I have. The Sovereign Tech Fund supports open-source infrastructure in the most critical way: with money. </p>



<h3>Funding Our Futures</h3>



<p>This is a major win for the GNOME project, for open-source, and for all of us who use and rely on the technologies it oversees. </p>



<p>With this investment, GNOME will be able to further focus on the things it does well, develop new features, and make it easier for people to contribute to the project. </p>



<p>Great stuff!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>On Call</span> Friday is here, and perhaps your temper is a little frayed. Which is why <em>The Register</em> always opens the last day of the working week with a fresh installment of On Call, our reader-contributed tales of exciting incidents on the front lines of tech support.</p>
<p>This week's tale comes from a reader we'll Regomize as "Bruce" because his story concerns his time working for an Australian bank's internet infrastructure team.</p>
<p>Bruce joined when internet banking was in its infancy, so his team was growing fast. So was their workload.</p>

    

<p>"We controlled/owned/looked after everything from ISDN link to the cable that was connected to the network team's internal switch," Bruce explained.</p>

        


        

<p>But Bruce and his colleagues still had time for planning. And one day he was assessing current user numbers vs demand vs link capacity, then the trends for future numbers, and realized it would not be long before that ISDN link was more than half saturated.</p>
<p>With internet banking taking off, the risks were obvious. So Bruce and his mates put together a position paper explaining why ordering another ISDN line was a good idea and gave it to the CIO for approval.</p>

        

<p>This was vastly sensible – in those days ordering an internet link could take months, so Bruce knew that getting this order in ASAP was essential.</p>
<p>The CIO forwarded the request to the bank's Executive Committee, which promptly rejected it because it was clearly wasteful to buy an extra link when the current one wasn't even half-used!</p>
<p>Bruce and his colleagues were scolded for their wasteful ways.</p>

        

<p>Once usage ticked past 50 percent, the IT team again made a pitch for an ISDN order. And were again rebuffed – with instructions not to ask again until utilization was nudging 100 percent.</p>
<p>Bruce knew what would happen at that point: the connection would max out, user experience would become dire, and IT would be blamed for the bank's failed entry into the world of internet banking.</p>
<p>He also imagined being dragged out while on call to fix the inevitable network errors. And then being reamed for the extra cost of having the ISDN link installed as a rush job.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/27/on_call/">Ask a builder to fix a server and out come the vastly inappropriate power tools</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/20/on_call/">Making the problem go away is not the same thing as fixing it</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/13/on_call/">Workload written by student made millions, ran on unsupported hardware, with zero maintenance</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/06/on_call/">Police ignored the laws of datacenter climate control</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The IT team hatched a cunning plan to make this the executives' problem.</p>
<p>"The suits and their associated hangers-on all resided on one floor of Head Office with their own subnet of IPs," Bruce explained. That network topography made it a simple task to throttle their connection.</p>
<p>"The first week, we throttled them down ten percent. Each successive week we withdrew another ten percent," Bruce confessed.</p>
<p>After a month of these shenanigans, the IT team again requested the additional ISDN line.</p>
<p>It was approved – along with the extra payment for expedited installation, and an explanation that if the suits could understand the frustration of slow connections, customers would also chafe.</p>
<p>Once the new line was connected, the IT team removed the throttle, "and left the suits to congratulate themselves on fixing the 'internet problem'."</p>

<p>This is a website that will help you find a private or deleted YouTube video if you have the link.</p>
<p><b>If you don't have the link, this site won't help you.</b></p>
<p>Copy the link and paste it into the box above. Then click "Search for Captures".
Some of the services this website queries are slow, so be patient.</p>
<p>
Once all the services have been queried, the results will appear. The results section
shows the name of each service, and whether the service has the video or not.
A link to the archived material will be provided if there is one. If there isn't,
there should be some extra text provided that sheds some light on how to retrieve it.
</p>
<p><b>Metadata</b> is information about the video. This includes the title and description.</p>
<p>Metadata can be useful for searching further. It's always possible there's a reupload
of the video that this website simply didn't find, and knowing the title and description
can be a big help in finding one.

<h4 id="built-in-support-for-additional-types">Built-in support for additional types</h4>
<p>The serializer has built-in support for the following additional types.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.half" data-linktype="absolute-path">Half</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.int128" data-linktype="absolute-path">Int128</a>, and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.uint128" data-linktype="absolute-path">UInt128</a> numeric types.</p>
<pre><code>Console.WriteLine(JsonSerializer.Serialize(new object[] { Half.MaxValue, Int128.MaxValue, UInt128.MaxValue }));
// [65500,170141183460469231731687303715884105727,340282366920938463463374607431768211455]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.memory-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">Memory&lt;T&gt;</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.readonlymemory-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">ReadOnlyMemory&lt;T&gt;</a> values. <code>byte</code> values are serialized to Base64 strings, and other types to JSON arrays.</p>
<pre><code>JsonSerializer.Serialize&lt;ReadOnlyMemory&lt;byte&gt;&gt;(new byte[] { 1, 2, 3 }); // "AQID"
JsonSerializer.Serialize&lt;Memory&lt;int&gt;&gt;(new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }); // [1,2,3]
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="source-generator">Source generator</h4>
<p>.NET 8 includes enhancements of the System.Text.Json <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/source-generation" data-linktype="relative-path">source generator</a> that are aimed at making the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/glossary#native-aot" data-linktype="relative-path">Native AOT</a> experience on par with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/reflection-vs-source-generation#reflection" data-linktype="relative-path">reflection-based serializer</a>. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The source generator now supports serializing types with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/required-properties" data-linktype="relative-path"><code>required</code></a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/init" data-linktype="relative-path"><code>init</code></a> properties. These were both already supported in reflection-based serialization.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Improved formatting of source-generated code.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.serialization.jsonsourcegenerationoptionsattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">JsonSourceGenerationOptionsAttribute</a> feature parity with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializeroptions" data-linktype="absolute-path">JsonSerializerOptions</a>. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/source-generation#specify-options" data-linktype="relative-path">Specify options (source generation)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Additional diagnostics (such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/syslib-diagnostics/syslib1034" data-linktype="relative-path">SYSLIB1034</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/syslib-diagnostics/syslib1039" data-linktype="relative-path">SYSLIB1039</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't include types of ignored or inaccessible properties.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support for nesting <code>JsonSerializerContext</code> declarations within arbitrary type kinds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support for compiler-generated or <em>unspeakable</em> types in weakly typed source generation scenarios. Since compiler-generated types can't be explicitly specified by the source generator, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Text.Json</a> now performs nearest-ancestor resolution at run time. This resolution determines the most appropriate supertype with which to serialize the value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>New converter type <code>JsonStringEnumConverter&lt;TEnum&gt;</code>. The existing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.serialization.jsonstringenumconverter" data-linktype="absolute-path">JsonStringEnumConverter</a> class isn't supported in Native AOT. You can annotate your enum types as follows:</p>
<pre><code>[JsonConverter(typeof(JsonStringEnumConverter&lt;MyEnum&gt;))]
public enum MyEnum { Value1, Value2, Value3 }

[JsonSerializable(typeof(MyEnum))]
public partial class MyContext : JsonSerializerContext { }
</code></pre>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/source-generation#serialize-enum-fields-as-strings" data-linktype="relative-path">Serialize enum fields as strings</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>New <code>JsonConverter.Type</code> property lets you look up the type of a non-generic <code>JsonConverter</code> instance:</p>
<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;Type, JsonConverter&gt; CreateDictionary(IEnumerable&lt;JsonConverter&gt; converters)
  =&gt; converters.Where(converter =&gt; converter.Type != null).ToDictionary(converter =&gt; converter.Type!);
</code></pre>
<p>The property is nullable since it returns <code>null</code> for <code>JsonConverterFactory</code> instances and <code>typeof(T)</code> for <code>JsonConverter&lt;T&gt;</code> instances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="chain-source-generators">Chain source generators</h5>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializeroptions" data-linktype="absolute-path">JsonSerializerOptions</a> class includes a new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializeroptions.typeinforesolverchain#system-text-json-jsonserializeroptions-typeinforesolverchain" data-linktype="absolute-path">TypeInfoResolverChain</a> property that complements the existing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializeroptions.typeinforesolver#system-text-json-jsonserializeroptions-typeinforesolver" data-linktype="absolute-path">TypeInfoResolver</a> property. These properties are used in contract customization for chaining source generators. The addition of the new property means that you don't have to specify all chained components at one call site—they can be added after the fact. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializeroptions.typeinforesolverchain#system-text-json-jsonserializeroptions-typeinforesolverchain" data-linktype="absolute-path">TypeInfoResolverChain</a> also lets you introspect the chain or remove components from it. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/source-generation#combine-source-generators" data-linktype="relative-path">Combine source generators</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializeroptions.addcontext#system-text-json-jsonserializeroptions-addcontext-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">JsonSerializerOptions.AddContext&lt;TContext&gt;()</a> is now obsolete. It's been superseded by the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializeroptions.typeinforesolver#system-text-json-jsonserializeroptions-typeinforesolver" data-linktype="absolute-path">TypeInfoResolver</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializeroptions.typeinforesolverchain#system-text-json-jsonserializeroptions-typeinforesolverchain" data-linktype="absolute-path">TypeInfoResolverChain</a> properties. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/syslib-diagnostics/syslib0049" data-linktype="relative-path">SYSLIB0049</a>.</p>
<h4 id="interface-hierarchies">Interface hierarchies</h4>
<p>.NET 8 adds support for serializing properties from interface hierarchies.</p>
<p>The following code shows an example where the properties from both the immediately implemented interface and its base interface are serialized.</p>
<pre><code>IDerived value = new DerivedImplement { Base = 0, Derived = 1 };
JsonSerializer.Serialize(value); // {"Base":0,"Derived":1}

public interface IBase
{
    public int Base { get; set; }
}

public interface IDerived : IBase
{
    public int Derived { get; set; }
}

public class DerivedImplement : IDerived
{
    public int Base { get; set; }
    public int Derived { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="naming-policies">Naming policies</h4>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonnamingpolicy?view=net-8.0&amp;preserve-view=true#properties" data-linktype="absolute-path"><code>JsonNamingPolicy</code></a> includes new naming policies for <code>snake_case</code> (with an underscore) and <code>kebab-case</code> (with a hyphen) property name conversions. Use these policies similarly to the existing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonnamingpolicy.camelcase#system-text-json-jsonnamingpolicy-camelcase" data-linktype="absolute-path">JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase</a> policy:</p>
<pre><code>var options = new JsonSerializerOptions { PropertyNamingPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.SnakeCaseLower };
JsonSerializer.Serialize(new { PropertyName = "value" }, options); // { "property_name" : "value" }
</code></pre>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/customize-properties#use-a-built-in-naming-policy" data-linktype="relative-path">Use a built-in naming policy</a>.</p>
<h4 id="read-only-properties">Read-only properties</h4>
<p>You can now deserialize onto read-only fields or properties (that is, those that don't have a <code>set</code> accessor).</p>
<p>To opt into this support globally, set a new option, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializeroptions.preferredobjectcreationhandling#system-text-json-jsonserializeroptions-preferredobjectcreationhandling" data-linktype="absolute-path">PreferredObjectCreationHandling</a>, to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.serialization.jsonobjectcreationhandling#system-text-json-serialization-jsonobjectcreationhandling-populate" data-linktype="absolute-path">JsonObjectCreationHandling.Populate</a>. If compatibility is a concern, you can also enable the functionality more granularly by placing the <code>[JsonObjectCreationHandling(JsonObjectCreationHandling.Populate)]</code> attribute on specific types whose properties are to be populated, or on individual properties.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following code that deserializes into a <code>CustomerInfo</code> type that has two read-only properties.</p>
<pre><code>using System.Text.Json;

CustomerInfo customer =
    JsonSerializer.Deserialize&lt;CustomerInfo&gt;("""{"Names":["John Doe"],"Company":{"Name":"Contoso"}}""")!;

Console.WriteLine(JsonSerializer.Serialize(customer));

class CompanyInfo
{
    public required string Name { get; set; }
    public string? PhoneNumber { get; set; }
}

[JsonObjectCreationHandling(JsonObjectCreationHandling.Populate)]
class CustomerInfo
{
    // Both of these properties are read-only.
    public List&lt;string&gt; Names { get; } = new();
    public CompanyInfo Company { get; } = new() { Name = "N/A", PhoneNumber = "N/A" };
}
</code></pre>
<p>Prior to .NET 8, the input values were ignored and the <code>Names</code> and <code>Company</code> properties retained their default values.</p>
<pre><code>{"Names":[],"Company":{"Name":"N/A","PhoneNumber":"N/A"}}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the input values are used to populate the read-only properties during deserialization.</p>
<pre><code>{"Names":["John Doe"],"Company":{"Name":"Contoso","PhoneNumber":null}}
</code></pre>
<p>For more information about the <em>populate</em> deserialization behavior, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/populate-properties" data-linktype="relative-path">Populate initialized properties</a>.</p>
<h4 id="disable-reflection-based-default">Disable reflection-based default</h4>
<p>You can now disable using the reflection-based serializer by default. This disablement is useful to avoid accidental rooting of reflection components that aren't even in use, especially in trimmed and Native AOT apps. To disable default reflection-based serialization by requiring that a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializeroptions" data-linktype="absolute-path">JsonSerializerOptions</a> argument be passed to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializer" data-linktype="absolute-path">JsonSerializer</a> serialization and deserialization methods, set the <code>JsonSerializerIsReflectionEnabledByDefault</code> MSBuild property to <code>false</code> in your project file.</p>
<p>Use the new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializer.isreflectionenabledbydefault#system-text-json-jsonserializer-isreflectionenabledbydefault" data-linktype="absolute-path">IsReflectionEnabledByDefault</a> API to check the value of the feature switch. If you're a library author building on top of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Text.Json</a>, you can rely on the property to configure your defaults without accidentally rooting reflection components.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/source-generation#disable-reflection-defaults" data-linktype="relative-path">Disable reflection defaults</a>.</p>
<h4 id="new-jsonnode-api-methods">New JsonNode API methods</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.nodes.jsonnode" data-linktype="absolute-path">JsonNode</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.nodes.jsonarray" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Text.Json.Nodes.JsonArray</a> types include the following new methods.</p>
<pre><code>public partial class JsonNode
{
    // Creates a deep clone of the current node and all its descendants.
    public JsonNode DeepClone();

    // Returns true if the two nodes are equivalent JSON representations.
    public static bool DeepEquals(JsonNode? node1, JsonNode? node2);

    // Determines the JsonValueKind of the current node.
    public JsonValueKind GetValueKind(JsonSerializerOptions options = null);

    // If node is the value of a property in the parent
    // object, returns its name.
    // Throws InvalidOperationException otherwise.
    public string GetPropertyName();

    // If node is the element of a parent JsonArray,
    // returns its index.
    // Throws InvalidOperationException otherwise.
    public int GetElementIndex();

    // Replaces this instance with a new value,
    // updating the parent object/array accordingly.
    public void ReplaceWith&lt;T&gt;(T value);

    // Asynchronously parses a stream as UTF-8 encoded data
    // representing a single JSON value into a JsonNode.
    public static Task&lt;JsonNode?&gt; ParseAsync(
        Stream utf8Json,
        JsonNodeOptions? nodeOptions = null,
        JsonDocumentOptions documentOptions = default,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}

public partial class JsonArray
{
    // Returns an IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; view of the current array.
    public IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; GetValues&lt;T&gt;();
}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="non-public-members">Non-public members</h4>
<p>You can opt non-public members into the serialization contract for a given type using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.serialization.jsonincludeattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">JsonIncludeAttribute</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.serialization.jsonconstructorattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">JsonConstructorAttribute</a> attribute annotations.</p>
<pre><code>string json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(new MyPoco(42)); // {"X":42}
JsonSerializer.Deserialize&lt;MyPoco&gt;(json);

public class MyPoco
{
    [JsonConstructor]
    internal MyPoco(int x) =&gt; X = x;

    [JsonInclude]
    internal int X { get; }
}
</code></pre>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/immutability" data-linktype="relative-path">Use immutable types and non-public members and accessors</a>.</p>
<h4 id="streaming-deserialization-apis">Streaming deserialization APIs</h4>
<p>.NET 8 includes new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.iasyncenumerable-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">IAsyncEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</a> streaming deserialization extension methods, for example <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.json.httpclientjsonextensions.getfromjsonasasyncenumerable" data-linktype="absolute-path">GetFromJsonAsAsyncEnumerable</a>. Similar methods have existed that return <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">Task&lt;TResult&gt;</a>, for example, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.json.httpclientjsonextensions.getfromjsonasync" data-linktype="absolute-path">HttpClientJsonExtensions.GetFromJsonAsync</a>. The new extension methods invoke streaming APIs and return <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.iasyncenumerable-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">IAsyncEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</a>.</p>
<p>The following code shows how you might use the new extension methods.</p>
<pre><code>const string RequestUri = "https://api.contoso.com/books";
using var client = new HttpClient();
IAsyncEnumerable&lt;Book&gt; books = client.GetFromJsonAsAsyncEnumerable&lt;Book&gt;(RequestUri);

await foreach (Book book in books)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Read book '{book.title}'");
}

public record Book(int id, string title, string author, int publishedYear);
</code></pre>
<h4 id="withaddedmodifier-extension-method">WithAddedModifier extension method</h4>
<p>The new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.serialization.metadata.jsontypeinforesolver.withaddedmodifier#system-text-json-serialization-metadata-jsontypeinforesolver-withaddedmodifier(system-text-json-serialization-metadata-ijsontypeinforesolver-system-action((system-text-json-serialization-metadata-jsontypeinfo)))" data-linktype="absolute-path">WithAddedModifier(IJsonTypeInfoResolver, Action&lt;JsonTypeInfo&gt;)</a> extension method lets you easily introduce modifications to the serialization contracts of arbitrary <code>IJsonTypeInfoResolver</code> instances.</p>
<pre><code>var options = new JsonSerializerOptions
{
    TypeInfoResolver = MyContext.Default
        .WithAddedModifier(static typeInfo =&gt;
        {
            foreach (JsonPropertyInfo prop in typeInfo.Properties)
                prop.Name = prop.Name.ToUpperInvariant();
        })
};
</code></pre>
<h4 id="new-jsoncontentcreate-overloads">New JsonContent.Create overloads</h4>
<p>You can now create <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.json.jsoncontent" data-linktype="absolute-path">JsonContent</a> instances using trim-safe or source-generated contracts. The new methods are:</p>

<h4 id="freeze-a-jsonserializeroptions-instance">Freeze a JsonSerializerOptions instance</h4>
<p>The following new methods let you control when a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializeroptions" data-linktype="absolute-path">JsonSerializerOptions</a> instance is frozen:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializeroptions.makereadonly#system-text-json-jsonserializeroptions-makereadonly" data-linktype="absolute-path">JsonSerializerOptions.MakeReadOnly()</a></p>
<p>This overload is designed to be trim-safe and will therefore throw an exception in cases where the options instance hasn't been configured with a resolver.</p>

<p>If you pass <code>true</code> to this overload, it populates the options instance with the default reflection resolver if one is missing. This method is marked <code>RequiresUnreferenceCode</code>/<code>RequiresDynamicCode</code> and is therefore unsuitable for Native AOT applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializeroptions.isreadonly#system-text-json-jsonserializeroptions-isreadonly" data-linktype="absolute-path">IsReadOnly</a> property lets you check if the options instance is frozen.</p>
<h3 id="time-abstraction">Time abstraction</h3>
<p>The new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.timeprovider" data-linktype="absolute-path">TimeProvider</a> class and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.itimer" data-linktype="absolute-path">ITimer</a> interface add <em>time abstraction</em> functionality, which allows you to mock time in test scenarios. In addition, you can use the time abstraction to mock <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task" data-linktype="absolute-path">Task</a> operations that rely on time progression using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.delay" data-linktype="absolute-path">Task.Delay</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.waitasync" data-linktype="absolute-path">Task.WaitAsync</a>. The time abstraction supports the following essential time operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve local and UTC time</li>
<li>Obtain a timestamp for measuring performance</li>
<li>Create a timer</li>
</ul>
<p>The following code snippet shows some usage examples.</p>
<pre><code>// Get system time.
DateTimeOffset utcNow = TimeProvider.System.GetUtcNow();
DateTimeOffset localNow = TimeProvider.System.GetLocalNow();

// Create a time provider that works with a

<h3 id="utf8-improvements">UTF8 improvements</h3>
<p>If you want to enable writing out a string-like representation of your type to a destination span, implement the new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iutf8spanformattable" data-linktype="absolute-path">IUtf8SpanFormattable</a> interface on your type. This new interface is closely related to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.ispanformattable" data-linktype="absolute-path">ISpanFormattable</a>, but targets UTF8 and <code>Span&lt;byte&gt;</code> instead of UTF16 and <code>Span&lt;char&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iutf8spanformattable" data-linktype="absolute-path">IUtf8SpanFormattable</a> has been implemented on all of the primitive types (plus others), with the exact same shared logic whether targeting <code>string</code>, <code>Span&lt;char&gt;</code>, or <code>Span&lt;byte&gt;</code>. It has full support for all formats (including the new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-numeric-format-strings#binary-format-specifier-b" data-linktype="relative-path">"B" binary specifier</a>) and all cultures. This means you can now format directly to UTF8 from <code>Byte</code>, <code>Complex</code>, <code>Char</code>, <code>DateOnly</code>, <code>DateTime</code>, <code>DateTimeOffset</code>, <code>Decimal</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>Guid</code>, <code>Half</code>, <code>IPAddress</code>, <code>IPNetwork</code>, <code>Int16</code>, <code>Int32</code>, <code>Int64</code>, <code>Int128</code>, <code>IntPtr</code>, <code>NFloat</code>, <code>SByte</code>, <code>Single</code>, <code>Rune</code>, <code>TimeOnly</code>, <code>TimeSpan</code>, <code>UInt16</code>, <code>UInt32</code>, <code>UInt64</code>, <code>UInt128</code>, <code>UIntPtr</code>, and <code>Version</code>.</p>
<p>New <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.unicode.utf8.trywrite" data-linktype="absolute-path">Utf8.TryWrite</a> methods provide a UTF8-based counterpart to the existing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.memoryextensions.trywrite" data-linktype="absolute-path">MemoryExtensions.TryWrite</a> methods, which are UTF16-based. You can use interpolated string syntax to format a complex expression directly into a span of UTF8 bytes, for example:</p>
<pre><code>static bool FormatHexVersion(
    short major,
    short minor,
    short build,
    short revision,
    Span&lt;byte&gt; utf8Bytes,
    out int bytesWritten) =&gt;
    Utf8.TryWrite(
        utf8Bytes,
        CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
        $"{major:X4}.{minor:X4}.{build:X4}.{revision:X4}",
        out bytesWritten);
</code></pre>
<p>The implementation recognizes <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iutf8spanformattable" data-linktype="absolute-path">IUtf8SpanFormattable</a> on the format values and uses their implementations to write their UTF8 representations directly to the destination span.</p>
<p>The implementation also utilizes the new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.encoding.trygetbytes#system-text-encoding-trygetbytes(system-readonlyspan((system-char))-system-span((system-byte))-system-int32@)" data-linktype="absolute-path">Encoding.TryGetBytes(ReadOnlySpan&lt;Char&gt;, Span&lt;Byte&gt;, Int32)</a> method, which together with its <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.encoding.trygetchars#system-text-encoding-trygetchars(system-readonlyspan((system-byte))-system-span((system-char))-system-int32@)" data-linktype="absolute-path">Encoding.TryGetChars(ReadOnlySpan&lt;Byte&gt;, Span&lt;Char&gt;, Int32)</a> counterpart, supports encoding and decoding into a destination span. If the span isn't long enough to hold the resulting state, the methods return <code>false</code> rather than throwing an exception.</p>
<h3 id="methods-for-working-with-randomness">Methods for working with randomness</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Random</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.randomnumbergenerator" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator</a> types introduce two new methods for working with randomness.</p>
<h4 id="getitemst">GetItems&lt;T&gt;()</h4>
<p>The new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random.getitems" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Random.GetItems</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.randomnumbergenerator.getitems" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator.GetItems</a> methods let you randomly choose a specified number of items from an input set. The following example shows how to use <code>System.Random.GetItems&lt;T&gt;()</code> (on the instance provided by the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random.shared#system-random-shared" data-linktype="absolute-path">Random.Shared</a> property) to randomly insert 31 items into an array. This example could be used in a game of "Simon" where players must remember a sequence of colored buttons.</p>
<pre><code>private static ReadOnlySpan&lt;Button&gt; s_allButtons = new[]
{
    Button.Red,
    Button.Green,
    Button.Blue,
    Button.Yellow,
};

// ...

Button[] thisRound = Random.Shared.GetItems(s_allButtons, 31);
// Rest of game goes here ...
</code></pre>
<h4 id="shufflet">Shuffle&lt;T&gt;()</h4>
<p>The new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random.shuffle" data-linktype="absolute-path">Random.Shuffle</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.randomnumbergenerator.shuffle#system-security-cryptography-randomnumbergenerator-shuffle-1(system-span((-0)))" data-linktype="absolute-path">RandomNumberGenerator.Shuffle&lt;T&gt;(Span&lt;T&gt;)</a> methods let you randomize the order of a span. These methods are useful for reducing training bias in machine learning (so the first thing isn't always training, and the last thing always test).</p>
<pre><code>YourType[] trainingData = LoadTrainingData();
Random.Shared.Shuffle(trainingData);

IDataView sourceData = mlContext.Data.LoadFromEnumerable(trainingData);

DataOperationsCatalog.TrainTestData split = mlContext.Data.TrainTestSplit(sourceData);
model = chain.Fit(split.TrainSet);

IDataView predictions = model.Transform(split.TestSet);
// ...
</code></pre>
<h3 id="performance-focused-types">Performance-focused types</h3>
<p>.NET 8 introduces several new types aimed at improving app performance.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.frozen" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Collections.Frozen</a> namespace includes the collection types <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.frozen.frozendictionary-2" data-linktype="absolute-path">FrozenDictionary&lt;TKey,TValue&gt;</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.frozen.frozenset-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">FrozenSet&lt;T&gt;</a>. These types don't allow any changes to keys and values once a collection created. That requirement allows faster read operations (for example, <code>TryGetValue()</code>). These types are particularly useful for collections that are populated on first use and then persisted for the duration of a long-lived service, for example:</p>
<pre><code>private static readonly FrozenDictionary&lt;string, bool&gt; s_configurationData =
    LoadConfigurationData().ToFrozenDictionary(optimizeForReads: true);

// ...
if (s_configurationData.TryGetValue(key, out bool setting) &amp;&amp; setting)
{
    Process();
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>The new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.buffers.searchvalues-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Buffers.SearchValues&lt;T&gt;</a> type is designed to be passed to methods that look for the first occurrence of any value in the passed collection. For example, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.indexofany#system-string-indexofany(system-char())" data-linktype="absolute-path">String.IndexOfAny(Char[])</a> looks for the first occurrence of any character in the specified array in the <code>string</code> it's called on. NET 8 adds new overloads of methods like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.indexofany" data-linktype="absolute-path">String.IndexOfAny</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.memoryextensions.indexofany" data-linktype="absolute-path">MemoryExtensions.IndexOfAny</a> that accept an instance of the new type. When you create an instance of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.buffers.searchvalues-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Buffers.SearchValues&lt;T&gt;</a>, all the data that's necessary to optimize subsequent searches is derived <em>at that time</em>, meaning the work is done up front.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.compositeformat" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Text.CompositeFormat</a> type is useful for optimizing format strings that aren't known at compile time (for example, if the format string is loaded from a resource file). A little extra time is spent up front to do work such as parsing the string, but it saves the work from being done on each use.</p>
<pre><code>private static readonly CompositeFormat s_rangeMessage =
    CompositeFormat.Parse(LoadRangeMessageResource());

// ...
static string GetMessage(int min, int max) =&gt;
    string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, s_rangeMessage, min, max);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>New <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.hashing.xxhash3" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.IO.Hashing.XxHash3</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.hashing.xxhash128" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.IO.Hashing.XxHash128</a> types provide implementations of the fast XXH3 and XXH128 hash algorithms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="systemnumerics-and-systemruntimeintrinsics">System.Numerics and System.Runtime.Intrinsics</h3>
<p>This section covers improvements to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Numerics</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Runtime.Intrinsics</a> namespaces.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.vector256-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">Vector256&lt;T&gt;</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.matrix3x2" data-linktype="absolute-path">Matrix3x2</a>, and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.matrix4x4" data-linktype="absolute-path">Matrix4x4</a> have improved hardware acceleration on .NET 8. For example, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.vector256-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">Vector256&lt;T&gt;</a> was reimplemented to internally be <code>2x Vector128&lt;T&gt;</code> operations, where possible. This allows partial acceleration of some functions when <code>Vector128.IsHardwareAccelerated == true</code> but <code>Vector256.IsHardwareAccelerated == false</code>, such as on Arm64.</li>
<li>Hardware intrinsics are now annotated with the <code>ConstExpected</code> attribute. This ensures that users are aware when the underlying hardware expects a constant and therefore when a non-constant value may unexpectedly hurt performance.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.ifloatingpointieee754-1.lerp#system-numerics-ifloatingpointieee754-1-lerp(-0-0-0)" data-linktype="absolute-path">Lerp(TSelf, TSelf, TSelf)</a> <code>Lerp</code> API has been added to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.ifloatingpointieee754-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">IFloatingPointIeee754&lt;TSelf&gt;</a> and therefore to <code>float</code> (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.single" data-linktype="absolute-path">Single</a>), <code>double</code> (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.double" data-linktype="absolute-path">Double</a>), and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.half" data-linktype="absolute-path">Half</a>. This API allows a linear interpolation between two values to be performed efficiently and correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="vector512-and-avx-512">Vector512 and AVX-512</h4>
<p>.NET Core 3.0 expanded SIMD support to include the platform-specific hardware intrinsics APIs for x86/x64. .NET 5 added support for Arm64 and .NET 7 added the cross-platform hardware intrinsics. .NET 8 furthers SIMD support by introducing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.vector512-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">Vector512&lt;T&gt;</a> and support for <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-avx-512-instructions.html" data-linktype="external">Intel Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (AVX-512)</a> instructions.</p>
<p>Specifically, .NET 8 includes support for the following key features of AVX-512:</p>
<ul>
<li>512-bit vector operations</li>
<li>Additional 16 SIMD registers</li>
<li>Additional instructions available for 128-bit, 256-bit, and 512-bit vectors</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have hardware that supports the functionality, then <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.vector512.ishardwareaccelerated#system-runtime-intrinsics-vector512-ishardwareaccelerated" data-linktype="absolute-path">Vector512.IsHardwareAccelerated</a> now reports <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>.NET 8 also adds several platform-specific classes under the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.x86" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86</a> namespace:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.x86.avx512f" data-linktype="absolute-path">Avx512F</a> (foundational)</li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.x86.avx512bw" data-linktype="absolute-path">Avx512BW</a> (byte and word)</li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.x86.avx512cd" data-linktype="absolute-path">Avx512CD</a> (conflict detection)</li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.x86.avx512dq" data-linktype="absolute-path">Avx512DQ</a> (doubleword and quadword)</li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.x86.avx512vbmi" data-linktype="absolute-path">Avx512Vbmi</a> (vector byte manipulation instructions)</li>
</ul>
<p>These classes follow the same general shape as other instruction set architectures (ISAs) in that they expose an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.x86.avx512f.issupported#system-runtime-intrinsics-x86-avx512f-issupported" data-linktype="absolute-path">IsSupported</a> property and a nested <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.x86.avx512f.x64" data-linktype="absolute-path">Avx512F.X64</a> class for instructions available only to 64-bit processes. Additionally, each class has a nested <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.x86.avx512f.vl" data-linktype="absolute-path">Avx512F.VL</a> class that exposes the <code>Avx512VL</code> (vector length) extensions for the corresponding instruction set.</p>
<p>Even if you don't explicitly use <code>Vector512</code>-specific or <code>Avx512F</code>-specific instructions in your code, you'll likely still benefit from the new AVX-512 support. The JIT can take advantage of the additional registers and instructions implicitly when using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.vector128-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">Vector128&lt;T&gt;</a> or <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.intrinsics.vector256-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">Vector256&lt;T&gt;</a>. The base class library uses these hardware intrinsics internally in most operations exposed by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.span-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">Span&lt;T&gt;</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.readonlyspan-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">ReadOnlySpan&lt;T&gt;</a> and in many of the math APIs exposed for the primitive types.</p>
<h3 id="data-validation">Data validation</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.dataannotations" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations</a> namespace includes new data validation attributes intended for validation scenarios in cloud-native services. While the pre-existing <code>DataAnnotations</code> validators are geared towards typical UI data-entry validation, such as fields on a form, the new attributes are designed to validate non-user-entry data, such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/options#options-validation" data-linktype="relative-path">configuration options</a>. In addition to the new attributes, new properties were added to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.dataannotations.rangeattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">RangeAttribute</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.dataannotations.requiredattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">RequiredAttribute</a> types.</p>

<h3 id="cryptography">Cryptography</h3>
<p>.NET 8 adds support for the SHA-3 hashing primitives. (SHA-3 is currently supported by Linux with OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later and Windows 11 Build 25324 or later.) APIs where SHA-2 is available now offer a SHA-3 compliment. This includes <code>SHA3_256</code>, <code>SHA3_384</code>, and <code>SHA3_512</code> for hashing; <code>HMACSHA3_256</code>, <code>HMACSHA3_384</code>, and <code>HMACSHA3_512</code> for HMAC; <code>HashAlgorithmName.SHA3_256</code>, <code>HashAlgorithmName.SHA3_384</code>, and <code>HashAlgorithmName.SHA3_512</code> for hashing where the algorithm is configurable; and <code>RSAEncryptionPadding.OaepSHA3_256</code>, <code>RSAEncryptionPadding.OaepSHA3_384</code>, and <code>RSAEncryptionPadding.OaepSHA3_512</code> for RSA OAEP encryption.</p>
<p>The following example shows how to use the APIs, including the <code>SHA3_256.IsSupported</code> property to determine if the platform supports SHA-3.</p>
<pre><code>// Hashing example
if (SHA3_256.IsSupported)
{
    byte[] hash = SHA3_256.HashData(dataToHash);
}
else
{
    // ...
}

// Signing example
if (SHA3_256.IsSupported)
{
     using ECDsa ec = ECDsa.Create(ECCurve.NamedCurves.nistP256);
     byte[] signature = ec.SignData(dataToBeSigned, HashAlgorithmName.SHA3_256);
}
else
{
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>SHA-3 support is currently aimed at supporting cryptographic primitives. Higher-level constructions and protocols aren't expected to fully support SHA-3 initially. These protocols include X.509 certificates, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.xml.signedxml" data-linktype="absolute-path">SignedXml</a>, and COSE.</p>
<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>
<h4 id="support-for-https-proxy">Support for HTTPS proxy</h4>
<p>Until now, the proxy types that <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient" data-linktype="absolute-path">HttpClient</a> supported all allowed a "man-in-the-middle" to see which site the client is connecting to, even for HTTPS URIs. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient" data-linktype="absolute-path">HttpClient</a> now supports <em>HTTPS proxy</em>, which creates an encrypted channel between the client and the proxy so all requests can be handled with full privacy.</p>
<p>To enable HTTPS proxy, set the <code>all_proxy</code> environment variable, or use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webproxy" data-linktype="absolute-path">WebProxy</a> class to control the proxy programmatically.</p>
<p>Unix: <code>export all_proxy=https://x.x.x.x:3218</code>
Windows: <code>set all_proxy=https://x.x.x.x:3218</code></p>
<p>You can also use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webproxy" data-linktype="absolute-path">WebProxy</a> class to control the proxy programmatically.</p>
<h3 id="stream-based-zipfile-methods">Stream-based ZipFile methods</h3>
<p>.NET 8 includes new overloads of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.compression.zipfile.createfromdirectory" data-linktype="absolute-path">ZipFile.CreateFromDirectory</a> that allow you to collect all the files included in a directory and zip them, then store the resulting zip file into the provided stream. Similarly, new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.compression.zipfile.extracttodirectory" data-linktype="absolute-path">ZipFile.ExtractToDirectory</a> overloads let you provide a stream containing a zipped file and extract its contents into the filesystem. These are the new overloads:</p>
<pre><code>namespace System.IO.Compression;

public static partial class ZipFile
{
    public static void CreateFromDirectory(string sourceDirectoryName, Stream destination);
    public static void CreateFromDirectory(string sourceDirectoryName, Stream destination, CompressionLevel compressionLevel, bool includeBaseDirectory);
    public static void CreateFromDirectory(string sourceDirectoryName, Stream destination, CompressionLevel compressionLevel, bool includeBaseDirectory, Encoding? entryNameEncoding);

    public static void ExtractToDirectory(Stream source, string destinationDirectoryName) { }
    public static void ExtractToDirectory(Stream source, string destinationDirectoryName, bool overwriteFiles) { }
    public static void ExtractToDirectory(Stream source, string destinationDirectoryName, Encoding? entryNameEncoding) { }
    public static void ExtractToDirectory(Stream source, string destinationDirectoryName, Encoding? entryNameEncoding, bool overwriteFiles) { }
}
</code></pre>
<p>These new APIs can be useful when disk space is constrained, because they avoid having to use the disk as an intermediate step.</p>

<h3 id="keyed-di-services">Keyed DI services</h3>
<p>Keyed dependency injection (DI) services provides a means for registering and retrieving DI services using keys. By using keys, you can scope how your register and consume services. These are some of the new APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.ikeyedserviceprovider" data-linktype="absolute-path">IKeyedServiceProvider</a> interface.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.servicekeyattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">ServiceKeyAttribute</a> attribute, which can be used to inject the key that was used for registration/resolution in the constructor.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.fromkeyedservicesattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">FromKeyedServicesAttribute</a> attribute, which can be used on service constructor parameters to specify which keyed service to use.</li>
<li>Various new extension methods for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.iservicecollection" data-linktype="absolute-path">IServiceCollection</a> to support keyed services, for example, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.servicecollectionserviceextensions.addkeyedscoped" data-linktype="absolute-path">ServiceCollectionServiceExtensions.AddKeyedScoped</a>.</li>

<h3 id="options-validation">Options validation</h3>
<h4 id="source-generator-1">Source generator</h4>
<p>To reduce startup overhead and improve validation feature set, we've introduced a source code generator that implements the validation logic. The following code shows example models and validator classes.</p>
<pre><code>public class FirstModelNoNamespace
{
    [Required]
    [MinLength(5)]
    public string P1 { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    [Microsoft.Extensions.Options.ValidateObjectMembers(typeof(SecondValidatorNoNamespace))]
    public SecondModelNoNamespace? P2 { get; set; }
}

public class SecondModelNoNamespace
{
    [Required]
    [MinLength(5)]
    public string P4 { get; set; } = string. Empty;
}

[OptionsValidator]
public partial class FirstValidatorNoNamespace : IValidateOptions&lt;FirstModelNoNamespace&gt;
{
}

[OptionsValidator]
public partial class SecondValidatorNoNamespace : IValidateOptions&lt;SecondModelNoNamespace&gt;
{
}
</code></pre>
<p>If your app uses dependency injection, you can inject the validation as shown in the following example code.</p>
<pre><code>var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();
builder.Services.Configure&lt;FirstModelNoNamespace&gt;(builder.Configuration.GetSection(...));

builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;IValidateOptions&lt;FirstModelNoNamespace&gt;, FirstValidatorNoNamespace&gt;();
builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;IValidateOptions&lt;SecondModelNoNamespace&gt;, SecondValidatorNoNamespace&gt;();
</code></pre>
<h4 id="validateoptionsresultbuilder-type">ValidateOptionsResultBuilder type</h4>
<p>.NET 8 introduces the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.options.validateoptionsresultbuilder" data-linktype="absolute-path">ValidateOptionsResultBuilder</a> type to facilitate the creation of a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.options.validateoptionsresult" data-linktype="absolute-path">ValidateOptionsResult</a> object. Importantly, this builder allows for the accumulation of multiple errors. Previously, creating the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.options.validateoptionsresult" data-linktype="absolute-path">ValidateOptionsResult</a> object that's required to implement <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.options.ivalidateoptions-1.validate#microsoft-extensions-options-ivalidateoptions-1-validate(system-string-0)" data-linktype="absolute-path">IValidateOptions&lt;TOptions&gt;.Validate(String, TOptions)</a> was difficult and sometimes resulted in layered validation errors. If there were multiple errors, the validation process often stopped at the first error.</p>
<p>The following code snippet shows an example usage of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.options.validateoptionsresultbuilder" data-linktype="absolute-path">ValidateOptionsResultBuilder</a>.</p>
<pre><code>ValidateOptionsResultBuilder builder = new();
builder.AddError("Error: invalid operation code");
builder.AddResult(ValidateOptionsResult.Fail("Invalid request parameters"));

<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.loggermessageattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">LoggerMessageAttribute</a> now offers additional constructor overloads. Previously, you had to choose either the parameterless constructor or the constructor that required all of the parameters (event ID, log level, and message). The new overloads offer greater flexibility in specifying the required parameters with reduced code. If you don't supply an event ID, the system generates one automatically.</p>
<pre><code>public LoggerMessageAttribute(LogLevel level, string message);
public LoggerMessageAttribute(LogLevel level);
public LoggerMessageAttribute(string message);
</code></pre>
<h3 id="extensions-metrics">Extensions metrics</h3>
<h4 id="imeterfactory-interface">IMeterFactory interface</h4>
<p>You can register the new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.imeterfactory" data-linktype="absolute-path">IMeterFactory</a> interface in dependency injection (DI) containers and use it to create <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.meter" data-linktype="absolute-path">Meter</a> objects in an isolated manner.</p>
<p>Register the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.imeterfactory" data-linktype="absolute-path">IMeterFactory</a> to the DI container using the default meter factory implementation:</p>
<pre><code>// 'services' is the DI IServiceCollection.
services.AddMetrics();
</code></pre>
<p>Consumers can then obtain the meter factory and use it to create a new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.meter" data-linktype="absolute-path">Meter</a> object.</p>
<pre><code>IMeterFactory meterFactory = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService&lt;IMeterFactory&gt;();

MeterOptions options = new MeterOptions("MeterName")
{
    Version = "version",
};

Meter meter = meterFactory.Create(options);

<h4 id="metriccollectort-class">MetricCollector&lt;T&gt; class</h4>
<p>The new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.diagnostics.metrics.testing.metriccollector-1" data-linktype="absolute-path">MetricCollector&lt;T&gt;</a> class lets you record metric measurements along with timestamps. Additionally, the class offers the flexibility to use a time provider of your choice for accurate timestamp generation.</p>
<pre><code>const string CounterName = "MyCounter";

var now = DateTimeOffset.Now;

var timeProvider = new FakeTimeProvider(now);
using var meter = new Meter(Guid.NewGuid().ToString());
var counter = meter.CreateCounter&lt;long&gt;(CounterName);
using var collector = new MetricCollector&lt;long&gt;(counter, timeProvider);

Assert.Empty(collector.GetMeasurementSnapshot());

<h3 id="systemnumericstensorstensorprimitives">System.Numerics.Tensors.TensorPrimitives</h3>
<p>The updated <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Numerics.Tensors" data-linktype="external">System.Numerics.Tensors</a> NuGet package includes APIs in the new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.tensors.tensorprimitives" data-linktype="absolute-path">TensorPrimitives</a> namespace that add support for tensor operations. The tensor primitives optimize data-intensive workloads like those of AI and machine learning.</p>
<p>AI workloads like semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) extend the natural language capabilities of large language models such as ChatGPT by augmenting prompts with relevant data. For these workloads, operations on vectors—like <em>cosine similarity</em> to find the most relevant data to answer a question—are crucial. The System.Numerics.Tensors.TensorPrimitives package provides APIs for vector operations, meaning you don't need to take an external dependency or write your own implementation.</p>
<p>This package replaces the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Numerics.Tensors" data-linktype="external">System.Numerics.Tensors package</a>.</p>

<h2 id="garbage-collection">Garbage collection</h2>
<p>.NET 8 adds a capability to adjust the memory limit on the fly. This is useful in cloud-service scenarios, where demand comes and goes. To be cost-effective, services should scale up and down on resource consumption as the demand fluctuates. When a service detects a decrease in demand, it can scale down resource consumption by reducing its memory limit. Previously, this would fail because the garbage collector (GC) was unaware of the change and might allocate more memory than the new limit. With this change, you can call the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.gc.refreshmemorylimit#system-gc-refreshmemorylimit" data-linktype="absolute-path">RefreshMemoryLimit()</a> API to update the GC with the new memory limit.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>On 32-bit platforms (for example, Windows x86 and Linux ARM), .NET is unable to establish a new heap hard limit if there isn't already one.</li>
<li>The API might return a non-zero status code indicating the refresh failed. This can happen if the scale-down is too aggressive and leaves no room for the GC to maneuver. In this case, consider calling <code>GC.Collect(2, GCCollectionMode.Aggressive)</code> to shrink the current memory usage, and then try again.</li>
<li>If you scale up the memory limit beyond the size that the GC believes the process can handle during startup, the <code>RefreshMemoryLimit</code> call will succeed, but it won't be able to use more memory than what it perceives as the limit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following code snippet shows how to call the API.</p>
<pre><code>GC.RefreshMemoryLimit();
</code></pre>
<p>You can also refresh some of the GC configuration settings related to the memory limit. The following code snippet sets the heap hard limit to 100 mebibytes (MiB):</p>
<pre><code>AppContext.SetData("GCHeapHardLimit", (ulong)100 * 1024 * 1024);
GC.RefreshMemoryLimit();
</code></pre>
<p>The API can throw an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.invalidoperationexception" data-linktype="absolute-path">InvalidOperationException</a> if the hard limit is invalid, for example, in the case of negative heap hard limit percentages and if the hard limit is too low. This can happen if the heap hard limit that the refresh will set, either because of new AppData settings or implied by the container memory limit changes, is lower than what's already committed.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-binding-source-generator">Configuration-binding source generator</h2>
<p>.NET 8 introduces a source generator to provide AOT and trim-friendly <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/" data-linktype="absolute-path">configuration</a> in ASP.NET Core. The generator is an alternative to the pre-existing reflection-based implementation.</p>
<p>The source generator probes for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.options.configureoptions-1.configure#microsoft-extensions-options-configureoptions-1-configure(-0)" data-linktype="absolute-path">Configure(TOptions)</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration.configurationbinder.bind" data-linktype="absolute-path">Bind</a>, and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration.configurationbinder.get" data-linktype="absolute-path">Get</a> calls to retrieve type info from. When the generator is enabled in a project, the compiler implicitly chooses generated methods over the pre-existing reflection-based framework implementations.</p>
<p>No source code changes are needed to use the generator. It's enabled by default in AOT'd web apps. For other project types, the source generator is off by default, but you can opt in by setting the <code>EnableConfigurationBindingGenerator</code> property to <code>true</code> in your project file:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;EnableConfigurationBindingGenerator&gt;true&lt;/EnableConfigurationBindingGenerator&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The following code shows an example of invoking the binder.</p>
<pre><code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

WebApplicationBuilder builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
IConfigurationSection section = builder.Configuration.GetSection("MyOptions");

<h2 id="reflection-improvements">Reflection improvements</h2>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/unsafe-code#function-pointers" data-linktype="relative-path">Function pointers</a> were introduced in .NET 5, however, the corresponding support for reflection wasn't added at that time. When using <code>typeof</code> or reflection on a function pointer, for example, <code>typeof(delegate*&lt;void&gt;())</code> or <code>FieldInfo.FieldType</code> respectively, an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.intptr" data-linktype="absolute-path">IntPtr</a> was returned. Starting in .NET 8, a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.type" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Type</a> object is returned instead. This type provides access to function pointer metadata, including the calling conventions, return type, and parameters.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>A function pointer instance, which is a physical address to a function, continues to be represented as an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.intptr" data-linktype="absolute-path">IntPtr</a>. Only the reflection type has changed.</p>

{
    Console.WriteLine($"Parameter type: {parameterType}");
}

// Access to custom modifiers and calling conventions requires a "modified type".
Type modifiedType = fieldInfo.GetModifiedFieldType();

// A modified type forwards most members to its underlying type.
Type normalType = modifiedType.UnderlyingSystemType;

// New method to obtain the calling conventions.
foreach (Type callConv in modifiedType.GetFunctionPointerCallingConventions())
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Calling convention: {callConv}");
}

// New method to obtain the custom modifiers.
foreach (Type modreq in modifiedType.GetFunctionPointerParameterTypes()[0].GetRequiredCustomModifiers())
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Required modifier for first parameter: {modreq}");
}
</code></pre>
<p>The previous example produces the following output:</p>
<pre><code>IsFunctionPointer: True
IsUnmanagedFunctionPointer: True
Return type: System.Void

<h2 id="native-aot-support">Native AOT support</h2>
<p>The option to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/" data-linktype="relative-path">publish as Native AOT</a> was first introduced in .NET 7. Publishing an app with Native AOT creates a fully self-contained version of your app that doesn't need a runtime—everything is included in a single file. .NET 8 brings the following improvements to Native AOT publishing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adds support for the x64 and Arm64 architectures on <em>macOS</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reduces the sizes of Native AOT apps on Linux by up to 50%. The following table shows the size of a "Hello World" app published with Native AOT that includes the entire .NET runtime on .NET 7 vs. .NET 8:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Operating system</th>
<th>.NET 7</th>
<th>.NET 8</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Linux x64 (with <code>-p:StripSymbols=true</code>)</td>
<td>3.76 MB</td>
<td>1.84 MB</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Windows x64</td>
<td>2.85 MB</td>
<td>1.77 MB</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li><p>Lets you specify an optimization preference: size or speed. By default, the compiler chooses to generate fast code while being mindful of the size of the application. However, you can use the <code>&lt;OptimizationPreference&gt;</code> MSBuild property to optimize specifically for one or the other. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/optimizing" data-linktype="relative-path">Optimize AOT deployments</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="console-app-template">Console app template</h3>
<p>The default console app template now includes support for AOT out-of-the-box. To create a project that's configured for AOT compilation, just run <code>dotnet new console --aot</code>. The project configuration added by <code>--aot</code> has three effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generates a native self-contained executable with Native AOT when you publish the project, for example, with <code>dotnet publish</code> or Visual Studio.</li>
<li>Enables compatibility analyzers for trimming, AOT, and single file. These analyzers alert you to potentially problematic parts of your project (if there are any).</li>
<li>Enables debug-time emulation of AOT so that when you debug your project without AOT compilation, you get a similar experience to AOT. For example, if you use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.emit" data-linktype="absolute-path">System.Reflection.Emit</a> in a NuGet package that wasn't annotated for AOT (and therefore was missed by the compatibility analyzer), the emulation means you won't have any surprises when you try to publish the project with AOT.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="target-ios-like-platforms-with-native-aot">Target iOS-like platforms with Native AOT</h3>
<p>.NET 8 starts the work to enable Native AOT support for iOS-like platforms. You can now build and run .NET iOS and .NET MAUI applications with Native AOT on the following platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ios</code></li>
<li><code>iossimulator</code></li>
<li><code>maccatalyst</code></li>
<li><code>tvos</code></li>
<li><code>tvossimulator</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Preliminary testing shows that app size on disk decreases by about 35% for .NET iOS apps that use Native AOT instead of Mono. App size on disk for .NET MAUI iOS apps decreases up to 50%. Additionally, the startup time is also faster. .NET iOS apps have about 28% faster startup time, while .NET MAUI iOS apps have about 50% better startup performance compared to Mono. The .NET 8 support is experimental and only the first step for the feature as a whole. For more information, see the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-8-performance-improvements-in-dotnet-maui/" data-linktype="external">.NET 8 Performance Improvements in .NET MAUI blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Native AOT support is available as an opt-in feature intended for app deployment; Mono is still the default runtime for app development and deployment. To build and run a .NET MAUI application with Native AOT on an iOS device, use <code>dotnet workload install maui</code> to install the .NET MAUI workload and <code>dotnet new maui -n HelloMaui</code> to create the app. Then, set the MSBuild property <code>PublishAot</code> to <code>true</code> in the project file.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;PublishAot&gt;true&lt;/PublishAot&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>When you set the required property and run <code>dotnet publish</code> as shown in the following example, the app will be deployed by using Native AOT.</p>
<pre><code>dotnet publish -f net8.0-ios -c Release -r ios-arm64  /t:Run
</code></pre>
<h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4>
<p>Not all iOS features are compatible with Native AOT. Similarly, not all libraries commonly used in iOS are compatible with NativeAOT. And in addition to the existing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/#limitations-of-native-aot-deployment" data-linktype="relative-path">limitations of Native AOT deployment</a>, the following list shows some of the other limitations when targeting iOS-like platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Native AOT is only enabled during app deployment (<code>dotnet publish</code>).</li>
<li>Managed code debugging is only supported with Mono.</li>
<li>Compatibility with the .NET MAUI framework is limited.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h2>
<p>.NET 8 includes improvements to code generation and just-in time (JIT) compilation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arm64 performance improvements</li>
<li>SIMD improvements</li>
<li>Support for AVX-512 ISA extensions (see <a href="#vector512-and-avx-512" data-linktype="self-bookmark">Vector512 and AVX-512</a>)</li>
<li>Cloud-native improvements</li>
<li>JIT throughput improvements</li>
<li>Loop and general optimizations</li>
<li>Optimized access for fields marked with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threadstaticattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">ThreadStaticAttribute</a></li>
<li>Consecutive register allocation. Arm64 has two instructions for table vector lookup, which require that all entities in their tuple operands are present in consecutive registers.</li>
<li>JIT/NativeAOT can now unroll and auto-vectorize some memory operations with SIMD, such as comparison, copying, and zeroing, if it can determine their sizes at compile time.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, dynamic profile-guided optimization (PGO) has been improved and is now enabled by default. You no longer need to use a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/runtime-config/compilation#profile-guided-optimization" data-linktype="relative-path">runtime configuration option</a> to enable it. Dynamic PGO works hand-in-hand with tiered compilation to further optimize code based on additional instrumentation that's put in place during tier 0.</p>
<p>On average, dynamic PGO increases performance by about 15%. In a benchmark suite of ~4600 tests, 23% saw performance improvements of 20% or more.</p>
<h3 id="codegen-struct-promotion">Codegen struct promotion</h3>
<p>.NET 8 includes a new physical promotion optimization pass for codegen that generalizes the JIT's ability to promote struct variables. This optimization (also called <em>scalar replacement of aggregates</em>) replaces the fields of struct variables by primitive variables that the JIT is then able to reason about and optimize more precisely.</p>
<p>The JIT already supported this optimization but with several large limitations including:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was only supported for structs with four or fewer fields.</li>
<li>It was only supported if each field was a primitive type, or a simple struct wrapping a primitive type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Physical promotion removes these limitations, which fixes a number of long-standing JIT issues.</p>

</code></pre>
<h3 id="terminal-build-output">Terminal build output</h3>
<p><code>dotnet build</code> has a new option to produce more modernized build output. This <em>terminal logger</em> output groups errors with the project they came from, better differentiates the different target frameworks for multi-targeted projects, and provides real-time information about what the build is doing. To opt into the new output, use the <code>--tl</code> option. For more information about this option, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build#options" data-linktype="relative-path">dotnet build options</a>.</p>
<h3 id="simplified-output-paths">Simplified output paths</h3>
<p>.NET 8 introduces an option to simplify the output path and folder structure for build outputs. Previously, .NET apps produced a deep and complex set of output paths for different build artifacts. The new, simplified output path structure gathers all build outputs into a common location, which makes it easier for tooling to anticipate.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/sdk/artifacts-output" data-linktype="relative-path">Artifacts output layout</a>.</p>
<h3 id="dotnet-workload-clean-command"><code>dotnet workload clean</code> command</h3>
<p>.NET 8 introduces a new command to clean up workload packs that might be left over through several .NET SDK or Visual Studio updates. If you encounter issues when managing workloads, consider using <code>workload clean</code> to safely restore to a known state before trying again. The command has two modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>dotnet workload clean</code></p>
<p>Runs <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2021/workloads/workload-installation.md#workload-pack-installation-records-and-garbage-collection" data-linktype="external">workload garbage collection</a> for file-based or MSI-based workloads, which cleans up orphaned packs. Orphaned packs are from uninstalled versions of the .NET SDK or packs where installation records for the pack no longer exist.</p>
<p>If Visual Studio is installed, the command also lists any workloads that you should clean up manually using Visual Studio.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>dotnet workload clean --all</code></p>
<p>This mode is more aggressive and cleans every pack on the machine that's of the current SDK workload installation type (and that's not from Visual Studio). It also removes all workload installation records for the running .NET SDK feature band and below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dotnet-publish-and-dotnet-pack-assets"><code>dotnet publish</code> and <code>dotnet pack</code> assets</h3>
<p>Since the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish" data-linktype="relative-path"><code>dotnet publish</code></a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-pack" data-linktype="relative-path"><code>dotnet pack</code></a> commands are intended to produce production assets, they now produce <code>Release</code> assets by default.</p>
<p>The following output shows the different behavior between <code>dotnet build</code> and <code>dotnet publish</code>, and how you can revert to publishing <code>Debug</code> assets by setting the <code>PublishRelease</code> property to <code>false</code>.</p>
<pre><code>/app# dotnet new console
/app# dotnet build
  app -&gt; /app/bin/Debug/net8.0/app.dll
/app# dotnet publish
  app -&gt; /app/bin/Release/net8.0/app.dll
  app -&gt; /app/bin/Release/net8.0/publish/
/app# dotnet publish -p:PublishRelease=false
  app -&gt; /app/bin/Debug/net8.0/app.dll
  app -&gt; /app/bin/Debug/net8.0/publish/
</code></pre>

<h3 id="dotnet-restore-security-auditing"><code>dotnet restore</code> security auditing</h3>
<p>Starting in .NET 8, you can opt into security checks for known vulnerabilities when dependency packages are restored. This auditing produces a report of security vulnerabilities with the affected package name, the severity of the vulnerability, and a link to the advisory for more details. When you run <code>dotnet add</code> or <code>dotnet restore</code>, warnings NU1901-NU1904 will appear for any vulnerabilities that are found. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-restore#audit-for-security-vulnerabilities" data-linktype="relative-path">Audit for security vulnerabilities</a>.</p>
<h3 id="template-engine">Template engine</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/templating" data-linktype="external">template engine</a> provides a more secure experience in .NET 8 by integrating some of NuGet's security-related features. The improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prevent downloading packages from <code>http://</code> feeds by default. For example, the following command will fail to install the template package because the source URL doesn't use HTTPS.</p>
<p><code>dotnet new install console --add-source "http://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging/dotnet-public/nuget/v3/index.json"</code></p>
<p>You can override this limitation by using the <code>--force</code> flag.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For <code>dotnet new</code>, <code>dotnet new install</code>, and <code>dotnet new update</code>, check for known vulnerabilities in the template package. If vulnerabilities are found and you wish to proceed, you must use the <code>--force</code> flag.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For <code>dotnet new</code>, provide information about the template package owner. Ownership is verified by the NuGet portal and can be considered a trustworthy characteristic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For <code>dotnet search</code> and <code>dotnet uninstall</code>, indicate whether a template is installed from a package that's "trusted"—that is, it uses a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/id-prefix-reservation" data-linktype="absolute-path">reserved prefix</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="source-link">Source Link</h3>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/sourcelink" data-linktype="relative-path">Source Link</a> is now included in the .NET SDK. The goal is that by bundling Source Link into the SDK, instead of requiring a separate <code>&lt;PackageReference&gt;</code> for the package, more packages will include this information by default. That information will improve the IDE experience for developers.</p>
<h3 id="source-build-sdk">Source-build SDK</h3>
<p>The Linux distribution-built (source-build) SDK now has the capability to build self-contained applications using the source-build runtime packages. The distribution-specific runtime package is bundled with the source-build SDK. During self-contained deployment, this bundled runtime package will be referenced, thereby enabling the feature for users.</p>
<h2 id="globalization">Globalization</h2>
<h3 id="hybridglobalization-mode-on-iostvosmaccatalyst">HybridGlobalization mode on iOS/tvOS/MacCatalyst</h3>
<p>Mobile apps can now use a new <em>hybrid</em> globalization mode that uses a lighter ICU bundle. In hybrid mode, globalization data is partially pulled from the ICU bundle and partially from calls into Native API. It serves all the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/icu/blob/dotnet/main/icu-filters/icudt_mobile.json" data-linktype="external">locales supported by mobile</a>.</p>
<p><code>HybridGlobalization</code> is most suitable for apps that can't work in <code>InvariantGlobalization</code> mode and that use cultures that were trimmed from ICU data on mobile. You can also use it when you want to load a smaller ICU data file. (The <em>icudt_hybrid.dat</em> file is 34.5 % smaller than the default ICU data file <em>icudt.dat</em>.)</p>
<p>To use <code>HybridGlobalization</code> mode, set the MSBuild property to true:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;HybridGlobalization&gt;true&lt;/HybridGlobalization&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>There are some limitations to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to limitations of Native API, not all globalization APIs are supported in hybrid mode.</li>
<li>Some of the supported APIs have different behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make sure your application isn't affected, see <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/features/globalization-hybrid-mode.md#behavioral-differences" data-linktype="external">Behavioral differences</a>.</p>

<p>The following changes have been made to .NET container images for .NET 8:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="#aspnet-composite-images" data-linktype="self-bookmark">ASP.NET composite images</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="generated-image-defaults">Generated-image defaults</h4>
<p>The new <a href="#non-root-user" data-linktype="self-bookmark"><code>non-root</code> capability</a> of the Microsoft .NET containers is now the default, which helps your apps stay secure-by-default. Change this default at any time by setting your own <code>ContainerUser</code>.</p>
<p>The default container tag is now <code>latest</code>. This default is in line with other tooling in the containers space and makes containers easier to use in inner development loops.</p>
<h4 id="debian-12">Debian 12</h4>
<p>The container images now use <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBookworm" data-linktype="external">Debian 12 (Bookworm)</a>. Debian is the default Linux distro in the .NET container images.</p>
<h4 id="non-root-user">Non-root user</h4>
<p>Images include a <code>non-root</code> user. This user makes the images <code>non-root</code> capable. To run as <code>non-root</code>, add the following line at the end of your Dockerfile (or a similar instruction in your Kubernetes manifests):</p>
<pre><code>USER app
</code></pre>
<p>.NET 8 adds an environment variable for the UID for the <code>non-root</code> user, which is 64198. This environment variable is useful for the Kubernetes <code>runAsNonRoot</code> test, which requires that the container user be set via UID and not by name. This <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/e5bc76bca49a1bbf9c11e74a590cf6a9fe9dbf2a/samples/aspnetapp/Dockerfile.alpine-non-root#L27" data-linktype="external">dockerfile</a> shows an example usage.</p>
<p>The default port also changed from port <code>80</code> to <code>8080</code>. To support this change, a new environment variable <code>ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS</code> is available to make it easier to change ports. The variable accepts a list of ports, which is simpler than the format required by <code>ASPNETCORE_URLS</code>. If you change the port back to port <code>80</code> using one of these variables, you can't run as <code>non-root</code>.</p>
<h4 id="preview-image-tags">Preview image tags</h4>
<p>Container image tags for .NET 8 Previews 1 through 7 had a <code>-preview</code> suffix, for example, <code>8.0-preview</code> and <code>8.0-preview-&lt;OS&gt;</code>. Starting in RC 1, <code>preview</code> is removed from the tag name, and those tags are no longer maintained. The new tags, <code>8.0</code> and <code>8.0-&lt;OS&gt;</code>, are permanent, and will be maintained throughout the lifetime of .NET 8.</p>
<h4 id="chiseled-ubuntu-images">Chiseled Ubuntu images</h4>
<p><a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/ubuntu/dotnet-deps" data-linktype="external">Chiseled Ubuntu images</a> are available for .NET 8. Chiseled images have a reduced attacked surface because they're ultra-small, have no package manager or shell, and are <code>non-root</code>. This type of image is for developers who want the benefit of appliance-style computing. Chiseled images are published to the <a href="https://mcr.microsoft.com/product/dotnet/nightly/aspnet/tags" data-linktype="external">.NET nightly artifact registry</a>.</p>
<h4 id="build-multi-platform-container-images">Build multi-platform container images</h4>
<p>Docker supports using and building <a href="https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/" data-linktype="external">multi-platform images</a> that work across multiple environments. .NET 8 introduces a new pattern that enables you to mix and match architectures with the .NET images you build. As an example, if you're using macOS and want to target an x64 cloud service in Azure, you can build the image by using the <code>--platform</code> switch as follows:</p>
<p><code>docker build --pull -t app --platform linux/amd64</code></p>
<p>The .NET SDK now supports <code>$TARGETARCH</code> values and the <code>-a</code> argument on restore. The following code snippet shows an example:</p>
<pre><code>RUN dotnet restore -a $TARGETARCH

# Copy everything else and build app.
COPY aspnetapp/. .
RUN dotnet publish -a $TARGETARCH --self-contained false --no-restore -o /app
</code></pre>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/improving-multiplatform-container-support/" data-linktype="external">Improving multi-platform container support</a> blog post.</p>
<h4 id="aspnet-composite-images">ASP.NET composite images</h4>
<p>As part of an effort to improve containerization performance, new ASP.NET Docker images are available that have a composite version of the runtime. This composite is built by compiling multiple MSIL assemblies into a single ready-to-run (R2R) output binary. Because these assemblies are embedded into a single image, jitting takes less time, and the startup performance of apps improves. The other big advantage of the composite over the regular ASP.NET image is that the composite images have a smaller size on disk.</p>
<p>There is a caveat to be aware of. Since composites have multiple assemblies embedded into one, they have tighter version coupling. Apps can't use custom versions of framework or ASP.NET binaries.</p>
<p>Composite images are available for the Alpine Linux, Jammy Chiseled, and Mariner Distroless platforms from the <code>mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/nightly/aspnet</code> repo. The tags are listed with the <code>-composite</code> suffix on the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-nightly-aspnet" data-linktype="external">ASP.NET Docker page</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#performance-and-compatibility" data-linktype="self-bookmark">Performance and compatibility</a></li>
<li><a href="#authentication" data-linktype="self-bookmark">Authentication</a></li>
<li><a href="#publish-to-targz-archive" data-linktype="self-bookmark">Publish to tar.gz archive</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="performance-and-compatibility">Performance and compatibility</h4>
<p>.NET 8 has improved performance for pushing containers to remote registries, especially Azure registries. Speedup comes from pushing layers in one operation and, for registries that don't support atomic uploads, a more reliable chunking mechanism.</p>
<p>These improvements also mean that more registries are supported: Harbor, Artifactory, Quay.io, and Podman.</p>
<h4 id="authentication">Authentication</h4>
<p>.NET 8 adds support for OAuth token exchange authentication (Azure Managed Identity) when pushing containers to registries. This support means that you can now push to registries like Azure Container Registry without any authentication errors. The following commands show an example publishing flow:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; az acr login -n &lt;your registry name&gt;
&gt; dotnet publish -r linux-x64 -p PublishProfile=DefaultContainer

<h4 id="publish-to-targz-archive">Publish to tar.gz archive</h4>
<p>Starting in .NET 8, you can create a container directly as a <em>tar.gz</em> archive. This feature is useful if your workflow isn't straightforward and requires that you, for example, run a scanning tool over your images before pushing them. Once the archive is created, you can move it, scan it, or load it into a local Docker toolchain.</p>
<p>To publish to an archive, add the <code>ContainerArchiveOutputPath</code> property to your <code>dotnet publish</code> command, for example:</p>
<pre><code>dotnet publish \
  -p PublishProfile=DefaultContainer \
  -p ContainerArchiveOutputPath=./images/sdk-container-demo.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<p>You can specify either a folder name or a path with a specific file name.</p>

<p>.NET 8 includes a new source generator that supports interoperating with COM interfaces. You can use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.marshalling.generatedcominterfaceattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">GeneratedComInterfaceAttribute</a> to mark an interface as a COM interface for the source generator. The source generator will then generate code to enable calling from C# code to unmanaged code. It also generates code to enable calling from unmanaged code into C#. This source generator integrates with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.libraryimportattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">LibraryImportAttribute</a>, and you can use types with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.marshalling.generatedcominterfaceattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">GeneratedComInterfaceAttribute</a> as parameters and return types in <code>LibraryImport</code>-attributed methods.</p>
<pre><code>using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshalling;

[GeneratedComInterface]
[Guid("5401c312-ab23-4dd3-aa40-3cb4b3a4683e")]
interface IComInterface
{
    void DoWork();
}

internal class MyNativeLib
{
    [LibraryImport(nameof(MyNativeLib))]
    public static partial void GetComInterface(out IComInterface comInterface);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The source generator also supports the new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.marshalling.generatedcomclassattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">GeneratedComClassAttribute</a> attribute to enable you to pass types that implement interfaces with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.marshalling.generatedcominterfaceattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">GeneratedComInterfaceAttribute</a> attribute to unmanaged code. The source generator will generate the code necessary to expose a COM object that implements the interfaces and forwards calls to the managed implementation.</p>
<p>Methods on interfaces with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.marshalling.generatedcominterfaceattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">GeneratedComInterfaceAttribute</a> attribute support all the same types as <code>LibraryImportAttribute</code>, and <code>LibraryImportAttribute</code> now supports <code>GeneratedComInterface</code>-attributed types and <code>GeneratedComClass</code>-attributed types.</p>
<p>If your C# code only uses a <code>GeneratedComInterface</code>-attributed interface to either wrap a COM object from unmanaged code or wrap a managed object from C# to expose to unmanaged code, you can use the options in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.marshalling.generatedcominterfaceattribute.options#system-runtime-interopservices-marshalling-generatedcominterfaceattribute-options" data-linktype="absolute-path">Options</a> property to customize which code will be generated. These options mean you don't need to write marshallers for scenarios that you know won't be used.</p>
<p>The source generator uses the new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.marshalling.strategybasedcomwrappers" data-linktype="absolute-path">StrategyBasedComWrappers</a> type to create and manage the COM object wrappers and the managed object wrappers. This new type handles providing the expected .NET user experience for COM interop, while providing customization points for advanced users. If your application has its own mechanism for defining types from COM or if you need to support scenarios that source-generated COM doesn't currently support, consider using the new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.marshalling.strategybasedcomwrappers" data-linktype="absolute-path">StrategyBasedComWrappers</a> type to add the missing features for your scenario and get the same .NET user experience for your COM types.</p>
<p>If you're using Visual Studio, new analyzers and code fixes make it easy to convert your existing COM interop code to use source-generated interop. Next to each interface that has the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.comimportattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">ComImportAttribute</a>, a lightbulb offers an option to convert to source-generated interop. The fix changes the interface to use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.marshalling.generatedcominterfaceattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">GeneratedComInterfaceAttribute</a> attribute. And next to every class that implements an interface with <code>GeneratedComInterfaceAttribute</code>, a lightbulb offers an option to add the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.marshalling.generatedcomclassattribute" data-linktype="absolute-path">GeneratedComClassAttribute</a> attribute to the type. Once your types are converted, you can move your <code>DllImport</code> methods to use <code>LibraryImportAttribute</code>.</p>
<h3 id="limitations-1">Limitations</h3>
<p>The COM source generator doesn't support apartment affinity, using the <code>new</code> keyword to activate a COM CoClass, and the following APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.unmanagedtype#system-runtime-interopservices-unmanagedtype-idispatch" data-linktype="absolute-path">IDispatch</a>-based interfaces.</li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.unmanagedtype#system-runtime-interopservices-unmanagedtype-iinspectable" data-linktype="absolute-path">IInspectable</a>-based interfaces.</li>
<li>COM properties and events.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="net-on-linux">.NET on Linux</h2>
<h3 id="minimum-support-baselines-for-linux">Minimum support baselines for Linux</h3>
<p>The minimum support baselines for Linux have been updated for .NET 8. .NET is built targeting Ubuntu 16.04, for all architectures. That's primarily important for defining the minimum <code>glibc</code> version for .NET 8. .NET 8 will fail to start on distro versions that include an older glibc, such as Ubuntu 14.04 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/linux-support.md#red-hat-enterprise-linux-family-support" data-linktype="external">Red Hat Enterprise Linux Family support</a>.</p>
<h3 id="build-your-own-net-on-linux">Build your own .NET on Linux</h3>
<p>In previous .NET versions, you could build .NET from source, but it required you to create a "source tarball" from the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/installer" data-linktype="external">dotnet/installer</a> repo commit that corresponded to a release. In .NET 8, that's no longer necessary and you can build .NET on Linux directly from the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet" data-linktype="external">dotnet/dotnet</a> repository. That repo uses <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/source-build" data-linktype="external">dotnet/source-build</a> to build .NET runtimes, tools, and SDKs. This is the same build that Red Hat and Canonical use to build .NET.</p>
<p>Building in a container is the easiest approach for most people, since the <code>dotnet-buildtools/prereqs</code> container images contain all the required dependencies. For more information, see the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet#building" data-linktype="external">build instructions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="cross-built-windows-apps">Cross-built Windows apps</h2>
<p>When you build apps that target Windows on non-Windows platforms, the resulting executable is now updated with any specified Win32 resources—for example, application icon, manifest, version information.</p>
<p>Previously, applications had to be built on Windows in order to have such resources. Fixing this gap in cross-building support has been a popular request, as it was a significant pain point affecting both infrastructure complexity and resource usage.</p>
<h2 id="aot-compilation-for-android-apps">AOT compilation for Android apps</h2>
<p>To decrease app size, .NET and .NET MAUI apps that target Android use <em>profiled</em> ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation mode when they're built in Release mode. Profiled AOT compilation affects fewer methods than regular AOT compilation. .NET 8 introduces the <code>&lt;AndroidStripILAfterAOT&gt;</code> property that lets you opt-in to further AOT compilation for Android apps to decrease app size even more.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;AndroidStripILAfterAOT&gt;true&lt;/AndroidStripILAfterAOT&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>By default, setting <code>AndroidStripILAfterAOT</code> to <code>true</code> overrides the default <code>AndroidEnableProfiledAot</code> setting, allowing (nearly) all methods that were AOT-compiled to be trimmed. You can also use profiled AOT and IL stripping together by explicitly setting both properties to <code>true</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;AndroidStripILAfterAOT&gt;true&lt;/AndroidStripILAfterAOT&gt;
  &lt;AndroidEnableProfiledAot&gt;true&lt;/AndroidEnableProfiledAot&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="code-analysis">Code analysis</h2>
<p>.NET 8 includes several new code analyzers and fixers to help verify that you're using .NET library APIs correctly and efficiently. The following table summarizes the new analyzers.</p>

<h3 id="hardware-acceleration">Hardware acceleration</h3>
<p>Previously, all WPF applications that were accessed remotely had to use software rendering, even if the system had hardware rendering capabilities. .NET 8 adds an option that lets you opt into hardware acceleration for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).</p>
<p>Hardware acceleration refers to the use of a computer's graphics processing unit (GPU) to speed up the rendering of graphics and visual effects in an application. This can result in improved performance and more seamless, responsive graphics. In contrast, software rendering relies solely on the computer's central processing unit (CPU) to render graphics, which can be slower and less effective.</p>
<p>To opt in, set the <code>Switch.System.Windows.Media.EnableHardwareAccelerationInRdp</code> configuration property to <code>true</code> in a <em>runtimeconfig.json</em> file. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/runtime-config/wpf#hardware-acceleration-in-rdp" data-linktype="relative-path">Hardware acceleration in RDP</a>.</p>
<h3 id="openfolderdialog">OpenFolderDialog</h3>
<p>WPF includes a new dialog box control called <code>OpenFolderDialog</code>. This control lets app users browse and select folders. Previously, app developers relied on third-party software to achieve this functionality.</p>
<pre><code>var openFolderDialog = new OpenFolderDialog()
{
    Title = "Select folder to open ...",
    InitialDirectory = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ProgramFiles),
};

string folderName = "";
if (openFolderDialog.ShowDialog())
{
    folderName = openFolderDialog.FolderName;
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="nuget">NuGet</h2>
<p>Starting in .NET 8, NuGet verifies signed packages on Linux by default. NuGet continues to verify signed packages on Windows as well.</p>
<p>Most users shouldn't notice the verification. However, if you have an existing root certificate bundle located at <em>/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/objsign-ca-bundle.pem</em>, you may see trust failures accompanied by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/errors-and-warnings/nu3042" data-linktype="absolute-path">warning NU3042</a>.</p>
<p>You can opt out of verification by setting the environment variable <code>DOTNET_NUGET_SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION</code> to <code>false</code>.</p>
<h2 id="diagnostics">Diagnostics</h2>
<h3 id="c-hot-reload-supports-modifying-generics">C# Hot Reload supports modifying generics</h3>
<p>Starting in .NET 8, C# Hot Reload <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/hot-reload-generics/" data-linktype="external">supports modifying generic types and generic methods</a>. When you debug console, desktop, mobile, or WebAssembly applications with Visual Studio, you can apply changes to generic classes and generic methods in C# code or Razor pages.

<p>When German engineers were developing the Tiger II in the 1940s, they probably never thought that a miniature remote control version of their tank would be used to help develop a space craft for the United States 50 years later.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title --><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_page_title - under_page_title -->



<p>In the 1990s, NASA was stress-testing tires for their Space Shuttle, a very dangerous job that could end with a tire exploding with the force of a few sticks of dynamite. This was too hazardous for staff to approach, so they custom-made an RC drilling vehicle from a Tamiya remote control Tiger tank.</p>



<p>Looking like it was pulled straight out of Small Soldiers, the tank, named the Tire Assault Vehicle, or TAV, would drive up to Space Shuttle tires and drill holes in them to release the pressure inside.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph --><p><span data-ez-name="tankhistoria_com-medrectangle-3"></span><span data-nosnippet="" data-ez-ph-owner-id="110"><span><img src="https://go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png" alt="Ezoic" loading="lazy" title="ezoic" name="?pageview_id=e50b9d67-0897-4c81-6fee-3179fa0f9f90&amp;ad_position_id=110&amp;impression_group_id=tankhistoria_com-medrectangle-3/2023-11-11/3143925374914230&amp;ad_size=580x400&amp;domain_id=339702&amp;url=https://tankhistoria.com/experimental/tire-assault-vehicle/"></span></span></p><!-- End Ezoic - wp_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph -->



<h2>Creating the Tire Assault Vehicle</h2>



<p>NASA’s engineering prowess is the stuff of legend. They are famous for extremely tight tolerances, redundancies, and intensely scrutinising and testing systems over and over again. After all, sending anything into space is dangerous and mind-bogglingly expensive affair.</p>



<p>Unlike a tank, which will drive along quite happily with a few wheels missing or some holes in it, spacecraft are very delicate, and even a single error can result in a catastrophe.</p>

<p>This makes how NASA approached testing the tires for the Space Shuttle orbiter even more hilarious.</p>



<p>The Space Shuttle was a radical departure from previous space vehicles as it was reusable. The orbiter was able to glide back down to Earth, deploy three landing gear legs and land on rubber tires. However as this one was hefty machine designed for extremely high-speed travel, it had a high landing speed and required a long runway.</p><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_first_paragraph-640x360-999998-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_first_paragraph-640x360-999998-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_first_paragraph-426x240-999998-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_first_paragraph-426x240-999998-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_first_paragraph-384x216-999998-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_first_paragraph-384x216-999998-nonexxxclearxxxblock -->

<p>These high landing speeds meant the Shuttle’s landing gear was subjected to tremendous forces. The tires had to be extremely strong to cope with such forces, and so, like everything else on the Space Shuttle, they were engineering marvels.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_mid_content - mid_content --><!-- End Ezoic - wp_mid_content - mid_content -->



<p>The tires were constructed from a bias-ply structure, which is capable of withstanding greater loads and offers better puncture resistance than the radial-ply tyres we have in our cars. They were filled with nitrogen, and pressurised to between 300 psi (21 bar) and 360 psi, (25 bar) depending on the tire.</p>



<p>Of course, these tyres had to be thoroughly tested before being used on an actual Shuttle, and for this NASA employed their CV-990 Landing Systems Research Aircraft (LSRA).</p>

<p>This is where the little Tire Assault Vehicle comes in.</p>



<p>When a tire pressurised to over 300 psi explodes, it releases the equivalent energy of around two and a half sticks of dynamite. These rubber bombs could injure people up to 50 feet away, and damage hearing at up to 100 feet.</p>



<p>During failure tests, some tires would be worn down so much that just one or two plies remained to contain the pressure.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_longest_content - longest_content --><p><span data-ez-name="tankhistoria_com-leader-1"></span><span data-nosnippet="" data-ez-ph-owner-id="115"><span><img src="https://go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png" alt="Ezoic" loading="lazy" title="ezoic" name="?pageview_id=e50b9d67-0897-4c81-6fee-3179fa0f9f90&amp;ad_position_id=115&amp;impression_group_id=tankhistoria_com-leader-1/2023-11-11/3160680846836936&amp;ad_size=336x280&amp;domain_id=339702&amp;url=https://tankhistoria.com/experimental/tire-assault-vehicle/"></span></span></p><!-- End Ezoic - wp_longest_content - longest_content -->



<p>These unpredictable bombs could explode any second and were too dangerous for staff to approach. Edwards AFB had access to a bomb disposal robot, but it was too large to fit under the CV-990, and at $100,000 (in the 1990s!) was a little too expensive to loose to an exploding tire.</p>



<p>So NASA commissioned physicist Dr. David Carrot to create a much cheaper remote method of approaching, inspecting, and drilling into damaged Space Shuttle tires.</p>



<p>Did David develop a super-advanced, futuristic robot assistant made from carbon fibre and titanium? No, he bought a remote control Tiger II, and strapped a drill and camera to it.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_5 - incontent_5 --><p><span data-ez-name="tankhistoria_com-leader-4"></span><span data-nosnippet="" data-ez-ph-owner-id="116"><span><img src="https://go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png" alt="Ezoic" loading="lazy" title="ezoic" name="?pageview_id=e50b9d67-0897-4c81-6fee-3179fa0f9f90&amp;ad_position_id=116&amp;impression_group_id=tankhistoria_com-leader-4/2023-11-11/7130522828893563&amp;ad_size=336x280&amp;domain_id=339702&amp;url=https://tankhistoria.com/experimental/tire-assault-vehicle/"></span></span></p><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_5 - incontent_5 -->

<p>David’s vehicle of choice was Tamiya’s 1/16-scale production turret Tiger II – product number 56004, for those who perhaps wanted to recreate this Frankenstein’s monster.</p>



<p>The kit was released in 1981, and today fetches quite a premium second hand. However it was, for the time and size, quite a faithful rendition of a Tiger II. Its lower hull was made of metal, as was its suspension swing arms and some of the running gear.</p>

<p>Inside, real torsion bars criss-cross the hull floor, electric motors powered a gearbox that drove the tracks, and the whole thing was remotely controlled. It was completed with miniature metal Tiger II track links</p>



<p>David discarded the kit’s plastic upper hull and turret, leaving only the running gear and rear “armor plate” on the lower hull.</p>



<p>He also removed the kit’s original motors and replaced them with Black and Decker drill motors powered by a single 12V battery. The motors sent their power through separate gearboxes so each track could be independently controlled.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_7 - incontent_7 --><p><span data-nosnippet="" data-ez-ph-owner-id="118"><span><img src="https://go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png" alt="Ezoic" loading="lazy" title="ezoic" name="?pageview_id=e50b9d67-0897-4c81-6fee-3179fa0f9f90&amp;ad_position_id=118&amp;impression_group_id=tankhistoria_com-large-mobile-banner-2/2023-11-11/3205766276908901&amp;ad_size=336x280&amp;domain_id=339702&amp;url=https://tankhistoria.com/experimental/tire-assault-vehicle/"></span></span></p><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_7 - incontent_7 -->

<p>Above this, a metal sheet covered the upper hull. There appears to have been some effort made to retain the Tiger’s original shape – whether for practical reasons or simply for fun – as the hull was clearly bent to resemble the real thing. It was even fitted with side skirts that closely match the original.</p>



<p>It received an metal upper glacis too, which, again, replicated the real thing.</p>



<p>The very top of the Tire Assault Vehicle was outfitted with a 3/8-inch DeWalt Drill and a small camera. Initially a hollow drill bit was used to allow the air inside the tire to vent out, but this was later discarded as it wasn’t necessary.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_8 - incontent_8 --><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_8 - incontent_8 -->

<p>The transmitter/receiver was supplied from the RC aircraft world, and allowed for control over each track and the drill. The camera relayed its signal wirelessly onto a black and white screen.</p>



<p>In the end, David had created an awesome little machine 18 inches (46 cm) long, 8 inches (20 cm) wide and 12 inches (30 cm) tall that weighed only 20 lbs (9 kg). Perhaps most importantly though, it had cost less than $3,000.</p><!-- Ezoic - wp_incontent_9 - incontent_9 --><!-- End Ezoic - wp_incontent_9 - incontent_9 -->



<p>It was named the Tire Assault Vehicle, likely in homage to its tank chassis, and used on 32 missions. When the CV-990 landed, an operator, positioned at a safe distance, would remotely drive the TAV up to the damaged Shuttle wheel and carry out an inspection.</p>

  <h3 id="pr6.1">November 10th, 2023, FFmpeg 6.1 "Heaviside"</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_6.1">FFmpeg 6.1 "Heaviside"</a>, a new
    major release, is now available! Some of the highlights:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>libaribcaption decoder</li>
    <li>Playdate video decoder and demuxer</li>
    <li>Extend VAAPI support for libva-win32 on Windows</li>

    <li>Bitstream filter for converting VVC from MP4 to Annex B</li>
    <li>scale_vt filter for videotoolbox</li>
    <li>transpose_vt filter for videotoolbox</li>
    <li>support for the P_SKIP hinting to speed up libx264 encoding</li>
    <li>Support HEVC,VP9,AV1 codec in enhanced flv format</li>
    <li>apsnr and asisdr audio filters</li>

    <li>ffprobe -output_format option added as an alias of -of</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This release had been overdue for at least half a year, but due to constant activity in the repository,
    had to be delayed, and we were finally able to branch off the release recently, before some of the large
    changes scheduled for 7.0 were merged.
  </p>
  <p>
    Internally, we have had a number of changes too. The FFT, MDCT, DCT and DST implementation used for codecs
    and filters has been fully replaced with the faster libavutil/tx (full article about it coming soon).<br>
    This also led to a reduction in the the size of the compiled binary, which can be noticeable in small builds.<br>
    There was a very large reduction in the total amount of allocations being done on each frame throughout video decoders,
    reducing overhead.<br>
    RISC-V optimizations for many parts of our DSP code have been merged, with mainly the large decoders being left.<br>
    There was an effort to improve the correctness of timestamps and frame durations of each packet, increasing the
    accurracy of variable frame rate video.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next major release will be version 7.0, scheduled to be released in February. We will attempt to better stick
    to the new release schedule we announced at the start of this year.
  </p>
  <p>
    We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.
  </p>

  <h3 id="vk2023">May 31st, 2023, Vulkan decoding</h3>
  <p>
    A few days ago, Vulkan-powered decoding hardware acceleration code was merged into the codebase.
    This is the first vendor-generic and platform-generic decode acceleration API, enabling the
    same code to be used on multiple platforms, with very minimal overhead.
    This is also the first multi-threaded hardware decoding API, and our code makes full use of this,
    saturating all available decode engines the hardware exposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Those wishing to test the code can read our
    <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/HWAccelIntro#Vulkan">documentation page</a>.
    For those who would like to integrate FFmpeg's Vulkan code to demux, parse, decode, and receive
    a VkImage to present or manipulate, documentation and examples are available in our source tree.
    Currently, using the latest available git checkout of our
    <a href="https://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=summary">repository</a> is required.
    The functionality will be included in stable branches with the release of version 6.1, due
    to be released soon.
  </p><p>
    As this is also the first practical implementation of the specifications, bugs may be present,
    particularly in drivers, and, although passing verification, the implementation itself.
    New codecs, and encoding support are also being worked on, by both the Khronos organization
    for standardizing, and us as implementing it, and giving feedback on improving.
  </p>

  <h3 id="pr6.0">February 28th, 2023, FFmpeg 6.0 "Von Neumann"</h3>
  <p>
    A new major release, <a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_6.0">FFmpeg 6.0 "Von Neumann"</a>,
    is now available for download. This release has many new encoders and decoders, filters,
    ffmpeg CLI tool improvements, and also, changes the way releases are done. All major
    releases will now bump the version of the ABI. We plan to have a new major release each
    year. Another release-specific change is that deprecated APIs will be removed after 3
    releases, upon the next major bump.
    This means that releases will be done more often and will be more organized.
  </p>
  <p>
    New decoders featured are Bonk, RKA, Radiance, SC-4, APAC, VQC, WavArc and a few ADPCM formats.
    QSV and NVenc now support AV1 encoding. The FFmpeg CLI (we usually reffer to it as ffmpeg.c
    to avoid confusion) has speed-up improvements due to threading, as well as statistics options,
    and the ability to pass option values for filters from a file. There are quite a few new audio
    and video filters, such as adrc, showcwt, backgroundkey and ssim360, with a few hardware ones too.
    Finally, the release features many behind-the-scenes changes, including a new FFT and MDCT
    implementation used in codecs (expect a blog post about this soon), numerous bugfixes, better
    ICC profile handling and colorspace signalling improvement, introduction of a number of RISC-V
    vector and scalar assembly optimized routines, and a few new improved APIs, which can be viewed
    in the doc/APIchanges file in our tree.
    A few submitted features, such as the Vulkan improvements and more FFT optimizations will be in the
    next minor release, 6.1, which we plan to release soon, in line with our new release schedule.
    Some highlights are:
  </p>

  <h3 id="photosensitivity">October 5th, 2019, Bright Lights</h3>
  <p>
  FFmpeg has added a realtime bright flash removal filter to libavfilter.
  </p>
  <p>
  Note that this filter is not FDA approved, nor are we medical professionals.
  Nor has this filter been tested with anyone who has photosensitive epilepsy.
  FFmpeg and its photosensitivity filter are not making any medical claims.
  </p>
  <p>
  That said, this is a new video filter that may help photosensitive people
  watch tv, play video games or even be used with a VR headset to block
  out epiletic triggers such as filtered sunlight when they are outside.
  Or you could use it against those annoying white flashes on your tv screen.
  The filter fails on some input, such as the
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L_9hXnUzRk">Incredibles 2 Screen Slaver</a>
  scene. It is not perfect. If you have other clips that you want this filter to
  work better on, please report them to us on our <a href="http://trac.ffmpeg.org/">trac</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/~compn/output20p8.mp4">See for yourself</a>.
  Example was made with -vf photosensitivity=20:0.8
  </p>
  <p>
  We are not professionals. Please use this in your medical studies to
  advance epilepsy research. If you decide to use this in a medical
  setting, or make a hardware hdmi input output realtime tv filter,
  or find another use for this, <a href="mailto:compn@ffmpeg.org">please let me know</a>.
  This filter was a feature request of mine
  <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/2104">since 2013</a>.

  <h3 id="gsoc2016finalreport">October 30th, 2016, Results: Summer Of Code 2016.</h3>
  <p>
    This has been a long time coming but we wanted to give a proper closure to our participation in this run of the program and it takes time. Sometimes it's just to get the final report for each project trimmed down, others, is finalizing whatever was still in progress when the program finished: final patches need to be merged, TODO lists stabilized, future plans agreed; you name it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Without further ado, here's the silver-lining for each one of the projects we sought to complete during this Summer of Code season:
  </p>
  <h4>FFv1 (Mentor: Michael Niedermayer)</h4>
  <p>
    Stanislav Dolganov designed and implemented experimental support for motion estimation and compensation in the lossless FFV1 codec. The design and implementation is based on the snow video codec, which uses OBMC. Stanislav's work proved that significant compression gains can be achieved with inter frame compression. FFmpeg welcomes Stanislav to continue working beyond this proof of concept and bring its advances into the official FFV1 specification within the IETF.
  </p>
  <h4>Self test coverage (Mentor: Michael Niedermayer)</h4>
  <p>
    Petru Rares Sincraian added several self-tests to FFmpeg and successfully went through the in-some-cases tedious process of fine tuning tests parameters to avoid known and hard to avoid problems, like checksum mismatches due to rounding errors on the myriad of platforms we support. His work has improved the code coverage of our self tests considerably.
  </p>
  <h4>MPEG-4 ALS encoder implementation (Mentor: Thilo Borgmann)</h4>
  <p>
    Umair Khan updated and integrated the ALS encoder to fit in the current FFmpeg codebase. He also implemented a missing feature for the ALS decoder that enables floating-point sample decoding. FFmpeg support for MPEG-4 ALS has been improved significantly by Umair's work. We welcome him to keep maintaining his improvements and hope for great contributions to come.
  </p>
  <h4>Tee muxer improvements (Mentor: Marton Balint)</h4>
  <p>
    Ján Sebechlebský's generic goal was to improve the tee muxer so it tolerated blocking IO and allowed transparent error recovery. During the design phase it turned out that this functionality called for a separate muxer, so Ján spent his summer working on the so-called FIFO muxer, gradually fixing issues all over the codebase. He succeeded in his task, and the FIFO muxer is now part of the main repository, alongside several other improvements he made in the process.
  </p>
  <h4>TrueHD encoder (Mentor: Rostislav Pehlivanov)</h4>
  <p>
    Jai Luthra's objective was to update the out-of-tree and pretty much abandoned MLP (Meridian Lossless Packing) encoder for libavcodec and improve it to enable encoding to the TrueHD format. For the qualification period the encoder was updated such that it was usable and throughout the summer, successfully improved adding support for multi-channel audio and TrueHD encoding. Jai's code has been merged into the main repository now. While a few problems remain with respect to LFE channel and 32 bit sample handling, these are in the process of being fixed such that effort can be finally put in improving the encoder's speed and efficiency.
  </p>
  <h4>Motion interpolation filter (Mentor: Paul B Mahol)</h4>
  <p>
    Davinder Singh investigated existing motion estimation and interpolation approaches from the available literature and previous work by our own: Michael Niedermayer, and implemented filters based on this research. These filters allow motion interpolating frame rate conversion to be applied to a video, for example, to create a slow motion effect or change the frame rate while smoothly interpolating the video along the motion vectors. There's still work to be done to call these filters 'finished', which is rather hard all things considered, but we are looking optimistically at their future.
  </p>
  <p>
    And that's it. We are happy with the results of the program and immensely thankful for the opportunity of working with such an amazing set of students. We can be a tough crowd but our mentors did an amazing job at hand holding our interns through their journey. Thanks also to Google for this wonderful program and to everyone that made room in their busy lives to help making GSoC2016 a success. See you in 2017!

  <h3 id="sdl1">September 24th, 2016, SDL1 support dropped.</h3>
  <p>
    Support for the SDL1 library has been dropped, due to it no longer being maintained (as of
    January, 2012) and it being superseded by the SDL2 library. As a result, the SDL1 output device
    has also been removed and replaced by an SDL2 implementation. Both the ffplay and opengl output
    devices have been updated to support SDL2.

    <a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_3.1">FFmpeg 3.1.2</a>, a new point release from the 3.1 release branch, is now available!
    It fixes several bugs.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend users, distributors, and system integrators, to upgrade unless they use current git master.
  </p>
  <h3 id="ffserv">July 10th, 2016, ffserver program being dropped</h3>
  <p>
    After thorough deliberation, we're announcing that we're about to drop the ffserver program from the project starting with the next release.
    ffserver has been a problematic program to maintain due to its use of internal APIs, which complicated the recent cleanups to the libavformat
    library, and block further cleanups and improvements which are desired by API users and will be easier to maintain. Furthermore the program has
    been hard for users to deploy and run due to reliability issues, lack of knowledgable people to help and confusing configuration file syntax.
    Current users and members of the community are invited to write a replacement program to fill the same niche that ffserver did using the new APIs
    and to contact us so we may point users to test and contribute to its development.

  <h3 id="removing_external_aac_encoders">January 30, 2016, Removing support for two external AAC encoders</h3>
  <p>
    We have just removed support for VisualOn AAC encoder (libvo-aacenc) and
    libaacplus in FFmpeg master.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even before marking our internal AAC encoder as
    <a href="#aac_encoder_stable">stable</a>, it was known that libvo-aacenc
    was of an inferior quality compared to our native one for most samples.
    However, the VisualOn encoder was used extensively by the Android Open
    Source Project, and we would like to have a tested-and-true stable option
    in our code base.
  </p>
  <p>
    When first committed in 2011, libaacplus filled in the gap of encoding
    High Efficiency AAC formats (HE-AAC and HE-AACv2), which was not supported
    by any of the encoders in FFmpeg at that time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The circumstances for both have changed. After the work spearheaded by
    Rostislav Pehlivanov and Claudio Freire, the now-stable FFmpeg native AAC
    encoder is ready to compete with much more mature encoders. The Fraunhofer
    FDK AAC Codec Library for Android was added in 2012 as the fourth
    supported external AAC encoder, and the one with the best quality and the
    most features supported, including HE-AAC and HE-AACv2.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, we have decided that it is time to remove libvo-aacenc and
    libaacplus. If you are currently using libvo-aacenc, prepare to transition
    to the native encoder (<code>aac</code>) when updating to the next version
    of FFmpeg. In most cases it is as simple as merely swapping the encoder
    name. If you are currently using libaacplus, start using FDK AAC
    (<code>libfdk_aac</code>) with an appropriate <code>profile</code> option
    to select the exact AAC profile that fits your needs. In both cases, you
    will enjoy an audible quality improvement and as well as fewer licensing
    headaches.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enjoy!

  </p>

  <h3 id="aac_encoder_stable">December 5th, 2015, The native FFmpeg AAC encoder is now stable!</h3>
  <p>
    After seven years the native FFmpeg AAC encoder has had its experimental flag
    removed and declared as ready for general use. The encoder is transparent
    at 128kbps for most samples tested with artifacts only appearing in extreme
    cases. Subjective quality tests put the encoder to be of equal or greater
    quality than most of the other encoders available to the public.
  </p>
  <p>
    Licensing has always been an issue with encoding AAC audio as most of the
    encoders have had a license making FFmpeg unredistributable if compiled with
    support for them. The fact that there now exists a fully open and truly
    free AAC encoder integrated directly within the project means a lot to those
    who wish to use accepted and widespread standards.
  </p>
  <p>
    The majority of the work done to bring the encoder up to quality was started
    during this year's GSoC by developer Claudio Freire and Rostislav Pehlivanov.
    Both continued to work on the encoder with the latter joining as a developer
    and mainainer, working on other parts of the project as well. Also, thanks
    to <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kamedo2/">Kamedo2</a> who does comparisons
    and tests, the original authors and all past and current contributors to the
    encoder. Users are suggested and encouraged to use the encoder and provide
    feedback or breakage reports through our <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/">bug tracker</a>.

  <h3 id="gsoc2015_result">September 29th, 2015, GSoC 2015 results</h3>

  <p>
    FFmpeg participated to the latest edition of
    the <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015">Google
    Summer of Code</a> Project. FFmpeg got a total of 8 assigned
    projects, and 7 of them were successful.
  </p>

  <p>We want to thank <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, the
    participating students, and especially the mentors who joined this
    effort. We're looking forward to participating in the next GSoC
    edition!
  </p>

  <p>
    Below you can find a brief description of the final outcome of
    each single project.
  </p>

  <h4>Basic servers for network protocols, mentee: Stephan Holljes, mentor: Nicolas George</h4>

  <p>
    Stephan Holljes's project for this session of Google Summer of Code was to
    implement basic HTTP server features for libavformat, to complement the
    already present HTTP client and RTMP and RTSP server code.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first part of the project was to make the HTTP code capable of accepting
    a single client; it was completed partly during the qualification period and
    partly during the first week of the summer. Thanks to this work, it is now
    possible to make a simple HTTP stream using the following commands:
  </p>

  <pre>    ffmpeg -i /dev/video0 -listen 1 -f matroska \
    -c:v libx264 -preset fast -tune zerolatency http://:8080
    ffplay http://localhost:8080/
  </pre>

  <p>
    The next part of the project was to extend the code to be able to accept
    several clients, simultaneously or consecutively. Since libavformat did not
    have an API for that kind of task, it was necessary to design one. This part
    was mostly completed before the midterm and applied shortly afterwards.
    Since the ffmpeg command-line tool is not ready to serve several clients,
    the test ground for that new API is an example program serving hard-coded
    content.
  </p>

  <p>
    The last and most ambitious part of the project was to update ffserver to
    make use of the new API. It would prove that the API is usable to implement
    real HTTP servers, and expose the points where more control was needed. By
    the end of the summer, a first working patch series was undergoing code
    review.
  </p>

  <h4>Browsing content on the server, mentee: Mariusz Szczepańczyk, mentor: Lukasz Marek</h4>

  <p>
    Mariusz finished an API prepared by the FFmpeg community and implemented
    Samba directory listing as qualification task.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the program he extended the API with the possibility to
    remove and rename files on remote servers. He completed the
    implementation of these features for file, Samba, SFTP, and FTP
    protocols.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of the program, Mariusz provided a sketch of an
    implementation for HTTP directory listening.
  </p>

  <h4>Directshow digital video capture, mentee: Mate Sebok, mentor: Roger Pack</h4>

  <p>
    Mate was working on directshow input from digital video sources. He
    got working input from ATSC input sources, with specifiable tuner.
  </p>

  <p>
    The code has not been committed, but a patch of it was sent to the
    ffmpeg-devel mailing list for future use.
  </p>

  <p>
    The mentor plans on cleaning it up and committing it, at least for the
    ATSC side of things. Mate and the mentor are still working trying to
    finally figure out how to get DVB working.
  </p>

  <h4>Implementing full support for 3GPP Timed Text Subtitles, mentee: Niklesh Lalwani, mentor: Philip Langdale</h4>

  <p>
    Niklesh's project was to expand our support for 3GPP Timed Text
    subtitles. This is the native subtitle format for mp4 containers, and
    is interesting because it's usually the only subtitle format supported
    by the stock playback applications on iOS and Android devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    ffmpeg already had basic support for these subtitles which ignored all
    formatting information - it just provided basic plain-text support.
  </p>

  <p>
    Niklesh did work to add support on both the encode and decode side for
    text formatting capabilities, such as font size/colour and effects like
    bold/italics, highlighting, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    The main challenge here is that Timed Text handles formatting in a very
    different way from most common subtitle formats. It uses a binary
    encoding (based on mp4 boxes, naturally) and stores information
    separately from the text itself. This requires additional work to track
    which parts of the text formatting applies to, and explicitly dealing
    with overlapping formatting (which other formats support but Timed
    Text does not) so it requires breaking the overlapping sections into
    separate non-overlapping ones with different formatting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, Niklesh had to be careful about not trusting any size
    information in the subtitles - and that's no joke: the now infamous
    Android stagefright bug was in code for parsing Timed Text subtitles.
  </p>

  <p>
    All of Niklesh's work is committed and was released in ffmpeg 2.8.
  </p>

<h4>libswscale refactoring, mentee: Pedro Arthur, mentors: Michael Niedermayer, Ramiro Polla</h4>

  <p>
    Pedro Arthur has modularized the vertical and horizontal scalers.
    To do this he designed and implemented a generic filter framework
    and moved the existing scaler code into it. These changes now allow
    easily adding removing, splitting or merging processing steps.
    The implementation was benchmarked and several alternatives were
    tried to avoid speed loss.
  </p>

  <p>
    He also added gamma corrected scaling support.
    An example to use gamma corrected scaling would be:
  </p>

  <pre>    ffmpeg -i input -vf scale=512:384:gamma=1 output
  </pre>

  <p>
    Pedro has done impressive work considering the short time available,
    and he is a FFmpeg committer now. He continues to contribute to
    FFmpeg, and has fixed some bugs in libswscale after GSoC has
    ended.
  </p>

  <h4>AAC Encoder Improvements, mentee: Rostislav Pehlivanov, mentor: Claudio Freire</h4>

  <p>
    Rostislav Pehlivanov has implemented PNS, TNS, I/S coding and main
    prediction on the native AAC encoder. Of all those extensions, only
    TNS was left in a less-than-usable state, but the implementation has
    been pushed (disabled) anyway since it's a good basis for further
    improvements.
  </p>

  <p>
    PNS replaces noisy bands with a single scalefactor representing the
    energy of that band, gaining in coding efficiency considerably, and
    the quality improvements on low bitrates are impressive for such a
    simple feature.
  </p>

  <p>
    TNS still needs some polishing, but has the potential to reduce coding
    artifacts by applying noise shaping in the temporal domain (something
    that is a source of annoying, notable distortion on low-entropy
    bands).
  </p>

  <p>
    Intensity Stereo coding (I/S) can double coding efficiency by
    exploiting strong correlation between stereo channels, most effective
    on pop-style tracks that employ panned mixing. The technique is not as
    effective on classic X-Y recordings though.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, main prediction improves coding efficiency by exploiting
    correlation among successive frames. While the gains have not been
    huge at this point, Rostislav has remained active even after the GSoC,
    and is polishing both TNS and main prediction, as well as looking for
    further improvements to make.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the process, the MIPS port of the encoder was broken a few times,
    something he's also working to fix.
  </p>

  <h4>Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG), mentee: Donny Yang, mentor: Paul B Mahol</h4>

  <p>
    Donny Yang implemented basic keyframe only APNG encoder as the
    qualification task. Later he wrote interframe compression via
    various blend modes. The current implementation tries all blend
    modes and picks one which takes the smallest amount of memory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Special care was taken to make sure that the decoder plays
    correctly all files found in the wild and that the encoder
    produces files that can be played in browsers that support APNG.
  </p>

  <p>
    During his work he was tasked to fix any encountered bug in the
    decoder due to the fact that it doesn't match APNG
    specifications. Thanks to this work, a long standing bug in the
    PNG decoder has been fixed.
  </p>

  <p>
    For latter work he plans to continue working on the encoder,
    making it possible to select which blend modes will be used in the
    encoding process. This could speed up encoding of APNG files.
  </p>

  <h3 id="message">August 1st, 2015, A message from the FFmpeg project</h3>
  <p>
    Dear multimedia community,
  </p>
  <p>
    The resignation of Michael Niedermayer as leader of FFmpeg yesterday has
    come by surprise. He has worked tirelessly on the FFmpeg project for many
    years and we must thank him for the work that he has done. We hope that in
    the future he will continue to contribute to the project. In the coming
    weeks, the FFmpeg project will be managed by the active contributors.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last four years have not been easy for our multimedia community - both
    contributors and users. We should now look to the future, try to find
    solutions to these issues, and to have reconciliation between the forks,
    which have split the community for so long.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, much of the disagreement has taken place in inappropriate
    venues so far, which has made finding common ground and solutions
    difficult. We aim to discuss this in our communities online over the coming
    weeks, and in person at the <a href="https://www.videolan.org/videolan/events/vdd15/">VideoLAN Developer
    Days</a> in Paris in September: a neutral venue for the entire open source
    multimedia community.
  </p>
  <p>
    The FFmpeg project.

  </p>

  <p>
    More information can be found <a href="https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2015/en/">here</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    We demonstrate usage of FFmpeg, answer your questions and listen to

    processed correctly with FFmpeg, be sure to have a sample with you
    so we can have a look!</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    For the first time in our CLT history, there will be an <strong>FFmpeg workshop</strong>!
    You can read the details <a href="https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2015/de/programm/beitrag/209">here</a>.
    The workshop is targeted at FFmpeg beginners. First the basics of
    multimedia will be covered. Thereafter you will learn how to use
    that knowledge and the FFmpeg CLI tools to analyse and process media
    files. The workshop is in German language only and prior registration
    is necessary. The workshop will be on Saturday starting at 10 o'clock.
  </p>

  <p>
    We wanted you to know there are
    <a href="https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=ffmpeg&amp;searchon=sourcenames&amp;suite=unstable&amp;section=main">
    FFmpeg packages in Debian unstable</a> again. <strong>A big thank-you
    to Andreas Cadhalpun and all the people that made it possible.</strong> It has been anything but simple.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately that was already the easy part of this news. The bad news is the packages probably won't
    migrate to Debian testing to be in the upcoming release codenamed jessie.

  <h3 id="opw03">October 8, 2014, FFmpeg secured a place in OPW!</h3>
  <p>
    Thanks to a generous 6K USD donation by Samsung (Open Source Group),
    FFmpeg will be welcoming at least 1 "Outreach Program for Women" intern
    to work with our community for an initial period starting December 2014
    (through March 2015).
  </p>

  <p>
    We all know FFmpeg is used by the industry, but even while there are
    countless products building on our code, it is not at all common for
    companies to step up and help us out when needed. So a big thank-you
    to Samsung and the OPW program committee!
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are thinking on participating in OPW as an intern, please take
    a look at our <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/SponsoringPrograms/OPW/2014-12">OPW wiki page</a>
    for some initial guidelines. The page is still a work in progress, but
    there should be enough information there to get you started. If you, on
    the other hand, are thinking on sponsoring work on FFmpeg through the
    OPW program, please get in touch with us at opw@ffmpeg.org. With your
    help, we might be able to secure some extra intern spots for this round!

    (both individuals and companies) to help us gather the needed money to
    secure our spot in the program.<br>

  <p>
    FFmpeg has started the process to become an OPW includer organization for the
    next round of the program, with internships starting December 9. The
    <a href="https://gnome.org/opw/">OPW</a> aims to "Help women (cis and trans)
    and genderqueer to get involved in free and open source software". Part of the
    process requires securing funds to support at least one internship (6K USD), so
    if you were holding on your donation to FFmpeg, this is a great chance for you
    to come forward, get in touch and help both the project and a great initiative!
  </p>
  <p>

    disclosed. We have changed the private keys (and certificates) for all
    FFmpeg servers. The details were sent to the mailing lists by
    Alexander Strasser, who is part of the project server team. Here is a

  <h3 id="trac_sec">February 9, 2014, trac.ffmpeg.org / trac.mplayerhq.hu Security Breach</h3>
  <p>
    The server on which FFmpeg and MPlayer Trac issue trackers were
    installed was compromised. The affected server was taken offline
    and has been replaced and all software reinstalled.
    FFmpeg Git, releases, FATE, web and mailinglists are on other servers
    and were not affected. We believe that the original compromise happened
    to a server, unrelated to FFmpeg and MPlayer, several months ago.
    That server was used as a source to clone the VM that we recently moved
    Trac to. It is not known if anyone used the backdoor that was found.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend all users to change their passwords.
    <b>Especially users who use a password on Trac that they also use
      elsewhere, should change that password at least elsewhere.</b>
  </p>


  <h3 id="ffmpeg_rfp">November 12, 2013, FFmpeg RFP in Debian</h3>
  <p>
    Since the splitting of Libav the Debian/Ubuntu maintainers have followed

  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://cynic.cc/blog/">Rogério Brito</a>, a Debian developer,
    has proposed a Request For Package (RFP) in the Debian bug tracking
    system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please let the Debian and Ubuntu developers know that you support packaging
    of the real FFmpeg! See Debian <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=729203">ticket #729203</a>

Logpoints are breakpoints that log to the console without pausing execution. While Microsoft Edge has had logpoints built-in for a while and Chrome just added them in v73, Firefox does not. But, we can use conditional breakpoints to simulate them in any browser.</p><p><img alt="Conditional Breakpoint - console.log" loading="lazy" width="756" height="337" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://alan.norbauer.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fconditional-breakpoint-console-log.2d18d3e4.gif&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 1x, https://alan.norbauer.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fconditional-breakpoint-console-log.2d18d3e4.gif&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://alan.norbauer.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fconditional-breakpoint-console-log.2d18d3e4.gif&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p><p>Use <code>console.count</code> instead of <code>console.log</code> if you also want a running count of how many times the line is executed.</p><p>UPDATE (May 2020): All the major browsers now directly support logpoints/tracepoints (<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/01/devtools#logpoints" alt="Chrome Logpoints Documentation">Chrome Logpoints</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide/debugger#breakpoints" alt="Edge Tracepoint Documentation">Edge Tracepoints</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/Set_a_logpoint" alt="Firefox Logpoint Documentation">Firefox Logpoints</a>)</p><section><h4 id="watch-pane"><a href="#watch-pane">Watch Pane</a></h4><p>You can also use <code>console.log</code> in the watch pane.

Now, after any DOM subtree modification, the debugger will pause execution and the new DOM snapshot will be at the end of the <code>window.doms</code> array. (There is no way to create a DOM mutation breakpoint that doesn’t pause execution.)</p></section><section><h4 id="tracing-callstacks"><a href="#tracing-callstacks">Tracing Callstacks</a></h4><p>Let’s say you have a function that shows a loading spinner and a function that hides it, but somewhere in your code you’re calling the show method without a matching hide call.

In your starting point set a breakpoint with the condition <code>console.time('label')</code> and at the end point set a breakpoint with the condition <code>console.timeEnd('label')</code>.

<p>Apple illegally discriminated against US citizens and other US residents in its hiring and recruitment practices for certain types of positions that went to foreign workers, the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-25-million-landmark-agreement-apple-resolve-employment">said yesterday</a>. Apple agreed to pay up to $25 million in back pay and civil penalties to settle the DOJ allegations.</p>
<p>Apple discriminated "against US citizens and certain non-US citizens whose permission to live in and work in the United States does not expire," the agency said. The $25 million payment was called the largest ever collected by the Justice Department under the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).</p>
<p>Apple is required to pay $6.75 million in civil penalties and create an $18.25 million fund to provide back pay to those harmed by its hiring practices. Apple did not admit guilt in the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/ier-apple_settlement_agreement_signed_2023-11-08_fully_executed.pdf">settlement</a>. But the company acknowledged in a statement that it had "unintentionally not been following the DOJ standard," <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-agrees-25-million-settlement-with-us-over-hiring-immigrants-2023-11-09/">according to Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>"We have implemented a robust remediation plan to comply with the requirements of various government agencies as we continue to hire American workers and grow in the US," Apple said. We contacted Apple and will update this article if it provides any further statement.</p>
<p>As Reuters noted, "Foreign labor can often be cheaper than hiring US workers, and immigrants who rely on their employers for green card sponsorship are seen as less likely to leave for a different job."</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>DOJ investigation</h2>
<p>The DOJ said it began investigating in February 2019 and determined "that Apple violated the INA's anti-discrimination requirements during Apple's recruitment for positions falling under the permanent labor certification program (PERM)." The agency said the discrimination began no later than January 1, 2018, and continued until at least December 31, 2019.</p>
<p><span>Under this program, a "permanent labor certification issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) allows an employer to hire a foreign worker to work permanently in the United States," the DOL </span><span><a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent"><span>says</span></a></span><span>. But the employer must also obtain a certification "that there are not sufficient US workers able, willing, qualified and available to accept the job opportunity in the area of intended employment and that employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed US workers."</span></p>
<p>The DOJ said its investigation "found that Apple engaged in a pattern or practice of citizenship status discrimination in recruitment for positions it hired through PERM, and that the company's unlawful discrimination prejudiced US citizens, US nationals, lawful permanent residents, and those granted asylum or refugee status. These less effective recruitment practices deterred protected workers from applying to positions that Apple preferred to fill instead with PERM beneficiaries."</p>
<p>Apple did not advertise PERM positions on its external job website like it does with other positions, the DOJ said. "It also required all PERM position applicants to mail paper applications, even though the company permitted electronic applications for other positions," the DOJ said.</p>
<p>In some cases, "Apple did not consider certain applications for PERM positions from Apple employees if those applications were submitted electronically, as opposed to paper applications submitted through the mail," the agency said. "These less effective recruitment procedures nearly always resulted in few or no applications to PERM positions from applicants whose permission to work does not expire."</p>
<h2>Apple changes hiring practices</h2>
<p>The settlement requires Apple to make its PERM recruitment practices match its standard recruitment practices more closely. Apple will have to "conduct more expansive recruitment for all PERM positions, including posting PERM positions on its external job website, accepting electronic applications, and enabling applicants to PERM positions to be searchable in its applicant tracking system."</p>
<p>Apple has already implemented some of the changes and agreed to "train its employees on the INA's anti-discrimination requirements and be subject to departmental monitoring for the three-year period of the agreement," the DOJ said.</p>

<div>
<p>NEW YORK – Mr Danny Taing’s 55,000 Kit Kats began their long, twisted, and sometimes obscure journey in Japan.</p>
<p>Mr Taing is the founder of Bokksu, a New York company that sells Japanese snacks in subscription boxes, and he intended to make a tidy sum by flipping the sweets in the United States. </p>
<p>The KitKat shipment, which included sought-after flavours such as melon, matcha latte, and daifuku mochi, had cost US$110,000 (S$149,000), but Bokksu expected to make about US$250,000 in total revenue.</p>

<p>“You can fit a lot of KitKats into two containers,” Mr Taing said.</p>
<p>And they are a booming business. In Japan, enthusiasts clamour for the rarer flavours, with some sold for just a few weeks or only in a specific region. In the United States, obsessives fawn over the collectibles, comparing reviews on Japanese snack blogs and shelling out for limited editions.</p>
<p>These particular KitKats would become key players in an ultimately frustrating saga of shell e-mail accounts, phantom truckers, supply-chain fraud and one seriously bewildered cargo freight broker.</p>


<p>Interviews and e-mails shared with The New York Times tell the story of just one instance of “strategic theft”, a growing corner of the criminal world that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has said accounts for some US$30 billion in losses a year – with food being among the top targets.</p>

<p>The precious sweets landed safely enough in California, and were trucked about 48km across Los Angeles County to a temporary storage facility in South El Monte, run by a company called Japan Crate Acquisition.</p>
<p>After weeks of chugging across the Pacific Ocean, they just needed to make the remaining leg of their journey to Bokksu’s warehouse in Carlstadt, New Jersey, and then into the hands of avid candy fans.</p>
<p>That was where Mr Shane Black came in.</p>

<p>Mr Black, who runs a freight brokering company called Freight Rate Central in Sarasota, Florida, is part of an invisible army of professionals who coordinate and marshal the fleets of trucks that criss-cross the country, carrying everything from chickens to smartphones. For this job, Bokksu would pay him about US$13,000.</p>
<p>Mr Black got to it. He posted the job on a trucking board that is something like a Craigslist for freight. Someone named Tristan with HCH Trucking accepted the job (though he was using a Gmail account), and said he would have the shipment picked up shortly.</p>
<p>On Aug 9, Tristan wrote in an e-mail: “Hey man, The first one is loaded and rolling, the second one we’ll pick it up tomorrow first thing in the morning.”</p>
<p>“There was nothing out of the ordinary,” Mr Black said in an interview.</p>
<h2>Coming clean</h2>
</div>

    <div>
<p>When the shipments failed to reach New Jersey days after any cross-country trip should have been completed, Mr Black started to have visions of KitKats melting in the summer heat.</p>
<p>“Please tell me the freight is in good order and has been refrigerated this whole time?” he e-mailed Tristan.</p>
<p>Tristan replied that one of the trucks had broken down in Washington, Pennsylvania, a small city just south-west of Pittsburgh. Tristan reassured him that the Kit Kats were cool and intact, but “if it’s not fixed by today we will have to head back to the shipper and re-unload them there”.</p>
<p>That sent up all kinds of red flags for Mr Black. If the truck was in good enough shape to drive over 3,800km back to California, why could it not make it fewer than 650km to New Jersey? So Mr Black called HCH Trucking.</p>
<p>“That’s when everything kind of hit the fan,” he said.</p>
<p>When he reached the HCH headquarters in Jersey City, New Jersey, he heard chaos in the background, sounds of panic. The representative told him that their information appeared to have been compromised. They had never heard of any Tristan.</p>
<p>If Mr Black was not dealing with HCH Trucking, who was he dealing with? And most important, where were the six figures’ worth of KitKats?</p>
<p>Seemingly on cue, Tristan followed up. “Time for some coming clean,” he confessed. “I’m actually a scammer and the owner of HCH doesn’t have anything to do with this.”</p>
<p>“Why though?” Mr Black replied plaintively. “What would you stand to gain? Can I please get access to the loads so I can get them to New Jersey? We’re not a big company at all. It‘s just me... I’m the owner and everything else.”</p>
<p>Tristan wrote back: “We’re trying to make money sir, I told you we’re scammers, really sorry I didn’t know your story, and hopefully the loads get to New Jersey.”</p>
<p>Tristan included the addresses of two warehouses, both just east of Los Angeles, where he had dropped the loads.</p>
</div>

  
  <div>
<p>The strange thing was that Mr Black had never paid Tristan any money; the shipping fee was due on delivery. If this was a con, so far it did not seem to be a very profitable one. In any case, Mr Black couldn’t believe his luck.</p>
<p>“When I found out they were at a cold-storage facility, I mean, I was just so happy,” he said. “I thought, ‘OK, we got the freight.’”</p>
<h2>Out of service</h2>
<p>Mr Black spun back into action. According to Tristan, one load was at Inland Empire Cold Storage in Jurupa Valley, California. The other was nearby, at Anytime Crossdock in Ontario, California. Tristan then went silent, and did not respond to repeated e-mails from NYTimes seeking comment.</p>
<p>Anytime was eager to get the load out of its warehouse and to be paid for nearly two weeks of storage.</p>
<p>It turned out that the KitKats had never left California. They had simply been driven about 50km east, put on ice and left to rack up storage fees.</p>
<p>“We would like to know when you are going to get this picked up,” Anytime wrote, “as we anticipated this to be a short-term storage request.”</p>
</div>

    <div>
<p>The outstanding balance for the storage was US$3,830. Mr Black said he paid US$2,000 of that out of his own pocket to secure the release of the freight, with the promise to pay the rest later. Anytime did not respond to repeated requests for comment from NYTimes.</p>
<p>Daunted but determined, he started the process over, posting the job again on the freight board. This time he said he got a bite from ‘Manny’ from MVK Transport.</p>
<p>According to Mr Black, Manny had the KitKats picked up. At least this half of the shipment was on its way to New Jersey, Mr Black believed. After a few days, though, communications turned spotty.</p>
<p>“I’ve been writing you for days now,” Mr Black e-mailed a few days later. “I called yesterday and you hung up and now your phone says it’s out of service.”</p>
<p>The next morning, he followed up, now furious: “How do you make money on this??? Are you going to sell KitKats on the corner???”</p>
<p>He had been had again. This time, the KitKats had disappeared for good into the expanse of Southern California’s freewayland. Requests for comment sent to MVK went unanswered.</p>
<h2>‘We cannot release the freight’</h2>
</div>

    <div>
<p>Inland Cold Empire Storage, at least, still had the other half of the KitKats, and Mr Black, by now frantic to salvage what he could of the candy, was still on the case.</p>
<p>“This load was stolen from us, and placed in your storage facility,” he wrote to Inland on Aug 21. Inland replied that its contract was with a man named Harry Centa.</p>
<p>“There is no ‘Harry’,” Mr Black explained. Bokksu, cc’ed on the e-mail, was the rightful owner. “‘Harry’ is a fictitious name.”</p>
<p>Harry Centa, however, is not a fictitious name. Mr Harry Centa lives in Ohio, and works in shipping. But the entire KitKat affair was news to him. “This is totally fraudulent and not me,” Mr Centa said in an e-mail to the NYTimes. “Good luck and hope they find the KitKats LOL.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Inland was unmoved: “Without proof that you are the rightful owner and payment for storage we cannot release the freight.”</p>
<p>Mr Black said he reached out to the sheriff’s departments of Riverside and San Bernardino counties, but said he was told<strong> </strong>jurisdictional issues kept them from getting involved, and no reports were filed.</p>
<p>He also turned to the team at Bokksu. Did they have anything that he could use to prove their ownership?</p>
<p>But Bokksu had essentially fired Mr Black in the meantime, stopped payment on his fee, filed a report with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department for insurance purposes, and decided to move on. The KitKats were dead to them.</p>
</div>

    <div>
<p>“I don’t know if I would be comfortable selling these to customers,” said Mr Taing, Bokksu’s founder. “What if something actually happens to customers that eat this, and we get sued?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the KitKats are still at Inland, according to the company’s chief executive officer Kevin Sacalas.</p>
<p>“We have no use for this product and would happily release it to anyone who would show proof of proper ownership and pay the storage fees,” Mr Sacalas wrote in an e-mail to NYTimes.</p>
</div>

  
  <div>
<h2>Chess v checkers</h2>
<p>The Bokksu KitKats are just one instance of an increasingly common computer-based form of fraud that some experts call “fictitious pickups” or “strategic theft”. It is part identity theft, part extortion. The freight, sometimes called a “hostage load”, can vanish if the extortion demands are not met.</p>
<p>“The more you unpeel the onion, the worse it gets,” said Mr Keith Lewis, vice-president of operations at CargoNet, which is part of the global data analytics and technology provider Verisk. He said that strategic cargo theft is up 700 per cent in 2023.</p>
<p>“The supply chain is moving at the speed of light,” he said, adding: “The bad guys are playing chess and we’re playing checkers. We’re two or three steps behind them.”</p>
<p>As for Bokksu, its insurance claim has been denied. So the blame is now flowing backward along that supply chain.</p>
<p>Bokksu holds Mr Black responsible. He fell for an obvious scam, they said, and the Gmail addresses should have been a red flag.</p>
<p>Mr Black said truckers do not always use company domains. Ultimately, he blames Japan Crate Acquisition, which originally released the KitKats to ‘Tristan’.</p>
<p>“Obviously it didn’t go to an HCH truck,” Mr Black said, and whoever loaded the shipment “should’ve been suspicious.”</p>
<p>In possibly the strangest twist on the KitKat trail, Bokksu announced in September that it had acquired Japan Crate. But NYTimes discovered that the acquisition had actually been completed back in June. So Bokksu, through a wholly owned subsidiary, had in effect overseen the loading of its own KitKats onto the original two fraudulent trucks.</p>
<p>“I’ve been doing this for over two decades now, and I’ve never come across anything like this, anything of this magnitude,” Mr Black said. “It’s beyond crazy, it really is. Because there’s no answers.”</p>
<p>“I do feel cheated,” he added. “I just don’t know who is doing the cheating.” NYTIMES</p>

Often, as we've covered, these notifications and reminders ignore or actively push back against user intent—prompting you to sign up for Microsoft 365 if you already said no, or trying to make you use Edge or Bing after you've already installed Chrome.</p>

<p>Microsoft took another step down this path this week when it began testing a new addition to the Windows OneDrive app that would force users to explain themselves when quitting the app. <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-wont-let-you-close-onedrive-in-windows-without-you-explaining-it-first/">Initially spotted by NeoWin</a>, the survey took the form of a drop-down menu, not unlike the ones you sometimes see when you try to unsubscribe from marketing or fundraising mailing lists.</p>
<p>Until you chose an answer from the drop-down, the "quit" button would be grayed out, preventing you from actually closing OneDrive.</p>
<p>This was an escalation from the previous behavior, which would ask you if you were sure before allowing you to quit but allowing you to actually click the "quit" button without interacting with any other menus. The old prompt was an explanation; the newer one was an imposition.</p>

<p>For its part, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/8/23952878/microsoft-onedrive-windows-close-app-notification">told The Verge</a> that the new prompt was a test that was only rolled out to a subset of OneDrive users and that the change has been reverted as of a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>"Between Nov. 1 and 8, a small subset of consumer OneDrive users were presented with a dialog box when closing the OneDrive sync client, asking for feedback on the reason they chose to close the application," reads Microsoft's statement. "This type of user feedback helps inform our ongoing efforts to enhance the quality of our products."</p>
<p>Reverted or not, the OneDrive prompt is of a piece with other things Microsoft does to encourage the usage of Edge, Bing, OneDrive, Microsoft 365, Game Pass, and its other services in Windows. You can always choose to avoid this kind of thing by declining to sign in to OneDrive or by uninstalling the app entirely. But it's just one more annoying default you need to change to make sure that modern Windows stays out of your way.</p>

<p>Leaders command people. That’s kind of what a leader is: someone with the authority to direct the actions of others. </p>



<p>But people don’t often appreciate being commanded. When you step into leadership you face this challenge: how do you direct the members of your team without offending them? How do you become a good boss, but not be “bossy”?</p>



<p>It’s worth starting this discussion with the reminder that most of what bosses do isn’t bossing at all. Although a leader <em>can</em> tell people what to do, we should be slow to do so. Most team discussions are dynamic and interactive. They should involve everyone without imposing much hierarchy. As a team we cultivate ideas. We imagine solutions. We consider potential tasks. We settle on a plan. The best work happens when the whole team is involved in understanding the problem, the chosen solution, and each person’s role in making it happen. Then each member has the knowledge and ownership to handle tasks skillfully and with passion. The leader’s primary job is to nurture this discussion, to make sure there is a divergence of options and then a convergence to a solid choice. Often this leadership involves no “bossing” at all.</p>



<p>But sometimes we should and must tell people what to do. Sometimes people need the clarity, the unambiguity of a direct instruction. Sometimes we do assign tasks. “You do this.”</p>



<p>We should rarely say it like that.</p>



<p>Usually there are better ways to give a command, ways that make our purpose clear while honoring and respecting the listener. It is possible to issue a command without it feeling like a command.</p>



<p>Even the word “command” can feel abrasive. But I’m going to use that term in this article. Technically, if you as a person in authority direct someone else to perform a task, you are commanding them.</p>



<p>The question we’ll answer today, then, is: how do you give a command in a way your team members will accept, won’t reject as “bossy,” and might even feel good about?</p>



<p>We’re going to focus on words. When you know you have to give a command (or directive or instruction or assignment), what words should you use?</p>



<p>Body language matters too. Tone of voice matters. The conversation that surrounds the command—what comes before and after—matters a lot.  But today let’s dive into the nitty-gritty. What are the <em>best words</em> to use?</p>



<p>Here’s a couple of examples.</p>



<p><em>“Get this done!”</em> That’s pretty harsh. Maybe sometimes this level of directness is necessary, but it’s no way to win friends or influence people.</p>



<p><em>“Do you think we could maybe see about possibly…”</em> That’s pretty cagey. You may come across sounding weak, and your directive may get lost.</p>



<p>The English language offers a wealth of options for how to give a command. Let’s look at them and consider which work best in this or that situation and which, if any, are never good for any situation. We’ll consider the example of telling someone to take out the trash—something most of us have been asked or told to do at some point. We’ll consider different ways you might command someone to take out the trash, see how it feels, and consider how <em>clear</em> the command is and how <em>harsh</em> it may feel.</p>

<p>From this menu of command forms you can build your own style of how, when the occasion warrants, you direct members of your team to do things.</p>



<h2>A Taxonomy of Commands</h2>



<p>“<strong>Take out the trash.”</strong> The simplest and most direct way to give a command is to use a straightforward imperative verb. “<em>Drive</em> me to the airport.” “<em>Send</em> me the report by the end of the day.” “<em>Turn in</em> your homework.” These are uncomplicated, bald directives that state the intended action plainly and make no bones about who’s the boss and who’s the bossed.</p>



<p>The benefit of using a direct imperative is that your intention is perfectly clear. The listener knows what you want done and who you want to do it. The downside is harshness. Although there are more abrasive ways to give a command (we’ll get to those), the imperative feels pretty in-your-face in most business cultures. Usually (but not always) there’s a better choice.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★★</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★★☆</p>



<hr>



<p>“<strong>Please take out the trash.”</strong> The word “please” has an interesting and hard-to-define role in English usage. “Please” breaks down hierarchy and puts you on the same footing as your listener. It reaffirms the listener’s choice in the matter. Between friends, family members, and other peers it’s a crucial word, converting a command into an appeal. </p>



<p>You must judge for yourself what its effect is on the lips of a leader in a business setting. The effect varies widely based on circumstances and persons. </p>



<p>In general it has the advantage of coming across as appealing and polite. It has the disadvantage of not quite making the command definite. “Please” gives the listener an option. Do they really have an option? If the command really is indefinite—if you’re willing for the listener to say “no”—then “please” is just the right word to add. But if the listener is really obligated to obey, “please” might either make everyone feel better by preserving the public honor of the listener—the <em>illusion</em> of choice—or make everyone feel worse by exposing the leader as manipulative.</p>



<p>On balance, when giving your listener a real choice, adding “please” makes your request both clearer and more polite.</p>



<p>And keep “please” in mind while considering the other forms of command in this list. “Please” can be sprinkled into almost statement with similar, polite-ifying effects as the ones we discovered here.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★★</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p>“<strong>Maybe take out the trash?” </strong>With the addition of one little word—”maybe”—and perhaps an upturned note at the end of the sentence to make it a question, the straightforward imperative becomes a much gentler request. The benefit is that you sound less bossy. The downside is that the command has lost its teeth, and the person you’re speaking to may simply ignore you. Leaders who direct others with “maybe” generally appear weak. You might make it work for your leadership style. Probably not.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“You’d better take out the trash.” </strong>Adding “you’d better” to the start of any imperative adds a note of menace, a threat. Whether you say it or not, the phrase “or else…” creeps onto the back of the command.</p>



<p>This is almost never a good move. Tossing a threat, however implied, toward someone you want or need to have a lasting relationship with is always counterproductive. The threat weakens the relationship. </p>



<p>There’s a further problem: the threat actually weakens the command itself. The fact that you have to invoke “you’d better” to get this person to do something shows that you don’t really have the innate authority to compel them to do it. The threat, not your own leadership, holds the power. With a command like this you might get someone to do something <em>once,</em> but your authority over this person—and anyone observing the exchange—now lives on borrowed time.</p>



<p>“You’d better” tends to be the weapon of choice of bullies and demagogues. You’d better avoid it.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★★★</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“You will take out the trash.”</strong> One of the English language’s favorite ways of softening an imperative is to turn it into the <em>future tense.</em></p>



<p>On the face of it the future tense looks as if it’s expecting us to predict what the listener will do. “I am Carmac the Magnificent and I foresee that you will…<em>take out the trash!”</em> But we know that in fact this is a directive rather than a prediction, yet a slightly softer directive than the bare imperative.</p>



<p>How does it come across to the listener? The answer varies. If you stress the word “will” (or, heaven forbid, transmogrify it to “shall”), the directive is quite harsh and even threatening. But good leaders can say, “You will…” in a calm and inoffensive tone and convey a sense of solidity rather than threat. “What you’re going to do is to get the kitchen cleaned up. After that you’ll take out the trash.” In effect they’re directing: “Get the kitchen cleaned up. After that, take out the trash.” But the future tense with the proper tone comes across a little more gently.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★★</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★★☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“I want you to take out the trash.” </strong>To my ear this is slightly gentler than a stark, “Take out the trash,” but tone of voice can make all the difference.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★★</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★★☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“I need you to take out the trash.” </strong>The differences between these various ways of asking someone to do something may strike you as overly subtle, but often a grain of change can make a heap of difference. The shift here from “want” to “need” makes this command much more forceful, yet without seeming particularly harsh. </p>



<p>“I need you to…” is a very popular way of commanding. Many leaders prefer it over any other form. I’ve even seen it taught in assertiveness training classes. </p>



<p>The reason it works so well is that it makes an appeal to the listener that is very forceful yet neither threatening nor invasive. In essence you’re asking for help: “I have this need, you see? Would you meet my need?” It’s not <em>you</em> that demands so loudly that this person obey your request, it’s your <em>need</em> that makes the demand. “I have this need, and you can help me meet my need by doing <em>this.” </em>The phrase “I need you to” gives the directive a softer, less “bossy” quality than some alternatives.</p>



<p>Yet it is forceful. A listener will find it very difficult to evade this form of command. To do so they must in essence respond with, “No, you don’t <em>need</em> that.” That kind of response takes brass. It means making a higher claim about your needs than you yourself are making. The listener must say, in effect, “You <em>say</em> that you need me to do that, but you’re wrong. What you <em>really</em> need is….” Only a very well-informed and knowledgable—or else stupid and insubordinate—listener will reply like this. Sometimes it <em>is</em> the right reply, and if you as a leader are telling people that you need them to do something, you’d better actually need it. This is a bluff that can be called.</p>



<p>In normal circumstances “I need you to…” is a tried-and-true way of issuing a command that carries great force without seeming excessively harsh, and is therefore quite common.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★★</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★☆☆ (and yet forceful)</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“Would you mind taking out the trash?” </strong>Here is one of the most common—and grammatically vexing—of English request forms, but also among the most effective. The fact that the listener must answer with “no” in order to agree to your request never ceases to befuddle. </p>



<p>As with adding “please” to a request, “would you mind” softens by transforming a demand into a plea. It is virtually illegal, culturally speaking, to answer with “yes,” as if you minded (even if you would). Instead the listener is obligated to refuse the request in some more deliberate way: “Well, actually I’m tied up just now” or something similar. Consequently this is one of those magic request forms (like “I need you to…”) that applies more force with less harshness.</p>



<p>“Would you mind” gives a less clear command than the bare imperative in that the user may refuse. The “answer yes by saying no” twisteroo also adds a little mental complication.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“I</strong>‘<strong>m going to get you to take out the trash.” </strong>By prefacing the imperative with several filler words, we dull the edge of the command while keeping the meaning fairly clear (though not as clear as the bare imperative). There’s not much mistaking what is supposed to be done or who is to do it, yet a little wiggle room has been left to the listener. Several of the phrases on this list use this technique: make the command longer to make it less harsh, but also less clear. </p>



<p>Personally I find this phraseology irritating. It can perhaps feel more gentle than a bare imperative but it also sounds more toadying and manipulative. For my own preference, a leader tempted to hedge with “I’m going to get you to…” would do better to skip the rigmarole and just say what they want.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“I’ll let you take out the trash.” </strong>Another softening-by-lengthening technique, now with the added twist of implying that the listener <em>wants</em> to do the task. To me it sounds manipulative, but it has the further disadvantage of lost clarity. The listener may reply (mentally or aloud), “You’re <em>letting </em>me? So if I don’t want to, I don’t have to?” The task may not get done, and you as leader won’t have much of an excuse for why you didn’t make your requirement clearer.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“I’d like for the trash to be taken out.” </strong>It’s remarkable how often you’ll hear phrases like this in meetings at every level of an organization. A leader knows what they want done and who they want to do it, but by omitting the subject of the command—<em>“you”</em>—they hope to make it less bossy. Indeed, they hope the listener will reply, “Okay, I’ll take out the trash.” Sometimes this works. More often, everyone sits on their hands, waits for the moment to pass, and the command is ambiguously lost as the meeting moves on.</p>



<p>There is a time for leaders to suggest a task and allow followers to volunteer to take it on. But it’s best to make that dance explicit. “Somebody needs to take the trash out. Who’ll do it?” Trying to hedge your command as an invitation for volunteerism is usually just weak and ineffective. If you know that you’re speaking to John, and everyone knows that you’re speaking to John, then speak to John. Don’t imply commands.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“Will you/Would you take out the trash?” </strong>On the face of it, it looks as if the English language, by offering this form of request, is inviting the listener to proclaim a prophetic oracle. A cheeky reply would be, “I don’t know whether I’ll take out the trash—am I supposed to be able to see the future?” In reality, of course, the future tense of the verb is a softer way to frame an imperative mood. Phrasing the command in the form of a question softens it further. The question implies—truly or falsely—that the listener has a choice.</p>



<p>This is a good and of course very common way of asking people to do things, quite clear and not terribly harsh. Your parents and teachers probably used it with you. Don’t be too shy about using it with your team.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“Could you/Can you take out the trash?”</strong> Likewise, “could you/can you” feels slightly quaint, almost archaic, and holds a note of appeal (as opposed to command) that might work well for your style of leadership. Or not. Something to experiment with?</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“Let’s take out the trash.”</strong> Another way of softening a command is to put it into the plural first person (“we/us”) instead of the second person (“you”). “Let’s…” is very commonly used by leaders and probably shouldn’t be. It tries to avoid harshness by sacrificing clarity, but usually loses more than it gains. The real subject of the command—<em>you</em>—is hidden, and unless the context has made the subject clear, the command will be lost. When you mean “you,” say “you.”</p>



<p>Still, “Let’s…” has its place in a leader’s toolbox, as for example when the person responsible for the task has already been made explicit and the leader’s significant choice is not <em>who</em> will do it but <em>what</em> they will do. In that case, “Let’s take out the trash” may not be a hedging way of saying “You take out the trash,” but rather, “You’ll take out the trash instead of taking out the recycling.”</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p>“<strong>Why don’t we take out the tras</strong><strong>h?”</strong> Again an overused hedge but not without its place. It is extremely soft but also extremely unclear. Are you actually asking someone to do something? In the middle of an exploratory discussion, asking “why don’t we” or “what if” questions is helpful in cultivating new options or narrowing toward a final choice. But as a final choice, “Why don’t we…” is too cautious and vague. Make a clear choice of who is to do what and then tell them clearly to do it.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★☆☆☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p>“<strong>Could we take out the trash?”</strong> Similar in form and effect to “Why don’t we…?” See the discussion there.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★☆☆☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p>“<strong>If you would just take out the trash…”</strong> Couches the command in the form of an “if” statement, usually with disastrous results. </p>



<p>Sometimes leaders let the ellipsis dangle, just like that: “If you would just take out the trash…”—followed by an uncomfortable silence in the room. This is bad.</p>



<p>Sometimes they fill the ellipsis with some convenient apodosis: “If you would just take out the trash, we could wash out the bin and maybe it wouldn’t smell so much.” This is equally bad. What little imperative force was implied by the initial “If you would…” becomes lost in the succeeding drivel.</p>



<p>“If you would…” simply fails as a means of commanding (or even asking) someone to do something. It stages a desperate ploy to sound less bossy, but still comes across as bossy, yet in an evasive and pandering manner. Avoid it.</p>



<p>A common variant has “could” in place of “would.” I don’t see a great difference.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★☆☆☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p>If you want to be a good boss without being seen as bossy, mull over this list. Watch how other leaders use phrases like these and what effect they have. Try out new ways of issuing commands, see how they feel to you, see how people respond. The key is to find a way of directing people that suits your personality, your team, and your organization’s culture. Once you settle on a comfortable style and make it consistent, then you’ll be seen as a leader who knows how to get people to do things without coming across as obnoxious.</p>

<p>Apple and Amazon are once again facing scrutiny for their 2018 agreement that saw Apple finally establish an <a href="https://amzn.to/3sm9MUy">official Amazon storefront</a>. A report <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-gives-apple-special-treatment-while-others-suffer-junk-ads-2023-11">from <em>Insider</em> today</a> goes in-depth on the details of this agreement, with one source saying that Apple is getting “massive preferential treatment” from Amazon.</p>



<p>The deal between Apple and Amazon has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/02/apple-amazon/">faced quite a bit</a> of regulatory pushback over the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/10/29/apple-amazon-deal-germany/">past several years</a>. The two companies are also <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/11/09/apple-amazon-lawsuit-price-fixing/">battling a price-fixing lawsuit</a> that alleges they colluded to raise iPhone and iPad prices.</p>



<p>As detailed by today’s report, the agreement between Apple and Amazon includes a carveout that reduces the number of ads and recommendations that appear on product pages for Apple devices. While Amazon product pages are generally full of ads, sponsored results, and recommendations, Apple’s product pages show only one banner ad at the very bottom of the page.</p>



<p>In contrast, product pages for Apple competitors like Samsung are riddled with ads from competitors, recommendations, and other sponsored banners. <em>Insider</em> says that other companies, including Samsung, have complained about the preferential treatment given to Apple.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether Amazon has made similar offers to companies like Samsung. <em>Insider</em> cites “least half a dozen salespeople on Amazon’s advertising team” who say that “they were not able to extend this Apple-style special treatment to their clients.”</p>



<p>Emails revealed as part of an FTC lawsuit against Amazon reveal that the company initially pushed back against Apple’s demands for special treatment before eventually caving in. In a statement today, Apple explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apple also told Insider that the 2018 agreement with Amazon “sought to address significant counterfeit and safety issues” on Amazon’s marketplace. Prior to the deal, Apple sent “hundreds of thousands of take-down notices” to Amazon to reduce counterfeits, and the company conducted test purchases on Amazon that “consistently returned high counterfeit rates,” Apple added.</p>



<p>By providing “accurate, relevant and qualitative content on Apple Product pages,” Apple has been able to address much of the counterfeit issues on Amazon, the iPhone maker said.</p>



<p>“The 2018 Agreements significantly reduced the sale of counterfeit and unsafe Apple products on Amazon’s marketplaces and have materially improved customer experience,” Apple also wrote in a statement to Insider.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-gives-apple-special-treatment-while-others-suffer-junk-ads-2023-11">full report at <em>Insider</em></a> includes additional details on the early negotiations between Apple and Amazon. For instance, at one point, Amazon insisted that Apple “compensate Amazon for the lost ad revenue” from the deal. Still, it’s unclear if that was included in the final agreement.</p>

<p>Recently, I was looking at the <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig programming language</a>.
As I often do, I started implementing a few typical things in new languages to learn them. Well, one of them was super slow and Zig is supposed to be super
fast, so I was trying to understand where the disconnect was and compare it to
<a href="https://factorcode.org/">Factor</a>!</p>
<p>I was able to reduce the issue to a small test case and it turns out that there
is a behavioral issue in their <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/hash_map.zig">implementation of
HashMap</a> that
makes their <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/17851">HashMaps get slow over
time</a>. The test case performs
these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>creates a <code>HashMap</code> of 2 million items</li>
<li>decrements the map values, removing an item every third loop</li>
<li>inserts a replacement new item to maintain 2 million items in the <code>HashMap</code></li>
<li>for a total of 250 million actions, then</li>
<li>deletes the remaining items from the <code>HashMap</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We record the total time each block of 1 million actions takes:</p>

<p>Something is very wrong!</p>

<p>This is the simple test case implemented in Zig using the <code>std.HashMap</code>:</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-bug">What’s the Bug?</h3>
<p>So, Zig <em>could</em> be super fast, but the default <code>std.HashMap</code> implementation
uses tombstone buckets to mark slots as being deleted, and over time these
tombstone buckets create fragmentation in the HashMap, which causes their
linear probing to trend towards the worst case examination of every bucket in
the HashMap when looking for a key.</p>
<p>We can implement a <code>rehash()</code> method on the HashMap that performs an in-place
rehashing of all the elements, without allocations. Ideally, this would be done
when the number of filled and deleted slots reaches some capacity threshold.
But, for now, we can just run <code>map.rehash()</code> once per block, and see how that
improves performance:</p>

</code></pre><p>Well now, Zig is fast and everything is right again with the world – and
Factor takes only about 50% more time than Zig’s <code>std.HashMap</code> with
<code>rehash()</code> and about the same as <code>std.ArrayHashMap</code>, which is pretty
good for a dynamic language.</p>
<p>I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/17890">pull request adding a rehash() method to
HashMap</a> and hopefully it gets into
the upcoming Zig 0.12 release and maybe for Zig 0.13 they can adjust it to
automatically rehash when it gets sufficiently fragmented, consider using
quadratic probing instead of linear probing, or perhaps switch to using a
completely different HashMap algorithm like <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2019/04/25/developer-tools/f14/">Facebook’s F14 hash
table</a>, which
doesn’t have this issue.</p>
<p>Maybe we should consider some of these improvements for Factor as well!</p>
<p>Open source is fun!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Scientists have rediscovered a long-lost species of mammal described as having the spines of a hedgehog, the snout of an anteater and the feet of a mole, in Indonesia's Cyclops Mountains more than 60 years after it was last recorded.</p><p>Attenborough's long-beaked echidna, named after British naturalist David Attenborough, was photographed for the first time by a trail camera on the last day of a four-week expedition led by Oxford University scientists.</p><p>Having descended from the mountains at the end of the trip, biologist James Kempton found the images of the small creature walking through the forest undergrowth on the last memory card retrieved from more than 80 remote cameras.</p><p>"There was a great sense of euphoria, and also relief having spent so long in the field with no reward until the very final day," he said, describing the moment he first saw the footage with collaborators from Indonesian conservation group YAPPENDA.</p><p>"I shouted out to my colleagues that were still remainin g... and said 'we found it, we found it' —&nbsp;I ran in from my desk to the living room and hugged the guys."</p><p>Echidnas share their name with a half-woman, half-serpent Greek mythological creature, and were described by the team as shy, nocturnal burrow-dwellers who are notoriously difficult to find.</p><p>"The reason it appears so unlike other mammals is because it is a member of the monotremes —&nbsp;an egg-laying group that separated from the rest of the mammal tree-of-life about 200 million years ago," Kempton said.</p><h2>Species only recorded once before</h2><p>The species has only been scientifically recorded once before, by a Dutch botanist in 1961. A different echidna species is found throughout Australia and lowland New Guinea.</p><div><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/chevrotain-rediscovered-1.5356202" text="Rare, fanged deer-like species rediscovered after 30 years" flag="" data-contentid=""><span>Rare, fanged deer-like species rediscovered after 30 years</span></a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/mammal-believed-extinct-found-in-mossy-forest-1.758476" text="Mammal believed extinct found in mossy forest" flag="" data-contentid=""><span>Mammal believed extinct found in mossy forest</span></a></li></ul></div><p>Kempton's team survived an earthquake, malaria and even a leech attached to an eyeball during their trip. They worked with the local village Yongsu Sapari to navigate and explore the remote terrain of northeastern Papua.</p><p>The echidna is embedded in the local culture, including a tradition that states conflicts are resolved by sending one party to a disagreement into the forest to search for the mammal and another to the ocean to find a marlin, according to Yongsu Sapari elders cited by the university.</p><p>Both creatures were seen as so difficult to find that it would often take decades or a generation to locate them. But&nbsp;once found, the animals symbolized the end of the conflict and a return to harmonious relationships.</p></div></div>]]></description>
