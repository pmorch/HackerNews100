<h3>from the <i>yeeted-from-search</i> dept</h3>

<p>A few months ago, Jack Yan pointed out to me that if they did a search for Techdirt on DuckDuckGo, it showed only one single link which was (bizarrely) to a random story from like eight years ago. There were literally no other results for Techdirt. I replicated it, but was travelling, and by the time I went back to write about it a few days later, everything seemed back to normal (in the interim there were a few days where it just found a couple hundred Techdirt posts). Jack wrote a short blog post <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jackyan.com/blog/2023/01/bing-increases-techdirts-results-saving-it-some-embarrassment/" target="_blank">on his own site</a> about it.</p>
<p>This morning, however, someone alerted me to the fact that DuckDuckGo currently shows zero results for Techdirt. Not even some random old article. Zero. None. Zilch.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/6b3494cb-9fee-40b0-97a7-387a9b11fc4c-RackMultipart20230727-96-s73gmq.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>Of course, DDG is powered by Bing, so I went to check Bing, and sure enough there’s nothing there:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/43661fc7-153f-4c4f-8e40-cbefbdd2e5a8-RackMultipart20230727-118-ostor0.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1">Bing appears to have deleted all links to Techdirt. Though at least it tells you that “some results have been removed.” Though it doesn’t say why.</p>
<p>At no point did anyone at Bing let us know that we’ve been removed from the search index. And, of course, BIng has every right to kick us out of their index for whatever reason they want. But it does seem odd.</p>
<p>So, hey, if you happen to know anyone at DuckDuckGo or on the Bing team, maybe ask them why they booted Techdirt? Apparently, I’m <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/forum/all/why-has-my-website-been-removed-from-bing/c5db8282-43a8-4696-8574-82e016b536b1">not the only person</a> this has happened to.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the meantime, I figured I’d ask Bing’s space aged AI chat bot if it could tell me what happened. And… it actually provided a decent answer, first pointing to Jack Yan’s blog post:</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/3f0e00a5-fa74-4db4-8149-11930c87339e-RackMultipart20230727-111-nug85h.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>And then coming up with a very speculative list of reasons why we got the boot:</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/4807d472-3417-4d45-9b1b-e0c9023cdf16-RackMultipart20230727-111-wbg503.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>I love that first one. Microsoft, a company with a $2.5 trillion market cap, “may not have enough resources” to crawl and index Techdirt? Cool. And the last one is of course possible: that Microsoft encountered “some legal or political pressure to remove or censor Techdirt.com, which is known for its critical and investigative reporting on various topics, such as technology, law, policy, and business,” but it would be nice if someone would just, you know, let me know?</p>
<p>I’m guessing it’s just a bug, but given that many Techdirt readers (for understandable reasons) prefer DDG to Google, it would be kinda nice if they could actually use it to get Techdirt results.</p>
<p>Now, of course, if this were a Trumpist nonsense peddler website, I’m sure there would be blaring headlines on Fox News and in the NY Post, and a whole set of hearings chaired by Jim Jordan about “censorship.” And we’d be hearing about it for years. That’s not going to happen with me. I’m sure the reality is much more mundane. I am guessing it’s just a glitch somewhere in the system.</p>
<p>But it would nice if it got fixed.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a rel="noopener follow" href="https://esthercrawford.medium.com/?source=post_page-----24a126098246--------------------------------"><div aria-hidden="false"><p><img alt="Esther Crawford" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*tgBvi4CuxtFvd_c4SUhcug.jpeg" width="44" height="44" loading="lazy"></p></div></a></div><figure><figcaption>since it’s a long read, feel free to listen to this post instead</figcaption></figure><p id="f91b">Like seemingly everyone on this app I have plenty of opinions about Twitter &gt; X and figure now is a good time to open up a bit about my experience at the company.</p><p id="ae62">I tweeted for years into the void for the love of it like many of you, but after selling my startup to Twitter in 2020 I finally got to see it from the inside. Up close it was both amazing and terrible, like so many other companies and things in life.</p><p id="983c">As someone with a maniacal sense of urgency built into me, Twitter often felt siloed and bureaucratic. Dumb power plays, reorgs and team name changes for the sake of someone’s ego were distractions that occurred too regularly.</p><p id="20f8"><strong>You couldn’t just be a builder — you also needed to be a politician.</strong></p><p id="1aca">I was shocked by how old and bespoke the infrastructure was, but there was little will to think beyond quarterly earnings calls because we were all beholden to the masters of mDAU and revenue growth as a public company. It often felt like things were held together with duct tape and glue, and that many people had just accepted that a small product change could take months or quarters to build.</p><p id="e4e0">Management had become bloated to accommodate <em>career growth</em> and the company culture felt too soft and entitled for my own taste. Healthy debate and criticism was replaced by a default refrain of “no, that can’t be done” or “another team owns that so don’t touch it”.</p><p id="6e63">Teams could spend months building a feature and then some last-minute kerfuffle meant it’d get killed for being too risky.</p><p id="7441"><strong>Just talking directly to customers could turn into a turf war and create deadlocks between functions.</strong></p><p id="4c3d">I recall one such episode where a teammate spent a month trying to get clearance to reach out to some creators. He went through 3 layers of management and 6 different functional teams. In the end 4 executives were involved in the approval. It was insanity, and unfortunately I saw several top performers get burnt out and demoralized after exhausting experiences like that.</p><p id="081c">Most people were good at their jobs but <strong>it was nearly impossible to fire poor performers</strong> — instead they got shuffled around to other teams because few managers had the will or resources to figure out how to get them out.</p><p id="02c1">A high performance culture pulls everyone up, but the opposite weighs everyone down. <strong>Twitter often felt like a place that kept squandering its own potential</strong>, which was sad and frustrating to see. The person who was best at cutting through the BS and inspiring a vision during my tenure was Kayvon Beykpour, but he wasn’t fully empowered to run the company since he wasn’t the CEO.</p><p id="4305">Despite those real issues, I was lucky enough to work with some of the most talented people in the business at Twitter in product, design, engineering, research, legal, BD, trust &amp; safety, marketing, PR and more. <strong>Often it was a small cross-functional team of intrinsically motivated people who made the biggest impact by challenging some core assumption.</strong> Those teams were very fun to be on but they felt like the exception rather than the rule.</p><p id="2da1">The months of waiting for the deal to close in 2022 were particularly slow and painful; it felt like leadership hid behind lawyers and legal language as all answers about the company’s future notoriously included the phrase “fiduciary duty”. Colleagues openly talked about how Twitter was being sold because leadership didn’t have conviction in their own plan or ability to fix longstanding problems.</p><p id="1546"><strong>Although I didn’t know much about Elon I was cautiously optimistic </strong>— I saw him as the guy who built incredible and enduring companies like Tesla and SpaceX, so perhaps his private ownership could shake things up and breathe new life into the company.</p><p id="1e38">My take on what’s happened since then is full of lived nuance.</p><p id="a660">When people ask why I stayed it’s easy to answer: optimism, curiosity, personal growth and money.</p><p id="d451">From the beginning I saw that some changes Elon was going to make were smart and others were stupid, but <strong>when I’m on a team I uphold the philosophy of “praise in public and criticize in private”</strong>. I was far from a silent wallflower. I shared my opinions openly and pushed back often, both before and after the acquisition.</p><p id="202c">I made peace with the fact that I didn’t have psychological safety at Twitter 2.0 and that meant I could be fired at any moment, and for no reason at all. I watched it happen repeatedly and saw how negatively it impacted team morale. Although I couldn’t change the situation I did my best to shine a light on folks who were doing important work while being an emotionally supportive leader for those who were struggling to adapt to the more brutalist and hardcore culture.</p><p id="7e08"><strong>In person Elon is oddly charming and he’s <em>genuinely funny</em>.</strong> He also has personality quirks like telling the same stories and jokes over and over. The challenge is his personality and demeanor can turn on a dime going from excited to angry. Since it was hard to read what mood he might be in and what his reaction would be to any given thing, people quickly became afraid of being called into meetings or having to share negative news with him.</p><p id="319e"><strong>At times it felt like the inner circle was too zealous and fanatical in their unwavering support of everything he said.</strong> When individuals encouraged me to be careful about what I said I politely thanked them and said I would not be taking their advice. I had no interest in adding to a culture of fear or walking on eggshells around Elon. Either he would respect me for being real or he could fire me. Either outcome was okay.</p><p id="96bb">I quickly learned that product and business decisions were nearly always the result of him following his gut instinct, and he didn’t seem compelled to seek out or rely on a lot of data or expertise to inform it. That was particularly frustrating for me since I believed I had useful institutional knowledge that could help him make better decisions. Instead he’d poll Twitter, ask a friend, or even ask his biographer for product advice. <strong>At times it seemed he trusted random feedback more than the people in the room who spent their lives dedicated to tackling the problem at hand.</strong> I never figured out why and remain puzzled by it.</p><p id="622d">I don’t think things had to be as difficult or dramatic as they turned out to be but I can’t say I’d bet against Elon or count him out. He’s smart and has enough money to make a lot of mistakes and then course correct when things go awry. As the largest shareholder he can tank the value in the short-term, but eventually he’ll need things to turn around.</p><p id="7e9f"><strong>His focus on speed is incredible and he’s obviously not afraid of blowing things up</strong>, but now the real measure will be how it get reconstructed and if enough people want the new <em>everything app</em> he is building.</p><p id="c2ac">I learned a ton from watching Elon up close — the good, the bad and the ugly. His boldness, passion and storytelling is inspiring, but his lack of process and empathy is painful.</p><p id="e2bb">Elon has an exceptional talent for tackling hard physics-based problems but products that facilitate human connection and communication require a different type of social-emotional intelligence.</p><p id="03ff"><strong>Social networks are hard to kill but they’re not immune from death spirals.</strong> Only time will tell what the outcome will be but I hope X finds its footing because competition is good for consumers.</p><p id="7414">In the meantime, I have a lot of empathy for the employees who are working tirelessly behind the scenes, the advertisers who want a stable platform to sell their stuff on, and the customers who are experiencing chaotic updates. It’s been a madhouse.</p><p id="4d34">Twitter moved at the speed of molasses and suffered from bureaucracy but now X is run by a mercurial leader whose instinct is driven by the unique and undoubtedly weird experience of being the biggest voice on the platform.</p><p id="7203"><strong>Many of you know me from the <em>sleeping bag incident</em> where I slept on a conference room floor</strong>, so I figure, let’s talk about that too.</p><p id="937e">Going viral was an odd and interesting experience. I was attacked by people on the left and called a billionaire bootlicker, while simultaneously being attacked by people on the right for being a working mom who was demonized as an example of a woman choosing her career over her family.</p><p id="de80">Thankfully I can laugh at myself and I don’t take armchair keyboard ideologues too seriously. <strong>Being the main character on the timeline, even for a few minutes, requires a thick skin and a strong sense of self.</strong></p><p id="e1f5">The real story is pretty simple. I was given a nearly impossible deadline for his first project and as the product lead I would never ask anyone to do anything I wasn’t willing to do myself. So I worked round the clock alongside an amazing team spanning many timezones, and we delivered it on schedule — truly against the odds. It was intense but also fun.</p><p id="7e54"><em>Those first few months were wildly crazy but I wanted to be there and I have no regrets.</em></p><p id="f2f5">Showing up and giving it your all should, in most cases, be celebrated. Obviously you can’t work at that pace forever but there are moments where bursts are mission critical. I’ve pulled many all-nighters in my career and also when I was a student for something that mattered to me. I don’t regret putting in long hours or being ambitious, and feel proud of how far I’ve come from where I started thanks in part to that type of work ethic.</p><p id="505a"><strong>I think of life as a game, and being at Twitter after the acquisition was like playing life at Level 10 on Hard Mode. </strong>Since I like taking on difficult challenges I found it interesting and rewarding because I was growing and learning so rapidly.</p><p id="6d44">I realize our society today trends toward polarization but when it comes to this app, its owner, and its future, <strong>I am neither a fan girl nor a hater — I’m an optimistic pragmatist</strong>.</p><p id="36f9">This may really irritate the internet but you cannot pigeonhole me into some radical position of either loving or hating every change that’s occurred. I escaped my fundamentalist upbringing and am a free thinker these days. <strong>Everyone can be seen as both a hero or a villain, depending on who is telling what angle of the story. </strong>Elon doesn’t deserve to be venerated or vilified. He’s a complicated person with an unfathomable amount of financial and geopolitical power which is why <strong>humanity needs him to err on the side of goodness, rather than political divisiveness and pettiness</strong>.</p><p id="e2d7">I disagree with many of his decisions and am surprised by his willingness to burn so much down, but with enough money and time, something new &amp; innovative may emerge.</p><p id="77a7">I hope it does.</p><p id="676a"><strong>Sometimes I get asked about how I felt when I got laid off, and the truth is it was the best gift I’ve ever received. </strong>Sure the headlines and punchlines wrote themselves but I was battle hardened by then. I knew that I’d worked in a way where I could walk out with my head held high. I have no bitterness about the Product Management team being dismantled, and it made sense for me to exit as nearly all of the remaining PMs were let go.</p><p id="2d07">Going on a sabbatical afterward has been exactly what I needed to decompress and I’m finally feeling rested and relaxed. I’m a creative and a builder, so sooner than later I’ll jump back into a high intensity company but I’m grateful for this season of thinking, reading, traveling and being with people I love.</p><p id="d8c5">After having time to reflect <strong>I believe more than ever that the very best outcomes flow from great leadership that combines <em>the head and the heart</em></strong>.</p><p id="f153">I’d be remiss if I didn’t note that in all of this there is also a cautionary tale for anyone who succeeds at something — which is that <strong>the higher you climb, the smaller your world becomes</strong>. It’s a strange paradox but the richest and most powerful people are also some of the most isolated.</p><p id="e085">I found myself frequently looking at Elon and seeing a person who seemed quite alone because his time and energy was so purely devoted to work, which is not the model of a life I want to live.</p><p id="7f5d">Money and fame can create psychological prisons which may worsen mental health conditions. We’ve all seen high profile cases of celebrities who end up with some combination of depression, paranoia, delusions of grandeur, mania and/or erratic behavior.</p><p id="09e0">Living in an echo chamber is dangerous and <strong>being at the top makes a person even more susceptible to being surrounded by yes people when nearly everyone around you is on the payroll and somehow stands to benefit from being in your orbit</strong>. Figuring out how to keep “better angels” around in the form of family, friends, and teammates is critical to staying on the rails and enduring intense ups and downs. Everyone needs to hear hard truths sometimes and if you fire all the people who speak up then the reality distortion field may just turn into a vortex.</p><p id="aa69">I was drawn to Twitter because I’m obsessed with the problem of loneliness and connection between people. <strong>I find it fascinating &amp; troubling that humans are getting lonelier as we simultaneously create a world that’s both safer and wealthier.</strong> I don’t believe that trade-off has to exist, which is why I keep returning to that theme in my personal and professional life.</p><p id="e729">I realize this is <em>too long of a tweet</em> but Twitter was a weird and special place on the internet, and I’m grateful to have played a teeny tiny role in its story and evolution.</p><p id="996a">I’m here for whatever comes next — on this app and in new places. Consumer social is very much alive and at a fascinating juncture, so I’ll be watching and participating and sharing hot takes because I don’t want to, and probably can’t, turn that part of me off.</p><p id="462d">Perhaps X becomes a resounding success. Or it fails epically.</p><p id="9005">Either way, I expect it will continue to be a very entertaining ride.</p><p id="876c">🫡</p></div></div>]]></description>

      Typically these records, which track the average air temperature across the entire world, are broken by hundredths<strong> </strong>of a degree. But the temperature for the first 23 days of July averaged 16.95 degrees Celsius (62.51 Fahrenheit), well above the previous record of 16.63 degrees Celsius (61.93 Fahrenheit) set in July 2019, according to the report.

      The data used to track these records<strong> </strong>goes back to 1940, but many scientists – including those at Copernicus – say it’s almost certain that these temperatures are the warmest the planet has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/05/world/hottest-day-world-climate-el-nino-intl/index.html" target="_blank">seen in 120,000 years</a>, given what we know from millennia of climate data extracted from tree rings, coral reefs and deep sea sediment cores.

      It all adds up to a blistering Northern Hemisphere<strong> </strong>summer – potentially an unprecedented one. “The odds are certainly in a favor of a record-breaking summer,” said Carlo Buontempo, the director of Copernicus, although he cautioned that it’s too early to state that with confidence.

      Human-caused climate change is the main driver of this extraordinary heat, Burgess said. “The global air temperature is directly proportional to the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.”

      The arrival of El Niño, a natural climate fluctuation with a warming impact, has not had a huge impact on the temperatures as it is still in its developmental phase, Burgess said, but it will play much more of a role next year, she added, and will likely drive temperatures even higher.

      “We are seven months into 2023 and almost every month this year has been in the top five hottest on record,” said Burgess, adding that if the trends continue into the fall and winter, 2023 is likely to be among the warmest years ever recorded.

        <h2>About AlpacaEval</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval" target="_blank">AlpacaEval</a>
            an LLM-based automatic evaluation that is fast, cheap, and reliable.
            It is based on the
            <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/05/22/alpaca-farm.html">AlpacaFarm</a>
            evaluation set,
            which tests the ability of models to follow general user instructions.
            These responses are then compared to reference Davinci003 responses by
            the provided GPT-4 or Claude or ChatGPT based auto-annotators,
            which results in the win rates presented above.
            AlpacaEval displays a high agreement rate with ground truth human annotations,
            and leaderboard rankings on AlpacaEval are very correlated with leaderboard rankings
            based on human annotators.
            Please see our
            <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval#analysis" target="_blank">documentation</a>
            for more details on our analysis.
        </p>
        <h2>Adding new models</h2>
        <p>
            We welcome new model contributions to the leaderboard from the community!
            To do so, please follow the steps in the
            <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval#contributing" target="_blank">contributions
                section</a>.
            Specifically, you'll need to run the model on the evaluation set,
            auto-annotate the outputs, and submit a PR with the model config and leaderboard results.
            We've also set up a
            <a href="https://discord.gg/GJMxJSVZZM" target="_blank">Discord</a>
            for community support and discussion.
        </p>
        <h2>Adding new evaluators or eval sets </h2>
        <p>
            We also welcome contributions for new evaluators or new eval sets!
            For making new evaluators, we release our ground-truth
            <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval#data-release" target="_blank">human annotations</a>
            and <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval#analyzing-an-evaluator" target="_blank">comparison
            metrics</a>.
            We also release a
            <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval#analyzing-an-eval-set" target="_blank">rough guide</a>
            to follow for making new eval sets.
            We specifically encourage contributions for harder instructions distributions and for safety testing of
            LLMs.
        </p>
        <h2>AlpacaEval limitations</h2>
        <p>
            While AlpacaEval provides a useful comparison of model capabilities in following instructions,
            it is not a comprehensive or gold-standard evaluation of model abilities.
            For one, as detailed in the
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14387" target="_blank">AlpacaFarm paper</a>,
            the auto annotator winrates are correlated with length.
            Though human annotations also display this bias,
            it is unclear if more verbose answers add utility in downstream tasks.
            Additionally, the AlpacaFarm eval set, though diverse, consists mainly of simple instructions.
            We encourage the community to contribute new, more complex eval sets, such as for tool use.
            Finally, AlpacaEval does not evaluate the safety of any of the models.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi HN! I'm Sai, the co-founder and CEO of PeerDB (<a href="https://www.peerdb.io/">https://www.peerdb.io/</a>), a Postgres-first data-movement platform that makes moving data in and out of Postgres fast and simple. PeerDB is free and open (<a href="https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb">https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb</a>) and we provide a Docker stack for users to try us out. Our repo is at <a href="https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb">https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb</a> and there’s a 5-minute quickstart here: <a href="https://docs.peerdb.io/quickstart">https://docs.peerdb.io/quickstart</a>.</p><p>For the past 8 years, working at Microsoft on Postgres on Azure, and before that at Citus Data, I’ve worked closely with customers running Postgres at the heart of their data stack, storing anywhere from 10s of GB of data to 10s of TB.</p><p>This was when I got exposed to the challenges customers faced when moving data in and out of Postgres. Usually they would try existing ETL tools, fail, and decide to build in-house solutions. Common issues with these tools included painfully slow syncs - syncing 100s of GB of data took days; flaky and unreliable - frequent crashes, loss of data precision on target etc., and; feature-limited - lack of configurability, unsupported data types and so on.</p><p>I remember a specific scenario where a tool didn’t support something as simple as the Postgres’ COPY command to ingest data. This would have improved the throughput by orders of magnitude. We (customer and me) reached out to that company to request them to add this feature. They couldn’t prioritize this feature because it wasn’t very easy - their tech stack was designed to support 100s of connectors rather than supporting a native Postgres feature.</p><p>After multiple such occurrences, I thought, why not build a tool specialized for Postgres, making the lives of many Postgres users easier. I reached out to my long-time buddy Kaushik, who was building operating systems at Google and had led data teams at Safegraph and Palantir. We spent a few weeks building an MVP that streamed data in real-time from Postgres to BigQuery. It was 10 times faster than existing tools and maintained data freshness of less than 30 seconds. We realized that there were many Postgres native and infrastructural optimizations we could do to provide a rich data-movement experience for Postgres users. This is when we decided to start PeerDB!</p><p>We started with two main use cases: Real-time Change Data Capture from Postgres (demo: <a href="https://docs.peerdb.io/usecases/realtime-cdc#demo">https://docs.peerdb.io/usecases/realtime-cdc#demo</a>) and Real-time Streaming of query results from Postgres (demo: <a href="https://docs.peerdb.io/usecases/realtime-streaming-of-query-results#demo">https://docs.peerdb.io/usecases/realtime-streaming-of-query-...</a>). The 2nd demo shows PeerDB streaming a table with 100M rows from Postgres to Snowflake.</p><p>We implement multiple optimizations to provide a fast, reliable, feature-rich experience.  For performance, we can parallelize the initial load of a large table, still ensuring consistency. Syncing 100s of GB goes from days to minutes. We do this by logically partitioning the table based on internal tuple identifiers (CTID) and parallelly streaming those partitions (inspired by this DuckDB blog - <a href="https://duckdb.org/2022/09/30/postgres-scanner.html#parallelization" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://duckdb.org/2022/09/30/postgres-scanner.html#parallel...</a>)</p><p>For CDC, we don’t use Debezium, rather handle replication more natively—reading the slot, replicating the changes, keeping state etc. We made this choice mainly for flexibility. Staying native helps us use existing and future Postgres enhancements more effectively. For example, if the order of rows across tables on the target is not important, we can parallelize reading of a single slot across multiple tables and improve performance. Our architecture is designed for real-time syncs, which enables data-freshness of a few 10s of seconds even at large throughputs (10k+ tps).</p><p>We have fault tolerance mechanisms for reliability (<a href="https://blog.peerdb.io/using-temporal-to-scale-data-synchronization-at-peerdb">https://blog.peerdb.io/using-temporal-to-scale-data-synchron...</a>) and support multiple features including log-based (CDC) / query based streaming, efficient syncing of tables with large (TOAST) columns, configurable batching and parallelism to prevent OOMs and crashes etc.</p><p>For usability - we provide a Postgres compatible SQL layer for data-movement. This makes the life of data engineers much easier. They can develop pipelines using a framework they are familiar with, without needing to deal with custom UIs and REST APIs. They can use Postgres' 100s of integrations to build and manage ETL. We extend Postgres' SQL grammar with a few new intuitive SQL commands to enable real-time data streaming across stores. Because of this, we were able to add dbt integration via Dagster (in private preview) in a few hours! We expect data-engineers to unravel similar integrations with PeerDB easily, and plan to make this grammar richer as we evolve.</p><p>PeerDB consists of the following components to handle data replication: (1) PeerDB Server uses the pgwire protocol to mimic a PostgreSQL server, responsible for query routing and generating gRPC requests to the Flow API. It relies on AST analysis to make informed decisions on routing. (2) Flow API: an API layer that deals with gRPC commands, orchestrating the data sync operations; (3) Flow Workers execute the data read-write operations from the source to the destination. Built to scale horizontally, they interact with Temporal for increased resilience. The types of data replication supported include CDC streaming replication and query-based batch replication. Workers do all of the heavy lifting, and have data store specific optimizations.</p><p>Currently we support 6 target data stores (BigQuery, Snowflake, Postgres, S3, Kafka etc) for data movement from Postgres. This doc captures the current status of the connectors: <a href="https://docs.peerdb.io/sql/commands/supported-connectors">https://docs.peerdb.io/sql/commands/supported-connectors</a>.</p><p>As we spoke to more customers, we realized that getting data into PostgreSQL at scale is equally important and hard. For example one of our customers wants to periodically sync data in multiple SQL Server instances (running on the edge) to their centralized Postgres database. Requests for Oracle to Postgres migrations are also common. So now we’re also supporting source data stores with Postgres as the target (currently SQL Server and Postgres itself, with more to come).</p><p>We are actively working with customers to onboard them to our self-hosted enterprise offering. Our fully hosted offering on the cloud is in private preview. We haven’t yet decided on the pricing. One common concern we’ve heard from customers is that existing tools are expensive and charge based on the amount of data transferred. To address this, we are considering a more transparent way of pricing—for example, pricing based on provisioned hardware (cpu, memory, disk). We’re open for feedback on this!</p><p>Check out our github repo - <a href="https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb">https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb</a> and go ahead and give it a spin (5-minute quickstart <a href="https://docs.peerdb.io/quickstart">https://docs.peerdb.io/quickstart</a>).</p><p>We want to provide the world’s best data-movement experience for Postgres. We would love to get your feedback on product experience, our thesis and anything else that comes to your mind. It would be super useful for us. Thank you!</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
              <p>In a paper posted on arXiv on 2023-07-23, three researchers from the Quantum Energy Research Centre, Inc. and KU-KIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, report the production and test of a lead-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatite">apatite</a> material which they claim exhibits all of the phenomena of superconductivity at room temperatures and above (they state its critical temperature, below which it is a superconductor, as 400 K, or 127° C) and ambient atmospheric pressure at sea level.  Here is the paper.</p>


<p>Full text, in PDF form, is available at the link.  The abstract is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the first time in the world, we succeeded in synthesizing the room-temperature superconductor (<span>T_c\geq 400 {\rm K}</span>, 127∘ C) working at ambient pressure with a modified lead-apatite (LK-99) structure. The superconductivity of LK-99 is proved with the Critical temperature (<span>T_c</span>), Zero-resistivity, Critical current (<span>I_c</span>), Critical magnetic field (<span>H_c</span>), and the Meissner effect. The superconductivity of LK-99 originates from minute structural distortion by a slight volume shrinkage (0.48 %), not by external factors such as temperature and pressure. The shrinkage is caused by <span>{\rm Cu}^{2+}</span> substitution of <span>{\rm Pb2}^{+}</span>(2) ions in the insulating network of Pb(2)-phosphate and it generates the stress. It concurrently transfers to Pb(1) of the cylindrical column resulting in distortion of the cylindrical column interface, which creates superconducting quantum wells (SQWs) in the interface. The heat capacity results indicated that the new model is suitable for explaining the superconductivity of LK-99. The unique structure of LK-99 that allows the minute distorted structure to be maintained in the interfaces is the most important factor that LK-99 maintains and exhibits superconductivity at room temperatures and ambient pressure.</p>

<p>These illustrations from the paper show the structure of the synthesised material.</p>

<p>This silent video from the Quantum Energy Research Centre, institution of two of the co-authors, purports to show repulsion of a copper disc with a thermally deposited coating of the LK-99 material from a permanent magnet, as would be expected to occur from a superconductor manifesting the Meissner effect.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtVjGWpbE7k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
</p>

<p>Another video, which cannot be embedded here, claims to show levitation of a sample of LK-99 above a permanent magnet: “<a href="https://sciencecast.org/casts/suc384jly50n">Superconductor <span>{\rm Pb}_{10−x}{\rm ​Cu}_x​({\rm PO}_4​)_{6 O}​</span> showing levitation at room temperature and atmospheric pressure and mechanism</a>”.  Note that the corner of the material never actually rises above the magnet.</p>
<p>In both of these magnetic repulsion videos, keep in mind that magnetic repulsion and/or levitation are not, by themselves, probative of superconductivity: a diamagnetic material such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolytic_carbon#Magnetic_levitation">pyrolytic graphite</a>, <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/archives/2013-03/001428.html">can be made to levitate</a> in a magnetic field without being superconductive.</p>
<p>Here are some additional causes for caution by “some guy on the Internet”.</p>

</ul>
<p>Unlike earlier claims, which were based upon material under extreme pressure in a diamond anvil cell, this paper claims superconductivity under ordinary laboratory conditions, and rather than exotic materials such as lutetium hydride compounds, uses a phosphate of lead doped with copper, which a competent chemist should be able to whip up and test for themselves, which I presume is going on as I write in laboratories around the world.</p>
<p>There’s no need among this audience to explain the technological consequences of discovery of room temperature, ambient pressure superconductivity.  If the effect is genuine, and materials can be engineered which retain their superconductivity under the high magnetic fields of power transmissions (which has been a limitation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuprate_superconductor">cuprate superconductors</a> that operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures), this may spark a revolution in electronics as significant as the invention of the transistor, vacuum tube, and induction motor.</p>

  <p>The simple answer is that DHCP is indeed special. To quote what a stranger quoted,</p>

<p>It's often stated that this is because the DHCP server uses raw sockets.  I think this phrasing is quite confusing.  Some official ISC docs for their DHCP server use "raw sockets" as a broad term, because it can run on a number of different platforms where it must use a number of different interfaces.  On Linux, there is more than one type that you might hear referred to as raw sockets.  <em>Some are affected by Linux iptables, and some are not affected by Linux iptables</em>.</p>

<p>I'm confident that Linux' TCP/IP stack imposes some restrictions when sending packets with PF_INET+SOCK_RAW.  My vague memory was that DHCP on Linux does not necessarily work with that type of socket, and might need to use "packet sockets" instead.  Packet sockets work at a lower level.  I'm confident that packet sockets are not affected by iptables.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PF_PACKET sockets bypass the TCP/IP stack.</p>
  
  <p>PF_INET/SOCK_RAW sockets still travers the TCP/IP stack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- <a href="https://lists.netfilter.org/pipermail/netfilter-devel/2003-March/010845.html" rel="noreferrer">https://lists.netfilter.org/pipermail/netfilter-devel/2003-March/010845.html</a></p>

<p>This quote was written in the context of receiving packets. There is also evidence that this applies to sending packets, as you might expect.</p>

<hr>

<p>It seems that iptables is one of the restrictions that applies to the TCP/IP stack, including to sending with PF_INET+SOCK_RAW.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If I have a an IP datagram in userspace and I send it via a raw socket
    created with socket(PF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW) using the send()
    system call, will this packet traverse the netfilter chains?</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>looks like good news:</p>

<pre><code>ipt_hook: happy cracking.
ipt_hook: happy cracking.
ipt_hook: happy cracking.
ipt_tcpmss_target: bad length (10 bytes)
</code></pre>
  
  <p>So your packets will traverse iptables.</p>

<p>And the evidence for the receive direction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It turns out that using raw sockets
  gives me the packets post-NAT so the IP addresses are back in the
  private range (10.x.x.x in my example). Maybe this is common knowledge
  but I've struggled to find it documented. If I use libpcap/tcpdump I
  get packets pre-NAT</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[NAT is performed by iptables]</p>

<hr>

<p>Bonus griping: I <em>think</em> the term "packet filter" in my initial quote is a straight out abuse, albeit a long-standing one.  Berkeley Packet Filter is a mechanism used to install a filter on a raw socket, e.g. so that it only receives packets on the DHCP port.  I think ISC at times refer to "Linux Packet Filter" as if it was a type of raw socket itself.  It's not, and you can actually use BPF on normal UDP or TCP sockets.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Usually, SQLite allows at most one writer to proceed concurrently. The
BEGIN CONCURRENT enhancement allows multiple writers to process write
transactions simultanously if the database is in "wal" or "wal2" mode,
although the system still serializes COMMIT commands.</p>

<p>When a write-transaction is opened with "BEGIN CONCURRENT", actually 
locking the database is deferred until a COMMIT is executed. This means
that any number of transactions started with BEGIN CONCURRENT may proceed
concurrently. The system uses optimistic page-level-locking to prevent
conflicting concurrent transactions from being committed.</p>

<p>When a BEGIN CONCURRENT transaction is committed, the system checks whether 
or not any of the database pages that the transaction has read have been
modified since the BEGIN CONCURRENT was opened. In other words - it asks 
if the transaction being committed operates on a different set of data than
all other concurrently executing transactions. If the answer is "yes, this
transaction did not read or modify any data modified by any concurrent
transaction", then the transaction is committed as normal. Otherwise, if the
transaction does conflict, it cannot be committed and an SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT
error is returned. At this point, all the client can do is ROLLBACK the
transaction.</p>

<p>If SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT is returned, messages are output via the sqlite3_log
mechanism indicating the page and table or index on which the conflict
occurred. This can be useful when optimizing concurrency.</p>

<h2>Application Programming Notes</h2>
<p>In order to serialize COMMIT processing, SQLite takes a lock on the database
as part of each COMMIT command and releases it before returning. At most one
writer may hold this lock at any one time. If a writer cannot obtain the lock,
it uses SQLite's busy-handler to pause and retry for a while:</p>

<p>  <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/busy_handler.html">
      https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/busy_handler.html
  </a></p>

<p>If there is significant contention for the writer lock, this mechanism can be
inefficient. In this case it is better for the application to use a mutex or
some other mechanism that supports blocking to ensure that at most one writer
is attempting to COMMIT a BEGIN CONCURRENT transaction at a time. This is
usually easier if all writers are part of the same operating system process.</p>

<p>If all database clients (readers and writers) are located in the same OS
process, and if that OS is a Unix variant, then it can be more efficient to
the built-in VFS "unix-excl" instead of the default "unix". This is because it
uses more efficient locking primitives.</p>

<p>The key to maximizing concurrency using BEGIN CONCURRENT is to ensure that
there are a large number of non-conflicting transactions. In SQLite, each
table and each index is stored as a separate b-tree, each of which is
distributed over a discrete set of database pages. This means that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Two transactions that write to different sets of tables never 
conflict, and that</p></li>
<li><p>Two transactions that write to the same tables or indexes only 
conflict if the values of the keys (either primary keys or indexed 
rows) are fairly close together. For example, given a large 
table with the schema:</p>

<pre>     CREATE TABLE t1(a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, b BLOB);</pre>

<p>writing two rows with adjacent values for "a" probably will cause a
conflict (as the two keys are stored on the same page), but writing two
rows with vastly different values for "a" will not (as the keys will likly
be stored on different pages).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that, in SQLite, if values are not explicitly supplied for an INTEGER
PRIMARY KEY, as for example in:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code> INSERT INTO t1(b) VALUES(&lt;blob-value&gt;);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>then monotonically increasing values are assigned automatically. This is
terrible for concurrency, as it all but ensures that all new rows are 
added to the same database page. In such situations, it is better to
explicitly assign random values to INTEGER PRIMARY KEY fields.</p>

<p>This problem also comes up for non-WITHOUT ROWID tables that do not have an
explicit INTEGER PRIMARY KEY column. In these cases each table has an implicit
INTEGER PRIMARY KEY column that is assigned increasing values, leading to the
same problem as omitting to assign a value to an explicit INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
column.</p>

<p>For both explicit and implicit INTEGER PRIMARY KEYs, it is possible to have
SQLite assign values at random (instead of the monotonically increasing
values) by writing a row with a rowid equal to the largest possible signed
64-bit integer to the table. For example:</p>

<pre><code> INSERT INTO t1(a) VALUES(9223372036854775807);
</code></pre>

<p>Applications should take care not to malfunction due to the presence of such
rows.</p>

<p>The nature of some types of indexes, for example indexes on timestamp fields,
can also cause problems (as concurrent transactions may assign similar
timestamps that will be stored on the same db page to new records). In these
cases the database schema may need to be rethought to increase the concurrency
provided by page-level-locking.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/27/google_web_environment_integrity/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/27/google_web_environment_integrity/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36893071">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Google's Web Environment Integrity (WEI) proposal, according to one of the developers working on the controversial fraud fighting project, aims to make the web "more private and safe."</p>
<p>Ben Wiser, a software engineer at the Chocolate Factory, responded on Wednesday to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/25/google_web_environment_integrity">serious concerns</a> about the proposal by insisting that WEI aims to address online fraud and abuse without the privacy harms enabled by browser fingerprinting and cross-site tracking.</p>
<p>"The WEI experiment is part of a larger goal to keep the web safe and open while discouraging cross-site tracking and lessening the reliance on fingerprinting for combating fraud and abuse," he explained in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/issues/28#issuecomment-1651129388">GitHub Issues post</a>.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The WEI experiment is part of a larger goal to keep the web safe and open</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Fraud detection and mitigation techniques often rely heavily on analyzing unique client behavior over time for anomalies, which involves large collection of client data from both human users and suspected automated clients."</p>
<p>WEI is an attestation scheme. It provides a way for a web publisher to add code to a website or app that checks with a trusted third party, like Google, to see whether a visitor's software and hardware stack meets certain criteria to be deemed authentic.</p>

    

<p>Technically speaking, attestation is just a matter of transmitting <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949">a token</a> with a value – derived from as-yet-undisclosed hardware and software characteristics – that indicates whether or not the client is trustworthy. It's then up to the website publisher to decide how to respond to that signal.</p>

        


        

<p>In theory, if effectively implemented, WEI could allow a web game publisher to check whether game players are cheating through the use of unsanctioned hardware or software. Or it might be used by a content publisher to check whether ads are being displayed to real visitors or fraudulent bots.</p>
<p>The worry is that WEI could potentially be used to disallow ad blocking, to block certain browsers, to limit web scraping (still largely legal, though often disallowed under websites' terms-of-service), to exclude software for downloading YouTube videos or other content, and impose other limitations on otherwise lawful web activities.</p>

        

<p>What WEI's attestation check actually looks for has not been revealed. Nor is it evident from the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium/commit/6f47a22906b2899412e79a2727355efa9cc8f5bd">WEI code</a> that has been added to the Chromium open source project. But Wisner insists, "WEI is not designed to single out browsers or extensions" and is not designed to block browsers that spoof their identity.</p>
<p>However, the intended use of a technology isn't necessarily a limitation on it being employed in tricky new ways.</p>
<h3>Sounding the alarm</h3>
<p>Those in the technical community who have expressed alarm about the proposal argue that the web should not be brought under a permission-based regime, where a third party renders judgment on the worthiness of users – without consultation, based on opaque criteria.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The use cases listed seem very reasonable, the solution proposed is absolutely terrible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"The idea of it is as simple as it is dangerous. It would provide websites with an API telling them whether the browser and the platform it is running on that is currently in use is trusted by an authoritative third party (called an attester)," wrote Julien Picalausa, a software developer at browser maker Vivaldi, in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/googles-new-dangerous-web-environment-integrity-spec/">a post</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The details are nebulous, but the goal seems to be to prevent 'fake' interactions with websites of all kinds. While this seems like a noble motivation, and the use cases listed seem very reasonable, the solution proposed is absolutely terrible and has already been equated with DRM for websites, with all that it implies."</p>
<p>Dangerous though the idea may be, attestation has already been implemented on native platforms (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity">Android</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_server">iOS</a>) – some would say autocratic regimes compared to the relatively open web.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/25/google_web_environment_integrity/">Google's next big idea for browser security looks like another freedom grab to some</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/27/google_tweaks_topics_api_ahead/">Google asks websites to kindly not break its shiny new targeted-advertising API</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/05/04/security_roundup/">Xiaomi emits phone browser updates after almighty row over web activity harvested even in incognito mode</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/08/15/hijacked_clicks_research/">How dodgy browser plugins, web scripts can silently rewrite that URL you were about to hit – and throw you into an internet wormhole</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But attestation has even made it to the web. Tim Perry, creator of dev tool HTTP Toolkit, noted in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://httptoolkit.com/blog/apple-private-access-tokens-attestation/">blog post</a> on Tuesday that Apple offers <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=huqjyh7k">Private Access Tokens</a> for its Safari browser. Network security firm Cloudflare uses Private Access Tokens as a way to avoid showing people CAPTCHA puzzles to prove that they're not robots.</p>
<p>Perry argues that Apple's scheme is less of a concern because Safari's market share (~20 percent of mobile and desktop browsers) is far less than Chrome/Chromium (~70 percent of web clients). Nonetheless, he opposes attestation for being fundamentally anti-competitive.</p>

        

<p>"Fraud and bots on the web are a real problem, and discussion on ways to defend against that is totally reasonable, and often very valuable!" Perry declared.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Removing all user control over their own devices is not a reasonable tradeoff</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"It's a hard problem. That said, this has to be carefully balanced against the health of the web itself. Blocking competition, hamstringing open source and the open web, and removing all user control over their own devices is not a reasonable tradeoff."</p>
<p>Google considers Apple Private Access Tokens to be too private. The WEI proposal says, "due to the fully masked tokens, this technology assumes that the attester can produce sustainable, high-quality attestation without any feedback from websites about gaps such as false positives or false negatives."</p>
<p>Apple's Private Access Tokens <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/">do not involve the exchange of device data</a> between the device maker (Apple, as an attester) and Cloudflare. Google argues that masking token data in this manner denies feedback from websites involved in the attestation process that may be able to use withheld device data to minimize incorrect trust verdicts.</p>
<p>In fact, Wiser suggests privacy improvements are what prompted WEI. "Privacy features like <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.chromium.org/updates/ua-reduction/">user-agent reduction</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ip-protection">IP reduction</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/privacy-sandbox/storage-partitioning/">preventing cross-site storage</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/3-fingerprint-randomization/">fingerprint randomization</a> make it more difficult to distinguish or reidentify individual clients, which is great for privacy, but makes fighting fraud more difficult," he claimed.</p>
<p>The result of this, he argues, is that websites – determined to fight fraud – have responded by increasing their usage of sign-in gates, invasive fingerprinting techniques, and intrusive challenges like CAPTCHAs and SMS verification. Wiser argues these defenses make the web experience worse.</p>
<p>"We believe this is a tough problem to solve, but a very important one that we will continue to work on. We will continue to design, discuss, and debate in public," he said.</p>
<h3>A fundamental flaw</h3>
<p>Jon von Tetzchner, CEO of Vivaldi, told <em>The Register</em> in an interview that while Google has yet to specify exactly what WEI will be measuring to render trust verdicts, the details don't really matter – the entire approach is flawed.</p>
<p>"A big part of the reason why there is a problem is the surveillance economy," he explained, "and the solution to the surveillance economy seems to be more surveillance."</p>
<p>Von Tetzchner said that Google wants to know who is seeing its ads when it should, in his opinion, focus on where its ads get shown – often on web spam pages to be viewed by bots involved in ad fraud.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The solution is to get away from the surveillance economy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He recalled when he was involved with the Opera browser and had to deal with Google Docs not working on the browser. "When we started with Vivaldi, my thinking was okay, we are using Chromium, this is not going to be a problem," he said.</p>
<p>But compatibility issues remained, he said, and Vivaldi had to hide its identity (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://vivaldi.com/press/releases/vivaldi-2-10-no-strings-attached/">spoof its default User-Agent string</a>) to enable users to access popular Google services. And he's concerned WEI represents more of the same.</p>
<p>Von Tetzchner argues that attestation is not the proper response to online fraud.</p>
<p>"I just don't think this is a solution," he said. "The solution is to get away from the surveillance economy. We've been trying to ban the surveillance economy and ban the collection of data and making profiles on end users and utilizing it for advertisements. I really don't really see any reason why that should be legal in society.</p>
<p>"The surveillance economy is highly toxic," he added. "It has created significant issues for society. And I think that the obvious thing should be to stop using the technology. It doesn't make any sense to use it and there are other ways to do advertising that work just as well. But there is a lot of money for certain companies and they don't want to give up what they have." ®</p>

<p>How cool is this! Popularized in England, these wavy walls actually use less bricks than a straight wall because they can be made just one brick thin, while a straight wall—without buttresses—would easily topple over. </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crinkle_crankle_wall">Wikipedia</a>, these wavy walls are also known as: crinkle crankle walls, crinkum crankum walls, serpentine walls, or ribbon walls. The alternate convex and concave curves in the wall provide stability and help it to resist lateral forces. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crinkle_crankle_wall">source</a>]</p>
<p>The county of Suffolk seems to be home to countless examples of these crinkle crankle walls. On <a href="http://www.freston.net/blog/index.php?y=2016&amp;m=01&amp;d=04">freston.net</a> you can find 100 wavy walls that have been documented and photographed. In the United States, the best known serpentine wall can be found at the University of Virginia where Thomas Jefferson incorporated the wavy walls into the architecture. Although some authorities claim that Jefferson invented this design, he was merely adapting a well-established English style of construction. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crinkle_crankle_wall">source</a>]</p>
<p>As for the mathematics behind these serpentine walls and why the waves make them more resistant to horizontal forces like wind vs straight walls, check out this post by <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/11/19/crinkle-crankle-calculus/">John D. Cook</a>.</p>
<p>Below you will find additional examples of these intriguing wavy walls that lawnmowers surely detest! </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The European Commission is opening a formal antitrust investigation into Microsoft’s bundling of its Teams software with its Office productivity suite. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333989/slack-microsoft-eu-competition-complaint-teams-office">Slack originally filed an anti-competitive complaint</a> against Microsoft with the European Commission in July 2020, just months after a global pandemic began and the Microsoft Teams userbase started to grow rapidly.</p><p>The European Commission will <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3991">now carry out an in-depth investigation</a> into whether Microsoft may have breached EU competition rules by tying or bundling Microsoft Teams to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.</p><p>“Remote communication and collaboration tools like Teams have become indispensable for many businesses in Europe,” explains Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of competition policy at the European Commission. “We must therefore ensure that the markets for these products remain competitive, and companies are free to choose the products that best meet their needs. This is why we are investigating whether Microsoft’s tying of its productivity suites with Teams may be in breach of EU competition rules.”</p><p>Microsoft has responded to the EU’s complaint. “We respect the European Commission’s work on this case and take our own responsibilities very seriously,” says Microsoft spokesperson Robin Koch, in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “We will continue to cooperate with the Commission and remain committed to finding solutions that will address its concerns.”</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Microsoft Teams stock" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/376x251/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/384x256/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/415x277/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/480x320/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/540x360/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/640x427/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/750x500/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/828x552/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/1080x720/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/1200x800/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/1440x960/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/1920x1280/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/2048x1365/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/2400x1600/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2502x1668/2400x1600/filters:focal(1251x834:1252x835):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7399611/microsoftteamsstock.0.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><figcaption><em>Microsoft has previously bundled Teams with its Office subscriptions.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333989/slack-microsoft-eu-competition-complaint-teams-office">Slack’s original complaint</a> alleged that Microsoft had “illegally tied” its Microsoft Teams product to Office and is “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.” Now EU regulators are fully investigating the situation, after Microsoft reportedly offered a concession to the EU to stop bundling Teams with Office.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="paragraph-0">AUSTIN, Texas</p>
<p id="paragraph-1">In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan’s advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.</p>
<p id="paragraph-2">He soon realized he was sometimes&nbsp;getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.</p>
<p id="paragraph-3">“We’re looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,” he said of his dashboard range meter.</p>
<p id="paragraph-4">Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that “remote diagnostics” had determined his battery was fine, and then: “We would like to cancel your visit.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-5">What Ponsin didn’t know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a “Diversion Team” in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.</p>
<p id="paragraph-6">The Austin, Texas-based&nbsp;electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-8">Inside the Nevada team’s office, some employees celebrated canceling service appointments by putting their phones on mute and striking a metal xylophone, triggering applause from coworkers who sometimes stood on desks. The team often closed hundreds of cases a week and staffers were tracked on their average number of diverted appointments per day.</p>
<p id="paragraph-9">Managers told the employees that they were saving Tesla about $1,000 for every canceled appointment, the people said. Another goal was to ease the pressure on service centers, some of which had long waits for appointments.</p>
<p id="paragraph-10">In most cases, the complaining customers’ cars likely did not need repair, according to the people familiar with the matter. Rather, Tesla created the groundswell of complaints another way – by hyping the range of its futuristic electric vehicles, or EVs, raising consumer expectations beyond what the cars can deliver. Teslas often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates and the projections provided by the cars’ own equipment, according to Reuters interviews with three automotive experts who have tested or studied the company’s vehicles.</p>
<p id="paragraph-11">Neither Tesla nor Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to detailed questions from Reuters for this story.</p>

    <figure id="video-title" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
        
        <figcaption itemprop="caption">Reuters reporter Steve Stecklow discusses how Tesla has been exaggerating the driving range of its vehicles for years.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-13">Tesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles’ potential driving distance – by rigging their range-estimating software. The company decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to write algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers “rosy” projections for the distance it could travel on a full battery, according to a person familiar with an early design of the software for its in-dash readouts.</p>
<p id="paragraph-14">Then, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the algorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their remaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a “safety buffer,” allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-15">The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-16">“Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged,” the person said, adding: “When you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile range, it makes you feel good.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-17">Tesla’s intentional inflation of in-dash range-meter projections and the creation of its range-complaints diversion team have not been previously reported.</p>
<p id="paragraph-18">Driving range is among the most important factors in consumer decisions on which electric car to buy, or whether to buy one at all. So-called range anxiety – the fear of running out of power before reaching a charger – has been a primary obstacle to boosting electric-vehicle sales.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-20">At the time Tesla programmed in the rosy range projections, it was selling only two models: the two-door Roadster, its first vehicle, which was later discontinued; and the Model S, a luxury sport sedan launched in 2012. It now sells four models: two cars, the 3 and S; and two crossover SUVs, the X and Y. Tesla plans the return of the Roadster, along with a “Cybertruck” pickup.</p>
<p id="paragraph-21">Reuters could not determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates. But automotive testers and regulators continue to flag the company for exaggerating the distance its vehicles can travel&nbsp;before their batteries run out.</p>
<p id="paragraph-22"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/south-korea-fines-tesla-22-mln-exaggerating-driving-range-evs-2023-01-03/" id="article-link-0">Tesla was fined</a> earlier this year by South Korean regulators who found the cars delivered as little as half their advertised range in cold weather. Another recent study found that three Tesla models&nbsp;averaged 26% below their advertised ranges.</p>
<p id="paragraph-23">The U.S. Environmental&nbsp;Protection Agency (EPA) has required Tesla since the 2020 model year to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to advertise for six of its vehicles by an average of 3%. The EPA told Reuters, however, that it expects some variation between the results of separate tests conducted by automakers and the agency.</p>
<p id="paragraph-24">Data collected in 2022 and 2023 from more than 8,000 Teslas by Recurrent, a Seattle-based EV analytics company, showed that the cars’ dashboard range meters didn’t change their&nbsp;estimates to reflect hot or cold outside temperatures, which can greatly reduce range.</p>
<p id="paragraph-25">Recurrent found that Tesla’s four models almost always calculated that they could travel more than 90% of their advertised EPA range estimates regardless of external temperatures.&nbsp;Scott Case, Recurrent’s chief executive, told Reuters that Tesla’s range meters also ignore many other conditions affecting driving distance.</p>
<p id="paragraph-26">Electric cars can lose driving range for a lot of the same reasons as gasoline cars — but to a greater degree. The cold is a particular drag on EVs, slowing the chemical and physical reactions inside their batteries and requiring a heating system to protect them. Other drains on the battery include hilly terrain, headwinds, a driver’s lead foot and running the heating or air-conditioning inside the cabin.</p>
<p id="paragraph-27">Tesla discusses the general effect of such conditions in a <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/range" id="article-link-1">“Range Tips”</a> section of its website. The automaker also recently updated its vehicle software to provide a breakdown of battery consumption during recent trips with suggestions on how range might have been improved.</p>
<p id="paragraph-28">Tesla vehicles provide range estimates in two ways: One through a dashboard meter of current range that’s always on, and a second projection through its navigation system, which works when a driver inputs a specific destination. The navigation system’s range estimate, Case said, does account for a wider set of conditions, including temperature. While those estimates are “more realistic,” they still tend to overstate the distance the car can travel before it needs to be recharged, he said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-29">Recurrent tested other automakers’ in-dash range meters – &nbsp;including&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Hyundai Kona – and found them to be more accurate. The Kona’s range meter generally underestimated the distance the car could travel, the tests showed. Recurrent conducted the study with the help of a National Science Foundation grant.</p>
<p id="paragraph-30">Tesla, Case said, has consistently designed the range meters in its cars to deliver aggressive rather than conservative estimates: “That’s where Tesla has taken a different path from most other automakers.”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-32">Failed tests and false advertising</p>
<p id="paragraph-33">Tesla isn’t the only automaker with cars that don’t regularly achieve their advertised ranges.</p>
<p id="paragraph-34">One of the experts, Gregory Pannone, co-authored a <a href="https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2023-01-0349/" id="article-link-2">study</a> of 21 different brands of electric vehicles, published in April by SAE International, an engineering organization. The research found that, on average, the cars fell short of their advertised ranges by 12.5% in highway driving.</p>
<p id="paragraph-35">The study did not name the brands tested, but Pannone told Reuters that three Tesla models posted the worst performance, falling short of their advertised ranges by an average of 26%.</p>
<p id="paragraph-36">The EV pioneer pushes the limits of government testing regulations that govern the claims automakers put on window stickers, the three automotive experts told Reuters.</p>
<p id="paragraph-37">Like their gas-powered counterparts, new electric vehicles are required by U.S. federal law to display a label with fuel-efficiency information. In the case of EVs, this is stated in miles-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe), allowing consumers to compare them to gasoline or diesel vehicles. The labels also include estimates of total range: how far an EV can travel on a full charge, in combined city and highway driving.</p>

    <blockquote id="JEUJMAJ611_4">
        <p>“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests.”</p>
        
    </blockquote>
<p id="paragraph-39">EV makers have a choice in how to calculate a model’s range. They can use a standard EPA formula that converts fuel-economy results from city and highway driving tests to calculate a total range figure. Or automakers&nbsp;can conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. The only reason to conduct more tests is to generate a more favorable estimate, said Pannone, a retired auto-industry veteran.</p>
<p id="paragraph-40">Tesla conducts additional range tests on all of its models. By contrast, many other automakers, including Ford, Mercedes and Porsche, continue to rely on the EPA’s formula to calculate potential range, according to agency data for 2023 models. That generally produces more conservative estimates, Pannone said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-41">Mercedes-Benz told Reuters it uses the EPA’s formula because it&nbsp;believes it provides a more accurate estimate. “We follow a certification strategy that reflects the real-world driving behavior of our customers in the best possible way,” the German carmaker said in a statement.</p>
<p id="paragraph-42">Ford and Porsche didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-44">Whatever an automaker decides, the EPA must approve the window-sticker numbers. The agency told Reuters it conducts its own tests on 15% to 20% of new electric vehicles each year as part of an audit program and has tested six Tesla models since the 2020 model year.</p>
<p id="paragraph-45">EPA data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act showed that the audits resulted in Tesla being required to lower all the cars’ estimated ranges by an average of 3%. The projected range for one vehicle, the 2021 Model Y Long Range AWD (all-wheel drive), dropped by 5.15%. The EPA said all the changes to Tesla’s range estimates were made before the company used the figures on window stickers.</p>
<p id="paragraph-46">The&nbsp;EPA said it has seen “everything” in its audits of EV manufacturers’ range testing, including low and high estimates from other automakers.&nbsp;“That is what we expect when we have new manufacturers and new technologies entering the market &nbsp;and why EPA prioritizes” auditing them, the agency said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-47">The EPA cautioned that individuals’ actual experience with vehicle efficiency might differ from the estimates the agency approves. Independent automotive testers commonly examine the EPA-approved fuel-efficiency or driving range claims against their own experience in structured tests or real-world driving. Often, they get different results, as in the case of Tesla vehicles.</p>
<p id="paragraph-48">Pannone called Tesla “the most aggressive” electric-vehicle manufacturer when it comes to range calculations.</p>
<p id="paragraph-49">“I’m not suggesting they’re cheating,” Pannone said of Tesla. “What they’re doing, at least minimally, is leveraging the current procedures more than the other manufacturers.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-50">Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone&nbsp;after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.</p>
<p id="paragraph-51">All five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.</p>
<p id="paragraph-52">Tesla complained to Edmunds that the test failed to account for the safety buffer programmed into Tesla’s in-dash range meters. So Edmunds did further testing, this time running the vehicles, as Tesla requested, past the point where their range meters indicated the batteries had run out.</p>
<p id="paragraph-53">Only two of six Teslas tested matched their advertised range, Edmunds <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/testing-teslas-range-anxiety.html" id="article-link-3">reported in March 2021</a>. The tests found no fixed safety buffer.</p>
<p id="paragraph-54">Edmunds has <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/electric-car-range-and-consumption-epa-vs-edmunds.html" id="article-link-4">continued to test electric vehicles</a>, using its own standard method, to see if they meet their advertised range estimates. As of July, no Tesla vehicle had, Elfalan said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-55">“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests,” Elfalan told Reuters. The practice can “misrepresent what their customers will experience with their vehicles.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-56">South Korean regulators earlier this year fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) found that Tesla failed to tell customers that cold weather can drastically reduce its cars’ range. It cited tests by the country’s environment ministry that&nbsp;showed Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company’s claimed ranges in cold weather.</p>
<p id="paragraph-57">The KFTC also flagged certain statements on Tesla’s website, including one that claimed about a particular model: “You can drive 528 km (328 miles) or longer on a single charge.” Regulators required Tesla to remove the “or longer” phrase.</p>
<p id="paragraph-58">Korean regulators required Tesla to publicly admit it had misled consumers. Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging “false/exaggerated advertising.”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-60">Creating a diversion</p>
<p id="paragraph-61">By last year, sales of Tesla’s electric vehicles were surging. The company delivered about 1.3 million cars in 2022, nearly 13 times more than five years before.</p>
<p id="paragraph-62">As sales grew, so did demand for service appointments. The wait for an available booking was sometimes a month, according to one of the sources familiar with the diversion team’s operations.</p>
<p id="paragraph-63">Tesla instructs owners to book appointments through a phone app. The company found that many problems could be handled by its “virtual” service teams, who can remotely diagnose and fix various issues.</p>
<p id="paragraph-64">Tesla supervisors told some virtual team members to steer customers away from bringing their cars into service whenever possible. One current Tesla “Virtual Service Advisor” described part of his job in his LinkedIn profile: “Divert customers who do not require in person service.”</p> 
<p id="paragraph-71">Such advisors handled a variety of issues, including range complaints. But last summer, Tesla created the&nbsp;Las Vegas “Diversion Team”&nbsp;to handle only range cases, according to the people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p id="paragraph-72">The office atmosphere at times resembled that of a telemarketing boiler room. A supervisor had&nbsp;purchased the metallophone – a xylophone with metal keys – that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations, according to the people familiar with the office’s operations.</p>
<p id="paragraph-73">Advisers would normally run remote diagnostics on customers’ cars and try to call them, the people said. They were trained to tell customers that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction, not an actual measurement, and that batteries degrade over time, which can reduce range. Advisors would offer tips on extending range by changing driving habits.</p>
<p id="paragraph-74">If the remote diagnostics found anything else wrong with the vehicle that was not related to driving&nbsp;range, advisors were instructed not to tell the customer, one of the sources said. Managers told them to close the cases.</p>
<p id="paragraph-75">Tesla also updated its phone app so that any customer who complained about range could no longer book service appointments, one of the sources said. Instead, they could request that someone from Tesla contact them. It often took several days before owners were contacted because of the large backlog of range complaints, the source said.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-77">The update routed all U.S. range complaints to the Nevada diversion team, which started in Las Vegas and later moved to the nearby suburb of Henderson. The team was soon fielding up to 2,000 cases a week, which sometimes included multiple complaints from customers frustrated they couldn't book a service appointment, one of the people said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-78">The team was expected to close about 750 cases a week. To accomplish that, office supervisors told advisers to call a customer once and, if there was no answer, to close the case as unresponsive, the source said. When customers did respond, advisers were told to try to complete the call in no more than five minutes.</p>
<p id="paragraph-79">In late 2022, managers aiming to quickly close cases told advisors to stop running remote diagnostic tests on the vehicles of owners who had reported range problems, according to one of the people familiar with the diversion team’s operations.</p>
<p id="paragraph-80">“Thousands of customers were told there is nothing wrong with their car” by advisors who had never run diagnostics, the person said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-81">Reuters could not establish how long the practice continued.</p>
<p id="paragraph-82">Tesla recently stopped using its diversion team in Nevada to handle range-related complaints, according to the person familiar with the matter. Virtual service advisors in an office in Utah are now handling range cases, the person said. Reuters could not determine why the change was made.</p>

<p id="paragraph-87">On the road</p>
<p id="paragraph-88">By the time Alexandre Ponsin reached California on his March road trip, he had stopped to charge his Model 3’s battery about a dozen times.</p>
<p id="paragraph-89">Concerned that something was seriously wrong with the car, he had called and texted with several Tesla representatives. One of them booked the first available appointment in Santa Clara – about two&nbsp;weeks away – but advised him to show up at a Tesla service center as soon as he arrived in California.</p>
<p id="paragraph-90">Ponsin soon received a text saying that remote diagnostics had shown his battery “is in good health.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-91">“We would like to cancel your visit for now if you have no other concerns,” the text read.</p>
<p id="paragraph-92">“Of course I still have concerns,” Ponsin shot back. “I have 150 miles of range on a full charge!”</p>
<p id="paragraph-93">The next day, he received another text message asking him to cancel the appointment. “I am sorry, but no I do not want to close the service appointment as I do not feel my concerns have been addressed,” he replied.</p>
<p id="paragraph-94">Undeterred, Ponsin brought his car to the Santa Clara service center without an appointment. A technician there told him the car was fine. “It lasted 10 minutes,” Ponsin said, “and they didn’t even look at the car physically.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-95">After doing more research into range estimates, he said he ultimately concluded there is nothing wrong with his car. The problem, he said, was that Tesla is overstating its performance. He believes Tesla “should be a lot more explicit about the variation in the range,” especially in very cold weather.</p>
<p id="paragraph-96">“I do love my Tesla,” the engineer said. “But I have just tempered my expectation of what it can do in certain conditions.”</p>

<p>Over the past six years, we’ve seen Transformers take the world by storm. Transformers have been the workhorse architecture behind modern foundation models and have seen impressive empirical success across diverse applications – from pretrained language models like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a>, <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416">Flan-T5</a>, to image models like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02643">SAM</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752">stable diffusion</a>. We think Transformers are great (and have had lots of fun <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135">optimizing</a> <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/07/17/flash2.html">them</a>), but we’ve also been thinking about a deeper <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-03-23-ai-everywhere">question</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Are Transformers the only way to get this amazing performance?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, the first reason we’ve been poking around at this is because it’s really interesting! Diving into the inner workings of the architectures could help us understand what makes our current generation of models really tick and learn how to train or use them better. And we’ve been really excited by a lot of the work looking into new architectures, from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396">S4</a> to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10544">BiGS</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10655">Mega</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12951">Liquid</a>, and more. It’s great to live in a world where there are so many great ideas!</p>
<p>But we’re also interested in this question for some core efficiency reasons. Ideally, an alternative to Transformers would scale more efficiently while still matching in quality. One strong motivation for us has been scaling in sequence length – hence the line of work in our lab looking into replacing attention with a sub-quadratic operator (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396">S4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052">H3</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10866">Hyena</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15794">HyenaDNA</a>). And we’re encouraged by the groundswell of work into new architectures for long sequences, from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08621">RetNet</a> to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13048">RWKV</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15595">positional interpolation</a> – just to name a few!</p>
<p>MLPs – the other core building block of Transformers – also introduce an efficiency bottleneck, which becomes more acute as we continue to optimize attention. MLPs are quadratic in the model width, which means they grow more expensive as you make models wider. This is why models like GPT-3 are so expensive, and why GPT-4 has allegedly started using techniques like mixtures of experts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What if there were a model that were sub-quadratic along both sequence length and model dimension, and could match Transformers in quality?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today we’re excited to present a little teaser of some work in this direction – Monarch Mixer BERT (M2-BERT). M2-BERT is sub-quadratic in sequence length and model dimension, has 25% fewer parameters/FLOPs than BERT, and matches in quality (potentially exceeding a little bit when parameter-matched). We’re still very early days, so come talk to us if you find these questions exciting! And if you’re reading this the week of release, we’ll be at ICML – come find us in Hawaii, we’ll be putting up a poster at the <a href="https://es-fomo.com/">ES-FoMo</a> workshop!</p>
<p>This blog post highlights a small portion of the Monarch Mixer line of work. Full arXiv coming soon, and this would not have been possible without the <a href="#ack">full team</a>!</p>
<h2>Monarch Mixer</h2>
<p>Our basic idea is to replace the major elements of a Transformer with Monarch matrices — which are a class of structured matrices that generalize the FFT and are sub-quadratic, hardware-efficient, and expressive. A key property of Monarch matrices is that they can be computed using a series of <em>block-diagonal</em> matrices, interleaved with permutations:</p>
<figure><img src="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2023-07-25-m2-bert/m2-diagram.png"></figure>
<p>In Monarch Mixer (M2), we use layers built up from Monarch matrices to do both mixing across the sequence (what attention does in Transformers) and mixing across the model dimension (what the MLP does in Transformers). This is similar in spirit to great work like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01601">MLP Mixer</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09792">ConvMixer</a>, which similarly replaced everything with a single primitive for vision tasks (but went for quadratic primitives).</p>
<p>Why go for a fully sub-quadratic architecture now? We’re continuing off a recent line of work in our lab (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10544">and</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13947">elsewhere</a>) that replaces attention with long convolutions – which is implemented efficiently with the FFT. Critically, Monarch matrices can implement the FFT – which gives us hope that a fully Monarch-based architecture can get there.</p>
<h2>Revisiting BERT with Monarch Mixer</h2>
<p>As a first proof-of-concept of our ideas, we’re going to roll the clock back to 2018, and look at one of the first big applications of pretrained Transformers – language modeling with BERT! Despite its (relative) age, BERT is still a workhorse model for applications such as text classification, retrieval, search, and more (see <a href="https://sayanchak.medium.com/practical-uses-of-bert-c384ae3a5c2a">this</a> great summary – and this great <a href="https://twitter.com/marktenenholtz/status/1682436003158433816">tweet</a> on why we love BERT).</p>
<p>For our model, we’ll replace the attention block with a layer inspired by previous work in attention-free models (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052">H3</a> &amp; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10866">Hyena</a>), and replace the fully-connected layers in the MLP with some simple block-diagonal matrices. All of these operations can be implemented with Monarchs, and the rest is standard stuff like element-wise multiplication, and simple pointwise operators.</p>
<p>Our sequence mixer block builds off H3 and Hyena. Our <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-01-20-h3">previous</a> <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-03-07-hyena">blogs</a> give some intuition about what the architecture is doing – in brief, the short convolutions allow the model to do a quick lookup of nearby tokens, while the long convolutions allow global information to pass over the sequence.</p>
<figure><img src="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2023-07-25-m2-bert/m2-arch.png"></figure>
<p>The deltas between our sequence mixer the original H3/Hyena layer are a bit interesting, so we’ll go over them briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FFT -&gt; Monarch:</strong> in H3 and Hyena, the long convs are computed using the FFT, e.g. <code>iFFT(FFT(x) * FFT(k))</code>. In M2-BERT, we compute these FFTs with Monarchs!</li>
<li><strong>Causal vs. bidirectional:</strong> in H3 and Hyena, the long convs are <em>causal</em> (for the autoregressive language modeling loss). This is done by padding the inputs of the FFTs with zeros, since the FFT implements a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem">circular</a> convolution. In M2-BERT, we make the convolutions <em>non-causal</em> by making the convolution kernel twice the length of the input, which makes the weights wrap around.</li>
<li><strong>Convolution kernel:</strong> For the actual kernels <code>k</code>, we use a CKConv parameterization with an exponential, similar to Hyena! In our bidirectional setup, this makes the convolution kernels focus on nearby tokens in the input.</li>
<li><strong>Extra convolution connection:</strong> for BERT, we found that adding an extra convolution (a “residual” so to speak) improved performance on synthetic tasks and pretraining loss.</li>
<li><strong>Average pooling in fine-tuning:</strong> Transformer-based BERT models are traditionally fine-tuned using the embedding of the CLS token. We find that taking the average pool of the embeddings in the input can work a bit better for M2-BERT on downstream tasks that require comparing information spread across multiple sentences such as GLUE NLI tasks (one intuition is that the convolutions spread the information across more tokens).</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, the dimension mixer looks a lot like a normal MLP with GLU, but replaces the fully-connected layers with block-diagonal layers – which drastically reduces the parameters and makes the model more efficient!</p>
<p>So then the natural questions are – given the drastic parameter reduction, how does quality compare to a standard BERT model, and how much faster is it?</p>
<h2>Quality on GLUE</h2>
<p>So our first evaluation was pretraining some M2-BERT models and comparing their downstream GLUE scores after fine-tuning.</p>
<p>When we take our M2-BERT models with the same model width and depth as a standard BERT model, we get some pretty decent parameter savings – M2-BERT-base with 12 layers and model with 768 has 80M parameters, compared to a standard BERT-base of 110M parameters. We pretrained M2-BERT-base (80M) on 36.5B tokens of C4, at sequence length 128, as well as an M2-BERT parameter-matched to BERT-base.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we can get pretty decent results, even with fewer parameters – M2-BERT-base (80M) matching the original BERT-base scores from Devlin 2018 BERT, and the parameter-matched M2-BERT-base sees further lift (see the end of the blog post for full numbers):</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><strong>Model</strong></th><th>Average GLUE Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>BERT-base (110M)</td><td>79.6</td></tr><tr><td>Crammed BERT-base (110M)</td><td>79.1</td></tr><tr><td>M2-BERT-base (80M)</td><td>79.9</td></tr><tr><td>M2-BERT-base (110M)</td><td><strong>80.9</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>There’s still a lot we don’t know about these models, so quality could get even better. We mostly took standard Transformer BERT-base hyperparameters, besides some basic hyperparameter sweeps on fine-tuning. The Transformer hyperparameters have been optimized by the community in tons of ways over the past five years, so there’s a lot still to learn about what the best hyperparameters and training formulae are for M2 (e.g., we observed up to half-point swings in average GLUE score during our sweeps). And there’s been great work in the community about exactly how much gating you need for different tasks (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10544">BiGS, section 7.2</a>, so lots more to explore here).</p>
<h2>Long Sequence Preview</h2>
<p>So what does this new architecture buy us? One possibility is speed, and scaling to longer sequences. Since M2 is sub-quadratic in model dimension, we see a FLOP reduction (which is reflected in the lower parameter count). But the sequence mixer is also sub-quadratic in sequence length, which means the potential to scale to longer sequences.</p>
<p>We’ll be exploring long-sequence M2-BERT models more in-depth in the coming weeks, but for now here’s a simple preview of throughput at different sequence lengths, compared to the HuggingFace BERT-base and a more optimized FlashAttention BERT-base, for various sequence lengths. Here, we’re looking at throughput in terms of tokens/ms, on a single A100.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>512</th><th>1024</th><th>2048</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>HF BERT-base (110M)</td><td>206.5</td><td>130.8</td><td>71.3</td></tr><tr><td>FlashAttention BERT-base (110M)</td><td>380.7</td><td>359.7</td><td>265.3</td></tr><tr><td>M2-BERT-base (80M)</td><td><strong>386.3</strong></td><td><strong>380.7</strong></td><td><strong>378.9</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Today we’re releasing two initial M2-BERT checkpoints pretrained on short sequences, but M2-BERT has the potential to scale to much longer sequences. We’ve started using these scaling properties to experiment with data recipes for long-sequence M2-BERT’s – stay tuned!</p>
<h2>What's Next</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are releasing code for BERT and checkpoints for 80M and 110M models today, pretrained using a standard recipe at sequence length 128 – stay tuned for longer sequences! Check out our <a href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/m2">code</a> and checkpoints (<a href="https://huggingface.co/danfu09/m2-bert-80M">80M</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/danfu09/m2-bert-110M">110M</a>).</li>
<li>In the coming weeks, watch out for further releases, as we train up long-sequence BERT’s and start tracing the history of Transformers forward – on ImageNet, causal language modeling, T5-style models, as well as explorations of the long sequence capabilities</li>
<li>As part of this release, you’ll find some optimized CUDA code for the forward pass of the M2 layer (which we used for the benchmarks) – we’ll continue to optimize and release updates over the coming weeks. Expect another series of blogs and materials on these soon as we explore the computational tradeoff space!</li>
<li>And of course, full arXiv coming soon!</li>

<p>I've been <a href="https://jlericson.com/2015/07/21/vacation.html/2015/07/21/vacation.html">on
vacation</a>, so I
haven't been following <a href="https://jlericson.com/tag/strike.html">the Stack Overflow moderator
strike</a>.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> Not there has been
much progress. Negotiations stalled for <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/390106/moderation-strike-update-data-dumps-choosing-representatives-gpt-data-and-wh/390704#390704">a variety of
reasons</a>. Meanwhile
Stack Overflow's CEO, Prashanth Chandrasekar, dug the company's hole a
bit deeper <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/stack-overflow-ceo-teases-generative-ai-tools-addresses-moderator-protest/">during an interview with
VentureBeat</a>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="https://jlericson.com/2020/02/04/misunderstanding_meta.html">the last time I analyzed an
interview</a>, I assume the
author accurately represented Prashanth. I'd prefer an unedited
transcript because it allows the reader to interpret in the original
context but we must play the hand we are dealt. I will pull out the
quotes and offer my analysis below.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's definitely a question around how we leverage [generative AI]
technology to deliver on our mission of helping build technology
through collective knowledge. This intersection between the power of
community on one side and AI on the other side—from my
standpoint, human-generated community content has taken us to this
level, we have a large impact, but there are also so many problems
we can solve by leveraging this technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before I jump in, please take a moment to read <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/introducing-stackoverflow-com/">Jeff
Atwood's</a>
and <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/09/15/stack-overflow-launches/">Joel
Spolsky's</a>
introductions of Stack Overflow.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>  Did you
notice what I did? Both describe Stack Overflow as the solution to a
very specific problem: programming knowledge locked up in minds and
forums whence it's difficult to retrieve. They also explain how they
intend to solve the problem including using their combined audience to
form the core of the community of programmers to answer questions. As
someone who was there at the time, it was easy to envision how the project
might solve the problem even if that was an unlikely outcome.</p>
<p>By contrast Prashanth regularly talks about combining community and AI
without going into detail about how that solves the problem at
hand. Neither does he go into much detail about the problems the
company intends to solve. I suspect one reason is that Prashanth, who
has spent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pchandrasekar/details/experience/">most of his career in
management</a>,
has become something of an <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/">architecture
astronaut</a>. As
Joel puts it, "architecture people are solving problems that they
think they can solve, not problems which are <em>useful</em> to solve." Since
there is overlap between a Q&amp;A site and generative artificial
intelligence, there must be a way of jamming them together.</p>
<p>But there's another factor. In May I <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/05/17/so_business.html">wrote about Stack Overflow's
business</a>, which lost $42 million over 6
months and had just laid off 10% of its employees. Since then, <a href="https://prosus-ir.com/results/2023/Prosus-annual-results-2023/pdf/booklet.pdf">the
company's fiscal year-end results came
out</a>. Despite
growing revenue, it lost $84 million over the year ending on March
31, 2023. In fact Prosus' <em>entire education technology segment</em> lost
money despite growing income:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On an economic-interest basis, Edtech segment revenues grew by 28%
(18%) to US$545m and trading losses increased to US$258m. Growth was
affected by decreased demand in the macroeconomic downturn. Our
portfolio companies have reacted quickly to changing market conditions
and are rationalising their cost structures and investments. At the
same time, our businesses are shifting resources to take advantage of
new AI technologies which promise to transform the industry. By
deploying GenAI technologies, our companies can better personalise the
content and user feedback on their platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.prosus.com/~/media/Files/P/Prosus-CORP/latest-financial-results/results-call-transcript.pdf">most recent earnings
call</a>,
Larry Illg, the CEO of the segment and Prashanth's boss, commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Stack specifically, we think that Gen AI is going to be an
important evolution to how developers work and learn in the future,
helping them to be more efficient and also learn new techniques
while they're in the flow of work. We think, and the Stack team
believes the developer community can play a crucial role in how AI
evolves and accelerates, ultimately, with the community being
helpful in ensuring the quality of Gen AI offerings. And Stack
itself sees its role as is bringing the power of its developer
community—and it's important to remember that they have assembled
one of the biggest developer communities in the world—bringing
that community together with the technology power of AI with the
goal of creating highly trusted solutions to technology
problems. And the team is working and launching a variety of AI
solutions and more to come here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it might be that the shift to allow AI answers has more to do with
Stack Overflow's parent company than its CEO. Or maybe Prashanth has
been pushing this as a solution to Stack Overflow's financial
problems. Either way, it appears the company hopes the community will
cooperate by vetting artificially generated content. It doesn't appear
they have put much thought into why the community might want to do
this, though it's important to remember these are comments directed to
investors, not developers.</p>
<p>The call happened on June 27, a month after <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/389582/what-is-the-network-policy-regarding-ai-generated-content">the policy allowing AI
content</a>. I
can only speculate, but a reasonable interpretation would be that the
company found it could not solve its financial problems by <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/19/data_dump.html">selling
data</a> and looked for other ways it could
provide something to sell to LLM developers. Given Stack Overflow's
voting system, it's natural to wonder if that data could be fed back
into the models. (And even better if Stack Overflow can be paid for
that data.) But you can't very well do that if machine-generated
content is absolutely disallowed.</p>
<p>Let's pop the stack back to Prashanth's interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to do it responsibly and safely and have the right use case
to solve specific user and customer problems. It's going
to be very, very exciting—I can't wait for the world to know and
for our community to use the things that we're about to announce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is clearly referencing Prashanth's keynote address on July 27
when he's planning on making an announcement. I
<a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/19/data_dump.html">predicted</a> the announcement would be
adding Prosus' LLM technology to Stack Overflow. That wouldn't help
with revenue, but it's the easiest way for Stack Overflow to
demonstrate the potential value of using voting data. In order to
maximize press coverage on the day of the announcement, the company
can only tease without breaking the news early. That's a pretty
terrible communication strategy for a community, however. Unless your
community trusts you without reservation (and Stack Overflow is
nowhere near that blessed state) the teases will only increase
anxiety.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're probably talking about 30 million official developers based on
our own data sets, but that number is probably going to at least
triple because there are so many people that are going to come into
the field of writing code because it's so much easier to begin to
write a baseline level of quality of code. And I think
the watermark has just sort of gone up in terms of the expectations
for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stack Overflow has <a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites#users">21 million
users</a>, so that's not where the
30 million comes from. A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+developers+are+in+the+world">quick Google
search</a>
puts the number of developers worldwide at 27 million. Since the world
population stands at <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">8
billion</a>, roughly 3
of every thousand people on Earth are developers. I don't know if that
sounds like a large or a small number to you, but given there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#Programmers">no
programmers before
1945</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd03xx/EWD340.PDF">not many
more added in the
1950s</a>, the
profession has grown at a goodly rate.</p>
<p><img src="https://jlericson.com/images/arrow_tech.jpg" alt="Display of arrowhead technology at Guernsey State Park, Wyoming."></p>
<p>In a blog earlier this year, <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/?p=21973">Prashanth compared AI to the
introduction of tractors</a> in that
they made the job easier. I pointed out that <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/388401/new-blog-post-from-our-ceo-prashanth-community-is-the-future-of-ai/389224#389224">tractors reduced the
number of
farmers</a>.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
Tripling the number of programmers would imply a rather dramatic
change to the world economy. What sort of work would they be doing? As
a lapsed programmer, I do find myself reaching for the old tools to
help a colleague from time to time. But I don't envision my co-workers
becoming programmers no matter how easy it becomes. If I weren't
around to ask, they'd reach for other tools or just go without.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you want to definitely be adopting these tools to get more
productive and efficient and learn faster in your role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another way of expressing the well-worn idea: <a href="https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1610984481342771200">"AI will not
replace you. A person using AI
will."</a>
Remember there used to be an occupation called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_(occupation)">"computer"</a>. The
people who had those jobs (often women) lost them to devices also
called "computers". AI enthusiasts aim for a happy medium where the
technology is disruptive enough to demand attention, but tame enough
that everyone who adopts it will prosper.</p>
<p>Since the invention of writing, there were scribes who specialized in
using (and creating) the tools required to make legible marks. They
were hired to take dictation and copy manuscripts. It was technical
and highly-specialized work. With improvements in technology
(including <a href="https://www.bl.uk/history-of-writing/articles/a-brief-history-of-writing-materials-and-technologies">the printing press and mass-produced metal
nibs</a>)
more people could write for themselves and "scribe" took on a
metaphorical meaning for someone who makes a living cranking out the
written word. Technology dramatically increased the production of
writing at the cost of people making a living doing that work.</p>
<p>After using ChatGPT for a few months to <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/03/29/coding_ai.html">help me write
code</a>, I'm not sure
it will have the same impact as metal nibs had on writing. For common
questions, it's impressive but <a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/the-miracle-of-chatgpt">blind spots can be easily
found</a>. The
primary advantage of LLMs (their output can be copied and used without
modification) also makes them poor tools for effective learning. They
create <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.pdf">cargo
cults</a> from
their training materials. They sometimes produce useful results if
circumstances are favorable, but provide no help otherwise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The decision to ban ChatGPT was the “right decision” back in
December, said Chandrasekar. But now, he explained, the company has
slowly been working with the community, doing research and getting
input.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the primary spot I wish VentureBeat had provided a
transcript. I think Prashanth has <a href="https://stackoverflow.co/labs/">Stack Overflow
Labs</a> in mind here. If so, the
feedback from the community was largely "please don't do this". It's
hard to see how any of what happened after reversing the ban on
ChatGPT is working <em>with</em> the community. "Against" seems the more
appropriate preposition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have gotten feedback on how best to make sure that we will trust
generative AI products, from a Stack Overflow standpoint, and that's
what we're going to announce in about a month's time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is fairly vague, but despite the context I suspect the feedback
came from people working with LLMs. It certainly hasn't come from the
community since their elected moderators were told their judgment was
unreliable. In that light "make sure that we will trust generative AI
products" feels a lot more sinister than it first appears. Perhaps
what Prashanth meant was simply "improve the trustworthiness of
generative AI products", which once again signals using Stack Overflow
voting to provide feedback to some model or other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[False negatives are] causing a really negative impact because when
a legitimate human being coming on the website wants to ask a
question, we don't want to shoo them away. We want to share the
question, we want to serve our purpose and mission.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[The decision to create a new AI policy was] not an easy decision by
any means—but we just thought that the cost of dissuading
people from asking a question on Stack Overflow was too high. And it
was happening very alarmingly high rate based on the analysis that
we looked at.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what I can tell, most suspected machine-generated content comes
in the form of an answer, not a question. Nevertheless, incorrectly
flagged content does have a negative impact on the humans that
produced it. I believe, however, the company is <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/26/problem_ai.html">underestimating the
number of answers copied from ChatGPT</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've taken a public position around this subject, saying that we
always want to be open and free with our data with our developer
community. However, large AI companies building models—we
absolutely want to work with them in a more formal way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this might be the company's public position, <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/391634/the-companys-commitment-to-the-data-dumps-the-api-and-sede/391640#391640">Prashanth
privately wanted to limit who can access the
data</a>. On
March 28, 2023, he ordered the data dump not be uploaded to
Archive.org. The DBA who turned it off warned that the community would
notice and it did. Rather than having an answer prepared, the company
publicly struggled for an answer. <a href="https://jlericson.com/2023/06/19/data_dump.html">Internal
communication</a> shows most of the company
was as surprised as the rest of us.</p>
<p>The harsh reality is that Stack Overflow's CEO hasn't listened to the
people who best understand Stack Overflow. He appears to have a
surface-level grasp of the site, the community and the culture. As a
result, he's made decisions that harm the value of Stack
Overflow. This isn't necessarily malicious, but rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">incompetence
of some sort</a>.</p>
<p>Prashanth has already demonstrated skill in selling Stack
Overflow. That was an impressive feat. But nobody can excel at
everything and he hasn't shown an aptitude for running a
community-centered company. It requires <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/391626/historical-policy-on-the-use-of-gpt-generators/391654#391654">much more than platitudes and
boundless
enthusiasm</a>.</p>

<pre>I promised a post-mortem three weeks ago after I brought the Tarsnap service
back online.  It took me an unforgivably long time to get around to writing
this, but here it is.

At approximately 2023-07-02 13:07:58 UTC, the central Tarsnap server (hosted
in Amazon's EC2 us-east-1 region) went offline suffering a "failed system
status check".  As a virtual machine, this could mean many things, including
a power outage, a hardware failure on the physical server, or an outage in
EC2's network; all I can say is that since I haven't seen reports of any
widespread EC2 issues at the same time, it was most likely just an isolated
hardware fault.

Tarsnap's monitoring systems detected the failure at 2023-07-02 13:10 UTC (I
have monitoring writing/reading/deleting archives every 5 minutes from a
different EC2 region) and alerted me.  (The text message at 13:10 UTC didn't
wake me up, but the phone call at 13:15 UTC did.)  My initial investigation
didn't reveal any clearly transient errors so I assumed the system was dead
and started spinning up a replacement EC2 instance.

At approximately 2023-07-02 13:52 UTC (45 minutes after the initial outage)
Amazon restarted the failed server on a new EC2 instance; this brought up the
operating system (FreeBSD) but did not restart the Tarsnap server code since I
don't have the system configured to start that automatically -- if anything
causes the system to unexpectedly reboot, I want to check things over before
any tarsnap traffic gets handled, since "preventing data loss if something
breaks" is far more important than "maximize service availability".

The server logs after rebooting showed filesystem corruption; it's clear that
whatever took the system offline either killed the hardware or severed it from
the Elastic Block Store which holds its filesystems.  I decided to continue
with setting up a new server rather than attempting to recover the old one.

The Tarsnap service stores data in Amazon S3 as a log-structured filesystem
with each S3 object consisting of a header with metadata for all of the log
entries, followed by (optionally) data for the log entries.  For example, a
"start write transaction" log entry has a header identifying the machine and
transaction nonce but has no log data, while a "store data block" log entry
has a header identifying the machine and block name, along with the block
data.  Under normal conditions, the log entry metadata is also cached in EC2
and is never read from Amazon S3; the only reads from Amazon S3 are to read
block data in response to requests from the tarsnap client.

The process of recovering the EC2 instance state consists of two steps: First,
reading all of the metadata headers from S3; and second, "replaying" all of
those operations locally.  (These cannot be performed at the same time, since
the use of log-structured storage means that log entries are "rewritten" to
free up storage when data is deleted; log entries contain sequence numbers
to allow them to be replayed in the correct order, but they must be sorted
into the correct order after being retrieved before they can be replayed.)

The first step proceeded without incident, completing at 2023-07-03 01:49:49
UTC.  In hindsight it probably could have been faster: I had the recovery
process configured to make 250 simultaneous requests to Amazon S3 because that
is what Amazon S3 could sustain a decade ago, but I suspect that this could be
significantly increased now.

The second step failed almost immediately, with an error telling me that a
replayed log entry was recording data belonging to a machine which didn't
exist.  This provoked some head-scratching until I realized that this was
introduced by some code I wrote in 2014: Occasionally Tarsnap users need to
move a machine between accounts, and I handle this storing a new "machine
registration" log entry and deleting the previous one.  Unfortunately while
I had tests for this, I never tested regenerating the server state after a
machine is "re-owned" *while having data stored* -- and since the new machine
"registration" log entry has a higher sequence number, the server was quite
right in objecting that data was stored belonging to a machine which didn't
exist... yet.

Once I figured out what was going on, I disabled that "seatbelt" and resumed
the state reconstruction process.  It then failed again almost immediately
complaining that it couldn't find data in Amazon S3, because my attempt at
"resuming" the process involved skipping the downloading-data-from-S3 step
and thereby left a "maximum log entry sequence number" value uninitialized
(and therefore set to zero).  A short time later I had that fixed and the
state reconstruction process continued properly.

This process was also somewhat slower than it should have been; had I realized
that it was disk throughput bound I would have configured the relevant EBS
volume for higher throughput.  Unfortunately by this point I was quite sleep
deprived so I wasn't monitoring the process closely -- otherwise I would have
noticed this (in both gstat(8) and Amazon CloudWatch) and reconfigured the
EBS volume.

By about 2023-07-03 15:10 UTC (I didn't record the exact time) the state
reconstruction process had completed.  I ran some quick tests with the server
in read-only mode and compared against the old server state (to make sure that
things matched up aside from the old server's filesystem having lost the last
few seconds of data when the server failed), and then I brought it online.
The first live post-outage traffic was at 2023-07-03 15:25:58 UTC, roughly
26 hours and 16 minutes after the outage started.

Following my ill-defined "Tarsnap doesn't have an SLA but I'll give people
credits for outages when it seems fair" policy, on 2023-07-13 (after some dust
settled and I caught up on some sleep) I credited everyone's Tarsnap accounts
with 50% of a month's storage costs.

As always, feel free to email me if you have any questions.

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>tl;dr: <a href="#two-ways-to-ask-for-explanations">part 1</a> explains what an explanation algorithm is, and <a href="#an-open-source-implementation-of-diff">part 2</a> describes an open source SQL data differ.</em></p>

<h2 id="why-did-this-happen-what-changed">“Why did this happen?” “What changed?”</h2>

<p>In the data world, most reporting starts by asking <em>how much?</em>: “how many new customers purchase each week?” or “what is the monthly cost of medical care for this group?”</p>

<p>Inevitably the initial reports result in questions about <em>why?</em>: “why did we see less purchases last week?” and “why are the medical costs for this group increasing?”</p>

<p>The academic community has an answer to such <em>why?</em> questions: explanation algorithms. An explanation algorithm looks at columns/properties of your dataset and identifies high-likelihood explanations (called “predicates” in database-speak). For example, the algorithms might find that you got less customers in the segment of people who saw a new marketing campaign, or that the medical costs for the group you’re studying can largely be attributed to costly treatments in a subgroup.</p>

<p>The academic interest is founded in real pain. When a journalist, researcher, or organization asks <em>why?</em>, the resulting data anlysis largely goes into issuing ad hoc GROUP BY queries or unscientifically creating pivot tables to try to slice and dice datasets to explain some change in a dataset over time. Companies like <a href="https://sisudata.com/">Sisu</a> (founded by Peter Bailis, one of the authors of the DIFF paper discussed below) are built on the premise that data consumers are increasingly asking <em>why?</em></p>

<p>You can rephrase lots of different questions in the form of an explanation question. This is an area I’ve been interested in for a while, especially as it might help people like journalists and social scientists better identify interesting trends. In <a href="https://blog.marcua.net/2015/06/02/a-data-differ-to-help-journalists.html">A data differ to help journalists</a> (2015), I said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be nice to have a utility that, given two datasets (e.g., two csv files) that are schema-aligned, returns a report of how they differ from one-another in various ways. The utility could take hints of interesting grouping or aggregate columns, or just randomly explore the pairwise combinations of (grouping, aggregate) and sort them by various measures like largest deviation from their own group/across groups.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time of that post, I hadn’t yet connected the dots between the desire for such a system and the active work going on in the research world. Thanks to database researchers, that connection now exists! In this post, I’ll first cover two approaches to explanation algorithms, and then introduce an open source implementation of one of them in my <a href="https://github.com/marcua/datools">datools library</a>.</p>

<h2 id="two-ways-to-ask-for-explanations">Two ways to ask for explanations</h2>

<p>In 2013, Eugene Wu and Sam Madden introduced <a href="http://sirrice.github.io/files/papers/scorpion-vldb13.pdf">Scorpion</a>, a system that explains why an aggregate (e.g., the customer count last week) is higher or lower than other example data. Figure 1 in their paper explains the problem quite nicely. They imagine a user looking at a chart, in this case of aggregate temperatures from a collection of sensors, and highlighting some outliers to ask “compared to the other points on this chart, why are these points so high?”</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://blog.marcua.net/assets/images/diff/scorpion-figure1.png" alt="A figure from the Scorpion paper that shows how a user might highlight outliers on a chart"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A figure that shows how a user might highlight outliers on a chart (source: Scorpion paper)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Scorpion has two nice properties. First, it operates on aggregates: it’s not until you look at some weekly or monthly statistics that you notice that something is off and search for an explanation. Second, it’s performant on a pretty wide variety of aggregates, with optimizations for the most common ones (e.g., sums, averages, counts, standard deviations). I believe that of all the explanation algorithms, Scorpion pairs the most intuitive phrasing of the question (“why so high/low?”) with the most intuitive experience (highlighting questionable results on a visualization).</p>

<p>The challenge in implementing Scorpion is that, as presented, it does its processing outside of the database that stores the data. Specifically, the way Scorpion partitions and merges subsets of the data to identify an explanation requires decision trees and clustering algorithms that traditionally execute outside of the database<sup id="fnref:madlib" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:madlib" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It is also specific to aggregates, which are commonly the source of <em>why</em> questions, but aren’t the only places that question arises.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="http://www.bailis.org/papers/diff-vldb2019.pdf">DIFF</a> comes in. In 2019, Firas Abuzaid, Peter Kraft, Sahaana Suri, Edward Gan, Eric Xu, Atul Shenoy, Asvin Ananthanarayan, John Sheu, Erik Meijer, Xi Wu, Jeff Naughton, Peter Bailis, and Matei Zaharia introduced an explanation algorithm in the form of a database operator called DIFF that can be expressed in SQL. If you’re so inclined, here’s the syntax for the DIFF operator:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://blog.marcua.net/assets/images/diff/diff-figure1.png" alt="The syntax for the DIFF operator "></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>The syntax for the DIFF operator (source: DIFF paper)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>An example with SQL might help in understanding how it works:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://blog.marcua.net/assets/images/diff/diff-example.png" alt="A simple example of the DIFF operator in action (source: DIFF paper)"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A simple example of the DIFF operator in action (source: DIFF paper)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In this example, the DIFF operator compares the crash logs of an application from this week to those of last week, considering columns like application version, device, and operating system for an explanation. The most likely explanation happened 20x more this week than last week (<code>risk_ratio = 20.0</code>), and explains 75% of this week’s crashes (<code>support = 75%</code>).</p>

<p>DIFF requires that we do some mental gymnastics to transform “why was X so high?” into “how are these two groups different?”. It also requires the user to wrap their head around statistics like risk ratios and support. In exchange for that mental overhead, DIFF is exciting for its praticality. As the example shows, DIFF’s authors envision it being expressed in SQL, which means it could be implemented on top of most relational databases. While a contribution of the paper is a specialized and efficient implementation of DIFF that databases don’t have today, it can also be implemented entirely in the database as a series of SQL GROUP BY/JOIN/WHERE operators.</p>

<p>If you have a relational database, love SQL, and want to run an explanation algorithim, DIFF is exciting because those three things are all you need. Luckily for you, dear reader, I had a relational database, loved SQL, and wanted to run an explanation algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="an-open-source-implementation-of-diff">An open source implementation of DIFF</h2>
<p>Over the past few months, I’ve been implementing DIFF as a thin Python wrapper that generates the SQL necessary to compute the difference between two schema-aligned queries. <a href="https://github.com/marcua/datools/blob/main/datools/explanations.py">The core of the implementation to do this</a>, including comments, requires a little under 300 lines of code. To see a full example of the tool in action, you can check out this <a href="https://github.com/marcua/datools/blob/main/examples/diff/intel-sensor.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>, but I’ll show snippets below to give you a sense of how it works.</p>

<p>First, we need a dataset. For that, I took inspiration from the Scorpion paper’s experiments, one of which relied on <a href="http://db.csail.mit.edu/labdata/labdata.html">sensor data from Intel</a> collected by my grad school advisor Sam Madden (and a few collaborators). Using Simon Willison’s excellent <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/">sqlite-utils</a> library, I load the data into SQLite and inspect it:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># Retrieve and slightly transform the data</span>
wget http://db.csail.mit.edu/labdata/data.txt.gz
<span>gunzip </span>data.txt.gz
<span>sed</span> <span>-i</span> <span>'1s/^/day time_of_day epoch moteid temperature humidity light voltage\n/'</span> data.txt
<span>head </span>data.txt

<span># Get it in SQLite</span>
pip <span>install </span>sqlite-utils
sqlite-utils insert intel-sensor.sqlite readings data.txt <span>--csv</span> <span>--sniff</span> <span>--detect-types</span>
sqlite-utils schema intel-sensor.sqlite
</code></pre></div>

<p>That last <code>sqlite-utils schema</code> shows us what the newly generated <code>readings</code> table looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>"readings"</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>[</span><span>day</span><span>]</span> <span>TEXT</span><span>,</span>
   <span>[</span><span>time_of_day</span><span>]</span> <span>TEXT</span><span>,</span>
   <span>[</span><span>epoch</span><span>]</span> <span>INTEGER</span><span>,</span>
   <span>[</span><span>moteid</span><span>]</span> <span>INTEGER</span><span>,</span>
   <span>[</span><span>temperature</span><span>]</span> <span>FLOAT</span><span>,</span>
   <span>[</span><span>humidity</span><span>]</span> <span>FLOAT</span><span>,</span>
   <span>[</span><span>light</span><span>]</span> <span>FLOAT</span><span>,</span>
   <span>[</span><span>voltage</span><span>]</span> <span>FLOAT</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK! So we have a row for each sensor reading, with the <code>day</code> and <code>time_of_day</code> it happened, an <code>epoch</code> to time-align readings from different sensors, a <code>moteid</code> (the ID of the sensor, otherwise known as a mote), and then the types of things that sensors tend to sense: <code>temperature</code>, <code>humidity</code>, <code>light</code>, and <code>voltage</code>.</p>

<p>In the Scorpion paper (Sections 8.1 and 8.4), a user notices that various sensors placed throughout a lab detect too-high temperature values (reading <a href="https://github.com/sirrice/scorpion/blob/ba1af715ebc33bc4c4a63612d63debd8650ee1cf/scorpion/tests/gentestdata.py#L80">the experiment code</a>, this happens in the days between 2004-03-01 and 2004-03-10). A natural question is why this happened. The Scorpion algorithm discovers that <code>moteid = 15</code> (a sensor with ID 15) was having a bad few days.</p>

<p>Can we replicate this result with DIFF? Let’s see! The DIFF implementation is part of a library I’ve been building called <code>datools</code>, which is a collection of tools I use for various data analyses. Let’s install datools:</p>



<p>Now let’s use it!</p>

<p>What’s <code>diff</code> have to say?</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Wow! <code>moteid = 15</code> is the top predicate that <code>datools.diff</code> identified as being the difference between the <code>test_relation</code> and <code>control_relation</code>! With a <code>risk_ratio = 404.83</code>, we learn that sensor 15 is about 400 times more likely to appear in the set of records with high temperature readings than in the set of records with low temperature readings. Hooray for replicating the Scorpion result! Poor sensor 15!</p>

<p>Let’s break that call to <code>diff</code> down a bit so we understand what’s going on:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>engine</code>: a <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> engine that’s connected to some database, in this case the SQLite database.</li>
  <li><code>test_relation</code>: the “test set,” which is a query with records that show a particular condition. In our case, it’s the higher-temperature records during the period of interest. This could alternatively be a SQL query for “patients with high medical costs” or “customers who purchased.”</li>
  <li><code>control_relation</code>: the “control set,” which is a query with records that don’t show that particular condition. In our case, it’s the lower-temperature records during the period of interest. This could alternatively be a SQL query for “patients who don’t have high medical costs” or “leads who haven’t purchased.”</li>
  <li><code>on_column_values</code>: these are set-valued columns you want to consider as explanations. In our case, we’re considering the <code>moteid</code> column, so we can identify a specific sensor thats misbehaving.</li>
  <li><code>on_column_ranges</code>: these are range-valued columns you want to consider as explanations. <code>diff</code> will bucket these columns into 15 equi-sized buckets, which works well for continuous variables like <code>{Column('humidity'), Column('light'), Column('voltage'),}</code>. In this example, we don’t provide any (more on why later), but in the Jupyter Notebook, you can see this in action.</li>
  <li><code>min_support</code>: The smallest fraction ([0, 1]) of the test set that the explanation should explain. For example, <code>min_support=0.05</code> says that if an explanation doesn’t include at least 5% of the test set, we don’t want to know about it.</li>
  <li><code>min_risk_ratio</code>: The smallest risk ratio that the explanation should cover. For example, <code>min_risk_ratio=2.0</code> says that if an explanation isn’t at least 2 times as likely to appear in the test set than in the control set, we don’t want to know about it.</li>
  <li><code>max_order</code>: How many columns to consider for a joint explanation. For example, in the Scorpion paper, the authors find that not just sensor 15 (one-column explanation), but sensor 15 under certain light and voltage conditions (three column-explanation), is the best explanation for outlier readings. To analyze three-column explanations, you’d set <code>max_order=3</code>. Sadly and hopefully temporarily, while <code>max_order</code> is the most fun, interesting, and challenging-to-implement parameter of the DIFF paper, <code>datools.diff</code> only supports <code>max_order=1</code> for now.</li>
</ul>

<p>An astute reader will note that I coaxed the results in my example a bit by asking DIFF to consider only <code>moteid</code> explanations (<code>on_column_values={Column('moteid'),}</code>). The Scorpion paper considers the other columns as well and still gets the strongest signal from <code>moteid</code>. In the <a href="https://github.com/marcua/datools/blob/main/examples/diff/intel-sensor.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>, we dive into this more deeply and run into an issue replicating the Scorpion results with <code>diff</code>. I offer some hypotheses for this in the notebook, but to have a more informed opinion, we’ll have to wait until <code>datools.diff</code> supports <code>max_order &gt; 1</code>.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here?</h2>
<p>Before we go off and celebrate the replication of the Scorpion paper’s findings with the DIFF paper’s algorithm, you should know that it’s not all roses. Luckily, I’m just as excited about improving <code>datools.diff</code> as I was when I first wrote it, so consider the list below to be both limitations of the current version and a roadmap for the library. If you’re curious, <a href="https://github.com/marcua/datools/projects/1">this project board</a> tracks the things I’m working on most actively.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Make <code>diff</code> work on more than just SQLite</strong>. <code>diff</code> generates SQL, and I’d love for that SQL to run on any database. This is largely a matter of improving the test harness to provision other databases and fixing whatever breaks. The next few databases I’m targeting are DuckDB, Postgres, and Redshift, but if you’re interested in collaborating on something else, I’d love to help.</li>
  <li><strong>Support <code>max_order &gt; 1</code></strong>. One of the DIFF paper’s contributions is in how to spar with the combinatorial explosion you encounter in looking for multi-column explanations. I’d love to support at least 2- or 3-column explanations.</li>
  <li><strong>Use <code>diff</code> on more datasets</strong>. If you’ve got a dataset (especially a public one) you’re hoping to try this on, let me know!</li>
  <li><strong>Replicate <code>diff</code> on Scorpion’s analysis after implementing higher-order explanations</strong>. The full Jupyter Notebook shows that <code>diff</code> can’t yet replicate Scorpion’s results when we ask it to consider more columns than <code>moteid</code>. The notebook offers explanations ranging from “DIFF and Scorpion are different algorithms and have different tradeoffs” to “Why are we considering an output measure as an explanation?” I think it’s worth revisiting this after implementing <code>max_order &gt; 1</code>, so that we can see how <code>datools.diff</code> handles more complex explanations.</li>
  <li><strong>Share more about <code>datools</code></strong>. <code>diff</code> is part of the <code>datools</code> package, but I haven’t told you much about <code>datools</code>. Countless words have been spilled about how SQL, despite being here to stay, also has its rough edges. <code>datools</code> smooths some of these rough edges out<sup id="fnref:datools-example" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:datools-example" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ewu/">Eugene Wu</a> not only introduced me to the concept of explanation algorithms, but also patiently guided me through starts and stops as I tried to implement various papers. <a href="http://www.bailis.org/">Peter Bailis</a> not only showed that the need for explanation algorithms is felt broadly, but also supportively contextualized DIFF relative to even more recent state-of-the-art solutions. I’m grateful to both of them for their feedback.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
      <article role="main">
        <p>Disclaimer: I work at Microsoft but not on Windows or Edge. I also don’t have
a full understanding about Web Environment Integrity, but am basing this off
what I understand. This article states my opinions, as opposed to that of my
employer.</p>
<p>If you haven’t been under a rock, you may have heard about Google’s evil
<a href="https://stackdiary.com/web-environment-integrity/">Web Environment Integrity</a>
“proposal”. Supposedly, this is to make sure a browser environemnt can be
“trusted”, but it seems Google wants this so they can kill ad blockers.</p>
<p>This looks a lot like Microsoft’s ill-fated “Palladium” they wanted to ship
with Vista. Palladium was an attempt to improve Windows security by adding
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc723472.aspx">attestation and integrity</a>,
but could also be abused to enforce DRM everywhere on your PC, block competing
but “untrusted” applications such as Firefox. The only saving grace was Vista’s
very painful and long development period where
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/whatever-happened-to-microsofts-drm-plan/">Palladium was eventually killed</a>
so Vista could actually ship.</p>
<p>Palladium was renamed “Next-Generation Secure Computing Base” but it’s easier
to call it by the former name so I’ll just use that. Also, some features such
as BitLocker, UEFI Secure Boot (Windows 8), and TPM requirements (Windows 11)
did make their way, but they can be disabled or bypassed.</p>
<p>While I was only a young child during the development of Windows Vista, I am
pretty good at reading up on tech history.</p>
<p>Going back, Google takes
<a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md">“inspiration”</a>
from their infamous Play Integrity API (also known as
SafetyNet) used on Android, which is often used to block rooted phones from
using certain apps such as Netflix, Google Pay, and banking apps.</p>
<p>Well, guess what? People who root their devices and use custom ROMs like
LineageOS (myself included) nowadays hide root from bad apps and can pass these
checks anyways. I use Google Pay all the time on my OnePlus 11 running an
unofficial LineageOS build, thanks to root hiding. Does Google not realize how
commonly bypassed Play Integrity is? In fact, it is easy even on Google’s very
own Pixel devices, as someone who previously used multiple generations of Pixel
devices, including the Pixel 7.</p>
<p>Unless you can only use an official signed Google Chrome binary, what’s
stopping people from modifying Chromium and faking these checks? Unless that’s
the strategy.</p>
<p>Even on the web today, there are bad actors like Chase Bank who claims to
<a href="https://www.chase.com/digital/resources/privacy-security/security/system-requirements">“require” only Windows or Mac</a>
(like it’s still 2003)
and uses this as justification to block BSD and Linux-on-ARM without user agent
switchers. The only reason why this isn’t in the media is because Chase allows
Linux-on-x86 and Chrome OS, due to both having &gt;2-3% market share each. In fact,
I can log into Chase.com on my Fedora laptop fine without modifications.</p>
<p>If Chase was equipped with Web Environment Integrity, they could impose the
worst of the early 2000s web on their customers, maybe only making “exceptions”
for Chromebooks and common Linux distros to avoid the obvious uproar. Or worse,
Chase could mandate your PC has Secure Boot and no ad blocker in order to pay
your credit card or mortgage. And not just Chase, but any bank. It would be
even worse for certain fintechs which require their app for customer service
and bill payments: look at the X1 credit card.</p>
<p>In many ways, if we get Web Environment Integrity, we’ll need every government
to regulate Google, Apple, Microsoft, and adtech in every way possible, and
also add unbundling requirements so any browser can attest as long as it’s not
obvious malware.</p>
<p>After all, going back to the Windows 8 era, UEFI Secure Boot couldn’t lock out
Linux since we put pressure on Microsoft to sign Linux distros. There was also
an antitrust fear if desktop Linux went extinct, which helped. We could force
Google to bless small browsers like Vivaldi and Tor Browser the same way.</p>
<p>Better off Web Environment Integrity API becomes Palladium and dies in a
long-abandoned Chromium branch. After all, Windows Longhorn pre-reset, compete
with Palladium probably still exists in source, but is full of cobwebs rotting
away on some long-forgotten-about Azure DevOps server.</p>
<p>It’s not impossible to win this fight, we won the fight against Palladium, even
with a well-resourced Microsoft combined with the PC industry, if not the NSA
and MPAA. If we fight hard, we can win against Google’s anti-user Web Integrity
attempts also.</p>
<p>So, get the EFF and FSF involved: we need to be loud.</p>

                                      <p>Japan experienced the largest drop in the number of citizens last year, with all 47 prefectures seeing declines for the first time. The number of non-Japanese residents, however, surged to a record high, stemming some of the population loss, according to government data released on Wednesday.</p><p>New data from the internal affairs ministry revealed that the population of Japanese nationals stood at around 122.42 million as of Jan. 1, a decrease of over 800,000 compared to a year prior and the 14th straight year-on-year drop.</p><p>Yu Korekawa, director of the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research (IPSS), said he is not surprised about the continued decrease, but noted it is critical to pay attention to the rise of Japan’s foreign population.</p>

<p dir="auto">Chidori is a reactive runtime for building AI agents. It provides a framework for building AI agents that are reactive, observable, and robust. It supports building agents with Node.js, Python, and Rust.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is currently in alpha, and is not yet ready for production use. We are continuing to make significant changes in response to feedback.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Built from the ground up for constructing agents</li>
<li>Runtime written in Rust supporting Python and Node.js out of the box</li>
<li>Build agents that actually work :emoji:</li>
<li>LLM caching to minimize cost during development</li>
<li>Optimized for long-running AI workflows</li>
<li>Embedded code interpreter</li>
<li>Time travel debugging</li>

<p dir="auto">In the table below are examples for Node.js, Python and Rust. You'll need to scroll horizontally to view each.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following examples show how to build a simple agent that fetches the top stories from Hacker News and call
the OpenAI API to filter to AI related launches and then format that data into markdown. Results from the example
are pushed into the Chidori database and can be visualized using the prompt-graph-ui project. We'll update this example
with a pattern that makes those results more accessible soon.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Reactive Runtime</h3>
<p dir="auto">At its core, Chidori brings a reactive runtime that orchestrates interactions between different agents and their components. The runtime is comprised of "nodes", which react to system changes they subscribe to, providing dynamic and responsive behavior in your AI systems.
Nodes can encompass code, prompts, vector databases, custom code, services, or even complete systems.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Monitoring and Observability</h3>
<p dir="auto">Chidori ensures comprehensive monitoring and observability of your agents. We record all the inputs and outputs emitted by nodes, enabling us to explain precisely what led to what, enhancing your debugging experience and understanding of the system’s production behavior.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Branching and Time-Travel</h3>
<p dir="auto">With Chidori, you can take snapshots of your system and explore different possible outcomes from that point (branching), or rewind the system to a previous state (time-travel). This functionality improves error handling, debugging, and system robustness by offering alternative pathways and do-overs.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Code Interpreter Environments</h3>
<p dir="auto">Chidori comes with first-class support for code interpreter environments like <a href="https://deno.land/" rel="nofollow">Deno</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark/blob/master/spec.md">Starlark</a>. You can execute code directly within your system, providing quick startup, ease of use, and secure execution. We're continually working on additional safeguards against running untrusted code, with containerized nodes support coming soon.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is an early open source release and we're looking for collaborators from the community.
A good place to start would be to join our <a href="https://discord.gg/CJwKsPSgew" rel="nofollow">discord</a>!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Another AI Framework?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Chidori focuses on the specifics of how LLM+code execution operates rather than providing specific compositions of prompts. Other frameworks haven’t focused on this space, and it's an important one. We reduce accidental complexity in building systems for long-running agents; this helps developers build successful systems.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Chidori?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Chidori is the name of the lightning blade technique used by Kakashi in the Naruto anime series.
It also happens to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chidori" rel="nofollow">mean Thousand Birds in Japanese</a>, which is a nice coincidence.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Well then why Thousand Birds?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Thousand Birds is a reference to flocks of birds (or a murmuration) and the emergent behavior that arises from their interactions.
We think this is a good metaphor for the behavior of long running agents, the internal units of LLM execution within them, and the emergent behavior that arises from their interactions.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Rust?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Rust is a great language for building systems, we like the type system and the guarantees provided by it.
We also like the performance characteristics of Rust, and the ability to build a single binary that can be deployed anywhere.
The Rust ecosystem makes it fairly easy to provide bindings to other languages, which is important for us to provide a good developer experience.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Inspiration</h2>
<p dir="auto">Our framework is inspired by the work of many others, including:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://temporal.io/" rel="nofollow">Temporal.io</a> - providing reliability and durability to workflows</li>
<li><a href="http://witheve.com/" rel="nofollow">Eve</a> - developing patterns for building reactive systems and reducing accidental complexity</li>

<p><time datetime="2023-04-25">April 25, 2023</time></p>
</header>
<p>I've <a href="https://log.schemescape.com/posts/programming-languages/future-proof-languages.html">spent</a> <a href="https://log.schemescape.com/posts/programming-languages/future-proof-languages-2.html">some</a> <a href="https://log.schemescape.com/posts/programming-languages/future-proof-languages-3.html">time</a> contemplating future-proof programming languages because I want to enusre that code I write will be usable in the future. Generally, if I want to build something and share it with others, I'm a pragmatist, so I'll <del>use JavaScript</del> choose a programming language that is popular, portable, and convenient.</p>
<p>But <em>other times</em>, I just want to have fun and experiment with other programming languages and tools. In that vein, I've been monitoring a few single-syllable, intriguing-but-maybe-not-future-proof programming languages such as <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a> and <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>. Sometimes these experiments open my eyes to new ways of programming or new tools that eventually become indispensible.</p>
<h2 id="janet">Janet</h2>
<p>Very recently, I ran across a newly-published (free) book about the <a href="https://janet-lang.org/">Janet</a> programming language called <a href="https://janet.guide/">Janet for Mortals</a> and it piqued my interest. Janet is a relatively small Lisp/Clojure-inspired scripting language that tries to fill a similar niche to Lua, but with an actual standard library (and, of course, Lisp-style metaprogramming and compile-time execution via macros).</p>
<p><strong>Janet for Mortals</strong> is an entertaining and informative read, and it gave me the nudge I needed to become interested in Lisps again. I had previously abandoned using Scheme because, frankly, I ran out of free time for exploratory programming. But while I was reading about Janet, I kept coming back to one question: why should I use Janet instead of an established Lisp, e.g. Scheme?</p>
<p>For me, the most attractive qualities of Janet (other than general Lispiness) are portability, embeddability, and <a href="https://janet-lang.org/docs/peg.html">Parsing Expression Grammars</a>. Realistically, however, I don't currently have any need to embed a language, so that leaves portability and parsing. As far as portability, <a href="http://www.call-cc.org/">CHICKEN Scheme</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/clisp/">CLISP</a>, and <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">Steel Bank Common Lisp</a> looked acceptable. For parsing, <a href="https://bford.info/packrat/">Packrat</a> looked reasonable.</p>
<p>At this point, I started to run out of reasons to pursue Janet instead of an established Lisp.</p>
<h2 id="common-lisp">Common Lisp</h2>
<p>During my research, I ran across a <a href="https://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2020-12-18-repl-driven/">blog post describing Common Lisp's (mostly) unique REPL-driven workflow</a>. In that post, the author describes handling a runtime error by just fixing the broken code--in-place, without any restarts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try this in your favorite repl:</p>
<p>Define a function, foo, that calls some other function, bar, that is not yet defined. Now call foo. What happens?</p>
<p>Obviously, the call to foo breaks, because bar is not defined. But what happens when it breaks?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The answer to that question is the differentiating point of repl-driven programming. In an old-fashioned Lisp or Smalltalk environment, the break in foo drops you into a breakloop.</p>
<p>A breakloop is a full-featured repl, complete with all of the tools of the main repl, but it exists inside the dynamic environment of the broken function. From the breakloop you can roam up and down the suspended call stack, examining all variables that are lexically visible from each stack frame. In fact, you can inspect all live data in the running program.</p>
<p>What's more, you can edit all live data in the program. If you think that a break was caused by a wrong value in some particular variable or field, you can interactively change it and resume the suspended function.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Moreover, because the entire language and development system are available, unrestricted, in the repl, you can define the missing function bar, resume foo, and get a sensible result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've seen various (often unreliable) "edit and continue" features over the years, but I didn't realize that Common Lisp was built with this sort of workflow in mind.</p>
<p>When I first learned to program, I used "printf debugging", where I'd temporarily add in code to log values, recompile, run, and inspect the output to troubleshoot problems. Eventually, I ran into scenarios where I couldn't modify the program or rerun it, so I learned to use a debugger. Using a real debugger is definitely the right thing to do, but setting up a debugging environment is often painful (and sometimes impossible).</p>
<p>Common Lisp seems to take debugging a step further. Sure, I've modified memory in a debugger to test out potential fixes, but being able to rewrite code and patch into a live process <em>in a sane way</em> sounds amazing--almost too good to be true.</p>
<p>That new workflow is my motivation for learning Common Lisp. I want to try interactively building a program to see if it's a pleasant way to work.</p>
<p>Is it a good idea to learn a new programming language and standard library just to explore a new workflow? Maybe not, but I'm not sure there's a great alternative. I'm sure similar REPL-editor integrations exist in other languages, but I also suspect that they're buggier because they've been bolted on, rather than supported from the beginning. Additionally, if I put in the work and am not satisfied with the workflow after all, I can rest assured that I gave it the best possible chance, using standard tools.</p>
<p>Regardless, it should be an interesting adventure!</p>

Hi,

I noticed that the remote for the Exway Flex has a missing resistor on the USB-C port. This makes it so that it will not charge with a type-C to C cable. Is this problem fixed with newer revisions of the remote?

Hi Exway,

I think you misunderstood my question. My remote does indeed have a USB-C port. However, it is missing the proper resistor that tells the connected type-C cable that it draws power. As a result the remote does not charge with a type-C-to-C cable.

My question was, whether or not this is fixed in newer revisions of the remote. 

Thanks,
Eric

Hi Exway,

Thank you for the confirmation. Is a fix planned in future revisions? Because the device violates USB-C specifications by not charging with C-to-C cables.

Hi Leo,

Yes, I understand that a firmware update will not resolve this issue, as it is a hardware problem.

However, for future revisions of this remote, this problem should be fixed, as USB-C spec conformity is very important for all devices shipping with a type-C port. I hope that this is forwarded over to the engineers so that they can incorporate it in future remote revisions. In fact, devices that do not meet this spec can be determined as defective in some jurisdictions.

Thanks,
Eric

Hi Eric,

I have reported your request and I referred this to the tech team, but I  got a negative answer, sorry about that

Specifically, unlike USB-A ports that give out 5 volts of power by default, USB-C requires a negotiation process before it’ll start handing out power. You may have heard about this on branding material of USB-C chargers: USB-PD, or USB Power Delivery, is the spec that devices must adhere to.</p><p>But PD negotiation chips are expensive, when compared to the overall price of the device. The electric skateboard remote in question probably costs five dollars or so to make. (In reality, it’s probably much less than that, if you mass-manufacture it.) Having a chip that costs half a dollar takes up a ton of the budget in the BoM (bill-of-materials).</p><p>But obviously, the USB-IF board thought of that, and they provide guidance on how devices should behave (or in this case, identify themselves) if they just want 5V of power, no power delivery negotiation required.</p><p>This is done by pulling down the CC pins to ground with 5.1K resistors. (Because there are two CC pins –&nbsp;CC1 and CC2 - you need two of them.) Failure to do so means that with a type-C-to-C cable and charger won’t work with said device – the charger will check the CC lines over the type-C cable, find it “floating” (as in, not pulled down with a resistor), and not send over the required 5V. (And if your device shipped with one resistor, <a href="https://medium.com/@leung.benson/how-to-design-a-proper-usb-c-power-sink-hint-not-the-way-raspberry-pi-4-did-it-f470d7a5910">or shares a resistor for the two CC pins</a> (ugh Raspberry Pi Foundation!!!), then it can lead to all sorts of wonky behavior, like the device refusing to charge if the cable is plugged in one way and charging normally when the port is flipped.)</p><p>In this case, Exway didn’t put in the required two resistors on the CC pins of the remote, and as a result it won’t charge with USB-C-to-C cables.</p><h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2><p>I know what you’re thinking. “Just charge it with a USB-A to C cable! What’s the big deal here?”</p><p>Sure, you can charge the remote with this workaround. But let’s look at the bigger picture.</p><p>These resistors cost <del>pennies</del> <a href="https://github.com/ericswpark/ericswpark.github.io-comments/issues/3#issuecomment-1652743946">a fraction of a penny</a> (thanks @rickcox on GitHub!) to include. And the instructions on how to do that is a simple Google search away. In fact, if you’re a competent electrical engineer designing circuits, you know your first job is to read the specifications before implementing them on your device.</p><p>Which means one of the following is true:</p><ul><li>Exway hired incompetent engineers that do a poor job, or</li><li>The engineers warned that the port did not follow specifications, but Exway decided not to fix it to save money, or</li><li>The engineering team at Exway made a geniune mistake and forgot to include the resistors, or didn’t know about this particular specification (I mean, the USB-C spec is really long, and probably very complicated thanks to the USB-IF committee).</li></ul><p>But I don’t think the third one is likely. Nobody caught the problem while testing this product during development? Nobody used a type-C-to-C cable to charge the remote while using engineering samples? No, it is borderline impossible for Exway to not be aware of this problem, <em>unless</em> they don’t do any sort of testing, which again I find hard to believe. (And if they don’t test their products, that’s even more horrifying.)</p><p>And now we know they’re aware of it, but they don’t care. They don’t plan to fix the problem, even when they’re made aware of it.</p><p>If they’re willing to cut corners on stuff like <em>this</em>, do you really want to risk your life and ride a electric skateboard from them, equipped with their battery? Even if we give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they did everything possible in regards to safety, I don’t think they would be very receptive to a fix if the battery spontaneously combusted, especially given the response above.</p><h2 id="so-what-can-i-do">So what can I do?</h2><p><strong>If you have an Exway board that is affected by this problem</strong>, then contact Exway and let them know that this is unacceptable. The product is defective by design, and they need to fix it.</p><p>Also, consider discontinuing the use of their skateboards.</p><p><strong>If you were considering purchasing an electric skateboard</strong>, consider alternative brands.</p><p>But most importantly, it’s important to spread the word and let manufacturers know that <strong>not conforming to USB-C spec in 2023 is absolutely unacceptable.</strong> Countless forum posts have been made about this exact issue, and there’s even a subreddit called r/USBCHardware that has constant threads on defective products like these. Help people that might not understand why their device won’t charge with certain cables by not letting these companies get away with bad design.</p><h2 id="links">Links</h2><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Exway/comments/15a5myg/exway_doesnt_care_about_usbc_conformity/">Discussion on r/Exway</a></p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/15a5o3f/oc_exway_doesnt_care_about_usbc_conformity/?">Discussion on r/USBCHardware</a></p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36886859">Discussion on Hacker News</a></p><h3>Related Posts</h3><ul><li><a href="https://ericswpark.com/blog/2021/2021-01-11-msi-laptop-usb-c-charger-design-problem/">MSI laptop USB-C charger design problem</a></li></ul></div></main></div></div>]]></description>

When you run either application using <code>jupyter lab</code> or <code>jupyter notebook</code>, we automatically detect if the other application is installed and enable its user experience as well. This is possible as both JupyterLab and Notebook use the same underlying server and extension system. From a user experience perspective, this allows you to easily open a notebook in the other application using the “JupyterLab” and “Notebook” buttons as the top of each notebook. This makes it seamless to move back and forth between the two applications to best match your work.</p><h2 id="f9b0">More features</h2><p id="9f90">You can find a list of the new features in the <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook_7_features.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebook documentation</a>.</p><h2 id="f290">Why a new version?</h2><p id="736c">Following feedback from the community, we decided in late 2021 to continue developing the Jupyter Notebook application and sunrise it as Notebook 7.</p><p id="40af">The major change is building the Jupyter Notebook 7 interface with JupyterLab components so that the two applications share a common codebase and extension system. We have worked hard to ensure that the experience users know and love from Jupyter Notebook 6 is preserved, even as we have added many new features to Notebook 7. Let’s dive into those new features!</p><p id="2c68">You can find more details about the rationale behind this new release in <a href="https://jupyter.org/enhancement-proposals/79-notebook-v7/notebook-v7.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Jupyter Enhancement Proposal 79</a>.</p><h2 id="a0b4">Migrating to Notebook 7</h2><p id="cf4f">The Jupyter Notebook Team has been working to make the transition from Notebook 6 to Notebook 7 as smooth as possible. The Notebook 7 release is a good opportunity to try out the new features and report any issues you may encounter.</p><p id="aa07">Because the architecture of Notebook 7 is rebuilt from the ground up, we recognize that some existing users might need a medium-term option for backward-compatibility with Notebook 6 using <a href="https://nbclassic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbclassic.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">NbClassic</a>, which delivers the same user experience and can be run on the same server as JupyterLab and Notebook 7. This means that the server hosting your Notebook can deliver those 3 difference user interfaces at the same time.</p><p id="15e8">There is also a <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrate_to_notebook7.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">migration guide</a> to help you upgrade to the new version.</p><h2 id="f43d">Try it on Binder</h2><p id="2dd0">You can try Notebook 7 on Binder using <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gist/jtpio/d368ab89cee5123ecee60683115e15f3/master?urlpath=%2Ftree" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p><h2 id="274b">Acknowledgements</h2><p id="41a6">The work on Notebook 7 by Jeremy Tuloup was supported by <a href="https://twitter.com/QuantStack/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">QuantStack</a>.</p><p id="7dac"><a href="https://anaconda.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Anaconda</a> supported work on Notebook 6 and 7, NbClassic, documentation and maintenance.</p><h2 id="7e54">Get Involved</h2><p id="20f4">There are many ways you can participate in the Notebook 7 effort.

I was unable to find a clean, cheap hotel in the centre of town. My only option was to download an app by Sonder, which offered affordable Airbnb-style apartments with kitchens (thus saving me money on food). I handed over my debit card details to this San Francisco-based hospitality company and received a code with instructions to a room in a faceless building. I would not meet another human during my stay.</p><p>This atomisation, and the reliance on tech for our most basic human needs, unnerved me. It became a leitmotif during my trip, and also spoke to something I saw repeatedly: the exclusion of those without smartphones or credit cards.

My 20-minute stopover in Columbus was where a picture began to form of what Greyhound travel looks like today. The bus station consisted of a parking garage the size of a small airplane hangar. At both ends, electric doors opened and closed when a bus entered or exited. Between the two bus lanes sat a small concrete island where passengers were disgorged. There was a chemical toilet, no drinking fountain, very few seats and no windows. The air was choked with exhaust. A police van was parked at one end of the tunnel and armed policemen stood against a wall facing us.</p><figure id="1cf52802-8cc9-441a-8247-d187cd13aa00" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529423c8efb41c7ee9aeaa4d4e2361f7e0d10622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529423c8efb41c7ee9aeaa4d4e2361f7e0d10622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529423c8efb41c7ee9aeaa4d4e2361f7e0d10622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529423c8efb41c7ee9aeaa4d4e2361f7e0d10622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529423c8efb41c7ee9aeaa4d4e2361f7e0d10622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529423c8efb41c7ee9aeaa4d4e2361f7e0d10622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="colourful building in a parking lot" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529423c8efb41c7ee9aeaa4d4e2361f7e0d10622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="445" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Jefferson Avenue, in Detroit.</span> Photograph: Joanna Pocock</figcaption></figure><p>If you had commissioned an urban planner to design the most hostile, uncomfortable and unhealthy environment for passengers, this would be the result. I guess this is what you get when you travel in a seat costing $35 as opposed to a $200 plane ticket or in a car with a full tank of gas.</p><p>My next bus was scheduled to leave for St Louis – a mere 530-mile trip – at 3.00pm. I looked around at my fellow island-dwellers: an elderly man with four large zip-up bags printed with “Patient Belongings”; a couple travelling with a large fluffy blanket propped up against the Porta-Potti as a makeshift bed; a mother and her teenage son carrying large cardboard boxes. The sign on the empty Greyhound kiosk read: “As of 25 January 2023 – you will need photo ID to buy tickets.” Yet another barrier between those with little money, no fixed address, no car, no passport or credit card and their ability to travel.</p><p>Five pm and still no bus. Another passenger, a university student from India, had been checking his app, which showed that the bus had been and gone. How could we have missed it when we hadn’t left our island? Ruben, a young Amish man, approached. I gave him my phone so he could tell his family he would be late. A one-handed man asked us if we knew what was going on. We didn’t, so he told us his story: he had lost his wife and daughter recently and had just emerged from a 14-month coma – the result of being electrocuted at work, which also saw his hand melt. Like so many of the people I met on the road he had suffered extreme anguish, but had found God. “I am now never alone,” he told me.</p><figure id="0980333a-f67b-43ef-ae55-1d1c833c43db" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372dfeb2bb495dbab5d8875e44963c5102c05a36/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372dfeb2bb495dbab5d8875e44963c5102c05a36/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372dfeb2bb495dbab5d8875e44963c5102c05a36/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372dfeb2bb495dbab5d8875e44963c5102c05a36/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372dfeb2bb495dbab5d8875e44963c5102c05a36/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372dfeb2bb495dbab5d8875e44963c5102c05a36/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="concrete hangar" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372dfeb2bb495dbab5d8875e44963c5102c05a36/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="445" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>The station in Columbus, Ohio.</span> Photograph: Joanna Pocock</figcaption></figure><p>The four of us were discussing tactics when a Greyhound employee showed up.

Apparently, its faulty hold had opened and bags had scattered along the highway – or so the story went. You never quite know on a Greyhound. The rides can take on a mythical dimension. Our driver had never done the Columbus–St Louis route before and we wound our way through unlit back roads until a marine on board snapped and ordered her to use his GPS.</p><p>At Indianapolis, the driver – shaken and angry – quit.

Several buses had been cancelled and the station was heaving. The vibe was nervy and angry. Miraculously, a coffee counter was open. In most stations, the diners are closed and the vending machines border on empty. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese as a skinny man with eyes the size of silver dollars started yelling about a lost cellphone which had his ticket on it.</p><figure id="be37f2c2-7dd4-464c-994c-754485ef663d" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7535b782b18b27d61c01d56971aab75c4a9b25a8/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7535b782b18b27d61c01d56971aab75c4a9b25a8/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7535b782b18b27d61c01d56971aab75c4a9b25a8/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7535b782b18b27d61c01d56971aab75c4a9b25a8/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7535b782b18b27d61c01d56971aab75c4a9b25a8/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7535b782b18b27d61c01d56971aab75c4a9b25a8/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="At the Louisville station." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7535b782b18b27d61c01d56971aab75c4a9b25a8/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="445" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>At the Louisville station.</span> Photograph: Joanna Pocock</figcaption></figure><p>The security guard, a tall trans woman with bright nail polish, calmly walked over to him. The guy next to me at the coffee counter nudged my arm and pointed: “Her revolver is the same as my grandad’s,” he laughed. “It’s old. Probably doesn’t even work.” The man was now pounding the wall while the security guard kept one hand on her holster.</p><p>We could relate to the screaming man – somewhat. “The problem is, it’s all digital now. They just look at their computer,” the guy said, miming someone typing officiously on a keyboard. “‘Sorry I can’t help you,’ they say if it’s not right there on their screen. Nobody cares.”</p><p>The combination of cancelled buses, a customer care phone line that is impossible to penetrate, an online system that can’t track bus routes accurately, and exasperated and unsupported Greyhound staff leads to desperation for travellers. Even for those with smartphones who can download the app, the information on it is often wrong.</p><hr><p>From St Louis to Albuquerque, I had over 1,000 miles to cover. I had planned to read, but none of the overhead lights worked. Many of the buses are slowly falling apart.</p><p>The company has been struggling for a while thanks to cheap flights and a pandemic which reframed close quarters with strangers as a potential death trap. Greyhound was bought in 2021 by the German-owned FlixBus. They don’t own the physical stations, however, and are fast becoming another Uber-style company, connecting consumers online with a service. One of my bus stops consisted of coordinates along a four-lane road.</p><figure id="6a049141-13ff-4af7-ba24-04eae08d6dca" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:29,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/31/vanlife-nomad-living-us-families&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;They changed everything and adopted #vanlife.

In the early 1960s, Greyhound buses were used by the Congress of Racial Equality for their Freedom Rides. Members rode through the south to ensure stations were complying with the US supreme court rulings to allow Black and white people to mix – sometimes leading to violence against the freedom riders.</p><p>None of this oppression is touched upon in the literature of the Great American Road Trip, because in your car you are removed from the communal, from the people who, behind the scenes, are keeping much of the country going: the cleaners, care workers, manual labourers and those doing necessary work – with little fanfare and often for very little money.</p><hr><p><span><span>A</span></span>s you approach Albuquerque, just beyond the 100th longitudinal meridian – the dividing line between east and west – the light changes, the horizon retreats, the emerald greens turn minty, and your heart opens a little. At the Texas panhandle, the ground takes on a deep red hue, and by the time you reach New Mexico, the colours have become psychedelic. You’ve arrived in the west.</p><p>My hotel in Albuquerque was an Econo Lodge on Central Avenue (AKA Route 66), tucked under the I-25. A five-minute walk from my front door was what I took to be an abandoned motel. As I took some photos, a guy in a pickup rolled up. “Are you looking for Jesse?” he asked. Not being a Breaking Bad fan, I didn’t get the connection. Pickup guy was the owner of the Crossroads Motel. “This is where Jesse stayed,” he said. If buildings could be method actors, the Crossroads would win an Oscar, with the glowing pink Sandia Mountains and golden light in supporting roles. As with most of my stops, I only allowed myself a night in Albuquerque, but I had wished for more. I never like leaving New Mexico. Simone de Beauvoir called it the “Land of Dreams”, a place that made her “muse about the mysterious marriage binding our species to this planet”.</p><p>The only direct Greyhound bus you can book from Albuquerque to Vegas takes a minimum of 21 hours and does a bizarre route via San Bernardino. This is where you have to get creative. I worked out that if I went to Phoenix and changed there, I could do the trip in less than 18 hours.</p><figure id="438d5075-b277-4524-8667-ae529d56180e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aae61b2de41d5c8c7776a9f5161f31267a43622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aae61b2de41d5c8c7776a9f5161f31267a43622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aae61b2de41d5c8c7776a9f5161f31267a43622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aae61b2de41d5c8c7776a9f5161f31267a43622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aae61b2de41d5c8c7776a9f5161f31267a43622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aae61b2de41d5c8c7776a9f5161f31267a43622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="colourful painted wall in a restaurant" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aae61b2de41d5c8c7776a9f5161f31267a43622/0_0_3024_3024/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="445" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A restaurant in Amarillo, Texas.</span> Photograph: Joanna Pocock</figcaption></figure><p>I decided to walk to Albuquerque’s bus station early as I was tired of lugging my backpack around. A city bus honked and pulled up next to me. The driver motioned for me to get on rather than walk alone in the dark. What I didn’t know was that Greyhound stations now often close between buses to keep homeless people out – yet another communal space closed to those without the money to access private spaces. Dozens sat on the steps of the station shivering; some were lying in the foetal position; others hopped from foot to foot like their feet were on fire. I gave what food I had to anyone who wanted it, but I still had an hour before my bus.</p><p>I remembered Beauvoir’s descriptions of bus stations with restaurants, juke boxes, showers and lockers she compares to columbariums. Columbariums! I walked to a cafe where I very slowly nursed a cup of chamomile tea as part of my near-dehydration diet which had managed so far to keep me from having to use a bathroom on the bus.</p><hr><p><span><span>I</span></span> was arriving in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/las-vegas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Las Vegas</a> on a Thursday, when the prices rise, so I booked the cheapest off-Strip motel I could find. As the bus approached town, I decided to read the reviews: “Filthy hotel … Wish I would have read reviews before I went to this dump.” Stained sheets and gunshots were mentioned. I panicked and texted a writer friend in Vegas who told me about the HotelTonight app. Once again, I succumbed to the appification of travel, which saw me bag a room at the Tropicana for $50 – far less than the price of my now-cancelled room at the Wyndham Super 8.</p><p>In 2021, Vegas’s Greyhound station at the Plaza Hotel moved 10 miles south of the city’s downtown. With its xeriscaped native plants, the building is a glass and steel model of a functional civic space – albeit one removed from the centre of the city. After two nights in Vegas, I filed on to the Los Angeles-bound bus for the final leg of my trip, and watched a ticketless young woman with very swollen ankles beg the driver to take her out of town. We pulled away, leaving her crying quietly on a bench. The city disappeared behind concrete highways, eventually giving way to a vast desert draped in a strawberry-coloured dawn.</p><hr><p><span><span>W</span></span>hen Beauvoir first arrived in the US, she wrote about seeing “all of America on the horizon. As for me, I no longer exist. There. I understand what I’ve come to find – this plenitude that we rarely feel except in childhood or in early youth, when we’re utterly absorbed by something outside ourselves … in a flash I’m free from the cares of that tedious enterprise I call my life.”</p><figure id="5f08a276-92a3-4980-8c26-57638daeb3ed" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:44,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/may/22/olivia-travel-lesbian-cruise&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘I stood there with my mouth open.

That sense of escaping the enterprise we call “our life” – that is the pull. Although, for many, their journey <em>is</em> their life. What I found on this trip was a changed landscape: gone are the small, clean, cheap motels in the centre of cities, gone are public spaces where anyone can find a water fountain, a bathroom, a place to nurse a cheap cup of coffee and human company. And yet the camaraderie on the Greyhound is just about hanging on – but I wonder for how long?</p><p>When you find yourself gazing at the horizon as the sun rises, each little sage bush with its purple shadow stretching into a seemingly infinite sandy blur, a quiet descends. Everyone feels the power of these landscapes. Maybe that’s what’s unique about road tripping by Greyhound. There are other places we think we’d rather be, but here we are in the moment, trundling along all of us together looking out at the same earth, breathing the same air, all of us knowing deep down that where we are really is where we’d like to be.</p><p>There is no app for this feeling and, thankfully, there never will be.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://val.packett.cool/blog/tiddlypwa/">https://val.packett.cool/blog/tiddlypwa/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36885753">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Oops, I think I just turned the legendary personal wiki system into an offline-first, installable, encrypted, synchronized Progressive Web App</p><div>
		<p><em>tl;dr: go play with the new thing <a href="https://tiddly.packett.cool/">there</a>, report issues <a href="https://codeberg.org/valpackett/tiddlypwa/issues">there</a> and support me <a href="https://www.patreon.com/valpackett">there</a> :3 but please do read the full story below!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> is quite a famous note-taking system.
Describing itself as “a non-linear personal web notebook”, it’s actually quite a bit more than that.
Thanks to a plugin system, it’s basically an app platform, and plenty of <a href="https://thaddeusjiang.github.io/Projectify/">cool stuff</a> has been made for it.</p>
<p>And it exists as a unique thing: a self-contained web application—a single HTML file with both the app and the content—that you can take around on a USB flash drive.
Oh wait… who even uses those anymore for anything other than OS installers and bringing files to a print shop?</p>
<p>So of course, a bunch of storage solutions have sprung up.
There’s an official node.js based server mode where it becomes more like a traditional web app,
there are browser extensions and even modules inside of TW itself for saving the updated single file to a server,
there are mobile and desktop apps that try to combine that saving with some kind of offline support,
there are people using a file sync solution like Syncthing – I’ve even heard of some people using Syncthing with the server version,
syncing the <code>.tid</code> files between devices and <em>running the server in <a href="https://termux.dev/en/">Termux</a> on their phones</em> to access them on mobile.
Oof. While I’m nerdy enough to <em>be able</em> to do that, I’m also enough of a spoiled basic consumer to know that that’s not the user experience <em>I want</em>.</p>
<p>What I want is something that works like <em>an app</em>. Fully working offline, syncing <em>efficiently</em> (not by POSTing a multi-megabyte HTML file), quickly and reliably when online.
And with client-side encryption, because there’s just <em>no reason</em> to let the server side read the contents here.</p>
<p>There has actually been one good attempt at bringing this kind of sync to TiddlyWiki: <a href="https://noteself.org/">NoteSelf</a>, which integrated <a href="https://pouchdb.com/">PouchDB</a> for storage.
I liked the sound of it, but in practice it wasn’t up to my standards.
It’s a heavyweight modification of TiddlyWiki that doesn’t keep up with latest core updates, PouchDB/CouchDB feel a bit heavy themselves, there’s no encryption, and the offline support is just “run it from your hard drive”.</p>
<p>So… this is where I come in.
Last year, looking to try TiddlyWiki once again, looking through the options and getting frustrated with the aforementioned everything, one thing inspired me.
I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/3420">a basic IndexedDB plugin</a> which made me realize that there is an API for storage backends inside TiddlyWiki.
I realized that there’s no need for core modifications, that I could just start with this and—knowing what I know about the web platform—take it to the next level.
Make a plugin that combines IndexedDB, encryption, a sync engine (with a custom super-lightweight server counterpart for it), and adds a Service Worker and a Web Manifest
to turn TW into a <a href="https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/">Progressive Web App</a> that works offline and installs on mobile with “add to home screen”.
That was a whole Vision. And I knew it had to be done. It just had to exist. So I got to work, putting aside my typical FreeBSD system-level work to get back to good old web dev.</p>
<p>Now, a whole year after that inspiring moment, having gone through huge personal life changes and a reverse putting-aside in favor of my other work again…
it’s finally ready for the public to see.</p>
<p>So.</p>

<p><a href="https://tiddly.packett.cool/">TiddlyPWA</a>.</p>
<p>It’s still rough around the edges, but I’ve put <em>a lot</em> of effort into the setup experience, hiding all the complexity of the flexibility available with how the system is structured
and presenting a very simple “happy path” where if you open the app from a sync server it’s already preconfigured to sync with that server and so on.</p>
<p>I’ve also tried to document it, though I have to say that detailing the security model was a lot easier than trying to explain the whole synchronization/server/content-versus-app thing.
Hopefully at least for those familiar with TiddlyWiki it’s not too hard to understand that there’s the “app wiki” with the core/plugins/themes and the separate encrypted content,
and that the sync server can work with both (differently).</p>
<p>Now, to justify the whole existence of this blog post, let me also list some random fun facts and whatnot – everything that didn’t fit in the documentation itself :)</p>
<h2 id="random-development-tidbits-ha" tabindex="-1"><a href="#random-development-tidbits-ha"><span>Random Development Tidbits (ha)</span></a></h2>
<p>Because of how browsers work, I’ve had to take extra care to make the storage work across multiple running tabs without corrupting anything.
Moreover, I made it all explicitly work together well and it’s kind of a hidden feature now.
Thanks to a combination of BroadcastChannels and Web Locks, you can enjoy a multi-tab experience.
Browse the same wiki simultaneously in two tabs, the navigation will be independent but any changes will be visible everywhere.</p>
<p>This whole <a href="https://codeberg.org/valpackett/argon2ian">argon2ian</a> thing you might’ve seen was indeed created for TiddlyPWA!
I’ve started out using PBKDF2 because it’s available in the Web Crypto API, but eventually decided to upgrade to a modern password hash rather than cranking out iteration counts.
I wasn’t satisfied with the state of existing Argon2 WASM+JS wrappers, so I set out to make my own, code-golfed to the tiniest size possible.
The <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9g8r2ffu4o">yak shaving stack</a> got even deeper during that subproject.
Also, I have used the very new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Compression_Streams_API">Compression Streams API</a> to be able to bundle the Wasm binary as compressed while not having to bunlde a decompressor.
And this has led to the creation of a very funny bug…</p>
<p>…so since that API was already used there I started using it to compress long-enough tiddler contents as well.
Stream APIs are kind of annoying when you don’t want to stream, so I went with the whole “a stream is an async iterator” thing.
When I first gave TiddlyPWA to an external tester I got a report of not being able to save a particular tiddler.
Turns out, that iterator thing is only available in Firefox as of right now.
I accidentally made it so that <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9gv2anuoss"><em>tiddlers longer than 240 bytes would only work in Firefox</em></a>. :D</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9gjs72259o">really funny bug</a> is something I <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1840934">bugzilled here</a> for Firefox Android.
When using <a href="https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard">FlorisBoard</a>, pressing “enter” would result in the password mask (bullet ••• characters) becoming the actual value of the input.
This is something that I have discovered while typing passwords into my TiddlyPWA password prompt!
I also ran into an <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/issues/15244">already reported</a> <code>prompt()</code> bug in Firefox on iOS.</p>
<p>The server was initially written with SQLite as it is now, but when Deno KV was announced I got excited and rewrote it to use KV, hoping to leverage Deno Deploy for an easy server hosting experience.
I quickly ran into a 64KiB limit per entry when trying to do the whole “save the HTML page” thing, but I found <a href="https://github.com/kitsonk/kv-toolbox">kv-toolbox</a>, a module that would do chunking for me.
Then, after everything was ready, already with the aforementioned other person testing it, I discovered (and <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9h1dr9g4jq">ranted about</a>) the undocumented <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/19284">10 mutations in a transaction</a> limitation.
I wasn’t about to give up on atomicity, so I just rewrote everything back to SQLite in a burst of anger and now I hold a bit of a grudge against Deno KV &gt;_&lt;
Even though I recognize that, obviously, it’s just that <em>my use case is absolutely not the intended one</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/68695508">This TypeScript thing</a> that I <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9h1fdi76dt">referenced on fedi</a> was actually for the SQLite part of the TiddlyPWA server.</p>
<p>There was a <a href="https://blahaj.zone/notes/9hlma651nz">very last minute</a> backwards-incompatible change I suddenly managed to do right before release.</p>
<h2 id="so-tiddlypwa-needs-you" tabindex="-1"><a href="#so-tiddlypwa-needs-you"><span>So, TiddlyPWA Needs YOU!</span></a></h2>
<p>I probably could’ve tried to make it as a commercial product with a centrally hosted server, but that’s not what I made.
TiddlyPWA is fully free (both “as in beer” and “as in freedom”) because I believe in software that empowers everyone to own their data <em>and the software itself</em>, that <s>is never gonna give you up</s> doesn’t die for business reasons.</p>
<p>Right now TiddlyPWA is still early in its development, still missing a lot of things, but hopefully is solid enough to make you check it out.
If you like what you see, please consider helping me continue working on it:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a rel="noopener follow" href="https://dwdraju.medium.com/?source=post_page-----1b9a340ca43d--------------------------------"><div aria-hidden="false"><p><img alt="Raju Dawadi" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*r7hrULSjglXP2M63J8Txug.png" width="44" height="44" loading="lazy"></p></div></a></div><p id="5b1f">You had things running with occasional glitches and there was always an excuse “It works in my machine” as there is rarely identical machine &amp; OS for all. So, you need a solution to avoid same excuse when code breaks. Now, someone told about a blue chip solution called “Container” which will have all dependencies packaged, works on any machine, maintains parity on dev to production environment, no conflicts at all. So stay chill !!!</p><figure></figure><p id="73ee">And you started building container images, grabbed the concept of writing Dockerfile, port mapping, package installation commands, decrease image size, follow best practices and yay its real !!!</p><figure></figure><p id="7bd8">Gradually, other developers also started using container and after sometime, you started using docker in production. Cool story !!!</p><h2 id="23a2">But … After a month …</h2><p id="74b7">People start to spend an hour daily on fixing container issue. And the voice starts raising — “<strong>It works in my container</strong>”</p><figure></figure><h2 id="8233">So, what happened?</h2><p id="4e61">Was it too early to adopt container technologies(like docker hype)? Do you need a professional before diving? Is there any issue from application or flaw in container? No ….</p><p id="7cc7"><strong>Let’s dive into why the “It works in my container” situation arises</strong></p><h2 id="576b"><strong>1. Using <em>latest</em> image tag</strong></h2><p id="935c">Yes. It’s number one thing to always keep in mind. While starting to learn we use <em>latest</em> tag of every image. But it’s like to put axe on your own foot. Consider an example:</p><pre><span id="9d76">From node:latest</span></pre><p id="4904">At the time you started to use docker, the <em>latest</em> tag was for NodeJS version let’s say 10 but after a month when someone formatted her laptop or a new guy is on-boarded, the <em>latest</em> tag is now version 12. But your application is best suite for the previous version. All of the people are using same Dockerfile but this is the reason why you are forced to say loud “It works in my container”.</p><p id="cf56">So, always use versioned tag. Use <code>ubuntu:16.04</code> or <code>node:12-alpine</code> but never <code>ubuntu:latest</code> or <code>node:alpine</code></p><h2 id="e641">2. <strong>Container engine and other environment version</strong>:</h2><p id="e214">In case of Docker, it tries to make releases with backward compatibility in concern and feature removal is communicated three releases in advance. This could be a reason if the engine is not upgraded since long time.</p><p id="bb0f">If you use Docker Compose, the changes and versioning of yml files is very important. While versioning docker-compose file, its always a good practice to specify minor release. Like, not use <code>version: “3”</code> but <code>version: "3.7"</code> because by default the prior means <code>version: "3.0"</code> and there are many updates on each release of docker-compose which is supported by the upgraded version only. It’s a way to avoid ping. <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Here</a> is the compose versioning and compatibility matrix guide.</p><h2 id="fc34">3. <strong>Dealing with variables</strong>:</h2><p id="24ad">In general, we read variables &amp; secret for applications through config file like: <code>config.json</code> or <code>.env</code> . But with docker, there are are multiple ways, that is run time and build time environment variables. A simple way to pass environment variable is:</p><pre><span id="c1a2">docker run -it -e KEY=VALUE --name nginx nginx:1.15-alpine /bin/sh -c "env | grep KEY"</span></pre><p id="945d">And through docker compose:</p><pre><span id="e8e1">web:<br>  environment:<br>    - KEY=VALUE</span></pre><p id="c00a">Additionally, with compose we can pass variables of a file:</p><pre><span id="47bf">web:<br>  env_file:<br>    - web-variables.env</span></pre><p id="a8a1">Also, we can use variables of file to another key:</p><pre><span id="5fda">web:<br>  image: "nginx:${NGINX_VERSION}"</span></pre><p id="a46e">In this case, by default compose reads <code>.env</code> file and checks for the value of <code>NGINX_VERSION</code> and adds it.</p><p id="db0e">One major difference in reading directly from file and environment variables is - in case of file, the changes in file are reflected immediately if volume is shared but if we use docker environment variables, it requires docker restart. So, in case of compose:</p><p id="0962"><code>$ docker-compose restart web</code></p><p id="c24e">Then only, new variables are available for the environment reading through <code>PROCESS.ENV</code></p><p id="074d">Additionally, there’s another variable called <code>ARG</code> which is available only at build time so that the variable is not available during run time. But <code>ENV</code> is available both during build &amp; run time.</p><h2 id="aaca">4. <strong>Image build process</strong>:</h2><p id="9898">Official docker images are not always enough. We need some customization and additional packages which takes long time and resources if we do each step on everyone’s system. So, we take a base image and build our own image by customization. Here, manual addition and commit of packages should always be avoided:</p><pre><span id="f27b">$ docker run -it --name alpine alpine:3.8 /bin/sh</span><span id="e60b">/ # apk add busybox-extras</span><span id="cc93">[CTRL+p CTRL+q]</span><span id="82d4">$ docker commit alpine alpine-custom</span><span id="ad51">$ docker push alpine-custom</span></pre><p id="5897">Here, you lost the track of state. Also, the version of <code>busybox-extras</code> that you installed now may not be available later. So, always use Dockerfile with versioning of package:</p><pre><span id="e4b1">FROM alpine:3.8<br>RUN apk add busybox-extras-1.28.4-r3</span></pre><h2 id="89f4">5. Files and folders permission:</h2><p id="a915">Let’s dive with an example:</p><pre><span id="dbdf">#docker-compose.yml<br>version: "3"<br>services:<br>  myapp:<br>    image: node:11-alpine<br>    container_name: "myapp"<br>    volumes:<br>      - ./:/app<br>    entrypoint: /bin/sh<br>    command: -c "sleep 5 &amp;&amp; cd /app &amp;&amp; yarn &amp;&amp; yarn start"</span></pre><p id="7201">After running <code>docker-compose up -d</code> , let’s check files &amp; folders permission</p><figure><figcaption>files &amp; folder permission in shared docker volume</figcaption></figure><p id="7d95">Here, we can see <code>node_modules</code> and <code>yarn.lock</code> is owned by root user as these folder &amp; file were created inside of docker. Similarly, if there are any uploads that would be owned by root(Same issue will arise only on Linux machine but not on MacOS). This will cause problem when you have to edit or add file from host system and also git will detect changes. We cannot afford to change permission each time but bring the owner of every files &amp; folders to current user. Here is how we can do that:</p><pre><span id="746c">#Updated docker-compose.yml<br>version: "3"<br>services:<br>  myapp:<br>    image: node:11-alpine<br>    container_name: "myapp"<br>    volumes:<br>      - ./:/app<br>    entrypoint: /bin/sh<br>    command: -c "sleep 5 &amp;&amp; cd /app &amp;&amp; yarn &amp;&amp; yarn start"<br>    user: ${CURRENT_UID}</span></pre><p id="40c2">Export a variable with current user and group id</p><pre><span id="a172">export CURRENT_UID=$(id -u):$(id -g)</span></pre><p id="1467">And start container</p><pre><span id="4680">CURRENT_UID=$CURRENT_UID docker-compose up -d</span></pre><p id="bb7c">Now, we can see all the files and folders owned by current host user.</p><h2 id="9b82">6. Sharing between host and container volume:</h2><p id="3dc9">Though docker was introduced with the concept of — run once &amp; run everywhere — while using volumes, there’s difference in case of MacOS. It uses osxfs as shared file system solution on Docker Desktop for Mac edition. While mounting host path inside container, additional step is to be performed. Let’s take an example:</p><p id="c35e">docker-compose.yml</p><pre><span id="cc85">version: "3.2"<br>services:<br>  myapp:<br>    container_name: myapp<br>    image: node:11-alpine<br>    volumes:<br>      - ./:/app</span></pre><p id="976b">If you run <code>docker-compose up</code> , it will throw error:</p><pre><span id="4350">ERROR: for myapp  Cannot start service myapp: b'Mounts denied: \r\nThe path /private/tmp/docker/myapp\r\nis not shared from OS X and is not known to Docker.\r\nYou can configure shared paths from Docker -&gt; Preferences... -&gt; File Sharing.\r\nSee <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#namespaces" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#namespaces</a> for more info.\r\n.'</span></pre><p id="5808">But with same case, it runs fine on Linux environment. For mac, the path has to be added from Docker preferences menu -&gt; Preferences -&gt; File sharing.</p><figure><figcaption>Add bind mount on macOS</figcaption></figure><p id="2478">Also, if there is hard coded volume path, its common to create problem for other users.</p></div><div><p id="ad72">There are other issues which might arise like:</p><ul><li id="388e">Port conflict if you have any processes running on host machine and docker uses same port</li><li id="8413">Proxy or load balancer used for sending traffic to different containers based on virtual hosts urls. There might be upload limits, additional or modified header sent by proxy</li><li id="a1c1">Using dual packages: host installed and from inside docker commands which could have different versions.</li></ul><p id="d46a">If you have any issues faced while running applications on container which raised “It works in my container” talk, feel free to share on comment.</p><p id="5e25">Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwdraju/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dwdraju" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Twitter</a> where I share interesting updates.</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <div><p><span>Congress has </span><a href="https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/D89FC49B-0714-4124-B8B1-4F35A85F5E02"><span>resurrected the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)</span></a><span>, a bill that would increase surveillance and restrict access to information in the name of protecting children online. KOSA was introduced in 2022 but failed to gain traction, and today its authors, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), have reintroduced it with slight modifications. Though some of these changes were made in response to </span><a href="https://cdt.org/insights/coalition-letter-on-privacy-and-free-expression-threats-in-kids-online-safety-act/"><span>over 100</span></a><span> civil society organizations and LGBTQ+ rights groups’ criticisms of the bill, its latest version is still troubling. Today’s version of KOSA would still require surveillance of anyone sixteen and under. It would put the tools of censorship in the hands of state attorneys general, and would greatly endanger the rights, and safety, of young people online. And KOSA’s burdens will affect adults, too, who will likely face hurdles to accessing legal content online as a result of the bill.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-kosa-will-censor-the-internet-but-won-t-help-kids" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TELL CONGRESS:&nbsp;OPPOSE THE KIDS ONLINE SAFETY ACT</a></p>
<h3><b>KOSA Still Requires Filtering and Blocking of Legal Speech</b></h3>
<p><span>Online child safety is a complex issue, but KOSA attempts to boil it down to a single solution. The bill holds platforms liable if their designs and services do not “prevent and mitigate” a list of societal ills: anxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance use disorders, physical violence, online bullying and harassment, sexual exploitation and abuse, and suicidal behaviors. Additionally, platforms would be responsible for patterns of use that indicate or encourage addiction-like behaviors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Deciding what designs or services lead to these problems would primarily be left up to the Federal Trade Commission and 50 individual state attorneys general to decide. Ultimately, this puts platforms that serve young people in an impossible situation: without clear guidance regarding what sort of design or content might lead to these harms, they would likely censor </span><i><span>any </span></i><span>discussions that could make them liable. To be clear: though the bill’s language is about “designs and services,” the designs of a platform are not causing eating disorders. As a result, KOSA would make platforms liable for the content they show minors, full stop. It will be based on vague requirements that any Attorney General could, more or less, make up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Attorneys General Would Decide What Content is Dangerous To Young People</b></h3>
<p><span>KOSA’s co-author, Sen. Blackburn of Tennessee, has referred to education about race discrimination as “</span><a href="https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2021/7/why-is-critical-race-theory-dangerous-for-our-kids"><span>dangerous for kids</span></a><span>.” Many states have agreed, and recently moved to limit public education about the history of </span><a href="https://news.trust.org/item/20211001103420-4bdez"><span>race</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/594980-florida-isnt-the-only-state-with-a-dont-say-gay-bill-15"><span>gender, and sexuality</span></a><span> discrimination. If KOSA passes, platforms are likely to preemptively block conversations that discuss these topics, as well as discussions about substance use, suicide, and eating disorders. As we’ve written in </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/kids-online-safety-act-heavy-handed-plan-force-platforms-spy-young-people"><span>our previous commentary on the bill</span></a><span>, KOSA could result in loss of access to information that a majority of people would agree is not dangerous. Again, issues like substance abuse, eating disorders, and depression are complex societal issues, and there is not clear agreement on their causes or their solutions. To pick </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/07/645609248/whats-the-evidence-that-supervised-drug-injection-sites-save-lives"><span>just one example</span></a><span>: in some communities, safe injection sites are seen as part of a solution to substance abuse; in others, they are seen as part of the problem. Under KOSA, could a platform be sued for displaying content about them—or about needle exchanges, naloxone, or other harm reduction techniques?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The latest version of KOSA tries, but ultimately fails, to address this problem in two ways: first, by clarifying that the bill shouldn’t stop a platform or its users from “providing resources for the prevention or mitigation” of its listed harms; and second, by adding that claims under the law should be consistent with evidence-informed medical information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, were an Attorney General to claim that content about trans healthcare (for example) poses risks to minors’ health, they would have no shortage of ‘evidence-informed' medical information on which to base their assertion. Numerous states have laws on the books claiming that gender-affirming care for trans youth is child abuse. In an article for the </span><i><span>American Conservative</span></i><span> titled “</span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/how-big-tech-turns-kids-trans"><span>How Big Tech Turns Kids Trans</span></a><span>,” the authors point to numerous studies that indicate gender-affirming care is dangerous, despite leading medical groups </span><a href="https://transhealthproject.org/resources/medical-organization-statements/"><span>recognizing the medical necessity</span></a><span> of treatments for gender dysphoria. In the same article, the authors laud KOSA, which would prohibit “content that poses risks to minors’ physical and mental health.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The same issue exists on both sides of the political spectrum. KOSA is ambiguous enough that an Attorney General who wanted to censor content regarding gun ownership, or Christianity, could argue that it has harmful effects on young people.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><b>KOSA Would Still Lead to Age Verification On Platforms</b></h3>
<p><span>Another change to KOSA comes in response to concerns that the law would lead to age verification requirements for platforms. For a platform to know whether or not it is liable for its impact on minors, it must, of course, know whether or not minors use its platform, and who they are. Age verification mandates </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/age-verification-mandates-would-undermine-anonymity-online"><span>create many issues</span></a><span> — in particular, they undermine anonymity by requiring all users to upload identity verification documentation and share private data, no matter their age. Other types of “age assurance” tools such as age estimation also require users to upload biometric information such as their photos, and have accuracy issues. Ultimately, no method is sufficiently reliable, offers complete coverage of the population, and has respect for the protection of individuals' data and privacy and their security.&nbsp; France’s National Commission on Informatics and Liberty, CNIL, reached this conclusion in a recent analysis of current age verification methods.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In response to these concerns, KOSA’s authors have made two small changes, but they’re unlikely to stop platforms from implementing age verification. Earlier versions would have held platforms liable if they “knew or should have known” that an impacted user was sixteen years of age or younger. The latest version of KOSA adds “reasonableness” to this requirement, holding platforms liable if they “know or </span><i><span>reasonably</span></i><span> should know” a user is a minor. But legally speaking, this doesn't result in giving platforms any better guidance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The second change is to add explicit language that age verification is not required under the “Privacy Protections” section of the bill. The bill now states that a covered platform is not required to implement an age gating </span><i><span>or</span></i><span> age verification functionality.&nbsp;</span><span>But there is essentially no outcome where sites don’t implement age verification. There’s no way for platforms to block nebulous categories of content for minors without explicitly requiring age verification.&nbsp;</span><span>If a 16-year-old user truthfully identifies herself, the law will hold platforms liable, unless they filter and block content. If a 16-year-old user identifies herself as an adult, and the platform does not use age verification, then it will still be held liable, because it should have “reasonably known” the user’s age.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A platform could, alternatively, skip age verification and simply institute blocking and filtering of certain types of content for all users regardless of age—which would be a terrible blow for speech online for everyone. So despite these bandaids on the bill, it still leaves platforms with no choices except to institute heavy-handed censorship and age verification requirements. These impacts would affect not just young people, but every user of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>There Are Better Ways to Fix The Internet</b></h3>
<p><span>While we appreciate that lawmakers have responded to concerns raised about the bill, its main requirements—that platforms must “prevent and mitigate” complex issues that </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/04/25/1171773181/social-media-teens-mental-health"><span>researchers don’t even agree the platforms are responsible for</span></a><span> in the first place—will lead to a more siloed, and more censored, internet. We also stand by our </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/kids-online-safety-act-heavy-handed-plan-force-platforms-spy-young-people"><span>previous criticisms of KOSA</span></a><span>—that it unreasonably buckets all young people into a single category, and that it requires surveillance of minors by parents. They&nbsp; remain troubling aspects of the law.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no question that some elements of social media today are toxic to users. Companies want users to spend as much time on their platforms as possible, because they make money from targeted ad sales, and these ad sales are fueled by invasive data collection. EFF has long supported&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/party-its-1979-og-antitrust-back-baby"><span>stronger competition laws</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/effs-recommendations-consumer-data-privacy-laws"><span>comprehensive data privacy legislation</span></a><span> in part because they can open the field to competitors to today’s social media options, and force platforms to innovate, offering more user choice. If users are unhappy with the content or design of current platforms, they should be able to move to other options that offer different forms of content moderation, better privacy protections, and other features that improve the experience for everyone, including young people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>KOSA would not enhance the ability of users to choose where they spend their time. Instead, it would shrink the number of options, by making strict requirements that only today’s largest, most profitable platforms could follow. It would solidify today’s Big Tech giants, while forcing them to collect more private data on all users. It would force them to spy on young people, and it would hand government the power to limit what topics they can see and discuss online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is not a safety bill—it is a surveillance and censorship bill. Please tell your Senators and representatives not to pass it.&nbsp;</span></p>

<article id="post-103226">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>This post is an update to the proposal for <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/12/lets-make-wordpress-officially-support-sqlite/">officially support SQLite in WordPress</a>. The initial implementation was included in the <a href="https://w.org/plugins/performance-lab">Performance Lab</a> <span tabindex="0">plugin<span> <span>A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party</span></span></span> and then released as a <a href="https://w.org/plugins/sqlite-database-integration/">stand-alone plugin</a>.</p>



<p>That initial implementation was based on <a href="https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/wp-sqlite-db">wp-sqlite-db</a> by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/aaemnnosttv/">@aaemnnosttv</a>, which in turn, was a fork of an <a href="https://w.org/plugins/sqlite-integration/">older plugin</a>. </p>



<p>Over the course of the last 6 month, issues with that implementation surfaced and the project experienced some limitations. As a result, we (<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/zieladam/">@zieladam</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/aristath/">@aristath</a>) decided to rewrite it using a more future-proof concept.</p>



<p>The code has been completely rewritten to use an SQL Lexer and is now stable and able to handle all WordPress queries properly. The SQL Lexer is part of the <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/sql-parser">PHPMyAdmin/SQL-Parser</a> project (licensed under the <span tabindex="0">GPL<span> <span>GNU General Public License. Also see <a href="#copyright-license">copyright license</a>.</span></span></span> 2.0) and it was adapted for WordPress, effectively implementing a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/sqlite-database-integration/pull/9">MySQL to SQLite translation engine</a>. This provides improved security, as well as compatibility.</p>



<p>The update has already been released in the standalone plugin and will soon be ported to the Performance Lab plugin. Most WordPress Unit Tests now pass, with the exception of a few that require patching WordPress <span tabindex="0">Core<span> <span>Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress.</span></span></span>.</p>



<p>The next step would be to implement these changes to WordPress core instead of using a plugin. To that end, we have a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/3220">draft Pull Request</a> and an accompanying <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57793">Trac ticket</a>.</p>



<h2>Why should this be in Core and not as a plugin?</h2>



<p>In its current form, the SQLite implementation is a plugin. Just like all plugins, it can only be installed on a pre-existing website. As a result, a site can only use an SQLite database if it already has a <span tabindex="0">MySQL<span> <span>MySQL is a relational database management system. A database is a structured collection of data where content, configuration and other options are stored. <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">https://www.mysql.com/</a>.</span></span></span> database – effectively negating all the benefits that SQLite can bring to WordPress.</p>



<p>Using the&nbsp;<em>featured</em>&nbsp;plugin is a great way to allow users to test the implementation and iron out any issues etc. However, long-term, it doesn’t make sense to use it as a plugin.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What are the next necessary decisions?</h2>



<p>There needs to be a decision, if the WordPress project wants to provide an option to users during WordPress installation, so they can choose whether they want to use a MySQL or an SQLite database. If no option is available in the <span tabindex="0">UI<span> <span>User interface</span></span></span>, then users would have to manually add <code>define( 'DB_ENGINE', 'sqlite' );</code> in their <code>wp-config.php</code> file.</p>



<p>Adding an option to select the database type may initially raise some eyebrows thinking that the famous 5-minute installation process will become more complicated, but in fact, it’s the exact opposite: If users pick SQLite as their database, they don’t need to create a MySQL db or enter their credentials in the installation screen, as no separate server is required.</p>



<p>A prototype of the UI changes are already available via the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/3220">pull request in WordPress Core</a>, to showcase how easy it would be to install WP using SQLite instead of MySQL. </p>



<p>The proof-of-concept UI in that implementation checks if the server supports SQLite and MySQL: </p>



<ul><li>If SQLite is supported but not MySQL, then it defaults to SQLite and no UI option is shown to users. This is for example what happens in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://playground.wordpress.net/" target="_blank">WordPress Playground</a>&nbsp;– it is vanilla WordPress that defaults to&nbsp;SQLite.</li>



<li>Similarly, if the server supports MySQL and not SQLite, then the installation will use MySQL and no option will be shown to users.</li>



<li>The UI option will only show if both SQLite and MySQL are supported by the server.</li>
</ul><h2>How can this implementation be tested? </h2>



<p>The next step would be to thoroughly test the implementation with all the plugins you normally use. You can use the <a href="https://w.org/plugins/sqlite-database-integration/">SQLite Database Integration plugin</a> to test an SQLite database on your existing website, or better yet – you can test the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/3220">pull request in WordPress Core</a>.</p>



<p>If you test the plugin, keep in mind that it does not copy your current data from MySQL to SQLite, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/12/20/help-us-test-the-sqlite-implementation/#faq">as mentioned in the call-for-testing post</a>.</p>
