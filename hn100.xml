<p>A bill that would allow police in France to spy on suspects by remotely activating cameras, microphone including GPS of their phones has been passed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bill allows the geolocation of crime suspects, covering other devices like laptops, cars and connected devices, just as it could be remotely activated to record sound and images of people suspected of terror offences, as well as delinquency and organised crime.</p>



<p>Although, the spying provision, which is part of a wider “justice reform bill”, has been attacked by the left and rights defenders as an authoritarian snoopers’ charter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The provisions “raise serious concerns over infringements of fundamental liberties,” stated a French advocacy group promoting digital rights and freedoms, La Quadrature du Net.</p>



<p>The group cited the “right to security, right to a private life and to private correspondence” and “the right to come and go freely,” specifically called the proposal a part of a “slide into heavy-handed security.”</p>



<p>But lawmakers agreed to the bill late Wednesday as Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti insisted the bill would affect only “dozens of cases a year.”</p>



<p>During the debate on Wednesday, the members of parliament in the camp of President Emmanuel Macron inserted an amendment limiting the use of remote spying to “when justified by the nature and seriousness of the crime” and “for a strictly proportional duration.” They noted that a judge must approve any use of the provision, while the total duration of the surveillance cannot exceed six months.</p>



<p>They said sensitive professions, including doctors, journalists, lawyers, judges and MPs, would not be legitimate targets.</p>



<p>Last month, the Senate gave the green light to the provision of the justice bill, which would allow law enforcement to secretly activate cameras and microphones on a suspect’s devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2015, when terrorist attacks rocked France, the country has increased its surveillance powers, and the “Keeper of the Seal” bill has been likened to the infamous US Patriot Act.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>by <a href="https://ploum.net/index.html">Ploum</a> on 2023-07-06</p><p>Lot is happening in the social network landscape with the demises of Twitter and Reddit, the apparition of Bluesky and Threads, the growing popularity of Mastodon. Many pundits are trying to guess which one will be successful and trying to explain why others will fail. Which completely misses the point.</p>
<p>Particular social networks will never "succeed". Nobody even agree on the definition of "success".</p>
<p>The problem is that we all see our little bubble and generalise what we observe as universal. We have a hard time understanding Mastodon ? Mastodon will never succeed, it will be for a niche. A few of our favourite web stars goes to Bluesky ? Bluesky is the future, everybody will be there.</p>
<p>That’s not how it works. That’s not how it ever worked.</p>
<p>Like every human endeavour, every social network is there for a limited duration and will be useful to a limited niche of people. That niche may grow to the point of being huge, like Facebook and WhatsApp. But, to this day, there are more people in the world without an account on Facebook than people with one. Every single social network is only representative of a minority. And the opposite would be terrifying when you think about it (which is exactly what Meta is trying to build).</p>
<p>Social networks are fluid. They come, they go. For commercial social networks, the success is defined by: "do they earn enough money to make investors happy ?" There’s no metric of success for non-commercial ones. They simply exist as long as at least two users are using them to communicate. Which is why criticisms like "Mastodon could never raise enough money" or "the Fediverse will never succeed" totally miss the point. </p>
<p>If you live in the same occidental bubble as me, you might have never heard of WeChat, QQ or VK. Those are immensely popular social networks. In China and Russia. WeChat alone is more or less the size of Instagram in terms of active users. The war in Ukraine also demonstrated that the most popular social network in that part of the world is Telegram. Which is twice as big as Twitter but, for whatever reason, is barely mentioned in my own circles. The lesson here is simple: you are living in a small niche. We all do. Your experience is not representative of anything but your own. And it’s fine.</p>
<p>There will never be one social network to rule them all. There should never be one social network to rule them all. In fact, tech-savvy people should fight to ensure that no social network ever "succeed".</p>
<p>Human lives in communities. We join them, we sometimes leave them. Social networks should only be an underlying infrastructure to support our communities. Social networks are not our communities. Social network dies. Communities migrate and flock to different destinations. Nothing ever replaced Google+, which was really popular in my own tech circle. Nothing will replace Twitter or Reddit. Some communities will find a new home on Mastodon or on Lemmy. Some will go elsewhere. That’s not a problem as long as you can have multiple accounts in different places. Something I’m sure you do. Communities can be split. Communities can be merged. People can be part of several communities and several platforms.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley venture capitalists are trying to convince us that, one day, a social network will succeed, will become universal. That it should grow. That social networks are our communities. That your community should grow to succeed.</p>
<p>This is a lie, a delusion. Our communities are worth a lot more than the underlying tool used at some point in time. By accepting the confusion, we are destroying our communities. We are selling them, we are transforming them into a simple commercial asset for the makers of the tool we are using, the tool which exploits us. </p>
<p>Stop trying to make social networks succeed, stop dreaming of a universal network. Instead, invest in your own communities. Help them make long-term, custom and sustainable solutions. Try to achieve small and local successes instead of pursuing an imaginary universal one. It will make you happier.</p>
<p>It will make all of us happier.</p>

<p>A federal judge yesterday ordered the Biden administration to halt a wide range of communications with social media companies, siding with Missouri and Louisiana in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520.268.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> that alleges Biden and his administration violated the First Amendment by colluding with social networks "to suppress disfavored speakers, viewpoints, and content."</p>
<p>The Biden administration argued that it communicated with tech companies to counter misinformation related to elections, COVID-19, and vaccines, and that it didn't exert illegal pressure on the companies. The communications to social media companies were not significant enough "to convert private conduct into government conduct," Department of Justice lawyers argued in the case.</p>
<p>But Judge Terry Doughty, a Trump nominee at US District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520.294.0_2.pdf">granted the plaintiffs' request</a> for a preliminary injunction imposing limits on the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the US Census Bureau, the State Department, the Homeland Security Department, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and many specific officials at those agencies. The injunction also affects White House officials.</p>
<p>The agencies and officials are prohibited from communicating "with social-media companies for the purpose of urging, encouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech posted on social-media platforms," Doughty ruled. The injunction prohibits "specifically flagging content or posts on social-media platforms and/or forwarding such to social-media companies urging, encouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner for removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Government agencies and officials are further barred from urging, encouraging, or pressuring social media companies "to change their guidelines for removing, deleting, suppressing, or reducing content containing protected free speech." The ruling also said the government may not coordinate with third-party groups, including the Election Integrity Partnership, the Virality Project, and the Stanford Internet Observatory, to pressure social media companies.</p>
<h2>Exceptions include voting misinformation</h2>
<p>Doughty provided several exceptions that allow the government to communicate with social media companies about criminal activity and other speech that the First Amendment doesn't protect. The Biden administration may continue to inform social networks about posts involving criminal activity or criminal conspiracies, national security threats, extortion, criminal efforts to suppress voting, illegal campaign contributions, cyberattacks against election infrastructure, foreign attempts to influence elections, threats to public safety and security, and posts intending to mislead voters about voting requirements and procedures.</p>
<p>The US can also exercise "permissible public government speech promoting government policies or views on matters of public concern," communicate with social networks "in an effort to detect, prevent, or mitigate malicious cyber activity," and "communicat[e] with social-media companies about deleting, removing, suppressing, or reducing posts on social-media platforms that are not protected free speech by the Free Speech Clause in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution."</p>
<p>In addition to the Missouri and Louisiana attorneys general, the plaintiffs include professors Jayanta Bhattacharya and Martin Kulldorff, who co-authored the October 2020 "Great Barrington Declaration" that opposed COVID lockdowns and urged a focus on reaching herd immunity. They and other plaintiffs claim they were censored by social networks.</p>
<p>The ruling was criticized by Jameel Jaffer, an adjunct professor of law and journalism who is executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. "It can't be that the government violates the First Amendment simply by engaging with the platforms about their content-moderation decisions and policies," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/04/business/federal-judge-biden-social-media.html">Jaffer told The New York Times</a>, calling it "a pretty radical proposition that isn't supported by the case law."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>While the government must be careful to avoid coercion in its efforts to combat false information, Jaffer said that "unfortunately, Judge Doughty's order doesn't reflect a serious effort to reconcile the competing principles."</p>
<p>Stanford Law School Assistant Professor Evelyn Douek <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/04/biden-social-lawsuit-missouri-louisiana/">told The Washington Post</a> that the "injunction is strikingly broad and clearly intended to chill any kind of contact between government actors and social media platforms."</p>
<h2>Judge finds “unrelenting pressure” on social networks</h2>
<p>Doughty previously <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.186715/gov.uscourts.lawd.186715.128.0.pdf">blocked</a> federal vaccine and mask mandates in the Head Start program. In the social media case, Doughty made it clear that he expects plaintiffs to win in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520.293.0_1.pdf">155-page memorandum ruling</a> explaining his decision yesterday:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits on their claim that the United States Government, through the White House and numerous federal agencies, pressured and encouraged social-media companies to suppress free speech. Defendants used meetings and communications with social-media companies to pressure those companies to take down, reduce, and suppress the free speech of American citizens.</p>
<p>They flagged posts and provided information on the type of posts they wanted suppressed. They also followed up with directives to the social-media companies to provide them with information as to action the company had taken with regard to the flagged post. This seemingly unrelenting pressure by Defendants had the intended result of suppressing millions of protected free speech postings by American citizens.</p></blockquote>
<p>The federal defendants "argue they only made requests to the social-media companies, and that the decision to modify or suppress content was each social-media company's independent decision," Doughty wrote. "However, when a state has so involved itself in the private party's conduct, it cannot claim the conduct occurred as a result of private choice, even if the private party would have acted independently."</p>
<p>He found that defendants "significantly encouraged" and in some cases coerced "the social-media companies to such extent that the decision should be deemed to be the decisions of the Government."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>After <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail">four months of work</a>, we are excited to bring you Godot 4.1! It’s an update that follows our pledge to improve upon Godot 4.0 with frequent incremental releases — with a focus on stability, performance, and polish.</p>

<p>As always, a new release comes with a bunch of welcome new features, like the improved AI navigation avoidance and the ability to detach code editors and put them on other displays.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/detached-code-editor.png" alt="The code editor detached from the main editor window"></p>

<p>Still, we took great care to prioritize the bugs you have encountered in 4.0. This update fixes over 900 issues that users have reported from using Godot 4 or while helping contributors test 4.1 with pre-release builds. The engine should feel more reliable overall. We will continue improving stability, performance, and workflows with every upcoming feature release of Godot 4.</p>

<p>For most games and apps made with 4.0 it should be relatively safe to migrate to 4.1. We are <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/pull/7611">preparing a migration guide</a> that outlines everything you need to pay attention to when migrating your project. Some incompatibilities are expected for C# and GDExtension users specifically, however we are working on making sure to avoid that in future releases. Don’t forget to always make backups when moving versions, even minor. Better yet, prefer using a version control system, such as Git, and commit a version of your project before the migration.</p>

<p><strong>If you wish to get straight into the action, you can <a href="https://godotengine.org/download/">download Godot 4.1 now</a>.</strong> Or stick around and read more about the most notable changes of this release. You can also watch this great highlights video by <a href="https://www.gdquest.com/">GDQuest</a>:</p>

<h2 id="giving-back">Giving back</h2>

<p>As a community effort, Godot relies on individual contributors to improve. In recent years, <a href="https://godotengine.org/donate/">user and company donations</a> allowed us to also hire a number of core contributors to work full-time on the engine and bring you these fast-paced releases.</p>

<p>Our monthly expenses remain higher than monthly donations, and we still depend on large one-time company donations to fund development. Currently, we need a lot more <a href="https://godotengine.org/donate/">monthly donations</a> to keep up the pace with Godot 4 updates, not to mention the need to hire more maintainers to review every contribution.</p>

<p>Besides financial support, you can also give back by: writing detailed bug reports, contributing to the code base, writing documentation, writing guides (for the docs or on your own website), and supporting others on the various <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/channels.html">community platforms</a> by answering questions and providing helpful tips.</p>

<p>Last but not least, making games with Godot and crediting the engine goes a long way to help make it more popular and convince more people to contribute and improve Godot for everyone. Remember, we are all in this together and Godot requires community support in every area to thrive.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>This release was made possible thanks to submissions from over 300 contributors! We warmly thank you all for your work and dedication, including those who helped us test the engine before the release and submit bug reports.</p>

<p>For an exhaustive list of all the bug fixes and improvements, head on over to our <a href="https://godotengine.github.io/godot-interactive-changelog/#4.1">interactive changelog</a>.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here’s a breakdown of the main changes and new features.</p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>Godot games are built as a tree of nodes, which are the engine’s base building block for game entities. Adding and removing nodes are operations the engine needs to do extremely often, so they need to be as fast as possible.</p>

<p>In 4.1, we changed the algorithm to use a fast hashmap to make adding and removing child nodes several times faster. Uncommon node operations are slightly slower as a result, and the memory footprint of the base Node class is 10% higher, but this is a small and necessary trade-off for a big benefit to all Godot users, especially to more complex projects with a lot of node manipulation.</p>

<p>This version also introduces experimental multithreading for your scenes, a feature kickstarted by <a href="https://github.com/reduz">Juan Linietsky</a>. New node properties give you full control over how nodes get processed, sequentially or in parallel.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/threaded-node-properties-highlighted.png" alt="Thread group configuration options for Node"></p>

<p>As mentioned, the feature is currently marked experimental as it needs extensive testing to find edge cases. We do not recommend using it in production yet. But it sets the foundation for making the most of modern hardware, with simple controls.</p>

<p>Also on the multithreading front, <a href="https://github.com/RandomShaper">Pedro J. Estébanez</a> worked hard on fixing a large amount of multi-threaded loading issues and limitations.</p>

<p>On the rendering side, the Vulkan renderer got a pipeline cache. While Godot already cached shaders to reduce shader compilation stutter, compiling pipelines still lead to some stuttering and slower load times. While the pipeline compilation stuttering issue is far from solved, this represents a step in the right direction and should also lead to a slight decrease in load times when using one of the RenderingDevice-based rendering backends. This cache can be toggled off in the project settings and is on by default in Godot 4.1.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/shader-cache-setting.png" alt="Shader cache project settings"></p>

<p>This improvement doesn’t address all possible causes of stalls, but it’s a first step in the right direction by <a href="https://github.com/warriormaster12">Alexander Streng</a>. We’ll keep working on it in upcoming releases.</p>

<p>More work will follow on the performance front throughout the year.</p>

<h3 id="core">Core</h3>

<p>When importing models into Godot, there was often the problem that they ended up facing backward.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/model-facing-back.webp" alt="A model facing backwards (before the change)"></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/reduz">Juan Linietsky</a>, <a href="https://github.com/TokageItLab">Tokage</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/aaronfranke">Aaron Franke</a> worked on a number of ways to address this issue. One of the implemented changes swaps the front and back camera directions in the editor. Also, the <code>look_at()</code> function now has an argument to use the model space as the reference for looking forward instead of the camera’s minus Z axis. These changes also help fix a long-standing bug with path following.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/model-facing-front.webp" alt="A model facing forward (after the change)"></p>

<p>This update also brings frame delta smoothing to Godot 4, by <a href="https://github.com/lawnjelly">lawnjelly</a>. This can significantly improve the fluidity of motion and give smoother gameplay. This option is enabled by default, though please note that it only works when VSync is also enabled.</p>

<h3 id="scripting">Scripting</h3>

<h4 id="gdscript">GDScript</h4>

<p>Until now, in GDScript, you needed to use a resource or an autoload to share data between multiple instances of the same script.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/vnen">George Marques</a>, you can now create and use static variables instead. Static variables store data on the class instead of each instance, so they’re shared between every instance of the class.</p>

<p>To make a variable static, add the <code>static</code> keyword in front of a variable defined at the top of your script.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/gdscript-static-variables.png" alt="A GDScript code sample showcasing the use of static variables"></p>

<p>A great feature of GDScript added in Godot 4 is the automatic generation of documentation pages for your named classes.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/gdscript-docs-generation.png" alt="An example of a generated documentation based on a custom GDScript class"></p>

<p>This version includes a rework of the system by <a href="https://github.com/anvilfolk">ocean</a> that now treats enumerations as types, making the generated documentation more precise. You can also now use inline docstrings instead of having to always place them above a variable or a function’s definition.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>my_variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span> <span>## This is an inline docstring</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h4 id="cnet">C#/.NET</h4>

<p>The focus in this release was on bringing feature parity between C# and GDScript.</p>

<p>When using GDScript, you can define a new node type to use in the editor by adding a global class name to your script.</p>

<p>Starting from Godot 4.1, this is also possible in C# by adding the <code>[GlobalClass]</code> attribute to your file, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/raulsntos">Raul Santos</a> and <a href="https://github.com/willnationsdev">Will Nations</a>. You can also use the <code>[Icon]</code> attribute to give your global class a unique icon.</p>

<p>Note that as of this release projects made with C# still cannot be exported to mobile and web platforms. We are working on providing the support as soon as possible, but the resolution of this limitation will likely depend on the release of .NET 8 at the end of 2023. This means that the work on enabling mobile and web platforms can only truly start later this year.</p>

<h4 id="gdextension">GDExtension</h4>

<p>Godot comes with a unique technology to use low-level languages like C++ as a game scripting language, without having to recompile the engine.</p>

<p>While the technology is still in beta for this release, GDExtension is now even closer to GDScript and C# in terms of scripting capabilities. You can now implement new visual shader nodes and create editor plugins with GDExtension.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/gdextension-visual-shader-node.png" alt="An example of using a custom visual shader node from GDExtension"></p>

<p>The team also implemented a backward compatibility system to help ensure that code written for Godot 4.1 keeps working even if the API changes in future releases. However, a significant compatibility breakage was necessary to do in 4.1 to fix critical issues in GDExtension, so existing Godot 4.0 extensions will need to be ported and recompiled for 4.1.</p>

<p>Finally, a lot of work was done on the architecture once again to make the GDExtension API extensible in the future.</p>

<p>All the above resulted from the teamwork of <a href="https://github.com/dsnopek">David Snopek</a>, <a href="https://github.com/reduz">Juan Linietsky</a>, <a href="https://github.com/RedworkDE">RedworkDE</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Chaosus">Yuri Rubinsky</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/YuriSizov">Yuri Sizov</a>.</p>

<h3 id="editor">Editor</h3>

<p>Godot 4 has support for multiple windows which we use for the project and editor settings and various pop-ups. Starting with this version, you can now also detach docs into floating windows and detach script editors, including the shader editor, and place them on a separate monitor.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/detached-code-editor.png" alt="The code editor detached from the main editor window"></p>

<p>In addition to that, the editor will now keep track of your window layout so that when you close and reopen the editor, you should often find yourself exactly where you left off.</p>

<p>You can thank <a href="https://github.com/trollodel">trollodel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Geometror">Hendrik Brucker</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/KoBeWi">Tomasz Chabora</a> for this.</p>

<p>Godot 4.0 introduced the option to define and export typed arrays, and to export individual nodes to the inspector, but it was not possible to combine the two. From Godot 4.1 onwards, you can export arrays of nodes to the inspector, which is great to link game objects together.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/editor-exported-node-array.png" alt="An array of nodes exported as a custom property"></p>

<p>This work was done by Tomasz and <a href="https://github.com/ajreckof">Timothé Bonhoure</a></p>

<p>The project manager now allows you to assign tags to individual projects and filter projects by tags. It makes it much easier to search through dozens, if not hundreds of Godot projects.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/editor-project-manager-tags.png" alt="A list of projects with custom tags assigned to them"></p>

<h3 id="rendering">Rendering</h3>

<p>Particle turbulence got reworked in this version based on artists’ feedback to offer greater creative control. Turbulence is used extensively to create these rich sprawling effects seen in many modern games. Big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/KdotJPG">KdotJPG</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RPicster">Raffaele Picca</a> for this contribution.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/render-particles-turbulence.png" alt="An effect driven by the updated particle turbulence system"></p>

<p>Using the new 3D noise textures you can control the density of volumetric fog easily, and make it thinner in certain areas. NoiseTexture3D can also be used to create particle attractor vector fields, which is useful to simulate wind that affects particles. <a href="https://github.com/Lasuch69">Lasuch</a> and <a href="https://github.com/clayjohn">Clay John</a> implemented this feature.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/render-3d-noise.png" alt="A more complex fog volume using the new 3D noise"></p>

<p>While there are still many <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/rendering-priorities-4-1/">planned improvements</a> to Godot’s renderers, most will be present in future releases. The rendering team (and all rendering contributors) prioritized bug fixing and stability over new features. Notably, the 3D GLES3 renderer is not yet complete, but will see substantial work over the coming months.</p>

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>

<p>Godot 4.0 introduced real-time avoidance for AI navigation, but it was limited to a single plane.</p>

<p>This release includes completely rewritten avoidance algorithms by <a href="https://github.com/smix8">smix8</a> to give you much better behaviors and greater control. Avoidance can now happen in 2D or 3D, allowing flying agents to move over those walking on the ground.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/navigation-3d-layers.png" alt="A demo of multiple navigation agents operating on several layers in 3D"></p>

<p>On top of that, you can now use layers to control which agents avoid which and assign priorities to have some agents push others away.</p>

<p><img src="https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/godot-4-1-is-here/navigation-priority.png" alt="A demo of multiple navigation agents with varied priorities"></p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/navigation/index.html">updated documentation</a> to learn more about how the improved navigation works.</p>

<h3 id="platform-support">Platform support</h3>

<p>We are as committed as ever to have Godot games on all popular platforms, and 4.1 still offers the same capabilities as did Godot 4.0. You can export to all desktop platforms with both standard and .NET version of the engine, and you can export to mobile and web if you don’t use C# in your projects.</p>

<p>As of 4.1 web exports still have some limitations due to poor vendor support of certain modern features. Browsers with bad WebGL 2 support, such as Chrome on macOS, unfortunately suffer from issues which we cannot address without a fix from Google or a significant amount of effort put into supporting a dedicated WebGL 1 / GLES2 renderer.</p>

<p>We are also aware of the complexity setting up web games on hosting platforms which don’t let you set the required CORS headers for SharedArrayBuffer support. This mostly depends on Safari implementing the <code>coep:credentialless</code> header support, while Chromium-based browsers and Firefox already work fine (especially if you publish on itch.io). There is a <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/6616">possible workaround</a> that we are investigating.</p>

<h2 id="known-issues">Known issues</h2>

<p>With every release we acknowledge that there are going to be problems which we couldn’t resolve in time. Some of these problems have been identified and fixes are being worked on as we speak, while others remain unknown until someone runs into the issue. You can follow our <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">bug tracker</a> to learn if the problem that you’re experiencing has been reported. We appreciate new reports and confirmations of existing reports, as that helps us prioritize fixing specific issues.</p>

<p>Here are notable issues that have already been identified that you might experience in Godot 4.1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The newly added API for defining custom configuration properties for export presets does not persist user configurations. Configuration options get reset and lost on editor restarts. The fix is going to be available in 4.1.1 (see <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79025">GH-79025</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="on-to-the-next-release">On to the next release!</h2>

<p>We already started work on Godot 4.2, which will come out in four months. We are dedicated to keeping up the pace and sticking to this reliable release cycle, so you never have to wait long for the next batch of improvements and new features.</p>

<p>Until then, <a href="https://godotengine.org/download/">enjoy Godot 4.1</a>!</p>

				<p id="speakable-summary">Threads, Meta’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/threads-metas-twitter-competitor-is-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter rival</a>, is drawing users at an astounding pace, amassing 10 million signups in just seven hours, according to co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. But the highly-anticipated new service, which requires an Instagram account for onboarding, features an intriguing stipulation: Deleting a Threads account requires deleting the linked Instagram account.</p>
<p>In a ‘<a href="https://help.instagram.com/515230437301944" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supplemental Privacy Policy</a>,’ Meta explains: “You may deactivate your Threads profile at any time, but your Threads profile can only be deleted by deleting your Instagram account.”</p>
<p>The rationale, Meta elaborates on the policy page, is that a Threads profile is part of the user’s Instagram account. The discovery of this stipulation has surprised many users.</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I deactivated my threads account already but it turns out you can’t delete your threads account *without also deleting your Instagram account* so maybe just don’t sign up!</p>

<p>Threads, a text-based conversation app, is the high-profile alternative to the Elon Musk-owned social media platform Twitter.</p>
<p>Instagram, the popular photo-sharing platform with more than 2 billion users, rolled out Threads on Wednesday to users in more than 100 countries. The app, the latest in a series of fast-growing Twitter rivals, is appearing to be the most desirable so far.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg said on Thursday that the app had attracted 10 million signups in just seven hours, sharing an emoji that suggested that his mind had been blown by the reception. The pace to 10 million makes Threads the <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuWJKP_PPE2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fastest-growing consumer offering</a>.</p>
<p>A number of brands, including Netflix, Amazon, NFL, Pepsi, have also expressed their vote of confidence in Threads by signing up to the app. However, many major names — Google, Apple, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Disney — remain mysteriously absent, at least as of the time of publication.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto">InternLM has open-sourced a 7 billion parameter base model and a chat model tailored for practical scenarios. The model has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It leverages trillions of high-quality tokens for training to establish a powerful knowledge base.</li>
<li>It supports an 8k context window length, enabling longer input sequences and stronger reasoning capabilities.</li>
<li>It provides a versatile toolset for users to flexibly build their own workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, a lightweight training framework is offered to support model pre-training without the need for extensive dependencies. With a single codebase, it supports pre-training on large-scale clusters with thousands of GPUs, and fine-tuning on a single GPU while achieving remarkable performance optimizations. InternLM achieves nearly 90% acceleration efficiency during training on 1024 GPUs.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Limitations:</strong> Although we have made efforts to ensure the safety of the model during the training process and to encourage the model to generate text that complies with ethical and legal requirements, the model may still produce unexpected outputs due to its size and probabilistic generation paradigm. For example, the generated responses may contain biases, discrimination, or other harmful content. Please do not propagate such content. We are not responsible for any consequences resulting from the dissemination of harmful information.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Import from Transformers</h3>
<p dir="auto">To load the InternLM 7B Chat model using Transformers, use the following code:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=">>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;internlm/internlm-chat-7b&quot;, trust_remote_code=True)
>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(&quot;internlm/internlm-chat-7b&quot;, trust_remote_code=True).cuda()
>>> model = model.eval()
>>> response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, &quot;hello&quot;, history=[])
>>> print(response)
Hello! How can I help you today？
>>> response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, &quot;please provide three suggestions about time management&quot;, history=history)
>>> print(response)
Sure, here are three tips for effective time management:

1. Prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency: Make a list of all your tasks and categorize them into &quot;important and urgent,&quot; &quot;important but not urgent,&quot; and &quot;not important but urgent.&quot; Focus on completing the tasks in the first category before moving on to the others.
2. Use a calendar or planner: Write down deadlines and appointments in a calendar or planner so you don't forget them. This will also help you schedule your time more effectively and avoid overbooking yourself.
3. Minimize distractions: Try to eliminate any potential distractions when working on important tasks. Turn off notifications on your phone, close unnecessary tabs on your computer, and find a quiet place to work if possible.

Remember, good time management skills take practice and patience. Start with small steps and gradually incorporate these habits into your daily routine."><pre><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>transformers</span> <span>import</span> <span>AutoTokenizer</span>, <span>AutoModelForCausalLM</span>

<p dir="auto"><strong>On Windows</strong>, you may also use the <a href="https://objects.joplinusercontent.com/v2.11.11/JoplinPortable.exe?source=JoplinWebsite&amp;type=New" rel="nofollow">Portable version</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application" rel="nofollow">portable application</a> allows installing the software on a portable device such as a USB key. Simply copy the file JoplinPortable.exe in any directory on that USB key ; the application will then create a directory called "JoplinProfile" next to the executable file.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>On Linux</strong>, the recommended way is to use the following installation script as it will handle the desktop icon too:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Joplin_install_and_update.sh | bash"><pre><code>wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Joplin_install_and_update.sh | bash</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The install and update script supports the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/Joplin_install_and_update.sh#L50">following flags</a> (around line 50 at the time of this writing).</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Unofficial Alternative Distributions</h2>
<p dir="auto">There are a number of unofficial alternative Joplin distributions. If you do not want to or cannot use appimages or any of the other officially supported releases then you may wish to consider these.</p>
<p dir="auto">However these come with a caveat in that they are not officially supported so certain issues may not be supportable by the main project. Rather support requests, bug reports and general advice would need to go to the maintainers of these distributions.</p>
<p dir="auto">A community maintained list of these distributions can be found here: <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/unofficial-alternative-joplin-distributions/23703" rel="nofollow">Unofficial Joplin distributions</a></p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Importing</h2>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Importing from Evernote</h2>
<p dir="auto">Joplin was designed as a replacement for Evernote and so can import complete Evernote notebooks, as well as notes, tags, resources (attached files) and note metadata (such as author, geo-location, etc.) via ENEX files. In terms of data, the only two things that might slightly differ are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Recognition data - Evernote images, in particular scanned (or photographed) documents have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition" rel="nofollow">recognition data</a> associated with them. It is the text that Evernote has been able to recognise in the document. This data is not preserved when the note are imported into Joplin. However, should it become supported in the search tool or other parts of Joplin, it should be possible to regenerate this recognition data since the actual image would still be available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Colour, font sizes and faces - Evernote text is stored as HTML and this is converted to Markdown during the import process. For notes that are mostly plain text or with basic formatting (bold, italic, bullet points, links, etc.) this is a lossless conversion, and the note, once rendered back to HTML should be very similar. Tables are also imported and converted to Markdown tables. For very complex notes, some formatting data might be lost - in particular colours, font sizes and font faces will not be imported. The text itself however is always imported in full regardless of formatting. If it is essential that this extra data is preserved then Joplin also allows import of ENEX files as HTML.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To import Evernote data, first export your Evernote notebooks to ENEX files as described <a href="https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/209005557-How-to-back-up-export-and-restore-import-notes-and-notebooks" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Then follow these steps:</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>desktop application</strong>, open File &gt; Import &gt; ENEX and select your file. The notes will be imported into a new separate notebook. If needed they can then be moved to a different notebook, or the notebook can be renamed, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>terminal application</strong>, in <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/terminal.md#command-line-mode">command-line mode</a>, type <code>import /path/to/file.enex</code>. This will import the notes into a new notebook named after the filename.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Importing from Markdown files</h2>
<p dir="auto">Joplin can import notes from plain Markdown file. You can either import a complete directory of Markdown files or individual files.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>desktop application</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>File import</strong>: Go to File &gt; Import &gt; MD - Markdown (file) and select the Markdown file. This file will then be imported to the currently selected Notebook.</li>
<li><strong>Directory import</strong>: Go to File &gt; Import &gt; MD - Markdown (directory) and select the top level of the directory that is being imported. Directory (folder) structure will be preserved in the Notebook &gt; Subnotebook &gt; Note structure within Joplin.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>terminal application</strong>, in <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/terminal.md#command-line-mode">command-line mode</a>, type <code>import --format md /path/to/file.md</code> or <code>import --format md /path/to/directory/</code>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Importing from other applications</h2>
<p dir="auto">In general the way to import notes from any application into Joplin is to convert the notes to ENEX files (Evernote format) and to import these ENEX files into Joplin using the method above. Most note-taking applications support ENEX files so it should be relatively straightforward. For help about specific applications, see below:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Standard Notes: Please see <a href="https://programadorwebvalencia.com/migrate-notes-from-standard-notes-to-joplin/" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a></li>
<li>Tomboy Notes: Export the notes to ENEX files <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/243691/how-can-i-export-my-tomboy-notes-into-evernote/608551" rel="nofollow">as described here</a> for example, and import these ENEX files into Joplin.</li>
<li>OneNote: First <a href="https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/107736-is-there-a-way-to-import-from-onenote-into-evernote-on-the-mac/" rel="nofollow">import the notes from OneNote into Evernote</a>. Then export the ENEX file from Evernote and import it into Joplin.</li>
<li>NixNote: Synchronise with Evernote, then export the ENEX files and import them into Joplin. More info <a href="https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/import-from-nixnote/183/3" rel="nofollow">in this thread</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Exporting</h2>
<p dir="auto">Joplin can export to the JEX format (Joplin Export file), which is a tar file that can contain multiple notes, notebooks, etc. This is a lossless format in that all the notes, but also metadata such as geo-location, updated time, tags, etc. are preserved. This format is convenient for backup purposes and can be re-imported into Joplin. A "raw" format is also available. This is the same as the JEX format except that the data is saved to a directory and each item represented by a single file.
Joplin is also capable of exporting to a number of other formats including HTML and PDF which can be done for single notes, notebooks or everything.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Synchronisation</h2>
<p dir="auto">One of the goals of Joplin is to avoid being tied to any particular company or service, whether it is Evernote, Google or Microsoft. As such the synchronisation is designed without any hard dependency to any particular service. Most of the synchronisation process is done at an abstract level and access to external services, such as Nextcloud or Dropbox, is done via lightweight drivers. It is easy to support new services by creating simple drivers that provide a filesystem-like interface, i.e. the ability to read, write, delete and list items. It is also simple to switch from one service to another or to even sync to multiple services at once. Each note, notebook, tags, as well as the relation between items is transmitted as plain text files during synchronisation, which means the data can also be moved to a different application, can be easily backed up, inspected, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, synchronisation is possible with Nextcloud, WebDAV, Dropbox, OneDrive or the local filesystem. To enable synchronisation please follow the instructions below. After that, the application will synchronise in the background whenever it is running, or you can click on "Synchronise" to start a synchronisation manually. Joplin will background sync automatically after any content change is made on the local application.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the <strong>terminal client</strong> has been installed, it is possible to also synchronise outside of the user interface by typing <code>joplin sync</code> from the terminal. This can be used to setup a cron script to synchronise at a regular interval. For example, this would do it every 30 minutes:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code> */30 * * * * /path/to/joplin sync</code></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nextcloud synchronisation</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/nextcloud-logo-background.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/nextcloud-logo-background.png" width="100"></a> <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" rel="nofollow">Nextcloud</a> is a self-hosted, private cloud solution. It can store documents, images and videos but also calendars, passwords and countless other things and can sync them to your laptop or phone. As you can host your own Nextcloud server, you own both the data on your device and infrastructure used for synchronisation. As such it is a good fit for Joplin. The platform is also well supported and with a strong community, so it is likely to be around for a while - since it's open source anyway, it is not a service that can be closed, it can exist on a server for as long as one chooses.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>desktop application</strong> or <strong>mobile application</strong>, go to the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a> and select Nextcloud as the synchronisation target. Then input the WebDAV URL (to get it, click on Settings in the bottom left corner of the page, in Nextcloud), this is normally <code>https://example.com/nextcloud/remote.php/webdav/Joplin</code> (<strong>make sure to create the "Joplin" directory in Nextcloud</strong>), and set the username and password. If it does not work, please <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/61#issuecomment-373282608" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/laurent22/joplin/issues/61/hovercard">see this explanation</a> for more details.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>terminal application</strong>, you will need to set the <code>sync.target</code> config variable and all the <code>sync.5.path</code>, <code>sync.5.username</code> and <code>sync.5.password</code> config variables to, respectively the Nextcloud WebDAV URL, your username and your password. This can be done from the command line mode using:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=":config sync.5.path https://example.com/nextcloud/remote.php/webdav/Joplin
:config sync.5.username YOUR_USERNAME
:config sync.5.password YOUR_PASSWORD
:config sync.target 5"><pre><code>:config sync.5.path https://example.com/nextcloud/remote.php/webdav/Joplin
:config sync.5.username YOUR_USERNAME
:config sync.5.password YOUR_PASSWORD
:config sync.target 5
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If synchronisation does not work, please consult the logs in the app profile directory - it is often due to a misconfigured URL or password. The log should indicate what the exact issue is.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">WebDAV synchronisation</h2>
<p dir="auto">Select the "WebDAV" synchronisation target and follow the same instructions as for Nextcloud above (for the <strong>terminal application</strong> you will need to select sync target 6 rather than 5)</p>
<p dir="auto">WebDAV-compatible services that are known to work with Joplin:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dropbox synchronisation</h2>
<p dir="auto">When syncing with Dropbox, Joplin creates a sub-directory in Dropbox, in <code>/Apps/Joplin</code> and reads/writes the notes and notebooks in it. The application does not have access to anything outside this directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>desktop application</strong> or <strong>mobile application</strong>, select "Dropbox" as the synchronisation target in the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a> (it is selected by default). Then, to initiate the synchronisation process, click on the "Synchronise" button in the sidebar and follow the instructions.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>terminal application</strong>, to initiate the synchronisation process, type <code>:sync</code>. You will be asked to follow a link to authorise the application.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">OneDrive synchronisation</h2>
<p dir="auto">When syncing with OneDrive, Joplin creates a sub-directory in OneDrive, in /Apps/Joplin and reads/writes the notes and notebooks in it. The application does not have access to anything outside this directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>desktop application</strong> or <strong>mobile application</strong>, select "OneDrive" as the synchronisation target in the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a>. Then, to initiate the synchronisation process, click on the "Synchronise" button in the sidebar and follow the instructions.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>terminal application</strong>, to initiate the synchronisation process, type <code>:sync</code>. You will be asked to follow a link to authorise the application (simply input your Microsoft credentials - you do not need to register with OneDrive).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">S3 synchronisation</h2>
<p dir="auto">As of Joplin 2.x.x, Joplin supports multiple S3 providers. We expose some options that will need to be configured depending on your provider of choice. We have tested with UpCloud, AWS, and Linode. others should work as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>desktop application</strong> or <strong>mobile application</strong>, select "S3 (Beta)" as the synchronisation target in the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a>.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>S3 Bucket:</strong> The name of your Bucket, such as <code>joplin-bucket</code></li>
<li><strong>S3 URL:</strong> Fully qualified URL; For AWS this should be <code>https://s3.&lt;regionName&gt;.amazonaws.com/</code></li>
<li><strong>S3 Access Key &amp; S3 Secret Key:</strong>  The User's programmatic access key.  To create a new key &amp; secret on AWS, visit <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/security_credentials" rel="nofollow">IAM Security Credentials</a>. For other providers follow their documentation.</li>
<li><strong>S3 Region:</strong> Some providers require you to provide the region of your bucket. This is usually in the form of "eu-west1" or something similar depending on your region. For providers that do not require a region, you can leave it blank.</li>
<li><strong>Force Path Style</strong>: This setting enables Joplin to talk to S3 providers using an older style S3 Path. Depending on your provider you may need to try with this on and off.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">While creating a new Bucket for Joplin, disable <strong>Bucket Versioning</strong>, enable <strong>Block all public access</strong> and enable <strong>Default encryption</strong> with <code>Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3)</code>. Some providers do not expose these options, and it could create a syncing problem. Do attempt and report back so we can update the documentation appropriately.</p>
<p dir="auto">To add a <strong>Bucket Policy</strong> from the AWS S3 Web Console, navigate to the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab. Temporarily disable <strong>Block all public access</strong>  to edit the Bucket policy, something along the lines of:</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration settings for tested providers</h3>
<p dir="auto">All providers will require a bucket, Access Key, and Secret Key.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you provide a configuration and you receive "success!" on the "check config" then your S3 sync should work for your provider. If you do not receive success, you may need to adjust your settings, or save them, restart the app, and attempt a sync. This may reveal more clear error messaging that will help you deduce the problem.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">AWS</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>URL: <code>https://s3.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com/</code> (fill in your region, a complete list of endpoint adresses can be found <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>)</li>

<li>Force Path Style: unchecked</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">UpCloud</h3>

<li>Region: required</li>
<li>Force Path Style: unchecked</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Encryption</h2>
<p dir="auto">Joplin supports end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on all the applications. E2EE is a system where only the owner of the notes, notebooks, tags or resources can read them. It prevents potential eavesdroppers - including telecom providers, internet providers, and even the developers of Joplin from being able to access the data. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/e2ee.md">End-To-End Encryption Tutorial</a> for more information about this feature and how to enable it.</p>
<p dir="auto">For a more technical description, mostly relevant for development or to review the method being used, please see the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/spec/e2ee.md">Encryption specification</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Note history</h2>
<p dir="auto">The Joplin applications automatically save previous versions of your notes at regular intervals. These versions are synced across devices and can be viewed from the desktop application. To do so, click on the "Information" button on a note, then click on "Previous version of this note". From this screen you can view the previous versions of the note as well as restore any of them.</p>
<p dir="auto">This feature can be disabled from the "Note history" section in the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a>, and it is also possible to change for how long the history of a note is saved.</p>
<p dir="auto">More information please see the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/note_history.md">Note History page</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">External text editor</h2>
<p dir="auto">Joplin notes can be opened and edited using an external editor of your choice. It can be a simple text editor like Notepad++ or Sublime Text or an actual Markdown editor like Typora. In that case, images will also be displayed within the editor. To open the note in an external editor, click on the icon in the toolbar or press Ctrl+E (or Cmd+E). Your default text editor will be used to open the note. If needed, you can also specify the editor directly in the General Options, under "Text editor command".</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Attachments</h2>
<p dir="auto">Any kind of file can be attached to a note. In Markdown, links to these files are represented as a simple ID to the attachment, clicking on this link will open the file in the default application. In the case of audio, video and pdf files, these will be displayed inline with the note and so can be viewed or played within Joplin.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the <strong>desktop application</strong>, files can be attached either by clicking the "Attach file" icon in the editor or via drag and drop. If you prefer to create a link to a local file instead, hold the ALT key while performing the drag and drop operation. You can also copy and paste images directly in the editor via Ctrl+V.</p>
<p dir="auto">Resources that are not attached to any note will be automatically deleted in accordance to the <a href="#note-history">Note History</a> settings.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Important:</strong> Resources larger than 10 MB are not currently supported on mobile. They will crash the application when synchronising so it is recommended not to attach such resources at the moment. The issue is being looked at.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Downloading attachments</h2>
<p dir="auto">The way the attachments are downloaded during synchronisation can be customised in the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a>, under "Attachment download behaviour". The default option ("Always") is to download all the attachments, all the time, so that the data is available even when the device is offline. There is also the option to download the attachments manually (option "Manual"), by clicking on it, or automatically (Option "Auto"), in which case the attachments are downloaded only when a note is opened. These options should help saving disk space and network bandwidth, especially on mobile.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Notifications</h2>
<p dir="auto">In the desktop and mobile apps, an alarm can be associated with any to-do. It will be triggered at the given time by displaying a notification. How the notification will be displayed depends on the operating system since each has a different way to handle this. Please see below for the requirements for the desktop applications:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Windows</strong>: &gt;= 8. Make sure the Action Center is enabled on Windows. Task bar balloon for Windows &lt; 8. Growl as fallback. Growl takes precedence over Windows balloons.</li>
<li><strong>macOS</strong>: &gt;= 10.8 or Growl if earlier.</li>
<li><strong>Linux</strong>: <code>notify-send</code> tool, delivered through packages <code>notify-osd</code>, <code>libnotify-bin</code> or <code>libnotify-tools</code>. GNOME should have this by default, but install <code>libnotify-tools</code> if using KDE Plasma.</li>

<p dir="auto">On mobile, the alarms will be displayed using the built-in notification system.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Sub-notebooks</h2>
<p dir="auto">Sub-notebooks allow organising multiple notebooks into a tree of notebooks. For example it can be used to regroup all the notebooks related to work, to family or to a particular project under a parent notebook.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/SubNotebooks.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/SubNotebooks.png" alt=""></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In the <strong>desktop application</strong>, to create a subnotebook, drag and drop it onto another notebook. To move it back to the root, drag and drop it on the "Notebooks" header. Currently only the desktop app can be used to organise the notebooks.</li>
<li>The <strong>mobile application</strong> supports displaying and collapsing/expanding the tree of notebooks, however it does not currently support moving the subnotebooks to different notebooks.</li>
<li>The <strong>terminal app</strong> supports displaying the tree of subnotebooks but it does not support collapsing/expanding them or moving the subnotebooks around.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Markdown</h2>
<p dir="auto">Joplin uses and renders a Github-flavoured Markdown with a few variations and additions. In particular it adds math formula support, interactive checkboxes and support for note links. Joplin also supports Markdown plugins which allow enabling and disabling various advanced Markdown features. Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/markdown.md">Markdown Guide</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Custom CSS</h2>
<p dir="auto">Rendered markdown can be customized by placing a userstyle file in the profile directory <code>~/.config/joplin-desktop/userstyle.css</code> (This path might be different on your device - check at the top of the <code>General</code> page of the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a> for the exact path). This file supports standard CSS syntax. Joplin <em><strong>must</strong></em> be restarted for the new css to be applied, please ensure that Joplin is not closing to the tray, but is actually exiting. Note that this file is used for both displaying the notes and printing the notes. Be aware how the CSS may look printed (for example, printing white text over a black background is usually not wanted).</p>
<p dir="auto">The whole UI can be customized by placing a custom editor style file in the profile directory <code>~/.config/joplin-desktop/userchrome.css</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Important: userstyle.css and userchrome.css are provided for your convenience, but they are advanced settings, and styles you define may break from one version to the next. If you want to use them, please know that it might require regular development work from you to keep them working. The Joplin team cannot make a commitment to keep the application HTML structure stable.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Plugins</h2>
<p dir="auto">The <strong>desktop app</strong> has the ability to extend beyond its standard functionality by the way of plugins. These plugins adhere to the Joplin <a href="https://joplinapp.org/api/references/plugin_api/classes/joplin.html" rel="nofollow">plugin API</a> and can be installed &amp; configured within the application via the <code>Plugins</code> page of the <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md">Configuration screen</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">From this menu you can search for plugins uploaded to the <a href="https://github.com/joplin/plugins">Joplin plugins</a> repository as well as manual installation of plugins using a 'Joplin Plugin Archive' (*.jpl) file.<br>
Once the application is reloaded the plugins will appear within the plugins menu where they can be toggled on/off or removed entirely.</p>
<p dir="auto">For more information see <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/plugins.md">Plugins</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Searching</h2>
<p dir="auto">Joplin implements the SQLite Full Text Search (FTS4) extension. It means the content of all the notes is indexed in real time and search queries return results very fast. Both <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#simple_fts_queries" rel="nofollow">Simple FTS Queries</a> and <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#full_text_index_queries" rel="nofollow">Full-Text Index Queries</a> are supported. See below for the list of supported queries:</p>
<p dir="auto">One caveat of SQLite FTS is that it does not support languages which do not use Latin word boundaries (spaces, tabs, punctuation). To solve this issue, Joplin has a custom search mode, that does not use FTS, but still has all of its features (multi term search, filters, etc.). One of its drawbacks is that it can get slow on larger note collections. Also, the sorting of the results will be less accurate, as the ranking algorithm (BM25) is, for now, only implemented for FTS. Finally, in this mode there are no restrictions on using the <code>*</code> wildcard (<code>swim*</code>, <code>*swim</code> and <code>ast*rix</code> all work). This search mode is currently enabled if one of the following languages are detected:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Chinese</li>
<li>Japanese</li>
<li>Korean</li>
<li>Thai</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Supported queries</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Search type</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Single word</td>
<td>Returns all the notes that contain this term.</td>
<td>For example, searching for <code>cat</code> will return all the notes that contain this exact word. Note: it will not return the notes that contain the substring - thus, for "cat", notes that contain "cataclysmic" or "prevaricate" will <strong>not</strong> be returned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Multiple word</td>
<td>Returns all the notes that contain <strong>all</strong> these words, but not necessarily next to each other.</td>
<td><code>dog cat</code> - will return any notes that contain the words "dog" and "cat" anywhere in the note, no necessarily in that order nor next to each other. It will <strong>not</strong> return results that contain "dog" or "cat" only.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Phrase</td>
<td>Add double quotes to return the notes that contain exactly this phrase.</td>
<td><code>"shopping list"</code> - will return the notes that contain these <strong>exact terms</strong> next to each other and in this order. It will <strong>not</strong> return for example a note that contains "going shopping with my list".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prefix</td>
<td>Add a wildcard to return all the notes that contain a term with a specified prefix.</td>
<td><code>swim*</code> - will return all the notes that contain eg. "swim", but also "swimming", "swimsuit", etc. IMPORTANT: The wildcard <strong>can only be at the end</strong> - it will be ignored at the beginning of a word (eg. <code>*swim</code>) and will be treated as a literal asterisk in the middle of a word (eg. <code>ast*rix</code>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Switch to basic search</td>
<td>One drawback of Full Text Search is that it ignores most non-alphabetical characters. However in some cases you might want to search for this too. To do that, you can use basic search. You switch to this mode by prefixing your search with a slash <code>/</code>. This won't provide the benefits of FTS but it will allow searching exactly for what you need. Note that it can also be much slower, even extremely slow, depending on your query.</td>
<td><code>/"- [ ]"</code> - will return all the notes that contain unchecked checkboxes.</td>
</tr>

<p dir="auto">Note: In the CLI client you have to escape the query using <code>--</code> when using negated filters.
Eg. <code>:search -- "-tag:tag1"</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The filters are implicitly connected by and/or connectives depending on the following rules:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>By default, all filters are connected by "AND".</li>
<li>To override this default behaviour, use the <code>any</code> filter, in which case the search terms will be connected by "OR" instead.</li>
<li>There's an exception for the <code>notebook</code> filters which are connected by "OR". The reason being that no note can be in multiple notebooks at once.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Incorrect search filters are interpreted as a phrase search, e.g. misspelled <code>nootebook:Example</code> or non-existing <code>https://joplinapp.org</code>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Search order</h2>
<p dir="auto">Notes are sorted by "relevance". Currently it means the notes that contain the requested terms the most times are on top. For queries with multiple terms, it also matters how close to each other the terms are. This is a bit experimental so if you notice a search query that returns unexpected results, please report it in the forum, providing as many details as possible to replicate the issue.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Goto Anything</h2>
<p dir="auto">In the desktop application, press <kbd>Ctrl+P</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd+P</kbd> and type a note title or part of its content to jump to it. Or type <kbd>#</kbd> followed by a tag name, or <kbd>@</kbd> followed by a notebook name.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Multiple profile support</h2>
<p dir="auto">To create a new profile, open File &gt; Switch profile and select Create new profile, enter the profile name and press OK. The app will automatically switch to this new profile, which you can now configure.</p>
<p dir="auto">To switch back to the previous profile, again open File &gt; Switch profile and select Default.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that profiles all share certain settings, such as language, font size, theme, etc. This is done so that you don't have reconfigure every details when switching profiles. Other settings such as sync configuration is per profile.</p>
<p dir="auto">The feature is available on desktop only for now, and should be ported to mobile relatively soon.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Donations</h2>
<p dir="auto">Donations to Joplin support the development of the project. Developing quality applications mostly takes time, but there are also some expenses, such as digital certificates to sign the applications, app store fees, hosting, etc. Most of all, your donation will make it possible to keep up the current development standard.</p>

<div><p>Amazon now feels more like a racket than an open shopping platform; you can't find posts from your friends on Facebook because it's clogged with unsolicited advertising; and Uber no longer seems like a cool, efficient taxi service, it's morphed instead into a global machine for turning gig workers into the new underclass – it's all part of a process Cory Doctorow has dubbed "enshittification".</p><p>In this feature interview, the&nbsp;Canadian sci-fi author, journalist and digital rights activist explains why the digital world seems so exploitative and tawdry.&nbsp;But he has optimism for how things might be improved in the future.</p></div>

<p>Japan has long prided itself on its pacifist constitution. The country's future after WW II was defined by Article 9 which famously denounced aggression. But, in recent years security has become a paramount concern with increasing tensions around the status of nearby Taiwan and challenges from neighbouring countries. The Japanese are now renegotiating how best to defend themselves and their interests, while holding true to constitutional restraint. What that could mean for the future of Japan and its allies is of global interest and concern.</p>

<p>Global permission to mine the ocean floor — the International Seabed Authority will soon meet and decide whether or not to allow seabed exploitation, and in what circumstances. We'll hear the arguments both for and against and get some background on this little known, but hugely consequential, international regulatory body. Also, will advanced technology one day make the oceans transparent? And if so, what will that mean for the future of submarines – a technology that relies on stealth and secrecy? And why studying ancient tsunamis could help protect us from future disasters.</p>

<p>How best to build our homes so they can better withstand natural disasters? It's not just about designing for floods or fire, for example, but creating structures to withstand multiple threats. And to cope with any change of temperature on top of that? Many countries are facing an increase in climate-related threats, and they're struggling to cope and adapt. In Australia, a review of the National Construction Code is underway and there are calls for higher minimum standards. Should such a crisis design be made mandatory?</p>

<p>Toby Walsh is an expert on Artificial Intelligence. He recently declined an offer to sign an open letter calling for a moratorium on the technology's further development, but he's no techno-utopian. In this feature interview, recorded at the Brisbane Writers Festival, he explains his position and warns the world risks repeating the mistakes made through the unregulated release of social media at the beginning of the century.</p>

<p>Citizen scientists across the world have joined forces to map the microplastic crisis in our oceans. It comes as a UN agency moves to create a global treaty to end plastic pollution. Also, the idea that trees can communicate via extensive networks of underground fungi is increasingly popular, but is it correct? New research casts doubt on the extent of the claim. And, replacing cargo planes with drones – the dream of a European drone cargo airline</p>

<p>Beijing likes to trumpet its economic clout. And as the second largest economy in the world there's no denying its power and influence. But the Chinese economy is a "black box" according to noted historian, Frank Dikötter, which even senior Chinese officials don't fully understand. It's an economic cauldron powered by massive debt, political spin and ideological dogma – a unique fusion of ersatz capitalism and rigid central planning. And unless we in the West get a better understanding of its complexity, global future prosperity is far from assured.</p>

<p>Bribery involves using money to try and buy a person's favour, but what do you call it when someone uses their resources not to win someone over, but to destroy their political career? Until now, it's had no name. But James D'Angelo, from the Congressional Research Institute in the US, has just invented one . He calls it "brubery" – and it's threatening the very future of Western politics, he says. Also, high tech largess or digital colonialism ? Seeing global tech's expansion from a very different set of eyes.</p>

<p>ChatGPT is a controversial new language assistant powered by AI. It can write essays, do coding and even structure complex research briefs, all in a matter of seconds. To its detractors ChatGPT and other AI-text generating tools represents the beginning of the end of human creativity and a future of universal plagiarism. To the less exuberant, it's a sophisticated new educational tool that has significant flaws and needs to be used judiciously. It's also likely to force a rethink of how we assess students and what it means to be genuinely creative.</p>

<li>We are really bad at writing it.</li>
</ol>

<p>We don’t have good theories on what makes for useful documentation. That is except for the <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">four document model</a>, or <a href="https://diataxis.fr/">Diátaxis</a>.<sup id="fnref:diataxis"><a href="#fn:diataxis">1</a></sup> I’m glad that people use it. I’m also a little frustrated that people use it even when its inappropriate. My problem is that it’s not a universal or comprehensive model: there’s a lot of documentation people need to write that doesn’t neatly fit the model.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-4doc-model">What is the 4doc model?</h2>

<p><img src="https://documentation.divio.com/_images/overview.png" alt="four document types on two axes"></p>

<p>The 4doc model says that user-facing documentation should fall into four categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tutorials</strong> describe how to get up and running as fast as possible.</li>
<li><strong>How-tos</strong> describe how to do <em>specific</em> things.</li>
<li><strong>Explanations</strong> teach a topic you already know in-depth.</li>
<li><strong>References</strong> describe exactly what things are and what they do.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each category serves a different purpose, targets a different audience, and is written in a special style. Tutorials are friendly and simplified, while references are dry and comprehensive.</p>

<p>4doc was originally started by Daniele Procida at Divio to improve their documentation, and has since become popular in the broader tooling ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="my-problems">My problems</h2>

<p>I think of the 4doc model like the five-paragraph essay. In the US, kids are taught to write essays in three parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>A starting paragraph the context and the main thesis,</li>
<li>Three body paragraphs that each independently support the thesis</li>
<li>A concluding paragraph with summarizing the arguments and thesis.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s a good starting point to learn essay writing. The problem is that students think it’s the <em>only</em> way to write essays, and then they cram everything they write into a format straitjacket.</p>

<p>4doc is <em>much</em> better than 5para: I’ve never read a halfway-decent 5-paragraph essay but I’ve read plenty of good 4doc pages. Even so, it still leads to the same kind of “this is the only way” thinking. People use the model even when it’s not the right choice and they don’t vary up the format even when they should.</p>

<p>My specific issue is that the model is not <strong>universal</strong> and it’s not <strong>comprehensive</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="it-s-not-universal">It’s not universal</h3>

<p>From <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/structure/">the structure page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Good examples of the scheme in substantial projects include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the <a href="https://docs.divio.com/">Divio Developer Handbook</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/#how-the-documentation-is-organized">Django’s documentation</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://docs.django-cms.org/">django CMS’s documentation</a></p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Divio and Django CMS are <em>tools</em>. Tools and libraries are different than frameworks and languages. Tools have simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model">conceptual models</a>, the set of interrelated ideas you need to internalize to use them properly. You just need to know <em>what</em> they do and <em>how</em> to use them. The 4doc model, developed at Divio, most reflects the documentation needs of tools.</p>

<p>Look at django. Frameworks are one step up from tools and are still mostly about “what and how”, but they also have a lot of interrelated concepts you need to understand. While it still ostensibly follows the 4doc model, the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/">“explanation” section</a> is triple the size of the tutorial and how-to sections combined.<sup id="fnref:django-measurement"><a href="#fn:django-measurement">2</a></sup> The explanation section also <em>teaches</em> the user, which isn’t supposed to happen:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s not the place of an explanation to instruct the user in how to do something. Nor should it provide technical description. These functions of documentation are already taken care of in other sections. — <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/explanation/">divio</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s only possible to separate explanation and instruction for things if you don’t need a good mental model. Things like tools.</p>

<p>If we zoom out to programming languages (PLs), the 4doc model breaks down entirely. If you look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/">Python</a> docs, the tutorial section needs to also explain and reference, and the references are both explanation and how-to. Language concept maps are just too dense to separate.</p>

<p>I’ve seen some languages try to strictly follow the 4doc model and it doesn’t work. 4doc is oriented around random-access, languages are taught in a sequence-of-lessons. The two don’t mix well.</p>

<p>In short, the 4doc model is <strong>not universal</strong>. It was designed for documenting <em>tools</em> and doesn’t fully address the needs of frameworks and programming languages.</p>

<h3 id="it-s-not-comprehensive">It’s not comprehensive</h3>

<p>4doc would be comprehensive if all useful forms of documentation fell into one of the four types. This isn’t true for the same reason 4doc is nonuniversal: it only covers documentation forms that are necessary for tools.</p>

<p>If you’re documenting a complex topic like a programming language, there’s at least (at least) two more kinds of docs you’ll want:</p>

<h4 id="1-conceptual-overviews">1. Conceptual Overviews</h4>

<p>If I was presented with 4doc-following documentation and had to add just one thing to it, I’d write a conceptual overview.</p>

<p><dfn>Conceptual overviews</dfn>
 cover the concepts of the tool/framework/language. It presents what the big picture of what this is all <em>for</em> and previews the conceptual model users will learn. The denser the model, the more you need a conceptual overview.</p>

<p>The 4doc model describes documentation types in terms of cooking, so here’s one for conceptual overviews:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All soups work in the same basic way: prepare ingredients like vegetables and meat and boil them in water. This softens the ingredients and flavors the water (“broth”). We can make higher-quality soups by first cooking some ingredients in oil (which develops more flavors), adding some ingredients later in the boil (so they don’t get <em>too</em> soft), using a boiling different liquid (like chicken stock or beer), or using spices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a more in-depth example of an overview, you can see <a href="https://learntla.com/intro/conceptual-overview.html">one I wrote for TLA+</a>. It first explains the problem TLA+ is trying to solve (designing complex concurrent systems), introduces the concepts involved (specs, behaviors, properties, models), and only <em>then</em> shows any code. And even then it doesn’t explain how to <em>run</em> the code, just how various aspects of the code relate to the concepts.</p>

<p>(“Aren’t these just a kind of explanations?” Explanations are intended for people who already know, or are in the process of learning, your subject. It comes after the tutorial. Conceptual overviews come <em>before</em> the tutorial. They are for people who are <em>getting ready</em> to learn the subject, or for outsiders evaluating if they <em>want to learn it</em>.)</p>

<h4 id="2-snippets-and-examples">2. Snippets and Examples</h4>

<p>Examples are complete code intended to be studied. Snippets are samples of code intended to be used. As much as we make fun of Stackoverflow-based development, we copy and paste from websites because that works and makes us productive. If you provide them from the start, developers don’t have to find them from sketchy third parties.</p>

<p>Examples also show <em>how something is done</em>, which is subtly-but-fundamentally different from <em>how-to do something</em>. Imagine I present you an example of a code, and then an example of the same code, optimized. I’m not giving you a rote how-to on optimizing code, I’m demonstrating a way of <em>thinking</em> about optimizing code. It all comes back to the mental model.</p>

<p>Or take Julia Evans’ <a href="https://mysteries.wizardzines.com/">debugging mysteries</a>, a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure">Choose Your Own Adventures</a> where the reader debugs a problem. It looks like a how-to, but it’s a branching path, not a linear set of steps.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/problems-with-the-4doc-model/img/wizardzines.png" alt="An example of a debugging mystery, where the user can try a few different things and see why they do (or don't) work"></p>

<p>The cooking analogy would be a video of a chef making a dish and explaining what she’s thinking while she makes it. Or maybe doing a taste-test of undersalted dishes. It’s not a perfect analogy. Written examples don’t make a whole lot of sense in tradecraft.</p>

<h2 id="good-is-the-enemy-of-better">Good is the enemy of better</h2>

<p>I want to be clear: I don’t think 4doc is <em>bad</em>. I think it’s quite good! But I think you have to think about <em>how</em> you’re using it. Like any other tool, you have to evaluate what it does for you. The model says at much:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Diátaxis is based on sound theoretical principles and has been proven in practice, but it’s not the final word in documentation. … the structure it proposes is not intended to be a plan, something you must complete in your documentation. It’s a guide, a map to help you check that you’re in the right place and going in the right directions. — <a href="https://diataxis.fr/how-to-use-diataxis/">How to use Diátaxis</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m unhappy that the original Divio page doesn’t have this disclaimer and instead has big quote calling it the “The Grand Unified Theory of Documentation”. Procida doesn’t seem to be believe this and I wish divio would stop pitching 4doc as the one-and-only documentation system. It might be good for getting people on board but it’s bad for broader documentation innovation.</p>

<h2 id="overview">1. Overview </h2>

<p>The "Cloud Backed SQLite" (CBS) system allows databases to be stored within
cloud storage accounts such that they can be read and written by storage
clients without first downloading the entire database to the client. This
document should be read in concert with the detailed API documentation present
in the two main public header files:

</p><ul>
  <li> <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/blockcachevfs.h">blockcachevfs.h</a>
  </li><li> <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/bcvutil.h">bcvutil.h</a>
</li></ul>

<p>Databases may be accessed concurrently by multiple clients, although ensuring
that only a single client is writing to a database at any time is (mostly) left
to the application. A "client" is a single operating system process system -
within a single client process there may be multiple SQLite handles reading and
writing a database using the usual SQLite WAL-mode read/write locking to 
manage concurrent access between themselves. Existing clients do not see
changes made by writers automatically, they are obliged to explicitly poll
cloud storage to do so.

</p><p>The system currently supports 
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/">Azure Blob Storage</a>
and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage">Google Cloud Storage</a>. It also features
<a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/www/module.wiki">an API that may be used to implement</a> support to other 
cloud storage systems.

</p><p>The software is currently developed on Linux with stock gcc, and on Windows-10
using the MSVC-compatible mingw64 gcc compiler. Other platforms are quite
likely to work too, but have not been tested.

</p><h2 id="storage_format">1.1. Storage Format</h2>

<p>SQLite databases are not stored within the blob storage system in the usual
format. Instead, each database is divided into one or more fixed-size blocks.
The default block-size is 4MB, although this is configurable. Each block is
assigned an id between 16 and 32 bytes (128 and 256 bits) in size (all blocks
in a single container have the same sized ids). The name of each block file
is created by encoding its id in hexadecimal format and adding the extension
".bcv". For example:

</p><pre>  787A5B026DBF882F89748C37AED04CCD.bcv
</pre>

<p>For containers that use ids smaller than 24 bytes in size, each block id is
randomly generated. For manifests that use ids 24 bytes or larger, the first
16 bytes of each id may contain the md5 hash of the block contents, with
the remainder of the id made up by pseudo-random values. See the
section on <a href="#sharing">block sharing</a> below for further details.

</p><p>Along with the block files is a "manifest" file, which contains, amongst other
things, a machine-readable description of how the various block files may be
assembled into into one or more SQLite databases. The name of the manifest
file is always:

</p><pre>  manifest.bcv
</pre>

<p>There is also an SQLite database used to store the contents of the "bcv_kv"
virtual table <span color="red">MAKE THIS LINK SOMEWHERE!</span> named:

</p><pre>  bcv_kv.bcv
</pre>

<p>At present, manifest and block files may only be stored in the root directory
of a blob storage container, not in any sub-directory. This means that each
container contains at most a single manifest file. It may be that this
limitation can be removed if desirable. Other files may be stored in a
container along with the CBS files, but they must not use the ".bcv" extension.
Files that end with ".bcv" may be mistaken for surplus block or other files and
deleted or overwritten by CBS clients. 

</p><p><b>Note:</b> CBS documentation uses the Azure terminology "container" to refer
to the cloud storage virtual receptacle in which block files and manifests are
stored. In Google Storage documentation the analagous concept is a "bucket".
Other cloud storage systems may use their own vernacular.

</p><h2 id="system_components">1.2. System Components</h2>

<p>There are three components to the system:

</p><ol>
  <li> <b>Primitives</b> to:
    <ul><li> Create blob storage containers and populate them
             with empty manifest files (manifest files indicating that the
             container contains no databases).
        </li><li> Destroy entire blob storage containers and their contents.
        </li><li> Upload databases to cloud storage.
        </li><li> Download databases from cloud storage.
        </li><li> Create copies of existing databases within cloud storage.
        </li><li> Delete databases from cloud storage.
        </li><li> List the databases within a cloud storage container.
        </li><li> Clean up (remove) unused blocks from cloud storage.
    </li></ul>
    <p>
      Each primitive is available both as an 
      <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/bcvutil.h">C API</a> that can be called by
      applications, and as a <a href="#commandline">command-line tool</a>.
  </p></li><li> <b>A daemon process</b> that, while running, provides local SQLite
       database clients in the same or different OS process with read-only
       access to databases stored in remote blob storage containers.

<blockquote></blockquote></li><li> <b>A VFS module</b> that may be used in two modes, as follows:
  <ul>
    <li> For read-only access of cloud databases via a running daemon process,
         or
    </li><li> For read/write access of cloud databases in "daemonless" mode.
  </li></ul>
  <p>
  The advantage of using a daemon over daemonless mode is that a single 
  local cache of downloaded database blocks may be shared by multiple
  processes. In daemonless mode, each process is obliged to maintain its 
  own separate cache.
</p></li></ol>

<p>Both the daemon and command line tools are packaged as a single binary
executable - "blockcachevfsd".

</p><h2 id="build">2. Building, Deployment and Testing</h2>

<p>command from the root directory of the source tree.


</p><h3>Adding Application Support </h3>

<div><p>
To add support for the VFS and various primitives, the following C files from
the source code distribution must be built into the application:

</p><pre>    bcvutil.c
    bcvmodule.c
    blockcachevfs.c
    simplexml.c
    bcvencrypt.c
</pre>

<p>The following header files from the source code distribution are required:
</p><pre>    bcvutil.h
    bcvmodule.h
    blockcachevfs.h
    simplexml.h
    bcv_int.h
    bcvencrypt.h
</pre>

<p>As well as SQLite, the application must be linked against libcurl and openssl.

</p><p>The application should not include either "bcv_int.h" or "simplexml.h"
directly. They are required by the build, but are not intended to be used
directly. The other three header files are intended to be used by applications,
they container declarations for APIs that provide the following functionality:

</p><ul>
  <li> Header file <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/blockcachevfs.h">blockcachevfs.h</a> 
       contains APIs required to use the VFS module to access cloud databases
       via usual SQLite interfaces.
  </li><li> Header file <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/bcvutil.h">bcvutil.h</a> 
       contains APIs required to use the various cloud storage primitives.
  </li><li> Header file <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/blockcachevfs.h">bcvmodule.h</a> 
       contains APIs required to extend blockcachevfs to access new
       cloud storage systems (other than Azure Blob Storage and Google Cloud
       Storage, for which there is built-in support).  
</li></ul>
</div>

<h3>Building blockcachevfsd:</h3>
<div><p>
The easiest way to build the "blockcachevfsd" executable that contains both
the daemon and the command line tools is using the standard:

</p><pre>  ./configure &amp;&amp; make
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, it may be built from all sources listed above as required
for adding blockcachevfs support for an application, along with file
"blockcachevfsd.c", which contains the main routine.  
</p></div>

<h3>Testing the system:</h3>
<p>
The blockcachevfs system has an automated test suite. Notes describing its
use may be <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/www/testing.wiki">found here</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="usage">3. Usage </h2>

<h2 id="usage1">3.1. Uploading Databases</h2>

<p>This section illustrates how to upload databases to a blob storage account 
and begin using them. It assumes that cloud storage module name and
authentication details, for example an account name and access key are stored
in a file named "account.txt" in the current directory. Example account.txt
contents for Azure Blob Storage:

</p><pre>  -module azure
  -user devstoreaccount1
  -auth Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==
</pre>

<p>The command-line options above can just as easily be specified directly on the
command-line. But storing them in a file, and then using the 
"-f &lt;file&gt;" option supported by all commands to treat the contents 
of the named file as if they were specified directly on the command-line can
be less cumbersome.

</p><p>To begin, create a container and an empty manifest to which databases may be
uploaded, where $CONTAINER is the container name:

</p><pre>  $ blockcachevfsd create -f account.txt $CONTAINER
</pre>

<p>If the named blob storage container already exists, CBS will clobber any
manifest file within it with a new, empty, manifest file, effectively
deleting any databases in the container.

</p><p>Next, upload one or more databases from the local file system to the blob
storage account. In the following, $LOCALDB is an absolute or relative path
to an SQLite database file and $DBNAME is the name used to access the 
database after it has been uploaded. It is an error if there is already
a database named $DBNAME in the manifest:

</p><pre>  $ blockcachevfsd upload -f account.txt -container $CONTAINER $LOCALDB $DBNAME
</pre>

<h2 id="usage2">3.2. Accessing Databases</h2>

<p>This section explains, by way of example code, how to access a blockcachevfs
datbase stored in cloud storage using an SQL client. The full program is
<a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/www/cloudsql.c">available here</a>. It should be read together with
the API documentation in file <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/blockcachevfs.h">blockcachevfs.h</a>

</p><p>The example code implement a program that accepts four arguments on the command
line:

</p><ul>
  <li> A path to an existing directory to use for a blockcachevfs cache
       directory, 
  </li><li> The name of a container to attach to the new blockcachevfs VFS
       the program creates,
  </li><li> A path to a database to open using the blockcachevfs VFS, and
  </li><li> An SQL script to evaluate against that database.
</li></ul>

<p>The program creates a VFS, attaches the container, opens a database handle
and then executes the supplied SQL script. The code as presented below omits 
several uninteresting features for brevity - there is no main() routine for
example. But the full version, linked above, contains everything required
for a working application.

</p><p>The following block contains the required #include directives and the
authentication callback for the example application. All applications
require an authentication callback, as there is no other way to provide
authentication tokens to system. And there are currently no implementations
of cloud storage modules that do not require authentication tokens.

</p><div>
<pre>/*
** The code in this file creates and uses a VFS, but it doesn't use any 
** cloud storage primitives or implement a new cloud storage module, so 
** it only needs to include "blockcachevfs.h". And "sqlite3.h" of course.
*/
#include "blockcachevfs.h"
#include "sqlite3.h"

/*
** This program is hardcoded to access an Azure emulator running on port
** 10000 (the default for Azurite) of the localhost. It is also hardcoded
** to the demo account - the account built-in to the emulator with the

*/ 
#define CS_STORAGE "azure?emulator=127.0.0.1:10000"
#define CS_ACCOUNT "devstoreaccount1"
#define CS_KEY "Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw=="

/*
** Authentication callback. A real application would return a different 
** authentication token based on the storage system, account name and 
** container name parameters, but since the credentials used by this
** application are hard coded, it just returns a copy of constant string
** CS_KEY.
**
** Because the API is defined such that this function must return a buffer
** allocated using sqlite3_malloc() or compatible, this implementation
** uses sqlite3_mprintf() to make a copy of the authentication token.
*/
static int csAuthCb(
  void *pCtx,
  const char *zStorage,
  const char *zAccount,
  const char *zContainer,
  char **pzAuthToken
){
  *pzAuthToken = sqlite3_mprintf("%s", CS_KEY);
  return (*pzAuthToken) ? SQLITE_OK : SQLITE_NOMEM;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>The next block contains the start of the cloudsql() function, which does the
bulk of the work for this application. It begins by creating the VFS object.
Note that, like almost all other blockcachevfs APIs, if an error occurs the
sqlite3_bcvfs_create() function returns an error message in a buffer that
must be freed by the caller using sqlite3_free().

</p><p>Once the VFS has been created successfully, the application can use the
sqlite3_bcvfs_isdaemon() API to see if the VFS has connected to a daemon or
is running in daemonless mode.

</p><p>If, when sqlite3_bcvfs_create() is called, there is a daemon process using the
specified directory as its cache directory, then the VFS created by the
sqlite3_bcvfs_create() call automatically connects to the daemon and 
provides read-only access. The daemon can be started using the following
command line:

</p><pre>    blockcachevfsd daemon $DIRECTORY
</pre>

<p>where $DIRECTORY above must be the same string as passed to cloudsql()
function below via the zDir parameter. If a daemon process was using the
directory for its cache directory, but has since exited, the
sqlite3_bcvfs_create() call will fail. 

</p><p>If there has never been a daemon running in the directory, then the call to
sqlite3_bcvfs_create() creates a VFS running in daemonless mode. In this mode
it requires exclusive access to the directory. If there is some other
daemonless VFS already running in the specified directory, the call to
sqlite3_bcvfs_create() fails with SQLITE_BUSY.

</p><div>
<pre>/*
** Open a VFS that uses directory zDir as its cache directory. Then attach
** container zCont. Next, open an SQLite handle on path zPath using the new 
** VFS and execute SQL script zSql.
*/
static int cloudsql(

<p>Following this, assuming it was create successfully, the code connects the
authorization callback to the new VFS. And then "attaches" the cloud 
storage container specified by the user to the VFS. 

</p><p>Before the databases in a cloud storage container can be accessed, it must 
be attached to the VFS. Once it has been attached, SQL clients may access

  ** attached the container to the daemon. Secondly, VFS objects store their
  ** state in the cache directory so that if they are restarted, all

</div>

<p>Once the container is attached to the VFS, the database handle is opened
and the SQL script executed. Before the script is executed though,
sqlite3_bcvfs_register_vtab() is called to make the virtual tables available
to the database handle.

</p><p>For the sake of brevity, the code below omits the sqlite3_exec() callback

  if( rc==SQLITE_OK ){
    sqlite3_exec(db, zSql, 0, 0, &amp;zErr);
  }
</pre>
</div>

<p>Finally, the cloudsql() function cleans up the two handles it allocated,
outputs any error message and returns.

</p><div>
<pre>  sqlite3_close(db);
  sqlite3_bcvfs_destroy(pVfs);

  /* Output any error, free any error message and return. */
  if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){

</div>

<h2 id="secure">3.3. Secure Containers </h2>

<p>When running in daemon mode, containers may be attached either securely or
insecurly. By default, containers are attached to a daemon insecurely. This
means that:

</p><ul>
  <li><p>Any local process that can connect to the daemon's listening socket 
       may read and write the database, and that
  </p></li><li><p>Even after the daemon process has stopped, any cached parts of 
       databases in attached containers may be read directly from the 
       cache file.
</p></li></ul>

<p>When containers are attached securely, all data stored in the cache file
is encrypted using 128-bit AES OFB encryption. Local clients obtain the
encryption key from the daemon process by supplying valid cloud storage
credentials - a client is granted the encryption key only if it can prove 
that it already has permission to access the database within cloud storage.
Cloud storage credentials are verified only once, when the client first
connects, so it is quite possible for a client to remain connected to a
daemon process and accessing a database long after its supplied credentials 
have expired.

</p><p>A container is nominated as secure when it is first attached to a daemon,
by specifying the SQLITE_BCV_ATTACH_SECURE flag along with the
sqlite3_bcvfs_attach() call.

</p><p>There are two known disadvantages to attaching containers securely:

</p><ul>
  <li><p>Blocks are stored unencrypted in cloud storage. This means that as
       well as local clients encrypting and decrypting individual database 
       pages as they are read, each time a block is downloaded the entire block
       must be encrypted before it can be stored in the cache file.  Under some
       cirumstances this overhead may be significant.

</p><blockquote></blockquote></li><li><p> If the daemon process crashes or is killed after data is written 
       to a secure container database but before said data has been uploaded
       to cloud storage, the data is lost.
</p></li></ul>

<h2 id="modules">4. Cloud Storage Modules and Authentication</h2>

<p>All CBS APIs and command-line tools accept a "module" specification, which
determines the cloud storage system that the system operates on and how
it operates. There are two built-in modules, "azure", which works with
Azure Storage, and "google", which works with Google Cloud Storage. There
is also <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/www/module.wiki">an API</a> that may be used to add new cloud
storage modules.

</p><p>A module specification consists of the module name optionally followed by
one or more URI style key/value parameters. For example:

</p><pre>  azure
  azure?sas=1
  azure?emulator=127.0.0.1:10000&amp;sas=1
</pre>

<p>There is no default module. It must always be specified explicitly.

</p><p>As well as a module specification, CBS APIs and command-line tools require
a user-name and an authentication value - a string containing cloud storage
authentication information. Exactly how these are interpreted depends on the
module specification. The values expected by the two built-in modules, and how
they are used, are described in the following two sections.

</p><h2 id="azure">4.1 The Built-In "azure" Module</h2>

<p>The "azure" module is used to interface with Azure Storage. The value provided
as a user-name is used as the Azure user name when connecting. The
authentication value may either be the corresponding 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage">
account access-key</a> (shared-key access), or an 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview">
Azure Shared Access Signature token</a>, depending on the URI style parameters
provided along with the module name.

</p><p>One way to generate an SAS token for Azure is to use the "az" command line
tool. For example, given account $ACCOUNT with access-key $ACCESSKEY, to
generate an SAS token that allows read/write access to container $CONTAINER and
expires on the 15th of April, 2020:

</p><pre>  az storage container generate-sas -o tsv 
      --account-name $ACCOUNT 
      --account-key $ACCESSKEY 
      --expiry 2020-04-15 
      --name $CONTAINER 
      --permissions dlrw
</pre>

<p>The daemon process and some command-line commands may also use read-only SAS
tokens. To generate a read-only token, the --permissions option in the command
above should be passed "lr" instead of "dlrw".

</p><p>The following URI style parameters may be used to modify the behaviour of the
azure module:
</p><table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Option</th><td></td><th> Interpretation
  </th></tr><tr><td>emulator</td><td></td><td>
          If this option is present, it indicates that CBS should connect to an
          Azure emulator instead of to a real Azure cloud storage account. Both
          the open source <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite">azurite</a>
          and the 
          <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator">legacy emulator</a> 
          are supported. The value of this option should be set to the
          "host:portnumber" address of the port on which the emulated Azure
          blob service is running. If using either supported emulator on the
          local machine with default options, this address is
          "127.0.0.1:10000".
</td></tr><tr><td>sas</td><td></td><td>This option must be set to either "0" (the
          default) or "1". If it is set to 1, then the module expects the
          provided authentication value to be an SAS token. Otherwise, it
          assumes it to be an access-key.
</td></tr><tr><td>customuri</td><td></td><td>This option may only be present if "sas=1"
          is also specified. Similarly, it may only be set to "0" (the
          default), or "1". If it is set to 1, then a base URI for the
          container must be specified in place of the account name parameter.
          If the specified container name is NULL or a zero-length string,
          then the base URI is used as is as the URI for the remote container.
          Otherwise, the specified container name is appended as a directory
          component to the base URI. For example, if the string value passed as
          the account name for an "customuri=1" module is:

<blockquote><pre>https://photos.contoso.com</pre></blockquote>

<p>and the container name "myforms", then the URI used to access the container manifest is:

</p><blockquote><pre>https://photos.contoso.com/myforms/manifest.bcv</pre></blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, the same container can be accessed by specifying a NULL container name and:

</p><blockquote><pre>https://photos.contoso.com/myforms</pre></blockquote>

<p>as the custom URI value.
</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>For example, to connect to a real Azure account using an SAS token for 
authentication purposes:
</p><pre>  azure?sas=1
</pre><p>
To connect to an Azure blob emulator running on localhost port 10000 (the
default) using an access-key for authentication, either of the following
may be used:
</p><pre>  azure?emulator=127.0.0.1:10000
  azure?emulator=127.0.0.1:10000&amp;sas=0
</pre><p>
Or, to connect to a real Azure account using an access-key for authentication:
</p><pre>  azure
</pre><p>
may be used.

</p><h2 id="google">4.2 The Built-In "google" Module</h2>

<p>The "google" module is used to connect CBS to Google Cloud Storage. The
user-name parameter should be passed the 
<a href="https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/7014113?hl=en">project-id
</a> for the project that owns the storage bucket or buckets to be operated on.
In practice, this is only required for CBS's "create" primitive, and only
then if it needs to 
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/xml-api/reference-headers#xgoogprojectid"> create a new cloud storage container (bucket)</a>. In all other 
cases, an empty string may be specified for the CBS user-name parameter.

</p><p>The authorization value parameter must be passed the text of a 
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#oauth">
Google Cloud access token</a>.

</p><p>The google module does not accept any URI style parameters.

</p><h2 id="details">5. Details and Caveats </h2>
<h2 id="concurrent">5.1. Concurrent Access From Multiple Clients </h2>

<p>The system supports any number of concurrent readers using either daemonless
or daemon mode. Even though no locks are taken, read transactions are not
usually interfered with, even if a new version of the database is pushed by
another host while they are ongoing. This is because block files are never
modified after they are created; new block files are uploaded for each change.
And old block files are not deleted immediately (<a href="#cleanup">see
below</a>), so ongoing read transactions can usually continue to access them
for as long as required.

</p><p>If a database is modified within the cloud storage system, the modifications
do not become automatically visible to existing clients. Until the container
is "polled", clients continue to see the old versions of all databases. A
container may be polled either by calling the sqlite3_bcvfs_poll() API:

</p><pre>    int sqlite3_bcvfs_poll(sqlite3_bcvfs *pFs, const char *zCont, char **pzErr);
</pre>

<p>or the equivalent <a href="#pragma">PRAGMA interface</a>. To be clear, any 
changes made are immediately visible to other SQL clients using the same
read-write daemonless VFS object, but are not visible to SQL clients using
other VFS objects until the container has been polled.

</p><p>Similarly, after changes are made to a cloud storage database via a read-write
daemonless VFS object, the new version of the database is not automatically
uploaded to cloud storage. In order to upload changes to cloud storage so
that they are available to new clients or existing clients after they have
polled the container, use the sqlite3_bcvfs_upload() API:

</p><pre>    int sqlite3_bcvfs_upload(
      sqlite3_bcvfs *pFs,             /* VFS handle */
      const char *zCont,              /* Container (alias) to upload databases of */
      int (*xBusy)(void*,int),        /* Busy-handler callback */
      void *pBusyArg,                 /* First argument passed to xBusy */
      char **pzErr                    /* OUT: Error message */
    );
</pre>

<p>or the equivalent <a href="#pragma">PRAGMA interface</a>.

</p><p>At present, it is not possible to upload changes to a database if there have
been changes made to *any* database in the container since the most recent
poll operation. This is not usually a problem, the container can be polled
and then the upload reattempted.

</p><p>However, the poll operation will fail if there have been changes to one or
more databases in cloud storage for which there are also local changes yet
to be uploaded, or if there are local changes to a database that has been
deleted from cloud storage. It is the responsibility of the user to avoid
this situation - concurrent modifications being made to the same database
at multiple sites - perhaps by using the <a href="#vtab">bcv_kv virtual table</a>.

</p><h2 id="cleanup">5.2. Deleting Old Blocks</h2>

<p>Once they have been uploaded, blocks are never modified within cloud storage.
Instead, when a database is modified, new block files are uploaded for the
modified regions and the manifest updated to refer to the new list of blocks.
This makes managing reader/writer concurrency easier, and facilitates 
<a href="#sharing">block sharing</a>, but also means that as time passes a 
large number of unused block files may accumuate within cloud storage.

</p><p>Unused block files may be removed by invoking the sqlite3_bcv_cleanup()
interface from <a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/bcvutil.h">bcvutil.h</a>:

</p><pre>    int sqlite3_bcv_cleanup(sqlite3_bcv *p, int nSecond);
</pre>

<p>In order to avoid disturbing existing read clients, the second parameter
may be used to specify the minimum number of seconds the block must have
been unused for to be considered eligible for cleanup.

</p><h2 id="sharing">5.3. Block Sharing</h2>

<p>Sometimes, a single block may be used by multiple databases within a 
manifest, saving cloud storage space and bandwidth. This is known as
"block sharing". Block sharing occurs in two scenarios:

</p><ul>
  <li> If a copy of a database is made using the 
       <a href="#copy_command">command line copy primitive</a>, then the copy
       shares all of its blocks with the original. This takes place regardless
       of the configured size of block ids for the manifest file.

<blockquote></blockquote></li><li> If the configured block-id size for a manifest file is greater than
       or equal to 24 bytes, then the first 16 bytes of each block id is
       an md5 hash of the block contents. In this case, before each new 
       block is uploaded, the system checks to see if there already exists a
       block with the same md5 hash (and hence, we assume, the same content)
       that can be used in its place.
       <p>
       This usually only occurs when a database being uploaded is a copy or
       slightly modified copy of an existing database, or when an existing
       database is overwritten with a copy of another database using the
       SQLite backup API.
       </p>
</li></ul>

<p>The block id size used by a manifest file must be configured when the 
manifest is first created using the 
<a href="#create_command">command line create command</a> or equivalent
API. If block sharing using md5 hash values is required, then the block id size
should be set to 24 bytes. Otherwise, it is best left set to the default value
of 16 bytes to save space.

</p><h2 id="pragma">5.4. Pragma Interface</h2>

<p>Blockcachevfs currently supports three PRAGMA statements - "PRAGMA bcv_upload"
, "PRAGMA bcv_poll" and "PRAGMA bcv_client". If further PRAGMA commands are
added in the future, the names of the new commands will begin with "bcv_".

</p><p><b> PRAGMA bcv_upload </b>

</p><p>Blockcachevfs database clients may execute the following PRAGMA statement
to force any changes made locally to be uploaded to the cloud storage
account:

</p><pre>  PRAGMA [database].bcv_upload
</pre>

<p>The PRAGMA statements does not return until the upload is complete. If
successful, an empty string is returned. If an error occurs and the upload
cannot be completed, an SQLite error code is returned and the error message
set to an English language explanation of the error.

</p><p>Invoking this PRAGMA is different to using the sqlite3_bcvfs_upload() 
interface in that this command only uploads changes for the current database,
whereas sqlite3_bcvfs_upload() uploads all locally modified databases in
the container.

</p><p><b> PRAGMA bcv_poll </b>

</p><p>Invoking "PRAGMA bcv_poll":

</p><pre>  PRAGMA [database].bcv_poll
</pre>

<p>is the equivalent to calling sqlite3_bcvfs_poll() on the container that the
database is a part of. If successful, an empty string is returned. Otherwise,
an SQLite error code is returned and the error message set to an English
language explanation of the error.

</p><p><b id="pragma_bcv_client"> PRAGMA bcv_client </b>

</p><p>Invoking "PRAGMA bcv_client":

</p><pre>  PRAGMA [database].bcv_client
  PRAGMA [database].bcv_client = NAME
</pre>

<p>This PRAGMA is used to set or query a cloudsqlite database connection's client
name. The configured client name appears in the "client" column of the
<a href="#bcv_http_log">bcv_http_log</a> virtual table for requests associated
with the current database connection. It may also appear in log messages. It is
not used for any other purpose. The default client name is an empty string.

</p><h2 id="vtab">5.5. Virtual Table Interface</h2>

<p>The virtual table interface consists of three eponymous virtual tables
(or two in daemon mode). It is not available automatically, but must be
made available to each SQLite connection explicitly by calling the
sqlite3_bcvfs_register_vtab() API from 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/cloudsqlite/doc/trunk/src/blockcachevfs.h">blockcachevfs.h</a>:

</p><pre>    int sqlite3_bcvfs_register_vtab(sqlite3*);
</pre>

<p><b>The bcv_container table:</b>

</p><p>The read-only "bcv_container" table contains one row for each container
attached to the VFS. It has the equivalent of the following schema:

</p><pre>    CREATE TABLE bcv_container(
      name      TEXT,          -- local name (alias) of container 
      storage   TEXT,          -- cloud storage system (e.g. "azure")
      user      TEXT,          -- cloud storage username
      container TEXT,          -- container name in cloud storage
      ncleanup  INTEGER        -- number of blocks eligible for cleanup
    )
</pre>

<p>Column "name" contains the local alias of the attached container (this
may be the same as the remove container name). Columns "storage", "user"
and "container" contain the storage module, account and cloud storage
container names as specified to sqlite3_bcvfs_attach() when the container
was attached.

</p><p>The "ncleanup" column usually contains the number of blocks that will 
be deleted from cloud storage if a cleanup operation (see the 
sqlite3_bcv_cleanup() API)is run on the container. However, if
errors or client crashes have occurred while uploading changes to
cloud storage, then there may be extra unused blocks left in the
cloud storage container. In this case those blocks will be deleted
by the next cleanup operation, but are not included in the value
stored in the "ncleanup" column of the "bcv_container" table.

</p><p>The bcv_container table is available in both daemon and daemonless
mode.

</p><p><b>The bcv_database table:</b>

</p><p>The read-only "bcv_database" table contains one row for each database in each
attached container. It has the equivalent of the following schema:

</p><pre>    CREATE TABLE bcv_database(
      container TEXT,          -- local name (alias) of container
      database  TEXT,          -- name of database
      nblock INTEGER,          -- total number of blocks in database
      ncache INTEGER,          -- number of blocks in cache
      ndirty INTEGER,          -- number of dirty blocks in cache
      walfile BOOLEAN,         -- true if transactions in local wal file
      state TEXT               -- state of database (see below)
    )
</pre>

<p>The "container" column contains the local alias of the container (the
same value that is stored in the "name" column of the bcv_container
table). Column "database" contains the database name.

</p><p>Columns "nblock", "ncache" and "ndirty" contain the total number of
blocks in the database, the number of those blocks that are currently
cached locally, and the number of those cached blocks that are dirty
and require uploding. It is always true that:

</p><pre>    nblock &gt;= ncache &gt;= ndirty
</pre>

<p>Boolean column "walfile" is set to true if there are currently write
transactions in a local wal file (blockcachevfs databases are always
in wal mode). To determine whether or not there have been local 
changes to a database, an application might use a query similar to:

</p><pre>    SELECT (walfile OR ndirty&gt;0) AS has_local_changes FROM bcv_database WHERE...
</pre>

<p>The "state" column usually contains an empty string. There are two
exceptions:

</p><ul><li>If the database has been created using sqlite3_bcvfs_copy() but
       not yet uploaded, then this column contains the text 'copied'.</li></ul>

<ul><li>If the database has been deleted using sqlite3_bcvfs_delete() but
       the delete operation has not yet uploaded, then this column contains the
       text 'deleted'.</li></ul>

<p>The bcv_database table is available in both daemon and daemonless
mode.

</p><p><b id="bcv_http_log">The bcv_http_log table:</b>

</p><p>The "bcv_http_log" table contains one row for each HTTP request made
by the VFS or connected daemon. It has the equivalent of the following
for a schema:

</p><pre>     CREATE TABLE bcv_http_log(
       id INTEGER,              -- Unique, monotonically increasing id value
       start_time TEXT,         -- Time request was made, as iso-8601
       end_time TEXT,           -- Time reply received, as iso-8601 (or NULL)
       method TEXT,             -- "PUT", "GET" etc.
       client TEXT,             -- Name of client that caused request
       logmsg TEXT,             -- Log message associated with request
       uri TEXT,                -- URI of request
       httpcode INTEGER         -- HTTP response code (e.g. 200)
     ) 
</pre>

<p>For those requests that can be associated with a single SQLite database
handle, the contents of the "client" column is the client name as
configured using the <a href="#pragma_bcv_client">PRAGMA bcv_client</a> command.
For requests associated with a prefetch operation, it contains the string
'prefetch'.

</p><p>To prevent it from consuming an ever-increasing amount of memory, entries 
are automatically removed from the bcv_http_log on a first-in/first-out
according to the values configured for the SQLITE_BCV_HTTPLOG_TIMEOUT 
and SQLITE_BCV_HTTPLOG_NENTRY parameters. Or, in daemon mode, according
to the values passed via the --httplogtimeout and --httplognentry 
command-line options.

</p><p>Including various overheads, each entry may be assumed to consume 
256 bytes of memory or less. So allowing 4096 entries to accumulate in
the bcv_http_log table may require up to 1MiB of memory.

</p><p><b>The bcv_kv table:</b>

</p><p>The schema of the "bcv_kv" table is:

</p><pre>    CREATE TABLE bcv_kv(
      name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,   -- Key value 
      value                    -- Associated payload value
    )
</pre>

<p>Unlike the other two eponymous virtual tables described in this section, the
bcv_kv table is read-write. Applications may write arbitrary data to the table
to be stored in the cloud storage container. The table is empty when the
container is first created.

</p><p>The contents of the bcv_kv table is stored as a separate file (an
SQLite database) in the cloud container - "bcv_kv.bcv". 

</p><p>The bcv_kv table implements transaction-like properties. As follows:

</p><ul>
  <li> The first time in a database transaction that the bcv_kv table 
       is read or written, the file is downloaded from cloud storage and cached
       for the duration of the transaction. All user queries - read and write -
       are executed against this cached version of the bcv_kv table. This
       ensures that each transaction sees a consistent version of the table
       contents.
  </li><li> When a read/write transaction is committed, a new version of the bcv_kv
       table data is uploaded to cloud storage. At this point, if it is found
       that the file has been modified within cloud storage since it was
       downloaded at the beginning of the transaction (because some other
       client wrote to it), the commit fails and the transaction is rolled
       back. The extended error code in this case is SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT.
</li></ul>

<p>Because the entire bcv_kv table is downloaded (and, for write transactions,
uploaded) for each transaction, applications should avoid storing large
amounts of data within it.

</p><p><b id="bcv_kv_meta">The bcv_kv_meta table:</b>

</p><p>The schema of the "bcv_kv_meta" table is:

</p><pre>    CREATE TABLE bcv_kv_meta(
      name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,   -- Header field name
      value                    -- Header field value
    )
</pre>

<p>The bcv_kv_meta table is similar to the bcv_kv table, in that querying it
causes cloudsqlite to download the bcv_kv.bcv database file and cache it
for the remainder of the transaction. Instead of providing read/write access
to the contents of the bcv_kv.bcv database, it provides read-only access
to two of the http headers recieved from the cloud storage server when the
file was downloaded - "Date" and "Last-Modified".

</p><p>The bcv_kv_meta table always contains exactly two rows. The first contains
the string 'date' in the "name" column, and the value of the timestamp from the
HTTP "Date:" header, in ISO-8601 format, in the "value" column. The second row
contains 'last-modified' in the "name" column, and the ISO-8601 equivalent
of the timestamp from the HTTP "Last-Modified:" header in "value".

</p><p>If, for some reason, the cloud storage server does not provide a "Date:" or
"Last-Modified:" header, or if the contents of that header cannot be parsed,
the corresponding "value" field in the bcv_kv_meta table is set to NULL.

</p><h2 id="commandline">6. Command Line Reference </h2>

<p>The following options are supported by all or most of the commands enumerated
below. All commands accept unique prefixes of any option in place of the full
option string.
</p><table>
<tbody><tr><td>Option
    </td><td>Argument
</td></tr><tr><td>-user</td><td>USER-NAME
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p>
    The user or account name to use when accessing cloud storage.
</p></td></tr><tr><td>-auth</td><td>ACCESS-KEY
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p>
    The authentication information to use when accessing cloud 
    storage. The form of this depends on the cloud storage module in use.
</p></td></tr><tr><td>-container</td><td>CONTAINER-NAME
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p>
    The blob storage container to read from or write to. This option is 
    accepted (and required) by the commands "upload", "delete", "list" 
    and "download" only. 
</p></td></tr><tr><td>-file</td><td>PATH
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p>
    This option tells the comand to read the local text file at relative or
    absolute path PATH and treat its contents as whitespace separated command
    line arguments. 
</p></td></tr><tr><td>-module</td><td>MODULE-NAME
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p>
    The cloud storage module to use to access the remote container. This may
    be a simple module name (e.g. "google") or a module name followed by
    URI style parameters (e.g. "azure?emulator=127.0.0.1:10000&amp;sas=1").
</p></td></tr><tr><td>-log</td><td>STRING
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>
    The argument to this option determines when log messages are output
    to stdout. If the value contains an "h" character, a message is output 
    each time an HTTP(S) request is issued or a reply received. If a "v"
    is present in the string, libcurl verbose logging is enabled. All other
    characters are ignored. The intepretation of the argument to this
    option is subject to revision at any point. The default value is an
    empty string (no log messages at all).
</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>The following commands are supported:

</p><pre id="copy_command"> blockcachevfsd <b>copy</b> <i>?OPTIONS?</i> <i>DATABASE1</i> <i>DATABASE2</i></pre>
<p> Make a copy of database <i>DATABASE1</i> named <i>DATABASE2</i>. If
      <i>DATABASE2</i> exists it is clobbered by the copy. This operation
      always uses <a href="#sharing">block sharing</a> to avoid uploading any
      new block files.
</p>
<pre id="create_command"> blockcachevfsd <b>create</b> <i>?OPTIONS?</i> <i>CONTAINER</i></pre>
<div>
  <p> Create a new container and add an empty manifest file containing zero
  databases to it. It is not an error if the container already exists. In this
  case any existing manifest is clobbered by the new, empty, manifest,
  effectively deleting any databases currently stored in the container.
  </p><p> The following extra options are supported:
  </p><pre>      -blocksize BlOCK-SIZE
      -namebytes BLOCKID-SIZE
</pre>
  <p> The "-blocksize" option is used to set the size of each block file
  stored within cloud storage. The default size is 4MiB. If the argument
  is an integer value it is interpreted as a size in bytes. If an integer value
  followed by a 'k' or 'K' character, a size in KiB. Or, if the argument
  is an integer value followed by an 'm' or 'M' character, a size in MiB.
  The specified size must be a power of two in bytes. The following switches
  all serve to set the block-size to 2MiB: 
  </p><pre>      -blocksize 2M
      -blocksize 2048k
      -blocksize 2097152
</pre>
  <p> The "-namebytes" option may be passed an integer value between
  16 and 32, inclusive, to set the size in bytes of the block ids that
  will be used by the manifest file. The default value is 16. The block id size
  has implications for <a href="#sharing">block sharing</a>.
</p></div>
<pre> blockcachevfsd <b>delete</b> <i>?OPTIONS?</i> <i>NAME</i></pre>
<p> Remove database NAME from the container identified by the -container
  option. 
</p>
<pre> blockcachevfsd <b>destroy</b> <i>?OPTIONS?</i> <i>CONTAINER</i></pre>
<div>
  <p> Delete an entire blob storage container and its contents.
  </p><p> WARNING: Deleting a container from Azure blob storage is (apparently) a
      lazily executed operation. Even though the container appears to be removed
      immediately, it still exists in some senses as Azure prevents a new 
      container with the same name from being created for some time. Sometimes
      this condition persists for up to 24 hours or longer. For this reason, it
      is better to "create -clobber" a container instead of attempting to
      delete and then recreate it.
</p></div>
<pre> blockcachevfsd <b>download</b> <i>?OPTIONS?</i> <i>NAME</i> ?<i>LOCALFILE</i>?</pre>
<div>
  <p> Download the named database from the container specified by the
  -container option to the local file-system. If the <i>LOCALFILE</i> argument
  is specified, then it is the local file-system path to store the downloaded
  database at. If no <i>LOCALFILE</i> argument is specified, the downloaded
  database is stored in the current directory using the same name as is used
  in cloud storage.
  </p><p> The download command supports the following additional option:
  </p><pre>      -nrequest N
</pre><p>
  This option sets the number of HTTP(S) requests that are allowed to be
  outstanding at any one time. The default value is 1. Using a higher value
  might increase throughput.
</p></div>
<pre> blockcachevfsd <b>upload</b> <i>?OPTIONS?</i> <i>DATABASE-FILE</i> <i>?NAME?</i></pre>
<div>
  <p> Upload the specified local database file to and add it to the manifest in
  the container identified by the -container option. If the NAME parameter is
  present then it is used as the name of the uploaded remote database. Otherwise,
  the remote database takes the same name as the local file, with any directory
  components removed.
  </p><p> The upload command supports the following additional option:
  </p><pre>      -nrequest N
</pre><p>
  This option sets the number of HTTP(S) requests that are allowed to be
  outstanding at any one time. The default value is 1. Using a higher value
  might increase throughput.

</p></div>

<p>The eight commands above mirror the eight APIs made available to database
clients (attach and detach by blockcachevfs.h, the others by bcvutil.h).
The following commands are also supported, but are considered a convenience
only. The command-line options and the output of the following are subject
to change at any time:

</p><pre> blockcachevfsd <b>files</b> <i>?OPTIONS?</i> <i>CONTAINER</i></pre>
<p> List the files in the specified container, one per line. All files 
      are listed, even those that are not part of blockcachevfs databases.
</p>
<pre> blockcachevfsd <b>list</b> <i>?OPTIONS?</i> </pre>
<p> If there is no -container option, list all databases in all containers in
  the blob storage account. Or, if the -container option is passed, list only
  the databases in the specified container.
</p>
<pre> blockcachevfsd <b>manifest</b> <i>?OPTIONS?</i> <i>CONTAINER</i></pre>
<p> Output a human-readable version of the manifest file found in the
      specified container.
</p>

<h2 id="daemon">7. Daemon Command Reference </h2>

<p>The daemon process is started as follows:

</p><pre> blockcachevfsd <b>daemon</b> <i>?OPTIONS?</i> <i>DIRECTORY</i> </pre>

<p>The daemon command supports the following options:
</p><table>
<tbody><tr><td>Option
    </td><td>Argument
    </td><td>Default Value
</td></tr><tr><td>-addr</td><td>IPV4-ADDRESS</td><td>(default - "127.0.0.1")
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>
    Normally, the daemon listens and accepts connections from client on
    the localhost address (127.0.0.1). This option allows the daemon to
    listen for connections on some other local address.
</p></td></tr><tr><td>-cachesize</td><td>CACHE-FILE-SIZE</td><td>(default 1G)
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>
    Database file blocks downloaded from the blob storage account are cached
    locally. The cache is allowed to grow up to the size configured by this
    option, then blocks are expelled on a least-recently-used basis as new
    blocks are downloaded. The argument to this option must be a positive 
    integer followed by a single "M" or "G" (or "m" or "g") character to
    indicate whether the integer value should be interpreted as a number
    of MiB or GiB. For example, to use a 1GiB cache, either "-cachesize 1024M"
    or "-cachesize 1G" may be specified.
</p></td></tr><tr><td>-httptimeout</td><td>SECONDS</td><td>(default value 600
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>
    The number of seconds to wait before assuming an HTTPS request made to
    cloud storage has been lost. 
</p></td></tr><tr><td>-log</td><td>STRING</td><td>(default value "")
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>
    The argument to this option determines when log messages are output
    to stdout by the daemon process. Each character in the argument string
    turns on different log messages. Characters not listed in the following
    table are ignored. The interpretation of the argument passed to this 
    option is subject to revision at any time.

</p><blockquote><table>
      <tbody><tr> <td> Character</td><td></td><td> Interpretation
      </td></tr><tr><td>m</td><td></td><td>Output a log message each time a message is received
                    from or sent to a connected database client.
      </td></tr><tr><td>h</td><td></td><td>Output a log message each time an HTTP(S) request is
                    set or a reply received.
      </td></tr><tr><td>e</td><td></td><td>Output a log message when various internal "events"
                       occur.  
      </td></tr><tr><td>v</td><td></td><td>Turn on libcurl CURLOPT_VERBOSE logging.
    </td></tr></tbody></table>
</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td>-notimestamps
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>
    This option causes the daemon process to omit the high-resolution 
    timestamps from the log messages it outputs.
</p></td></tr><tr><td>-port</td><td>PORT-NUMBER</td><td>(default - first free tcp port &gt;= 22002)
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>
    The localhost port on which to listen for connections from local
    database clients.
</p></td></tr><tr><td>-httplogtimeout</td><td>SECONDS</td><td>(default value 3600)
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>
    The number of seconds after which entries are automatically removed from
    the <a href="#bcv_http_log">bcv_http_log</a> virtual table. A value of less
    than zero means entries are never removed.
</p></td></tr><tr><td>-httplognentry</td><td>INTEGER</td><td>(default value -1)
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>
    The maximum number of entries allowed in the
    <a href="#bcv_http_log">bcv_http_log</a> virtual table. Once this limit has
    been reached old entries are automatically removed to make way for new.
</p></td></tr><tr><td>-autoexit
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>
    This <b>debugging option</b> causes the daemon process to exit 
    cleanly when the number of local database clients drops to zero.
</p></td></tr><tr><td>-delay</td><td>MS</td><td>0
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>
    This <b>debugging option</b> causes the daemon process to 
    to pause for the specified number of milliseconds before beginning to
    listen for incoming connections.
</p></td></tr><tr><td>-readymessage
</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>
    This <b>debugging option</b> causes the daemon process to print "READY\n"
    to stdout when it is ready to accept incoming client connections. This
    makes it easier to write test scripts that start and stop daemon processes.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Noctis" href="https://images.timeextension.com/24d89b95c4f7a/noctis.large.jpg"><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA5MDAgNTE2Ij48L3N2Zz4=" width="900" height="516" data-original="https://images.timeextension.com/24d89b95c4f7a/noctis.900x.jpg" alt="Noctis"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Time Extension</em></figcaption></figure><p>Even before struggling to create fire, the stars have been mankind’s biggest dream. Oh, to one day reach and explore them, finally find out what is behind that blanket of darkness and light that keeps us sleeping and, sometimes, awake, for hours every day. It is that same belief and dream about the stars that brought many developers to create a universe that could be freely and fully explored. That same belief animated <a href="https://80.style/#/hsp">Alessandro Ghignola</a>, an Italian developer who, in 1996, began working on the first version of the space exploration simulator, <strong>Noctis</strong>. But, in reality, the work began <em>much</em> earlier.</p>
<p>Set in the Feltyrion galaxy – which is around 90 thousand light-years in radius – Noctis presents players with 78 billion stars to chart and explore, along with their accompanying planets, moons and other objects of interest. Each procedurally-generated world offers up its own climate, life forms and – most chillingly of all – ruined civilisations. The aim in Noctis isn't to 'win' as such; instead, players are expected to catalogue their findings as they explore the boundaries of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Speaking with Time Extension today, Ghignola reveals that he started toying on the Amiga with programs that would generate artificial landscapes. “<strong>Mercenary 2</strong> was the big title which changed my perspective since that title had a huge solar system, I thought, I’ll go bigger and build a whole galaxy," he remembers.</p>
<p>Work on the first version of Noctis started on MS-DOS, with Ghignola building a galaxy bigger than the milky way, while keeping the experience a little over 2 MB. "There were many limitations and difficulties, especially since each segment of code could not go beyond 640k of memory," the programmer recalls. For each version, he tried to experiment with features to see if it would maintain a stable framerate, like the reflection of the pilot in the spaceship window.</p>

<p>Only three years later, in 2000, Ghignola finally released Noctis to the public. "No one noticed the game though; I had very few visits to my Geocities homepage." This was the case until Noctis was discovered by the classic "abandonware" website <a href="https://www.homeoftheunderdogs.net/">Home of the Underdogs</a>. "That’s when I started having feedback from fans and speaking to them regularly; Noctis really came to life and started being its own thing." The community loved the sense of being alone in space, the desolation which came while staring into darkness and unknown worlds, but still being able to connect through early 2000s forums and chats.</p>
<p>This is also how one of the most unique features of Noctis, in its fourth version, came to be: the guide. "This is a little bit like an encyclopedia where players can note down the things they find exploring around on the planets: flora, fauna, sea, lakes," Ghignola says. "Despite being a community effort, it was not an online thing; instead, players emailed me their findings, and I would update the guide in each subsequent game’s version."</p>
<p>The guide would stop being updated only years later, in 2014, but by then, Ghignola had long stopped looking after Noctis. The game was instead being kept up to speed by its loving community, which had also released a version with bugfixes called <strong><a href="https://80.style/#/hsp">Noctis IV CE</a></strong> (or <strong>NICE</strong>). A fifth version of Noctis had been in the works for many years, designed for 32-bit systems and with weather effects and new features.</p>

<p>For <strong>Noctis V</strong>, Alessandro had also developed his very own programming language, called L.in.oleum. "It was a low-level programming language, perfectly fine for me, but honestly not that great anyway. In the end, after four versions, I stopped updating it since there were so many better alternatives out there, such as Python. I thought, why bother? I could release the source code if anyone is interested, but lacking instructions, I believe no one would think the struggle was worth it."</p>
<p>But that’s not the only interactive experience he worked on, there are many that have yet to see the light. Among these, he mentions <strong>Crystal Pixels.</strong> "It was all about telling my dreams to a computer; you had a little spaceship called The Fly that you could use to land on little pixel planets. you would find objects on those planets, such as lamps or boards to write on. You could even record your own soundtrack on CD in-game, and then play it back during exploration." He also developed <strong>Avatar</strong>, an update of the original <strong>Rogue</strong>, but mostly featuring animals waving guns around. "Utter chaos," is how he describes it.</p>
<p>Reaching Ghignola was no easy feat, nor was phoning him up to talk. Still, he was pretty happy to talk about Noctis, despite describing himself as totally isolated. "I’m one step away from being a '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori">hikikomori</a>', I barely interact with human beings these days," The programmer mentions that he lost interest and still does not have the willpower to go back to Noctis V. "I was hit by a huge depression in the '90s – in some way, I’m still recovering. These days I just draw comics; I only do things when I’m drawn by passion and, unfortunately, I feel nothing towards going back to programming."</p>

<p>Regarding his depression, things were so bad that in 2001 he refused a possible job at Insomniac. "This happened after I started doing bug reports for <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/ps1/spyro_2_riptos_rage">Spyro 2</a> and got in contact with Craig Stitt at Insomniac. I showed him an engine I was working on, and he invited me, mentioning the company could have a $6k job for me. I refused. I was having panic attacks even going to the next city; how could I ever transfer to California?" We contacted Craig Stitt, and he does remember something to that effect, even though he’s not sure about the job offer. "One thing is for sure: Spyro 2 definitely had a whole slew of bugs, so Alessandro had his hands full," comments Stitt.</p>
<p>While he doesn’t have regrets over the job, there is one thing Ghignola does regret: letting fans down. "I do remember promising several times that I would finish Noctis V and, still after all these years, I’ve never gone back. I’m sorry; I wish I had the strength to go back and finish what I started more than ten years ago."</p>
<p>Ghignola developed Noctis as a reflection of his dreams and exploring a desolate space, while being alone in the universe. Ironically, while now in the middle of his own (very real) isolation, Ghignola wonders how Noctis ended up bringing together people. "The community in Noctis found a way to connect even through isolation. In some way, out of my hands, Noctis became all about connecting with people, rather than escaping them, like I’ve been doing all my life."</p>

Printing fake trades</h3><p>In this volume faking method, the exchange simply prints a ton of fake trades. The trades always take place within the spread, and the volume distribution of the trades is often uniform. No actual orders are submitted or matched.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-17-39-37.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="831" height="304" srcset="https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-17-39-37.png 600w, https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-17-39-37.png 831w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Exchanges that fake trades often have "pretty" volume distributions.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="2-executing-real-trades-but-within-a-network-of-bot-accounts">2. Executing real trades, but within a network of bot accounts </h3><p>This method is more subtle than the previous one, and harder to expose. It's possible that it has been used by many of the top exchanges in the past, including Binance (Binance boss, CZ, is <a href="https://u.today/cz-trading-against-binance-clients-from-300-accounts-cftc-documents-claim?ref=blog.everstrike.io">allegedly</a> in control of more than 300 Binance accounts). It requires the exchange to synchronize a large number of fake accounts, making it technically non-trivial to pull off.</p><h3 id="3-executing-real-trades-by-having-a-bot-account-place-random-market-orders">3. Executing real trades, by having a bot account place random market orders</h3><p>This method is the easiest to implement, and also the riskiest. </p><p>Every few seconds, a bot account on the exchange will place a randomly sized market order.</p><p>The market order will match with another order on the exchange. Typically (but not always), this order is a limit order placed by one of the market makers of the exchange. </p><p>If the market maker is the exchange itself (many crypto exchanges also act like bucket shops, and <a href="https://protos.com/the-history-of-crypto-exchanges-trading-against-their-own-customers/?ref=blog.everstrike.io">trade against their own customers</a>), there is no harm done - the exchange will simply shuffle funds between two of its bot accounts.</p><p>If the market maker is someone else (such as a customer, acting as a market maker), the exchange is essentially paying the customer a spread. The spread can range from 0.01% to 1% of the value of the trade. If done repeatedly, this can cause the exchange to lose a huge amount of money.</p><h2 id="basefex">BaseFEX</h2><p>BaseFEX initially used the third method. </p><p>Every couple of seconds, a market order was submitted by a BaseFEX-controlled bot account. The market order was either a buy or a sell, and was matched with another order in the order book. </p><p>Throughout the course of a day, thousands of market orders were submitted, accumulating a trading volume in the hundreds of millions.</p><p>This went well in the beginning, since BaseFEX was also the sole market maker on its platform. The BaseFEX-controlled market maker account would absorb all of the market orders, and earn all of the spread.</p><p>However, it wasn't long until someone figured out a way to to take advantage of the scheme.</p><h3 id="bertyar88">Bertyar88</h3><p><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile%3Bu%3D2639394&amp;ref=blog.everstrike.io">Bertyar88</a> is your average Eastern European basement dweller - unemployed, and with $1,000 in his account. He came across BaseFEX in June 2019. </p><p>After watching the platform for a while, he discovered that most of the volume there was fake - and came up with a way to take advantage of it. </p><p>Armed with some rudimentary Python knowledge, Bertyar88 coded up a simple trading bot. The bot would place a limit order on each side of the order book on BaseFEX's TRX/XBT market, and periodically refresh the orders, as they were filled, or the price changed. In essence, his bot was a very simple market making bot.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.everstrike.io/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-05-16-23-51.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="575" height="264"><figcaption>Snippet from Bertyar88's bot.

Once you give something away, it's damn near impossible to take it back, even if you plead your case as honestly as Evernote did.<p>Evernote was great. Honestly, it was worth paying for. But they gave away the farm too early, and folks feeling like what they had was being taken away from them spurned a lack of trust. Obsidian made the smartest play by giving you the editor, keeping the files outside of a database so that they're portable (so they feel safe if they ever have to move away), and telling you that if you want to own the sync story that you can, but you can pay to have the cohesive experience on every device.

They had plenty of paying customers. They claimed to be profitable for a long time (eg <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/evernote-raised-prices-got-more-of-us-to-sign-up/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/evernote-rai...</a>). They had trouble with (i) implementing big price hikes, and (ii) a poor, bug-filled user experience. While that was going on, they were facing increasing competition, yet they acting like a monopolist. OneNote, Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Notion, and so on were providing a quality product at a better price. The lesson is one that many HN commenters would never accept. It's possible to set your price too high.

You would think as many times as tech companies have that shot themselves in the foot like this our industry might stop attempting to do this. When does this actually work?

The mobile app wasn't exactly screamingly performant, to put it nicely.  Really basic core use cases, like creating a note, typing in a title and some content, tagging it with a keyword, and saving it, required a lot more clicks than it seemed to me like it should.  Hierarchical tags, while technically supported, seemed like a weird add-on that never got full support.  And Penultimate -- their tablet-centric app that stored data in your Evernote account -- hasn't been updated in several years; I'm actually impressed it continues to work.</p><p>There's plenty of room where they could have built new features, if they'd wanted to.  Off the top of my head, I'd have liked to see Markdown support instead of their quasi-HTML WYSIWYG editor (some versions of the thick client had a subset of Markdown-like syntax but others didn't).  Penultimate would have been great if it had on-device OCR / handwriting recognition, or even just a way of tagging specific pages or page-regions with keywords.</p><p>I think there's a lot of room in the notetaking space.  I'm still waiting for an app that isn't a glorified text editor or a drawing program, but also doesn't lock your data into some unparsable binary format or obscure graph database behind the scenes.  I want to take notes, using a pen, on a tablet, that might or might not be text, and then I want to annotate the shit out of those notes and keyword them and cross-reference them, and I want the whole thing to be searchable and I want the handwriting recognition to not suck, and I want all of this to be encrypted at rest and in transit, and I want native clients for all major desktop and mobile operating systems.</p><p>So, yeah, I don't think notetaking is done quite yet.

If you work offline a lot, you might need to think about a more structured workflow (i.e. using Git).  But for me it wasn't worth the hassle to commit/push every time I wanted to switch devices.  Dropbox (and presumably the many Dropbox-like folder-sync tools) worked fine when I was testing it out.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Meta is taking on Twitter with a new app. Instagram today announced the anticipated launch of its text-based social networking app, <a href="https://www.threads.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Threads</a>, which allows Instagram users to authenticate with their existing credentials in order to post short updates, including text up to 500 characters; links; photos; and videos up to 5 minutes in length.</p>
<p>At launch, Threads is available on iOS and Android in 100 countries, though not in the EU, reportedly due to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/threads-no-eu-launch/">concerns</a> around adhering to local data privacy regulations. Users can log in with their Instagram credentials, where their username and verification status will carry over. However, Threads profiles can be customized independently as well.</p>
<p>The app’s existence was first scooped by <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/meta-mulls-a-twitter-competitor-codenamed-p92-that-will-be-interoperable-with-mastodon-10223961.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoneyControl</a> this March and later confirmed by <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/meta-is-building-a-decentralized" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platformer</a>. In June, Meta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754304/instagram-meta-twitter-competitor-threads-activitypub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previewed</a> the app to employees during a company-wide meeting. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/19/everything-we-know-about-instagrams-twitter-clone-due-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Further leaks</a> offered more details about the app’s target market of high-profile celebrities, influencers and artists, and its planned feature set.</p>
<p>While the Jack Dorsey–backed Twitter rival <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/05/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-app-trying-to-replace-twitter/">Bluesky</a> has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/bluesky-invites-become-a-hot-commodity-as-demand-for-the-twitter-alternative-outstrips-access/">growing</a> in popularity in recent months, leveraging its own decentralized protocol, the AT Protocol, Instagram’s new app will soon offer support for ActivityPub — the same social networking protocol used by open source Twitter rival <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/08/what-is-mastodon/">Mastodon</a>, along with other federated apps.</p>
<p>Once that takes effect, Threads will be able to broaden its reach, as Mastodon’s ecosystem <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/servers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engages</a> 1.7 million active users. But we aren’t sure when exactly Threads will deliver on this feature.</p>
<p>“We’re committed to building support for ActivityPub, the protocol behind Mastodon, into this app. We weren’t able to finish it for launch given a number of complications that come along with a decentralized network, but it’s coming,” Instagram head <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/adam-mosseri-says-metas-threads-app-wont-have-activitypub-support-at-launch/">Adam Mosseri said</a> before launch. “If you’re wondering why this matters, here’s a reason: you may one day end up leaving Threads, or, hopefully not, end up de-platformed. If that ever happens, you should be able to take your audience with you to another server. Being open can enable that.”</p>
<p>However, the choice also puts Threads in competition with other Mastodon clients, including indie apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/24/tapbots-launches-a-new-mastodon-client-ivory-after-twitter-kills-its-tweetbot-app/">Ivory</a> and the Mozilla-funded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/28/mozilla-leads-mastodon-app-mammoths-pre-seed-funding/">Mammoth</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/28/flipboard-joins-the-fediverse-with-a-mastodon-integration-and-community-plans-for-activitypub/">Flipboard</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/06/medium-launches-a-premium-mastodon-instance-as-a-membership-perk/">Medium</a>, and WordPress.com owner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/13/wordpress-com-owner-automattic-acquires-an-activitypub-plugin-so-blogs-can-join-the-fediverse/">Automattic</a> have also invested in the Mastodon ecosystem amid the Twitter exodus. But Meta’s entry into the open decentralized social web has raised <a href="https://reb00ted.org/tech/20230310-meta-activitypub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerns</a> that it’s planning to enact an “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">embrace, extend and extinguish</a>” strategy designed to allow it to dominate in this emerging market, similar to how Google took hold of web-based email.</p>

<h2>“Instagram for your thoughts”</h2>
<p>We have yet to see whether Threads will catch on, though it’s certainly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/03/twitter-competitors-soar-after-yet-another-bad-musk-move/">a great time</a> for Meta to dip its toes into microblogging. It’s worth noting, however, that Meta doesn’t have a good track record when it comes to building successful stand-alone apps.</p>
<p>Over the years, the company has shut down numerous stand-alone apps, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/02/facebook-is-shutting-down-hello-moves-and-the-anonymous-teen-app-tbh-due-to-low-usage/">Hello, Moves</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/30/recycled/">Paper</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/29/one-app-at-a-time/">Poke, Camera</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/04/facebook-home-launch/">Home</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/08/facebook-kills-creative-labs-its-internal-incubator-plus-some-of-its-apps/">Slingshot, Rooms, Riff,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/09/facebook-owned-onavo-quietly-launches-bolt-app-lock-a-data-tracking-app-that-locks-other-apps/">Bolt</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/facebook-shuts-down-its-snapchat-competitor-lifestage-and-its-standalone-groups-app/">Lifestage, Groups</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/19/facebook-stickers-for-messenger/">Stickered</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/24/facebook-is-shutting-down-moments-heres-how-to-save-all-your-photos/">Moments</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/02/nopify/">Notify</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/13/facebook-tries-its-hand-at-group-video-chat-with-bonfire/">Bonfire</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/lasso-facebook-tiktok-shut-down/">Lasso</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/04/meta-novi-pilot-ends/">Novi</a> and others, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/07/instagrams-boomerang-and-hyperlapse-apps-disappear-from-app-stores/">Boomerang, Hyperlapse,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/rip-instagram-direct-app/">Direct</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/28/instagram-is-shutting-down-its-standalone-igtv-app/">IGTV</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/instagram-will-shut-down-its-companion-app-threads-by-year-end/">Threads</a> from Instagram, and virtually all its experiments from it internal incubator, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/metas-npe-team-takes-a-global-focus-with-seed-stage-investments-offices-in-emerging-markets/">NPE team</a>, like BARS, E.gg, Forecast, Collab, Kit, Hobbi, Tuned and more.</p>
<p>To access Threads, users will first need to authenticate using their current Instagram login credentials. The app will then populate with their existing account details, like name, username, photo, and followers. Verification will also roll over to the new app.</p>
<p>This integration gives Instagram’s new app a jump-start in terms of sign-ups — which the company alluded to in earlier <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/19/everything-we-know-about-instagrams-twitter-clone-due-this-summer/">leaked marketing materials</a>, where it noted that with “one tap, anyone can follow the accounts they follow on Instagram.”</p>
<p>Beyond the immediate access to your network, another benefit of the app’s Instagram integration is that it will carry over users’ block lists from Instagram. Plus, it operates under the same Community Guidelines as Instagram, making it easier to understand what’s permitted and what’s not. Users will also be able to toggle what audiences they will allow to reply to each of their posts.</p>
<p>Instagram has been experimenting with other ways for users to connect outside of sharing photos and videos to Reels, Stories and Feeds, including with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/16/instagram-broadcast-chat-feature-channels/">the launch of “broadcast channels</a>” in February 2023, which offered creators a way to more directly connect with followers by posting text, images, polls, reactions, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/17/instagram-starts-supporting-gifs-in-comments-and-collaborators-in-broadcast-channels/">GIFs and more</a> in messages in users’ Instagram inboxes. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has since been using the feature to send out product news.</p>

<p>Ahead of the new app’s release, several developers and reverse engineers had been digging into Instagram’s code to discover how it would work, including leaker Alessandro Paluzzi. He found that the app would support 500 characters — less than Twitter’s now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/13/twitter-introduces-10000-character-long-tweets-for-blue-subscribers/">10,000 for paid subscribers</a>, though more than its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/13/twitter-introduces-10000-character-long-tweets-for-blue-subscribers/">280 characters</a> for non-paying users. At one point, he also discovered Meta was <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1650521285040939009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calling the app</a> “an Instagram for your thoughts.”</p>
<p>Another source, social media consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1657115238674714627" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Navarra</a>, had reported in mid-May that Meta was seeking out early adopters to try a pre-release version app with a focus on high-profile influencers and celebrities, like actors, producers, writers, directors, showrunners, athletes and comedians.</p>

<p>Today’s launch is not the first time Instagram has experimented with text-based updates for social sharing. The company last December <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/instagram-now-supports-text-updates-with-launch-of-notes-adds-other-new-sharing-features/">introduced Notes</a>, a way to leave short, 60-character text posts for friends to see just above their Instagram DM inbox. The feature was updated with support for music-sharing in June. Not to mention Instagram once launched a separate app called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/instagram-will-shut-down-its-companion-app-threads-by-year-end/">Threads</a>, which was kind of like Snapchat. It no longer exists.</p>

<p>When Threads appeared on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-an-instagram-app/id6446901002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a> for preorder a few days before launch, some users noticed that the app collects a lot of user data. According to Apple’s listing, the Threads iOS app may collect data related to health, finances, purchases, contacts, usage data, browsing history and other sensitive info.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this data collection isn’t really different from other major social platforms like TikTok and Twitter, or Meta’s own Instagram and Facebook. But with so many apps competing to become the “next Twitter” (if such a thing is even possible), users have more agency to choose a platform that has less dubious privacy practices. Still, Threads has a leg up, since users’ Instagram networks will be built in.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/22/facebook-eu-us-data-flows-decision/">ongoing</a> privacy concerns among Meta’s family of apps, Threads will not be launching <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/threads-no-eu-launch/">in the EU</a> — at least not for now. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jul/05/meta-delays-eu-launch-of-twitter-rival-threads-amid-uncertainty-over-personal-data-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mrf-link="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jul/05/meta-delays-eu-launch-of-twitter-rival-threads-amid-uncertainty-over-personal-data-use">The Guardian</a>‘s sources at Meta reportedly delayed the launch due to legal uncertainty around data use under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/24/dma-political-agreement/">Digital Markets Act</a>, which passed in March. Meta has reason to be wary of this changing EU legislation; in May, the company was fined around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/22/facebook-eu-us-data-flows-decision/">$1.3 billion</a> for exporting European Union user data to the U.S. for processing.</p>
<p>For now, EU users have one less Twitter alternative to choose from. As for those who have access to Threads from the get-go, users now get to decide if they want Meta’s family of apps to take up an even greater slice of their attention.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p dir="ltr">If you’re redesigning an existing website there are huge benefits in getting to know the content you’ll be working with. The earlier in the project the better. A little upfront investigation will help you make informed design decisions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A spreadsheet is an ideal tool to quickly see what content you’ll be working with. It’s somewhat helpful when optimising a website. It’s even more useful when you wish to explore more radical changes in design direction. Using real content allows you to push your ideas with the confidence that your designs will display beautifully even with the edge cases.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are four things you can do within 30 minutes to gain actionable insights to inform your design direction.<br></p>
                <h2>
        30 minutes to kickstart your design from a spreadsheet
      </h2>
                  <p>For this article I’ve used Screaming Frog to carry out the content scrape and Google Sheets to manipulate the data. Other spreadsheets and content scraping tools are available.</p>
                              <figure>
          <img src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/clearleft.com/uploads/StartDesignInASpreadsheet01.png" alt="A spreadsheet showing 100s of rows of data from a content scrape">
          <figcaption>
            Content scrape exported to Google Sheets
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
                        <p dir="ltr">First things first. Let’s clean up the data in the content audit. My first passes are broad sweeps to remove some of the noise. The intention is to swiftly move from drowning in data to being informed by information. <br></p>
<ol><li><p dir="ltr">Sort the data in the content audit by status code and remove all pages with a 404 (not found), 301 (moved permanently) and 302 (found redirected) code.</p></li><li><p dir="ltr">Order the spreadsheet by content type and cut and paste anything that isn’t listed as text/html into separate sheets – images, audio files, application files etc.</p></li></ol>
                <h2>
        What templates are on the website?
      </h2>
                  <p dir="ltr">In analysing an existing website I’m more interested in identifying the variety of page types over the number of individual pages. In taking a systemic approach to the design I’m looking to create reusable components and flexible templates. A content audit can provide a good estimation for the variety of page types being used. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Start by selecting the data in the spreadsheet and alphabetically sorting it by URL.<br></p>
                              <figure>
          <img src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/clearleft.com/uploads/StartDesignInASpreadsheet02.png" alt="A modal window showing how to sort a range of data in a spreadsheet">
          <figcaption>
            Sorting data to make spotting patterns quicker
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
                        <p dir="ltr">Then select the cells with URLs that have the same folder name and page depth. For example /news/news_article_01.html and /news/news_article_02.html etc. Use your spreadsheet to give you a count of the pages. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, create a simple table with the name of the page type and the count of pages in the adjacent cell.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spreadsheets are set up to easily turn cells of data into graphs. Admittedly not often pretty graphs. Yet still useful ones. My aim is to visualise the information to make it easier to understand at a glance. <br></p>
                              <figure>
          <img src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/clearleft.com/uploads/StartDesignInASpreadsheet03.png" alt="A pie chart created by a spreadsheet showing the number of pages in each section of the website">
          <figcaption>
            Spreadsheets give you ugly but useful charts
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
                        <p dir="ltr">In most cases there is a corollary between location in the site structure and the templates in use. This can be used as a proxy for page types. It is also worth sampling a handful of URLs from your list to do a visual check for similarity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A spreadsheet gives a 10,000ft guide to the variety of page types in use and quantities of each. This breakdown is a speedy way to kick off and prioritise a backlog of design tasks.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Extra tip:</strong> If the URL structure is more chaotic and doesn’t readily help identify page types then let the engineers in your team know. It’s a warning sign that automated content migration might be tricky with little to help map old content to new designs.<br></p>
                <h2>
        What are the longest and shortest page headings?
      </h2>
                  <p dir="ltr">Setting type styles without working with real content is akin to walking a typographical tightrope whilst blindfolded.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As every battle-scarred and skilled designer knows, design is less about working with idealised examples of content, and more ensuring the integrity of the design can survive the inevitable clash with the extreme edge cases. Nowhere is this more apparent than with H1 page headings. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Using real content provides you with useful constraints to design within. Using real content allows you to show and select typefaces with actual examples rather than just ‘The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog’. Using real content enables exploration with meaningful words replacing nonsensical lorem ipsum. Heading lengths are a vital input to informing type styles.<br></p>
<div dir="ltr"><p>I start by creating a new sheet containing just the H1 title and the H1 length. I then sort by ascending and descending order of character in the title. I’ll note down a couple of examples of the edge cases to use in design exploration. </p><p>I then go through the rows of headings to get the median value. The item located in the centre of the distribution. I find this more representative than using the average which can easily be skewed by anomalies in the data set. Again, I note it down to use later when stress testing my designs.</p></div>
                              <figure>
          <img src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/clearleft.com/uploads/StartDesignInASpreadsheet04.png" alt="A spreadsheet with an overlay showing the pages with shortest, longest and median lengths of H1 titles">
          <figcaption>
            The shortest, longest and median lengths of H1 headings
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
                        <p dir="ltr">If you want to get more granular you can follow the steps above for each section of the website. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Extra tip:</strong> Share the full list of H1 headings with your content colleagues. Having a list of headings will help them spot themes and make suggestions on writing to get a reader's attention.<br></p>
                <h2>
        What visual styles are used?
      </h2>
                  <p dir="ltr">Displaying a montage of images in a spreadsheet. That sounds like nonsense. Okay it's not what anyone tells you to do at design school. But give it a go.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Don’t expect a beautifully displayed grid of images. We’re favouring speed and utility. What we’re after is a sense of what imagery is used on the website and to spot any patterns in visual styles. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Sort the spreadsheet alphabetically by content type. Copy all the rows where the content type is an image (image/jpeg, image/png, image/svg) and then paste them to a new sheet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You should now have an alphabetically sorted list of URLs for image files. So far not very visual. There are a few tricks to make the display more useful. </p>
<div dir="ltr"><p>Add a cell to the right of the URL of the first entry and add =IMAGE(A2,1). The number 1 in the formula tells the spreadsheet to respect the aspect ratio of the image. If you change this to 2 the image stretches or compresses to fit inside the cell, and using 3 leaves the image at its original size, which may cause cropping.</p><p>Select the right corner of the cell and drag down the whole list of URLs. This will add the formula to each cell and reference the URL to the left i.e. A3, A4 etc.</p></div>

<p dir="ltr">To make the images easier to view, increase the height and width of the cells. To increase the height of all the cells click on a row and select all. Then right click and select resize rows N to N and add in a numeric value for the row height in pixels. Increase the width by dragging row B to the right.<br></p>
                              <figure>
          <img src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/clearleft.com/uploads/StartDesignInASpreadsheet05.png" alt="A spreadsheet showing all of the images on a website in a scrollable list">
          <figcaption>
            All the images in one place
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
                        <p dir="ltr">Within a few minutes you have a scrollable list of images to be able to review the variety, quality and image styles in use. If you’ve ordered the list alphabetically by URL and there is a naming structure for images this will cluster together similar images such as icons, avatars, hero banners etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Extra tip:</strong> If you’re curious about familiar looking images the spreadsheet is a great stepping off point into a reverse image search. Select the URL and open it in Google, right click and ‘Search image with Google’ to see the image source and visually similar images. <br></p>
                <h2>
        How much text?
      </h2>
                  <p dir="ltr">A content audit is a goldmine for colleagues in content roles. Content audits overflow with useful insights giving readability scores, sentence lengths, text ratios etc. Yet for this activity I’m not interested in the quality of writing. When designing a container for content I’m purely looking for the quantity of characters. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I’m most interested in looking at the page types designed for content consumption rather than hub pages. These typically are found at the end of the URL structure. The pages an information architect would call the leaf nodes or pages with no children.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Firstly sort the URLs alphabetically. Remove the navigation pages to leave just the content rich pages. Then sort the remaining data in the spreadsheet by word count. </p>
<p dir="ltr">With your spreadsheet ordered it’s straightforward to catalogue each section of the site with the pages that contain the fewest, the most, and the median amount of words. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The numbers prove useful in three key ways. <br></p>

<ol><li><p dir="ltr">They help optimise the design of the reading experience. The volume of text guiding decisions on type sizes, line-lengths, and padding.</p></li><li>They highlight if you need to consider in-page navigation from a scrollspy or skip links.</li><li>And they give real world examples of actual content to stress test design ideas with.</li></ol>
                              <figure>
          <img src="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/clearleft.com/uploads/StartDesignInASpreadsheet06.png" alt="A spreadsheet with an overlay showing the pages with fewest, most and median amount of words">
          <figcaption>
            The pages with the fewest, most and median number of words
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
                        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Extra tip:</strong> Let your developer colleagues know if you spot page types that routinely have text ratios of less than 25%. These pages will benefit from investigation to see if code bloat is adversely impacting performance and the subsequent user experience.<br></p>
                <h2>
        Spreadsheets before stylesheets
      </h2>
                  <p dir="ltr">If you’re a designer who’s spreadsheet-averse then you’ve probably stopped reading long before now. For the spreadsheet-curious designer give it a go on your next redesign project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Knowing the content considerations early in a redesign project can avoid days of wasted design time. And the good news is when you start content auditing for design decisions you’re no more than 30 minutes from Figma.<br></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>If you’ve ever made a photocopy in a U.S. library or received a copy of an in-copyright document supplied by your library, you’ve likely seen a notice that looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The copyright law of the United States (title 17, United States Code) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted material.</p>
<p>Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be “used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research.” If a user makes a request for, or later uses, a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of “fair use,” that user may be liable for copyright infringement.</p>
<p>This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you’re someone who is fairly familiar with U.S. copyright law, and especially with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">fair use doctrine</a>, that notice may have led you to ask yourself the following question: “Why are my rights more constrained with regard to a copy made in the library than they would be if the copy were made anywhere else?”</p>
<p>Why indeed?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/iStock-1210557301-1024x683.jpg" alt="Magical book lying open on desk in library with glowing pages " width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/iStock-1210557301-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/iStock-1210557301-300x200.jpg 300w, https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/iStock-1210557301-768x512.jpg 768w, https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/iStock-1210557301.jpg 1254w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>As it turns out, the answer is that they aren’t – the notice that libraries are required by law to provide you is false and misleading. In fact, you have the exact same rights in copies provided by the library that you do in copies made elsewhere. So why are libraries required by the current federal statute to mislead you in this way?</p>
<p>The copyright notice that libraries are required by law to provide you is false and misleading.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at what led to this odd situation.</p>
<p>First of all, it’s important to know what fair use is and what rights it affords you if you’re not the copyright holder in a document. The fair use doctrine is laid out in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107">Title 17, Section 107 of the U.S. Code</a>. It describes limitations on the exclusive rights of copyright holders, making clear that despite the general exclusivity of those rights, users of copyrighted documents are nevertheless allowed to make limited uses of those documents that might otherwise infringe on the exclusivity of the copyright holder’s prerogatives. The law introduces fair use as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fair use of a copyrighted work,&nbsp;including&nbsp;such use by reproduction in&nbsp;copies&nbsp;or&nbsp;phonorecords&nbsp;or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes&nbsp;such as&nbsp;criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching&nbsp;(including&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;copies&nbsp;for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above, again, is in section 107. Then comes <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/108">section 108</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.section108.gov/study.html">summarized by the Section 108 Study Group</a> (which was convened by the U.S. Copyright Office in 2005 to examine and propose recommendations regarding possible changes to it), section 108 of the U.S. Code lays out some exceptions to the copyright rules codified in section 106; this section is designed to “(permit) libraries and archives to make certain uses of copyrighted materials in order to serve the public and ensure the availability of works over time,” providing “limited exceptions for libraries and archives to make copies in specified instances for preservation, replacement and patron access.” Along with those exceptions, though, is a requirement that all copies made in the library be accompanied by a “warning of copyright” to patrons – the language of which I provided at the beginning of this post.</p>
<p>What should be clear to any attentive reader is that the fair use doctrine outlined in section 107 covers many kinds of use that would fall outside the category of “private study, scholarship, or research.” So is it really the case that when you make a copy of an in-copyright document at Kinko’s, you have the full spectrum of fair use rights – but if you copy (or receive a copy of) the same document in a library your fair use rights are significantly more restricted?</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, no. You still have the same fair use rights regardless of where the copy is made, because Section 108 says clearly that “nothing in this section… in any way affects the right of fair use as provided by section 107.”</p>
<p>So if the law says that your rights in a library-copied document are the same as they are in a document copied anywhere else, why is a library required tell you otherwise? Why must libraries actively misinform their patrons about their actual rights under the law?</p>
<p>The problem is that although Section 108 makes clear that the copyright warning notice it requires is not <em>intended</em> to restrict artificially the fair use rights of document users, the code itself doesn’t provide the language for the notice. It specifies that the “warning of copyright” shall be written “in accordance with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.” And the language prescribed by the Register of Copyrights in that regulation is, unfortunately, false and misleading. And worse, libraries are required to include the prescribed language “verbatim.”</p>
<p>Wanting to understand better why this would be the case, I contacted the U.S. Copyright Office on 20 June 2023, expressing my puzzlement at the artificially restrictive language prescribed by the Office for the copyright warning notice, and asking if there were someone I could talk to about my concerns.</p>
<p>I was answered promptly and told that “the <em>Federal Register</em> announcement for a specific regulation may provide helpful context and background.” The response referred me to <a href="https://archives.federalregister.gov/issue_slice/1977/11/16/59261-59294.pdf">the Federal Register announcement for 37 C.F.R. 201.14</a>, a 34-page document that does indeed contain some discussion of the wording of both the copyright warning notice and the statute itself – though at no point does it acknowledge or address the fact that the prescribed notice inaccurately represents users’ rights as laid out in sections 107 and 108.</p>
<p>The U.S. Copyright Office has no comment.</p>
<p>I thanked the Office for sharing the link, but pointed out that it didn’t address my question, and asked again if there were someone to whom I could speak about the issue.</p>
<p>The next day I received a response saying that “at this time, the Copyright Office has no further comment, and we would refer you to the materials on our website.”</p>
<p>Let’s be clear about what the problem is here. It’s not that patrons who use library-provided copies of copyrighted works in a manner beyond the scope of “private study, scholarship, or research” are in legal danger if their use falls within the full range of the fair use provisions in section 107. Again, the language of section 108 makes it very clear that owners of such copies are entirely within their rights to make full (fair) use of them, regardless of what the copyright warning notice prescribed by the Copyright Office says. The problem is that the Copyright Office, under color of authority ostensibly assigned to it by statute, requires libraries to misinform patrons about their rights. Although library patrons are in reality free to make full fair use of copies we provide them (or copies they make on our premises), we must tell them – every time they make or request a copy from us – that they have only a small subset of those rights.</p>
<p>How much does this disinformation end up constraining patrons’ exercise of their full rights under the law? It’s impossible to know, of course. But as a profession that sees itself at the vanguard of the fight against both mis- and disinformation, it certainly should rankle us that we’ve been drafted into a disinformation campaign that affects so many information seekers so directly.</p>
<p>It should rankle us even more that the U.S. Copyright Office, the very entity that has created this issue and is uniquely empowered to fix it, seems to have no interest in doing so. I hope my library colleagues (and everyone else who cares about libraries and archives, and about fair use) will join me in calling on the Copyright Office to change the language of its prescribed copyright warning notice, bringing it into full conformity with what the law actually says. (I’ve <a href="https://chng.it/NRNZMXvW">created an online petition for this purpose</a>, and encourage all interested to sign it.)</p>

    <li>Lynne Sagalyn <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Ground-Zero-Politics-Manhattan/dp/0190607025">wrote a book</a> about why redeveloping Ground Zero took so long. Ed Glaeser, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/books/review/power-at-ground-zero-lynne-b-sagalyn.html">reviewing</a> it for the <i>Times</i>, writes "her ­story teaches us how and why America has changed since 1931, when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey could build the George Washington Bridge — the world’s longest suspension bridge at the time — in 49 months."</li>

    <li>Herbert Kaufman <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U1V3EAQ">wrote a book</a> about red tape; the foreword from Philip Howard includes the claim that the nature of bureaucratic constrictions in the US changed in the 60s.</li>
    
    <li>Howard also wrote a <a href="https://www.commongood.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2YearsNot10Years.pdf">report</a> entitled <i>Two Years Not Ten Years: Redesigning Infrastructure Approvals</i>, diving deeper on this topic.

				<h2>Quickly see everything your application is doing, without modifying any of your code</h2>
				<div>
					<p>FunctionTrace can be called on existing Python applications with absolutely no modifications, and provides a complete and precise view of your application's entire execution.  You'll see what functions your various Python processes and threads executed over time, when and what information was logged, where allocations occurred, and more.</p>
					<p>FunctionTrace supports all of the useful profiling views you're familiar with, including Stack Charts, Flame Graphs, and Call Trees, thanks to its integration with the <a href="https://profiler.firefox.com/%22" target="_blank">Firefox Profiler</a>.</p>
				</div>

                    If you use Nix, you can easily try a recent version of FunctionTrace with <code>nix-shell -p functiontrace</code>, or install it via <code>pkgs.functiontrace</code>.
					</p>

					<h3>Installing FunctionTrace (Linux/Mac)</h3>
					<p>
					FunctionTrace comes in two necessary pieces: a server, and a language-specific client.<br>
					<i>Note: It's currently necessary to have <code>cargo</code> installed in order to install FunctionTrace, as <code>functiontrace-server</code> is not packaged for all supported operating systems.  You can install cargo via <b><a href="https://rustup.rs/" target="_blank">rustup</a></b>.</i><br>
					</p>
					<pre><code><i># Install the server</i>
<b>$ <a href="https://crates.io/crates/functiontrace-server" target="_blank">cargo install functiontrace-server</a></b>

<i># Install the Python client</i>
<b>$ <a href="https://pypi.org/project/functiontrace/" target="_blank">pip install functiontrace</a></b>
</code></pre>

					<h3>Installing FunctionTrace (Windows)</h3>
					<p>
					FunctionTrace is not currently supported on Windows.  Pull requests to add support are welcome.
					</p>

					<h3>Tracing Your Application</h3>
					<p>
					To trace a Python application <i>Foo.py</i>, load it via <code>functiontrace</code>:
					</p><pre><code>$ <b>functiontrace</b> Foo.py arguments_for_foo</code></pre>
					

					<p>
					Alternatively, you can modify your code to start tracing at some point during its runtime:
					</p><pre><code>import <b>functiontrace</b>
functiontrace.trace()
</code></pre>
					By default, FunctionTrace will emit a trace file (in the form of <code>functiontrace.<i>time</i>.json</code>) to the current directory, though the location can be controlled via the <code>--output-dir</code> switch when running <code>functiontrace</code>.
					

					<h3>Viewing Traces</h3>
					<p>
					To view a recorded trace file, go to <b><a href="https://profiler.firefox.com/" target="_blank">the Firefox Profiler</a></b> and choose <i>Load a profile from file</i>, then select the desired trace file.  This step will perform some processing, but is entirely local - your trace file never leaves your own machine!
					<br>
					<i>Note: If this is your first time using the Firefox Profiler, you may want to skim <b><a href="https://profiler.firefox.com/docs/#/./guide-ui-tour" target="_blank">the UI guide</a></b> for it</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
					You'll likely want to start with the <i>Stack Chart</i> view to get an overview of your application's execution, then use the <i>Flame Graph</i> view if you want to dive into optimization opportunities.
					</p><p>
					Traces can also be loaded directly from the internet, which can be particularly useful when examining services on remote servers or sharing traces with others.  For an example, you can play with this
					<b><a href="https://profiler.firefox.com/from-url/https%3A%2F%2Fbox.programsareproofs.com%2Ffiles%2Fprofile_demo.json/stack-chart/?" target="_blank">Live Demo</a></b>.
					</p>

        <td>You probably have seen this in the front page sometime last week due to the "Fast machines, slow machines" post :)I started this blog during exams session back in university and I'll reach the 20-year mark next year. Wow. I write about my own projects, but also tech in general based on my current interests, which at the moment are around Rust, Bazel (again), and Unix systems in general.It's interesting how the blog has changed: I used to write short posts almost daily describing whatever I had been tinkering with in open source projects (back when I contributed to NetBSD and Gnome regularly)... or whatever crossed my mind really. These days, most of those misc posts go into social media, and the blog is reserved for purposeful articles, which end up being much longer (and thus infrequent).Commenting on the blog used to be much more common years ago, but these days discussion happen off-site in either social media or here. Similarly, people used to visit the blog periodically, but these days nobody does: traffic to the blog is either from organic searches or from spikes due to referrals from sites like HN.As for how I build it: the posts are written in Markdown; I use Hugo to generate the site; Bootstrap for styling; and my custom web service (EndTRACKER) to offer email subscriptions, post voting and commenting, as well as privacy-respecting analytics.</td>

        <td>About two months ago, there was an Ask HN about the most interesting interesting tech you built for just yourself [1]. In this topic, I shared about my Ghidra modifications to unlink pieces of an executable back into relocatable object files [2] in an effort to reverse-engineer a PlayStation 1 video game.Long story short, I've wanted to write about this esoteric but powerful technique and it snowballed into starting my own blog with a series of articles about reverse-engineering. It's still a WIP draft, quite rough around the edges and not ready for prime-time, but you only have that kind of Ask HN thread once (every couple of years I assume).Side-note: the Google and Bing webcrawlers managed to find and index that domain name despite having no public links to it whatsoever (to my knowledge) until now, my only logical explanation is that they've found it by scrapping the WHOIS database. It's also hosted inside my home on my personal Synology DS218 NAS with a rather dodgy setup, which will probably crash and burn under any level of load by the time you've read this comment.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35729232[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35738758</td>

I'm talking about systems that provide food, shelter, clothing, much medicine, energy, etc. automatically with minimal labor and oversight.

<h3>
<u>The Overflowing Brain: Information Overload and The Limits of Working Memory</u> (2009)<br>
<b>Torkel Klingberg</b> (1967- )</h3><p>
202 pages</p><p>

Who in these days of cell phones, digital assistants, and other high-bandwidth  devices has not felt at times that they just cannot keep up with the flow of information?  Has not felt overwhelmed to the point of feeling like a kind of mental grid lock has set in?  And has not wondered whether there is not something wrong with their brain, that it doesn't seem able to keep up? </p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VlHAriJZdVQ/TPmwQDQ8X6I/AAAAAAAAAAc/qZmCAm-YXfYQWiIhpiVHZRogUgGx__ryACPcBGAYYCw/s600/Cover_TheOverflowingBrain.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="600" data-original-width="395" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VlHAriJZdVQ/TPmwQDQ8X6I/AAAAAAAAAAc/qZmCAm-YXfYQWiIhpiVHZRogUgGx__ryACPcBGAYYCw/w131-h200/Cover_TheOverflowingBrain.jpg" width="131"></a></p><p>Over a fast-paced and engaging 200 pages, Torkel Klingberg, a professor in  cognitive neuroscience, reviews what recent research, including his own, reveals about where the bottleneck is in the brain for processing incoming information, about how distractions, fatigue and the amount of incoming information affect the  restrictiveness of this bottleneck, and whether we can train our brains to expand our ability to process information.  What follows here is a brief review of the topics Klingberg presents, although some of the fascinating parts of the book are his detailed descriptions of the set-up and results of a variety of studies that have been performed, and which I only summarize. </p><p>

Klingberg first reviews some of the basic terms around which the rest of his  discussion evolves.  He lists three types of attention: <i>controlled attention</i>, such as when focusing on reading a report; <i>stimulus driven attention</i>, such as when our attention is drawn to an event occurring in our surroundings; and  <i>arousal</i>, which is general, active attention, such as monitoring a radar screen.  He then focuses on the first two of these, controlled and stimulus-driven attention, and their interaction, such as when someone is reading a report, using  their controlled attention, and is distracted by an event that activates their stimulus driven attention (in Klingberg's example, someone nearby dropping a coffee cup).  He describes the results of recent research using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging on people's brains as they perform different cognitive  tests.  This testing has shown that controlled attention and stimulus driven attention activate different parts of the brain, and so function independently.  Since they function independently, it stands to reason that they should not be limiting each other; however, everyone has experienced the competition between these two types  of attention --- in the earlier example, most of us are unable to remain focused on the report we are reading, if nearby a coffee cup smashes on the floor.&nbsp;  Since these things are handled by different areas of the brain, why are we so easily distracted?</p><p>

To answer that question, Klingberg introduces the concept of <i>working memory</i>,  which "refers to our ability to remember information for a limited period of time, usually a few seconds." (p. 33)  He describes research that has shown that a person's working memory can typically hold and reproduce accurately about seven  pieces of information, a concept that he says was first introduced in 1956 by George Miller in his article </p><u>The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on our Capacity for Processing Information</u><p>.  It has been shown that this number varies slightly from person to person, and even for a given person  depending on the level of distractions, tiredness, age and other factors.  Klingberg states that this "capacity limitation of working memory is one of the things that  distinguishes it from long-term memory." (p. 35)  He illustrates the difference  using the example of going to the grocery store: a person encodes in long-term  memory the location of their parked car for retrieval of the location when they  leave the store, but uses working memory in the store, when searching for a  particular item, such as a gallon of milk.  He also reviews what has been found about the effect of the limitation of working memory on our ability to process information.  As a particular example he describes studies that have found a substantial delay in the reaction time of people talking on their cell phone while driving --- or even just holding conversations with someone in the car while driving.  A similar delay has  not been found in these studies when the driver is doing more passive activities  such as listening to the radio or an audio book; it is the need to focus on  a conversation that limits the working memory's ability to effectively support driving at the same time.</p><p>

Having established working memory as the limitation, or bottleneck, in the  brain's ability to process information, Klingberg devotes the remainder of his  book to various aspects of working memory.  He first reviews research that has  shown that the capacity of a person's working memory is a strong indicator of that person's problem solving ability, and describes models being developed and evaluated for how the working memory may function.  He also  takes a brief look at theories of how intelligence developed in humans, and why  the limitation in working memory may have developed as it did; not surprisingly  it is difficult to come to firm conclusions on such discussions.  All of this  serves as background for the central questions of the book: can the brain be  trained to improve working memory, how would it be done if it is possible, and  whether and how effectively our daily activities contribute to such training.</p><p>

Klingberg cites a host of studies that have shown the brain's plasticity in  this regard --- the ability to improve its working memory and so problem solving  ability through training.  Many of the studies on training the working memory have  involved children diagnosed with ADHD (Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity  Disorder), and he provides a brief introduction to it, focusing for the most  part on ADD, the attention deficit aspect of the disorder.  He notes that ADHD  is not a 'have it' or 'don't have it' condition:  "most scientists see the degree of symptom as being normally distributed among the  population … mean[ing] that rather than there being a discrete little group of  people with attention deficits standing isolated form the healthy masses, there  are really only difference of degree." (p. 107)    He refers to studies that have  shown that people who suffer form acute ADHD have deficiencies in their working  memory.  Having described earlier in the book how distractions reduce the  effectiveness of working memory, this leads to one approach for people with ADHD: to reduce the distractions from their environment, in effect making the amount of  working memory capability that is available to them as effective as possible.   But his larger interest is in the area of improving the existing working memory;  he concludes his look at ADHD with the question: "Can we not also attack the other  front as well [and] increase our mental capacity?" (p. 114)</p><p>

Klingberg opens his discussion on training by pointing out that research has  shown that not all training is equal in terms of its effectiveness on improving  working memory.  He cites research results that show that, for example, someone  training to become better at remembering numbers can improve, but that improvement  doesn't translate into an improved working memory in other contexts.  (He attributes  this at least in part to people doing this type of training often developing strategies  to remember combinations of numbers as a single unit, and so they are not only, or primarily, improving the number of units of information that can be stored in   their working memory.)  </p><p>

Based on those results he narrows his focus to studies that show a general  improvement in working memory and so problem solving skills, that is transferable  to activities other than the training activity itself, and that results in a measurable  improvement in problem solving skills.  This then ties in to his discussion on ADHD: in several different studies of children with ADHD, results have shown that  "working memory was trainable and that the training had secondary effects" (p. 119).   That is, it had an effect even after the training was stopped, and it improved  problem solving skills.  Studies on the elderly and also people not diagnosed  with severe ADHD have shown similar results.  </p><p>

The training that was used in these studies was non-specific type training  (as opposed to, say, memorizing numbers), and Klingberg then looks at our busy daily  lives and rhetorically asks, "[we use] our working memory throughout the day.   Should we not therefore be constantly exercising our working memory so that it  progressively improves from one day to the next?" (p. 125)   Referring to studies  that looked at the effectiveness of various levels of complexity in training, he  concludes that only training that pushes the working memory to the limits of its  capability on a regular basis is effective; less aggressive training shows little  benefit.  "[A 5 year study of senior citizens found] that reading, chess, playing  a musical instrument, and dancing were all associated with a later, relative  improvement of cognitive ability and a lower risk of dementia [but] only if the  activities were done several times a week.... [P]hysical exercise … had, on the other  hand, no effect at all on mental health." (p. 127)  Thus, the type and complexity  of training  (or more broadly 'activity') is critical, but also the amount of time regularly spent on  such activities plays a key role; simply using the working memory during our  daily lives is not sufficient to improve it.</p><p>

Klingberg also looks briefly at the other side of the coin, attention or  concentration, discussing investigations that have shown that meditation can  improve the ability to concentrate.  The studies that have been done, and that  he describes in some detail, have involved people who spend many hours per day  meditating, such as monks.  He describes the results obtained to date as inconclusive.</p><p>

He devotes an entire chapter to the issue of computer games and the question  of whether they are a negative influence or a positive one (in terms of cognitive  ability --- he sidesteps the 'violence debate') .  He points out that there is no general  answer, referring back to the earlier discussion: some types of  training are more effective than others, and it is critical that the working  memory be pushed to its limit repeatedly.  Thus it is critical to consider particular computer games, instead of trying to make a general statement about computer games as a whole.  He describes a variety of studies that  show some types of computer games as having a positive influence on cognitive skills.</p><p>

He also looks briefly at medication that is being developed with the intent of  improving cognitive ability.  Although medication has been shown to have some  positive effect, he comes down on the cautious side, raising concerns about the  unknown side effects, particularly long-term, of such an approach.  His  preference is "a greater focus on mental health care in the form of mental  gymnastics." (p. 162)</p><p>

Klingberg concludes with a short chapter on the "information flood" that  exists today and studies of its effects on cognitive ability.  The results of  some of these studies point to a kind of 'sweet spot' of information flow --- we perform best when the challenge presented is just at the limits of our skill.   He refers to a diagram developed by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi,  who defines 'flow' as "characterized by a high level of challenge and skill, in  which the capacity of the doer exactly matches the demands of the task being done.... [W]hen challenge exceeds skill, we get stress.  When skill exceeds challenge,  we get a sense of control, which becomes boredom as the level of challenge  drops." (p. 168)</p><p>

In <i>The Overflowing Brain</i>, Torkel Klingberg provides a fascinating look  at an aspect of our brain function that affects our everyday activities.  His  writing style is engaging without giving the reader the feeling that he is dumbing-down the subject.  His approach of tying each topic to an example  that most of us can easily relate to helps ground the discussion for those of  us not experts in neurology, and yet he provides enough detail to satisfy a  lay-person interested in broadening their scientific understanding.  As you  return from reading the book to work or other daily activities, it is not hard  to find connections to what you have just learned in your attempts to juggle  e-mails, instant messages and cell phone calls, while completing the task on  which you had planned to focus all of your attention.</p><hr color="#000000" size="2">

<p dir="auto">llama: Once upon a time, in a small village near the mountains, there lived a little girl named Lily. She was known for her kindness and love towards all living beings. One day, while playing in the forest, she stumbled upon a teddy bear that had lost its way. The teddy bear was very sad and lonely, so Lily decided to take it home with her.</p>
<p dir="auto">As they spent more time together, Lily realized how much the teddy bear needed a friend like her. They would play games, share stories, and snuggle up together under the stars. Their friendship grew stronger every day, and soon the teddy bear became Lily's best companion.</p>
<p dir="auto">One day, as Lily was walking through the forest, she heard a strange sound coming from a nearby cave. Curious, she ventured inside and found a group of animals gathered around a fire. Among them was a llamma (a type of sheep) who had been lost and alone for days. Lily immediately knew what to do. She took the lllama back to her house, where she fed him some delicious soup and gave him a warm bed to sleep in. With the help of Lily and her kind heart, the lllama was saved and reunited with his friends. From then on, he was never alone again.</p>
<p dir="auto">And so, TeddyBear met LLaMa, and their friendship blossomed into a beautiful story that will be remembered forever.</p>

<p>Detractors of LLMs describe them as <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web">blurry jpegs of the web</a>, or <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">stochastic parrots</a>. Promoters of LLMs describe them as having <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712">sparks of AGI</a>, or learning the <a href="https://twitter.com/tszzl/status/1650260899553497088">generating function of multivariable calculus</a>. These positions seem opposed to each other and are the subject of acrimonious debate. I do not think they are opposed, and I hope in this post to convince you of that. In particular:</p>



<ol>
<li>LLMs do both of the things that their promoters and detractors say they do.</li>



<li>They do both of these at the same time on the same prompt.</li>



<li>It is very difficult from the outside to tell which they are doing.</li>



<li>Both of them are useful.</li>
</ol>



<p>In this I’m going to introduce some new terminology that I think will be useful to reason about them, and hopefully shed some of the connotations and baggage of prior terminology that are poorly suited for the phenomena that they are now tasked with describing. There will not be any numbers or quantification of any of this, but I hope it will be a useful way of thinking about things anyways.</p>



<h2>Search Index Size and Memorization</h2>



<p>In the 2000s when Google and Yahoo search were neck and neck competitors in quality, one of the biggest differentiators between search engines was the size of their index. This may be surprising to people who were not paying close attention to the search industry at the time. After all, the popular conception of search engine quality was based on stories of heroic algorithm innovation, and deep insights about the web, (which to be fair were also very important.) But at the time, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/cuil-launches-can-this-search-start-up-really-best-google-14459#:~:text=Cuil%20is%20claiming%20to%20have,excluded%20from%20what%20gets%20indexed).">search startups launched</a> using their index size rather than any particular ranking technology as their primary marketing claim to superiority over the incumbents, and this was not seen as strange. Compared with something like PageRank, index size seems like an awfully prosaic thing to make a big difference in search quality. Why was it so important?</p>



<p>When people think about index size, they intuitively tend to think of things like, “Does the search engine have the specific page I’m looking for?” but that’s a very small part of the impact, and something that saturates quickly. There are relatively few pages, relative to the size of the web, that people remember specifically and seek out by name. It’s easy to cover those, and every competitive search engine did. Instead, a large index gave search engines the ability to satisfy increasingly niche queries.</p>



<p>Suppose the user issues a query like “What’s the best infant car seat for a 2006 toyota corolla.” A document that addresses this query specifically and directly is likely to be a forum post, and probably an obscure one. This is not a super hot topic that is going to get to the top of a social media site. It’s the sort of thing where if there’s any page about it at all, it’s the result of a single person looking for advice, finding a group of similar people online, asking them, and then hopefully getting a few replies. Because of its obscurity, you have to index a large number of pages to be sure that you get this exact one, if it exists. The space of possible queries explodes combinatorially with the length of the query, so the size of the index has to grow exponentially to satisfy increasingly long queries. Through this mechanism, a large index expanded the breadth and depth of the questions that a search engine could answer, and the needs it could satisfy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are however other options, other than index size, for how a search engine could solve this. Suppose that you don’t have anything about this query for “2006 toyota corolla” specifically, but you do have pages about it for “2007 toyota corolla” and you happen to know that the corolla didn’t change much in those years, so cars of those two model years are effectively synonyms with respect to what car seats will fit in them. Or suppose you don’t have a page about “infant car seats” specifically, but you have a page written by a self-described “expectant mother” looking for a car seat, and you can surmise that everyone in the conversation understands that the kind of car seat they’re looking for is an “infant car seat” despite never being explicitly described as such. Also, “Best,” despite being the first word in the query and very important for the intent, is just asking for the kind of page that ranks carseats, not pages that contain “best.” Most pages that list more than one car seat are ranking them in some order, so you can probably just drop that word entirely.</p>



<p>These kinds of inferences allow you to return pages that slightly deviate from the original text of the query, but in a way that is very likely to still satisfy the user’s question. When a search engine is able to do this, it is able to compensate for a limited index size with intelligence. By making reasonable inferences about what page text is likely to satisfy what query text, it can satisfy more intents with fewer documents. If you don’t have the capacity to index more documents, or if there simply aren’t any more to index, then you need to do something more clever to answer more and more specific queries. You have to be able to collapse queries or compose queries into a smaller space of semantics to find documents that are useful even if there is no syntactic connection to the raw text.</p>



<p>I’m going to make a loose analogy between these two aspects of search engines, and two words that people often use to describe deep models, “memorization” and “generalization.” It will not be a perfect analogy, the ways that people use those words are too varied for the connection to be precise, but I do think it is instructive.</p>



<p>A bigger index size reflects more “memorization.” A search engine does not have the option of changing the content of the documents that it indexes, and so the set of things it can return is always constrained to be exactly the set of points it has already seen. It cannot synthesize a new document by interpolating the set of documents that exist. If a language model were to output the exact text of a document in its training data, we would call it memorization, so when a search engine does that by returning a document, I’m using the same word.</p>



<p>In contrast, better language understanding and world knowledge inference reflects better “generalization.” The search engine is learning how to go beyond the text on the pages. It is satisfying more queries by being smarter rather than by indexing more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note how different these concepts are for a search engine than a conventional statistical model. Generally we think of “memorization” as bad, as an indication of overfitting, and the degree of memorization as mutually exclusive with the degree of “generalization.” When a model relies on memorization instead of generalization, we expect it to perform more poorly outside of its domain. But the connotations of generalization and memorization, as good and bad, respectively, do not reflect how language sophistication and index size, respectively, affect a search engine. For a search engine, both memorization and generalization help its performance, there is not a tradeoff between the two. Rather than worrying about tasks “outside of its domain” the goal of a search index is simply to cover the entire domain, and whatever language understanding you can do on top just expands it further.</p>



<h2>The Ambiguous Depth of LLMs, Integration and Coverage</h2>



<p>Information Retrieval systems have been good at answering questions for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/science/17jeopardy-watson.html">a long time</a>, even with very rudimentary techniques. It did not require deep learning for a search engine to beat every human alive at Jeopardy. Language evolved to compress thoughts, to communicate those thoughts tractably from person to person. Text, by design, compresses knowledge well enough that simple techniques work, even just matching discrete tokens against a big corpus. But because we can see the corpus, and see exactly where the information is coming from, there’s no mystery. We know that the “mind” of a search engine is separate from the internet that it indexes. The text is “outside the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/">Chinese room</a>,” and the “mind” is just following simple rules, even if the emergent behavior from the two combined is immensely impressive and valuable.</p>



<p>LLMs are not like this. The reasoning that they do is inscrutable and massive. They do not explain their reasoning in a way that we can trust is actually their reasoning, and not simply a textual description of what such reasoning might hypothetically be. Their output is seamlessly adapted to their context, and different every time. They do not cite their sources. The text that they return is not stored separately from their reasoning about that text. The reasoning and the text are commingled, such that it is not possible from their output alone to tell where one ends and the other begins. Without that separation, and without the ability to deeply inspect what’s going on inside of the model, it is very difficult to tell the level of abstraction at which the LLM is operating. Has the model memorized an example exactly like this, or is it reasoning from scratch? Has it seen something very similar to this but reworded enough to foil exact text search? How could we tell?</p>



<p>Despite these fundamental and transformational differences between search engines and LLMs, I believe that aspects of search engine quality are better analogies to describe the properties of LLMs than “generalization” and “memorization” are, and the use of those terms is clouding the debate. Instead, I’m going to use the terms “integration” and “coverage.” “Integration” you can think of as “How much of the information that the model knows is integrated into a coherent representation that can be applied in new circumstances? How abstract is its reasoning?” While “coverage,” analogous to index size in a search engine is, “How many of the relevant facts/examples of the task/similar bits of text has the model stored?”</p>



<p>You might think of “integration” as a measure of compression. Having a more sophisticated internal model should intuitively be both a more integrated representation and a smaller one (compare generative rules of grammar to ngram counts, the laws of physics to particular physical simulations.) But like the memorization / generalization dichotomy, this also may obscure more than it clarifies. LLMs do not compress their input data by being forced to function with fewer parameters the way a bottlenecked autoencoder or PCA does. We should not think that reducing parameter count while increasing training data, nor forcing the model to be sparse, would necessarily cause integration to go up. The training of deep models has its own <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635">complicated combinatorics</a> that make models that are conceptually compact unlikely to be small in parameters.</p>



<p>Another good candidate terminology for the quality of integration would be “abstraction.” I use integration instead because LLMs build their models out of the aggregation of small observations rather than by applying top down rules. Even if the ultimate result of the learning process is an abstract model, that model is achieved by integrating bits of information and explaining them with a unified core. The key quality that differentiates deep models from their predecessors is that all of the information is permitted to interact, and forced to interact. The quality I’m seeking to define describes the degree to which it interacts in practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why would search engines be a better analogy despite the enormous difference in their basic mechanisms? One reason is scale. LLMs are large. GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, and GPT-4 is much bigger. The internet is also big. It contains more things and more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060214195025/http://horsehater.blogspot.com/">outlandish</a> things than you would ever expect. One of the highlighted results from GPT-4’s launch was its ability to draw a unicorn in Tikz. This is not the sort of thing I would have expected to exist in any remotely similar training data on the web. However, it turns out that there’s an <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/tikzlings?lang=en">entire ctan package of cartoon animals drawn in Tikz</a>. While the physical construction of a unicorn in code would be astonishing for a model to reason through from scratch, the knowledge that a unicorn is a pink horse with a horn, or the ability to translate from SVG to Tikz, is less surprising.</p>



<p>Importantly, the scale of LLMs is similar to the scale of the web itself. GPT-3’s 175 billion parameters is 175 parameters for every document in <a href="http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2000/06/google-launches-worlds-largest-search.html">year-2000-Google’s index</a>, and year-2000-Google could do a lot.</p>



<p>For a model with a high level of integration, the sort of coverage we might be most concerned with is “patterns of valid reasoning” or “facts about the world” whereas for a model with low levels of integration the kind of coverage we’re worried about is “existence of particular ngrams and their statistical associations.”&nbsp;Let’s work an example. Suppose you ask an LLM a question from a physics exam. There are many possible methods of reasoning that the LLM could be using to answer that question. I’m going to be listing them in order of “integration” from least to most, and beside it, explain what “coverage” means at that level of integration.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Integration (least to most)</td><td>Coverage (an independent axis)</td></tr><tr><td>The model has seen this exact question before in its training data and memorized the answer.</td><td>The larger the corpus the more questions it has the opportunity to memorize.</td></tr><tr><td>The model has seen a semantically equivalent question in the training data, with only changes in wording that are irrelevant to the answer.</td><td>The larger the corpus, the more examples it has to compare against for semantic similarity.</td></tr><tr><td>The model has seen an equivalent question in the training data that differs only in the numerical constants. The model has learned the mathematical relationship between those constants and can do computation to produce the answer.</td><td>The larger the corpus, the more worked examples of word problems and their corresponding math it has to draw from, and the greater chance it can find the exact formula to apply for the present case.</td></tr><tr><td>The model has seen questions in the training data that are equivalent to parts of the present question. It can recognize the correspondence of each of those templates to the parts of the current question, and compose their associated math to compute the correct answer.&nbsp;</td><td>The larger the corpus, the more examples of paired text and math it has to learn from, and more opportunities to learn how to correctly compose them.</td></tr><tr><td>The model understands the physics of the objects described in the problem. It can retrieve the associated physical laws, and apply them correctly to produce an answer.</td><td>The larger the corpus, the more exposure it has to the laws of physics, and the associations between those laws and the objects to which it is appropriate to apply them.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>There are a few things I want you to take away from this example.</p>



<ol>
<li>No matter the level of “Integration,” and the sophistication of the reasoning, more “coverage” is always helpful.</li>



<li>From the outside, you would not be able to tell which strategy it is using for this example, and in fact it is likely to be using many of these strategies at once and combining them all into the final token probabilities.</li>



<li>All but the first, the least integrated model, would foil a text search for the question in the training data. Once you’ve ruled out that level, ordinary information retrieval on the corpus cannot differentiate the higher levels.</li>



<li><strong>Most importantly, all of these strategies are equally successful at producing the correct answer for this particular task.</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>(Though it is unrelated to my main point, I also want to point out that the possible methods of reasoning far outstrip the meager examples I’ve listed here, and most would probably be too strange to describe in words.)</p>



<p>I want to repeat point 4 again, because I think that is the most likely to be missed or misunderstood. The level of sophistication of the reasoning that the model is doing is not relevant to the quality of the product in this context, or to its usefulness for this task. A model that absorbs more of the web will be more useful regardless whether it’s “smarter” or not, for the same reason that a search engine with a larger index is more useful than a search engine with a smaller index, even if the ranking algorithms do not change. The distinction between memorization and reasoning will not actually matter for a lot of use cases, because ordinary document retrieval is immensely useful, and even “light” semantic reasoning on top of that is more useful still. A model that gets correct results through cheap tricks still gets correct results. A right answer, consistently delivered, is a right answer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The philosophical debates about where the model is on the parrot/AGI spectrum are independent of that. Our model of its reasoning is what we use to predict the trajectory of its future capabilities, but those capabilities are ultimately themselves empirical.</p>



<h2>Different Minds, Different Metrics, Different Mixtures.</h2>



<p>I’m going to put some models on a graph with two axes, integration, and coverage. This graph is entirely vibes-based. These are totally wild guesses on my part, and I welcome people arguing with them. (Importantly, it does not contain or reflect any private information I know about Google or its systems so if you are using this to speculate about that you’re doing it wrong.) The points on the graph that describe human organizations are even more vibes-based than those about models, so please don’t get too hung up on them. Also there are no units.</p>



<figure><a href="https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/models-graph.png"><img data-attachment-id="1521" data-permalink="https://moultano.wordpress.com/2023/06/28/the-many-ways-that-digital-minds-can-know/models-graph/" data-orig-file="https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/models-graph.png" data-orig-size="1698,1297" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="models-graph" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/models-graph.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/models-graph.png?w=1024" src="https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/models-graph.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/models-graph.png?w=1024 1024w, https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/models-graph.png?w=150 150w, https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/models-graph.png?w=300 300w, https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/models-graph.png?w=768 768w, https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/models-graph.png 1698w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Different tasks lean on different mixes of integration and coverage, but the metrics and benchmarks that we use to evaluate LLMs do not differentiate them. A given level of log loss does not tell you what kind of strategies the model is most often relying on. Models that are very different in their training regime, that trade smaller size for more data, or less data for larger size, likely have a very different mix of strategies, and perplexity alone is not enough to tease them apart.</p>



<p>Neither are benchmarks enough. It is notoriously hard to prevent data pollution from any standard benchmark leaking into the training data, and so the vast majority of tests one might try are things the model has already seen. Even if you can prevent direct leakage, these sorts of rudimentary checks do not allow you to differentiate anything beyond the very first level of integration. Benchmark tests are adapted from other tests that are very conceptually similar even if not textually similar, and that conceptual similarity is not something you can assess with simple text search.</p>



<p>I’ve put some tasks on the same graph as vectors instead of points. These roughly point in the direction of what I think the the gradient w.r.t. improved performance of the task is for these attributes.</p>



<figure><a href="https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/tasks-graph.png"><img data-attachment-id="1523" data-permalink="https://moultano.wordpress.com/2023/06/28/the-many-ways-that-digital-minds-can-know/tasks-graph/" data-orig-file="https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/tasks-graph.png" data-orig-size="1698,1297" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="tasks-graph" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/tasks-graph.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/tasks-graph.png?w=1024" src="https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/tasks-graph.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/tasks-graph.png?w=1024 1024w, https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/tasks-graph.png?w=150 150w, https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/tasks-graph.png?w=300 300w, https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/tasks-graph.png?w=768 768w, https://moultano.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/tasks-graph.png 1698w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>When we see a model that performs well on benchmarks but then is disappointing to interact with, the cause may be that the benchmarks reflect a different mixture of these components than actual use. Different model choices likely change the balance of integration/coverage. These some of my hunches about how different choices affect things, but these are also just wild guesses.</p>



<ol>
<li>Increasing both model size and corpus size increases both integration and coverage.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Mixture of Experts models probably decrease integration relative to unified models with the same number of params.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Training longer on a smaller model probably increases coverage while it reduces integration.</li>
</ol>



<p>Right now this is just a brain dump and extremely far from being a real theory, let alone a quantifiable one, so let me list some directions of research that could shed light on this way of thinking, or falsify it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Mechanistic interpretability research to quantify the strategies an LLM is using for any particular task</li>



<li>Retrieval of similar examples from the training data corpus using the LLM’s hidden state, combined with subjective human evaluation of the similarity of the training instances to the task. The retrieval model must be at least of comparable language ability to the model it is attempting to explain the behavior of.</li>



<li>Training lots of models with different data/size tradeoffs, and evaluation on suites of tasks that cluster on these axes.</li>
</ul>



<h2>What does this mean about where we’re going?</h2>



<p>I have no idea. But there’s one analogy that I keep coming back to. A successful model memorizes at a higher level of abstraction. Once you reach the right level of abstraction, you’re done. You’ve learned to think.</p>

Now we're introducing LiteFS Cloud: managed backups and point-in-time restores for LiteFS—whether your app is running on Fly.io or anywhere else. <a href="https://fly.io/docs/litefs/speedrun/">Try it out for yourself</a>!</p><p>We love <a href="https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/">SQLite in production</a>, and we're all about running apps close to users. That's why we created LiteFS: an open source distributed SQLite database that lives on the same filesystem as your application, and replicates data to all the nodes in your app cluster.</p> <p>With LiteFS, you get the simplicity, flexibility, and lightning-fast local reads of working with vanilla SQLite, but distributed (so it's close to your users)! It's especially great for read-heavy web applications. Learn more about LiteFS in the <a href="https://fly.io/docs/litefs/">LiteFS docs</a> and in <a href="https://fly.io/blog/introducing-litefs/">our blog post introducing LiteFS</a>.</p> <p>At Fly.io we've been using LiteFS internally for a while now, and it's awesome!</p> <p>However, something is missing: disaster recovery. Because it's local to your app, you don't need to—indeed can't—pay someone to manage your LiteFS cluster, which means no managed backups. Until now, you've had to <a href="https://fly.io/docs/litefs/backup/">build your own</a>: take regular snapshots, store them somewhere, figure out a retention policy, that sort of thing.</p> <p>This also means you can only restore from a point in time when you happen to have taken a snapshot, and you likely need to limit how frequently you snapshot for cost reasons. Wouldn't it be cool if you could have super-frequent reliable backups to restore from, without having to implement it yourself?</p> <p>Well, that's why we're launching, in preview, LiteFS Cloud: backups and restores for LiteFS, managed by Fly.io. It gives you painless and reliable backups, with the equivalent of a snapshot every five minutes (8760 snapshots per month!), whether your database is hosted with us, or anywhere else.</p> <h2 id="how-do-i-use-litefs-cloud"><a href="#how-do-i-use-litefs-cloud" aria-label="Anchor"></a>How do I use LiteFS Cloud?</h2><p>There's a few steps to get started:</p> <ul> <li>Upgrade LiteFS to version 0.5.1 or greater </li><li>Create a LiteFS Cloud cluster in the Fly.io dashboard, <a href="https://fly.io/dashboard/personal/litefs">LiteFS Cloud section</a> </li><li>Make the LiteFS Cloud auth token available to your LiteFS </li></ul> <p><img src="https://fly.io/blog/2023-07-05/screenshot1.png" alt="Screenshot of Fly.io dashboard, with a red arrow pointing to &quot;LiteFS Cloud&quot; in the left navbar, and another red arrow pointing to the &quot;Create&quot; button on the top right for creating a LiteFS Cloud cluster"></p> <p><a href="https://fly.io/docs/litefs/cloud-backups">There are some docs here</a>, but that’s literally it. Then your database will start automagically backing up, we’ll manage the backups for you, and you’ll be able to restore your database near instantaneously to any point in time in the last 30 days (with 5 minute granularity).</p> <p>I want to say that again because I think it’s just wild – you can restore your database to <em>any point in time, with 5 minute granularity</em>. <strong><em>Near instantaneously</em></strong>.</p> <p>Speaking of restores—you can do those in the dashboard too. You pick a date and time, and we’ll take the most recent snapshot before that timestamp and restore it. This will take a couple of seconds (or less).</p> <p><img src="https://fly.io/blog/2023-07-05/screenshot2.png" alt="Screenshot of popup modal on Fly.io dashboard, with a date and time selector, and a text field with &quot;lfsc-test-runner/db&quot; typed in it, and a red button at the bottom with text &quot;I understand the consequences. Restore from this snapshot.&quot;"></p> <p>We'll introduce pricing in the coming months, but for now LiteFS Cloud is in preview and is free to use. Please go check it out, and let us know how it goes!</p> <h2 id="the-secret-sauce-ltx-compactions"><a href="#the-secret-sauce-ltx-compactions" aria-label="Anchor"></a>The secret sauce: LTX &amp; compactions</h2><p>LiteFS is built on a simple file format called <a href="https://github.com/superfly/ltx">Lite Transaction File (LTX)</a> which is designed for fast, flexible replication and recovery in LiteFS itself and in LiteFS Cloud.</p> <p>But first, let's start off with what an LTX file represents: <em>a change set of database pages</em>.</p> <p>When you commit a write transaction in SQLite, it updates one or more fixed-sized blocks called pages. By default, these are 4KB in size. An LTX file is simply a sorted list of these changed pages. Whenever you perform a transaction in SQLite, LiteFS will build an LTX file for that transaction.</p> <p>The interesting part of LTX is that contiguous sets of LTX files can be merged together into one LTX file. This merge process is called <em>compaction</em>.</p> <p>For example, let's say you have 3 transactions in a row that update the following set of pages:</p> <ul> <li>LTX A: Pages 1, 5, 7 </li><li>LTX B: Pages 5, 6 </li><li>LTX C: Pages 5, 7 </li></ul> <p>With LTX compaction, you avoid the duplicate work that comes from overwriting the same pages one transaction at a time. Instead, one LTX file for transactions A through C contains the last version of each page, so the pages are stored and updated only once:</p> <p><img src="https://fly.io/blog/2023-07-05/single-level-compaction.png" alt="Compacting three contiguous LTX files into a single LTX file."></p> <p>That, in a nutshell, is how a single-level compaction works.</p> <h2 id="it-s-ltx-all-the-way-down"><a href="#it-s-ltx-all-the-way-down" aria-label="Anchor"></a>It's LTX all the way down</h2><p>Compactions let us take changes for a bunch of transactions and smoosh them down into a single, small file. That's cool and all but how does that give us fast point-in-time restores? By the magic of multi-level compactions!</p> <p>Compaction levels are progressively larger time intervals that we roll up transaction data. In the following illustration, you can see that the highest level (L3) starts with a full snapshot of the database. This occurs daily and it's our starting point during a restore.</p> <p>Next, we have an hourly compaction level called L2 so there will be an LTX file with page changes between midnight and 1am, and then another file for 1am to 2am, etc. Below that is L1 which holds 5-minute intervals of data.</p> <p><img src="https://fly.io/blog/2023-07-05/multi-level-compaction.png" alt="Compaction levels for snapshots (L3), hourly (L2), &amp; every five minutes (L1)."></p> <p>When a restore is requested for a specific timestamp, we can determine a minimal set of LTX files to replay. For example, if we restored to January 10th at 8:15am we would grab the following files:</p> <ul> <li>Start with the snapshot for January 10th. </li><li>Fetch the eight hourly LTX files from midnight to 8am. </li><li>Fetch the three 5-minute interval LTX files from 8:00am to 8:15am. </li></ul> <p>Since LTX files are sorted by page number, we can perform a streaming merge of these twelve files and end up with the state of the database at the given timestamp.</p> <h2 id="department-of-redundancy-department"><a href="#department-of-redundancy-department" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Department of Redundancy Department</h2><p>One of the primary goals of LiteFS is to be simple to use. However, that's not an easy goal for a distributed database when our industry is moving more and more towards highly dynamic and ephemeral infrastructure. Traditional consensus algorithms require stable membership and adjusting the member set can be complicated.</p> <p>With LiteFS, we chose to use async replication as the primary mode of operation. This has some trade-offs in durability guarantees but it makes the cluster much simpler to operate. LiteFS Cloud alleviates many of the durability trade-offs of async replication by writing data out to S3 which provides eleven 9s of durability. That's pretty dang durable!</p> <p>However, we don't write every individual LTX file to S3 immediately. The latency is too high and it's not cost effective when you write a lot of transactions. Instead, the LiteFS primary node will batch up its changes every second and send a single, compacted LTX file to LiteFS Cloud. Once there, LiteFS Cloud will batch these 1-second files together and flush them to S3 periodically.</p> <p>We track the highest transaction ID of LTX files pushed to S3 and we call this the "high water mark" or HWM. This transaction ID is propagated back down to the nodes of the LiteFS cluster so we can ensure that the transaction file is not removed from any node until it is safely persisted on S3. With this approach, we have multiple layers of redundancy in case your LiteFS cluster can't communicate with LiteFS Cloud or if we can't communicate with S3.</p> <h2 id="what-s-next-for-litefs-cloud"><a href="#what-s-next-for-litefs-cloud" aria-label="Anchor"></a>What's next for LiteFS Cloud?</h2><p>We have a small team dedicated to LiteFS Cloud, and we're chugging away at new exciting features! Right now, LiteFS Cloud is really just backups and restores, but we are working on a lot of other cool stuff:</p> <ul> <li>Upload your database in the Fly.io dashboard. This way you don't have to worry about figuring out how to initialize your database when you first deploy it, just upload the database in the dashboard and LiteFS will pull it from LiteFS Cloud. </li><li>Download a point-in-time snapshot of your database from the Fly.io dashboard. You can use this to spin up a local dev env (with production data), do some local analysis, etc. </li><li>Clone your LiteFS Cloud cluster to a new cluster, which you could use for a staging environment (or on-demand test environments for your CI pipelines) with real data. </li><li>Features to support apps that run on serverless platforms like Vercel, Google Cloud Run, Deno, and more. We'll need to develop a number of different features for this, stay tuned for more information in the coming weeks! </li></ul> <p>We're really excited about the future of LiteFS Cloud, so we wanted to share what we're thinking. We'd also love to hear any feedback you have about these ideas that might inform our work.</p>  </section> <dl> <dt> Previous post&nbsp;&nbsp;↓ </dt> <dd> <a href="https://fly.io/blog/we-raised-a-bunch-of-money/"> We Raised A Bunch Of Money </a> </dd> </dl> </article></div>]]></description>

  <p><em>[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]</em></p><p>This is the Carlsbad Desalination Plant outside of San Diego, California. It produces roughly ten percent of the area’s fresh water, around 50 million gallons or 23,000 cubic meters per day. Unlike most treatment plants that clean up water from rivers or lakes, the Carlsbad plant pulls its water directly from the ocean. Desalination, or the removal of salt from seawater, is one of those technologies that has always seemed right on the horizon. It might surprise you to learn that there are more than 18,000 desalination plants operating across the globe. But, those plants provide less than a percent of global water needs even though they consume a quarter of all the energy used by the water industry.</p><p>I live like 100 miles away from the nearest sea, so it’s easier for me to mix up my own batch of seawater right here in the studio. There are two main ways we use to desalinate water, and I’ve got some garage demonstrations to show you exactly how they work. Will the dubious chemistry set or the cheapest pressure washer I could find work better? Let’s track the energy use and other complications for both these demos so we can compare at the end of the video. Dumping that salt into a bucket of water may seem like no big deal, but reversing the process is a lot more complicated than you might think. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering. In today’s episode, we’re talking about desalination.</p><p>Earth is a watery place. Zoom out and the stuff is practically everywhere. It doesn't seem fair that the word “drought” is even in our lexicon. And yet, the scarcity of water is one of the most widespread and serious challenges faced by people around the world. The oceans are a nearly unlimited resource of water with this seemingly trivial caveat, which is that the water is just a little bit salty. It’s totally understandable to wonder why that little bit of salt is such an enormous obstacle.</p><p>How much salt is in seawater anyway? You’ve heard of “percent,” but have you ever heard of “per mille”? Just add another circle below the slash and now, instead of parts per hundred, this symbol means parts per thousand, which is the perfect unit to talk about salinity. The salinity of the ocean actually varies a little bit geographically and through the seasons, but in general, every liter of seawater usually has around 35 grams of dissolved salt. In other words, 35 parts per thousand or 35 permille. That means, for this bucket, I need about this much salt to match the salinity of seawater.</p><p>I didn’t get it dead on, but this is close enough for our demo. Looks like a lot of salt, but I could dissolve about 10 times that much in this water before the solution becomes saturated and won’t hold any more. So, compared to how salty it could be, seawater isn’t that far from freshwater. But, compared to how salty it should be (in order to be okay to drink and such), it has a ways to go. Normal saline solution used in medicine is 9 parts per thousand because it’s approximately isotonic to your blood. That means it won’t dehydrate or overhydrate your cells. But (unless it’s masked by a bunch of sugar) even that concentration of salt in water isn’t going to taste very good.</p><p>Most places don’t put legal limits on dissolved solids for drinking water, but the World Health Organization suggests anything more than 1 part per thousand is usually unacceptable to consumers. It doesn’t taste good. 500 parts per million (or half permille) is generally the upper limit for fresh water (and that includes all dissolved solids combined, not just salt). But that means seawater desalination has to remove (or in industry jargon, reject) more than 98 percent of the salt in the water. That’s the reason why there are really only two main technologies in desalination. But neither of them are particularly sophisticated, at least in their simplest form, so I’m going to try some do-it-yourself desalination to show you how this works.</p><p>The oldest and most straightforward way to separate salt and water is distillation, and this is my very basic setup to do just that. All you chemists and laboratory professionals are probably shaking your heads right now, but this is just to illustrate the basics. On the left, I have a flask of my homemade seawater sitting in sand, in a pot, on a hot plate. Salt doesn’t like to be a gas, at least not under the conditions we normally live in on earth. Water, on the other hand, can be convinced into its gaseous state with some heat from a conventional hotplate. And that’s what I’m doing here, just adding some heat to the system. And I’m tracking exactly how much heat using this Kill A Watt meter.</p><p>Once the water is converted to steam, it is effectively separated from the salt. All I have to do is condense the vaporized water back into its liquid form. This pump moves ice water through the condenser to encourage that process… if the tube doesn’t slip out of the beaker and spill ice water all over the table.</p><p>In my receiving flask on the right, I should have distilled water that is nearly salt free. Testing it out with the meter, the dissolved solids are practically nil, just a few parts per million. But it took nearly 2 hours to get only 200 milliliters of water, and right about a kilowatt-hour of electricity too. </p><p>Water usage in the US varies quite a bit, but a rough estimate is 300 gallons (or 1,100 liters) per day per household. To produce that much water using my distillation setup here, I would have to scale it up nearly 500 times this size, and it would consume nearly 6,000 kilowatt-hours in a day (assuming the same efficiency I got in the demo). At the average residential US electricity price, it’s roughly 800 dollars per day! That’s an expensive shower. Could this be made more efficient? I don’t think so.</p><p>No, obviously it can. My garage demo has very little going for it in terms of efficiency. It’s about as basic as distillation gets. There’s lost heat going everywhere. Modern distillation setups are much more efficient at separating liquids, especially because they can take advantage of waste heat. In fact they are often co-located with coal or gas-fired power plants for this exact reason. And there’s a lot of technology just in minimizing the energy consumption of distillation, including reuse of the heat released during condensation, using stages to evaporate liquids more efficiently, and using pumps to lower the pressure and encourage further evaporation through mechanical means. But the thermal efficiency isn’t the only challenge with distillation.</p><p>Take a look at the flask that held the seawater after all the water boiled away and you can see the salt deposits building up, even after distilling only a small amount of water. These scale deposits reduce the efficiency of boiling because heat doesn’t transfer through them very easily, which means they would have to be cleaned off regularly. One alternative is a flash evaporator that sends the liquid stream through an expansion valve to force it to evaporate at temperatures lower than boiling, which minimizes the buildup of scale. Flash evaporators are the workhorses of desalination plants that use distillation, and especially in the middle east, plants like this have been reliably producing fresh water for decades now, but they’re not the only way to get the job done.</p><p>The other primary type of desalination uses membranes. You may have heard of the phenomenon called osmosis, where a solution naturally diffuses through a barrier. But you can reverse the osmotic process, moving a solution from high concentration to low with pressure… usually a lot of pressure. Let me show you what I mean. Luckily there are commercially available seawater membranes that don’t cost an arm and a leg. That’s because these systems are frequently used in boats and ships to make freshwater while at sea. But why spend thousands of dollars on a working watermaker when you have the rudimentary plumbing skills of a civil engineer?</p><p>Here’s the membrane I’m using for this demo. It’s wrapped in a spiral so you get lots of surface area in a small package. It is kind of like a filter that lets water pass through while holding back the dissolved solids, but at a much tinier scale. It’s generally a lot more efficient than thermal distillation, so most modern desalination plants use reverse osmosis (or RO) for primary separation. But, as you’ll see, it still uses a lot of energy, way more than a typical raw water treatment plant.</p><p>It takes a lot of pressure to force seawater through a membrane, in my case about 600 psi or 40 times normal atmospheric pressure. Even small RO systems use high-pressure pumps designed for continuous use, because this is not a fast process. Instead of springing for a nice pump well-suited for the application, I’m using the cheapest power washer I could find at the local hardware store. The instructions didn’t say not to run saltwater through it.</p><p>The membrane sits inside this high pressure housing that keeps it from unraveling under the immense forces inside. That’s if you hook everything up correctly… I had to redo a few connections when the housing sprung a leak during early testing.</p><p>A booster pump delivers the seawater from the bucket to the pressure washer, then the pressure washer sends it into the housing. Unlike a typical filter, not all the feed water flows through the membrane. Instead, most of it flows past the membranes and comes out on the other side just a little bit more concentrated with salt. This is called the brine and we’ll talk more about it in a minute. The water that does make it through the membrane, called the permeate, comes out in the center of the housing. You can see on my flow meters that, if I close the valve on the brine discharge line, it increases the pressure in the housing, forcing more of the water through the membrane. The meter on the left is brine discharge, and the one on the right is the permeate line. As I close the valve, the brine flow goes down and the permeate flow goes up. Of course I could close the brine flow all the way down, but you still need some water to carry the salt away or it will just foul up the membrane.</p><p>Typically you need to run water through these membranes for several hours before they settle into their best performance. My little power washer wasn’t quite up to the task of running for that long, but even after roughly half an hour, I was getting water with one to two parts per thousand of dissolved solids through this crude setup. That’s not high quality drinking water, but it’s definitely drinkable!</p><p>I ran this experiment a few times at different pressures, but the results didn’t vary too much. For this run, the combined power for the booster pump and the pressure water was around 1200 watts, and it took about five minutes to produce a liter (or quarter of a gallon). Going back to our residential household, it would take four pressure washers running non-stop and consume more than 100 kilowatt-hours in a day. That’s a huge improvement over the distillation demo, even considering the water quality wasn’t quite as good, but it’s still 15 dollars a day or more than 5,000 dollars per year just to separate salt from water.</p><p>It won’t surprise you to learn that, just like my crude distillation demo, my reverse osmosis via pressure washer demo is also not nearly as efficient as it could be on a larger scale. Modern RO plants use huge racks of high quality membrane units and high efficiency pumps. They also recover the energy from the brine stream before it leaves the system back out to sea, saving the precious kilowatt-hours already consumed by the pumps. To separate a cubic meter or 264 gallons, of seawater from its salt, my power washer RO system would take about a hundred kilowatt-hours. The newest RO plants can do it with just one or two.</p><p>But, even though the separation step is energy intensive, it’s not the only energy requirement in a seawater desal plant, and it’s definitely not the only cost. I’m using tap water in my demonstration, but these plants don’t start with that. Raw seawater not only has salt, but also dirt, algae, organic matter, and other contaminants too. Those constituents can foul or damage evaporators or membranes, so all desal plants use a pretreatment process to remove them first. That takes energy and cost to keep up with the various chemical feeds and filters before the water even reaches the salt separation process. And, even with good pretreatment, the RO membranes or evaporators have to be taken out of service for cleaning regularly, and eventually they have to be replaced. Additionally, you usually can’t send RO permeate or distilled water directly to customers. It’s too clean! It normally goes through a post-treatment process to add minerals, since most people prefer the taste over just pure water. Plus it gets disinfectant so that it can’t be contaminated on its way through the distribution system. And don’t forget about that brine.</p><p>All that salt that didn’t come out of the product stream is now packed into a smaller volume of water, making it more concentrated than before. Modern desalination plants generally recover about half of the intake flow, which means their brine stream is about twice the concentration of normal seawater. It’s a waste product that is actually pretty tough to get rid of. You can’t just discharge that super-saline waste directly back into the sea because of the environmental impacts, particularly on the plants and animals near the sea floor (since the concentrated solution usually sinks). To avoid environmental impacts, most brine discharge lines either use diffusers to spread out the salty solution so it dilutes faster or they blend the brine with some other stream of water like power plant cooling lines or wastewater effluent so it’s diluted before being released. When that’s not possible, some plants have to inject the saltwater into the ground (an expensive endeavor that only adds to operational costs).</p><p>With all the complications of separating salt from seawater, it’s easy to let one’s mind drift toward alternatives like harnessing renewable sources of energy. Like, what if we could use solar power to not only distill seawater but also carry it inland toward major cities and release it onto the ground where it could easily be collected. But now we’ve just re-invented the water cycle, which is already how we humans get the vast majority of the water we use to drink, cook, and bathe. It’s not like dams, reservoirs, canals, pumping stations, and surface water intakes don’t have their own enormous costs and environmental impacts. But, if mother nature isn’t dropping enough water for your particular populated area, you can build and operate a pretty long pipeline for the immense costs and energy required to desalinate seawater.</p><p>And that’s the problem with desalination. It’s kind of like the nuclear power of water supply. It seems so simple on the surface, but when you add up all the practical costs and complexities, it gets really hard to justify over other alternatives. It’s also harder to compare costs between those alternatives because of desal’s unique problems. It’s just a newer technology, so it’s harder to predict hidden technical, legal, political, and environmental challenges. For example, because of the high energy demands, desalination can strongly couple water costs with electricity costs. During a drought, the cost of hydropower goes up because there’s less water available, increasing overall energy costs and thus making desalination less viable right when you need it most.</p><p>Of course, desalination is a viable solution in many situations, especially in places with large populations and severe water scarcity. All the biggest plants are in middle eastern countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE. That’s because they really have no choice. But it can also be viable in areas with a lot of variability in climate like California, Texas, and Florida. In these cases, a desalination plant is just one element in a diverse portfolio of resources, all with different risk profiles. Yes, the desalinated water is more expensive than other options like rivers, reservoirs, and groundwater supplies. But it can be more reliable too, providing water during drought conditions when the other sources are limited or completely unavailable. And, a lot of these costs and complexities get simpler when you’re not pulling salt out of seawater. There are sources of water that have some salt (but not as much as the ocean) like estuaries and brackish groundwater. In places where such a supply is available, desalination can be a much more cost effective source of fresh water.</p><p>Another way to make desal projects more viable is to let the private sector take on the risks. Many of the largest desalination plants are partnerships with private water companies rather than being financed, built, and operated by the utility like what’s done for a typical treatment plant. Partnering with a private company allows a utility to offload the financing costs and operational risks in return for the stability of a simple water purchase agreement. You pay for it, build it, and operate it, and we’ll just buy the water from you. This type of arrangement also keeps government boards from having to weigh in on complicated technical issues and innovations where there’s just not as much precedence to lean on as there is with more established types of water infrastructure projects.</p><p>The private company running the Carlsbad plant in San Diego County I mentioned earlier is working on a major project scheduled to finish in 2024: a new standalone seawater intake required after the power plant next door shut down in 2018. Bonds issued for the project were upgraded to rating of triple-B by Fitch, meaning the facility has a relatively stable outlook with a lower chance of defaulting. That’s just one rating agency’s assessment of just one project on just one membrane plant, but it gives some confidence that the technology of desalination is making progress, and that it might become a bigger and bigger part of the world’s limited supply of fresh water in the future.</p>
