          <p>A jury has awarded WhatsApp $167 million in punitive damages in a case the company brought against Israel-based NSO Group for exploiting a software vulnerability that hijacked the phones of thousands of users.</p>
<p>The verdict, reached Tuesday, comes as a major victory not just for Meta-owned WhatsApp but also for privacy- and security-rights advocates who have long criticized the practices of NSO and other exploit sellers. The jury also awarded WhatsApp $444 million in compensatory damages.</p>
<h2>Clickless exploit</h2>
<p>WhatsApp sued NSO <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/whatsapp-suit-says-israeli-spyware-maker-exploited-its-app-to-infect-1400-users/">in 2019</a> for an attack that targeted roughly 1,400 mobile phones belonging to attorneys, journalists, human-rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials. NSO, which works on behalf of governments and law enforcement authorities in various countries, exploited a critical WhatsApp vulnerability that allowed it to install NSO’s proprietary spyware <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/found-quite-possibly-the-most-sophisticated-android-espionage-app-ever/">Pegasus</a> on iOS and Android devices. The clickless exploit worked by placing a call to a target's app. A target did not have to answer the call to be infected.</p>
<p>“Today’s verdict in WhatsApp’s case is an important step forward for privacy and security as the first victory against the development and use of illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone,” WhatsApp said in a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/05/winning-the-fight-against-spyware-merchant-nso/">statement</a>. “Today, the jury’s decision to force NSO, a notorious foreign spyware merchant, to pay damages is a critical deterrent to this malicious industry against their illegal acts aimed at American companies and the privacy and security of the people we serve.”</p>
<p>NSO created WhatsApp accounts in 2018 and used them a year later to initiate calls that exploited the critical vulnerability on phones, which, among others, included 100 members of "civil society" from 20 countries, according to an investigation research group Citizen Lab performed on behalf of WhatsApp. The calls passed through WhatsApp servers and injected malicious code into the memory of targeted devices. The targeted phones would then use WhatsApp servers to connect to malicious servers maintained by NSO.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Monday <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/05/ftc-rule-unfair-or-deceptive-fees-take-effect-may-12-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released</a> new documentation detailing its new “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/ftc-bans-hidden-junk-fees-in-short-term-lodging-live-event-ticket-prices/">Rule on Unfair or Deceptive Fees</a>.”&nbsp;The rule, set to take effect on May 12, prohibits hidden fees for live events, hotels, and short-term rentals. It also bans practices such as “bait-and-switch pricing” and any actions that conceal or misrepresent total prices and fees.</p>

<p>In a newly published FAQ, the FTC offers a guide for these types of businesses, providing detailed information about pricing transparency. </p>







<p>The rule will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/ftc-bans-hidden-junk-fees-in-short-term-lodging-live-event-ticket-prices/">impact businesses</a>, including live-event ticket sellers and short-term lodging providers, like hotels, motels, Airbnb, or VRBO. Third-party platforms, resellers, and travel agents are also covered by the new regulation. (Airbnb already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/airbnb-will-automatically-display-total-price-to-all-users/">updated its service in advance of this new regulation</a> to show users the total cost of their stay upfront.)</p>

<p>According to the FTC:</p>

<ul>
<li>Live-event tickets include those for concerts, sporting events, music, theater, and other live performances that audiences watch as they occur, but not pre-recorded audio or visual performances.</li>



<li>The total price must include all known charges and fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Sites must disclose the total price upfront in ads and other offers for live-event tickets or short-term lodging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>The total price must also be more prominently displayed than any other pricing information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>There should be no misrepresentation about fees and charges.</li>



<li>Sites should provide truthful information about fees, including refund policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Sites should avoid vague terms like “convenience fees,” “service fees,” or “processing fees.”&nbsp;</li>



<li>Dynamic pricing strategies are still allowed as long as the pricing information isn’t misleading.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also included in the FTC’s new FAQ are the types of fees that can be excluded, such as taxes or government fees, shipping charges, and charges for optional goods or services people may select to buy as part of the same transaction. (Note that handling charges aren’t on this list.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the FTC notes that businesses must disclose that it has excluded charges from the total price before asking for payment. For example, if a business excludes shipping charges from the advertised price, it’s required to clearly state the amount and purpose of those charges.</p>

<p>The FTC first passed the rule in December 2024, a landmark regulation that marked a significant win for consumers who have been frustrated for years about hidden fees.</p>

In 1995 he wrote an influential article called “</em><a href="https://cr.yp.to/bib/1995/wirth.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>A Plea for Lean Software</em></a><em>,”</em><em> published in </em><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/348001" target="_blank">Computer</a><em>, the magazine for members of the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ieee-computer-society">IEEE Computer Society</a>, which I read early in my career as an entrepreneur and software developer. In what follows, I try to make the same case nearly 30 years later, updated for today’s computing horrors. A version of this post was </em><a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/a-2024-plea-for-lean-software/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>originally published</em></a><em> on my personal blog, <a href="http://berthub.eu/" target="_blank">Berthub.eu</a>.</em><br></p><p>Some years ago I did a talk at a local university on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a>, titled “<a href="https://berthub.eu/cyber-mad/Cyber%20and%20information%20security.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cyber and Information Security: Have We All Gone Mad?</a>” It is still worth reading today since we <em>have</em> gone quite mad collectively.</p><p>The way we build and ship software these days is mostly ridiculous, leading to apps using millions of lines of code to open a garage door, and other simple programs importing <a href="https://github.com/SashenJayathilaka/Photo-Sharing-Application" target="_blank">1,600 external code libraries</a>—dependencies—of unknown provenance. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-security">Software security</a> is dire, which is a function both of the quality of the code and the sheer amount of it. Many of us <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/programmers">programmers</a> know the current situation is untenable. Many programmers (and their management) sadly haven’t ever experienced anything else. And for the rest of us, we rarely get the time to do a better job.</p><p>It is not just you; we are not merely suffering from nostalgia: Software really is very weird today.</p><p> Let me briefly go over the terrible state of software security, and then spend some time on why it is so bad. I also mention some regulatory and legislative things going on that we might use to make software quality a priority again. Finally, I talk about <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/trifecta" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an actual useful piece of software I wrote</a> as a proof of concept that one can still make <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/trifecta-technology" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">minimal and simple yet modern software</a>.</p><p>I hope that this post provides some mental and moral support for suffering programmers and technologists who want to improve things. It is not just you; We are not merely suffering from nostalgia: Software really is very weird today.</p><h2>The terrible state of software security</h2><p>Without going all <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Old man (48) yells at cloud</a>,” let me restate some obvious things. The state of software security is <em>dire</em>. If we only look at the past year, if you ran industry-standard software like <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/exploitation-ivanti-vulnerabilities" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ivanti</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_MOVEit_data_breach" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MOVEit</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/russian-hackers-exploiting-outlook-bug-to-hijack-exchange-accounts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Outlook</a>, <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/cve-2023-22518-improper-authorization-vulnerability-in-confluence-data-center-and-server-1311473907.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Confluence</a>, <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/barracuda-esg-exploited-globally" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Barracuda Email Security Gateway</a>, <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/remediation-netscaler-adc-gateway-cve-2023-4966" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Citrix NetScaler ADC, and NetScaler Gateway</a>, chances are you got hacked. Even companies with near-infinite resources (like Apple and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/google">Google</a>) made <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/09/critical-vulnerability-in-libwebp-library.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trivial “worst practice” security mistakes</a> that put <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/apple-zero-click-imessage-exploit-used-to-infect-iphones-with-spyware/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their customers in danger</a>. Yet we continue to rely on all these products.</p><p>Software is now (rightfully) considered so dangerous that we tell everyone not to run it themselves.<em></em></p><p>Software is now (rightfully) considered so dangerous that we tell everyone not to run it themselves. Instead, you are supposed to leave that to an “<em>X</em> as a service” provider, or perhaps just to “the cloud.” Compare this to a hypothetical situation where cars are so likely to catch fire that the advice is not to drive a car yourself, but to leave that to professionals who are always accompanied by professional firefighters.</p><p>The assumption is then that the cloud is somehow able to make insecure software trustworthy. Yet in the past year, we’ve learned that Microsoft’s <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/09/outlook-breach-microsoft-reveals-how.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">email platform was thoroughly hacked</a>, including classified government email. (<a href="https://metacurity.substack.com/p/russian-hacking-group-midnight-blizzard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twice!</a>) There are also <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/azures-terrible-security-posture-comes-home-to-roost/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well-founded worries about the security of the Azure cloud</a>. Meanwhile, industry darling Okta, which provides cloud-based software that enables user log-in to various applications, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/okta-says-hackers-stole-data-all-customer-support-users-cyber-breach-2023-11-29/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">got comprehensively owned</a>. This was their second breach within two years. Also, there was a suspicious spate of Okta users subsequently getting hacked.</p><p>Clearly, we need better software.</p><p>The <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/european-union">European Union</a> has launched three pieces of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/legislation">legislation</a> to this effect: <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NIS2 for important services</a>; the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cyber Resilience Act </a>for almost all commercial software and electronic devices; and a revamped <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/eu-updates-product-liability-regime-to-include-software-artificial-intelligence/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Product Liability Directive</a> that also extends to software. Legislation is always hard, and it remains to be seen <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/eu-cra-what-does-it-mean-for-open-source/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">if they got it right</a>. But that software security is terrible enough these days to warrant legislation seems obvious.</p><h2>Why software security is so bad</h2><p>I want to touch on incentives. The situation today is clearly working well for commercial operators. Making more secure software takes time and is a lot of work, and the current security incidents don’t appear to be impacting the bottom line or stock prices. You can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/software-components-only-the-giants-survive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speed up time to market by cutting corners</a>. So from an economic standpoint, what we see is entirely predictable. Legislation could be very important in changing this equation.</p><p>The security of software depends on two factors—the <em>density</em> of security issues in the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/source-code">source code</a> and the sheer <em>amount of code</em> accessible by <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/hackers">hackers</a>. As the U.S. defense community loved to point out in the 1980s, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-said-Quantity-has-a-quality-all-its-own" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quantity has a quality all of its own</a>. The reverse applies to software—the more you have of it, the more risks you run.</p><p>As a case in point, Apple iPhone users got repeatedly hacked over many years because of the huge attack surface exposed by iMessage. It is possible to send an unsolicited iMessage to an Apple user. The phone will then immediately process that message so it can preview it. The problem is that Apple in its wisdom decided that such unsolicited messages needed to support a vast array of image formats, accidentally <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including PDFs with weird embedded compressed fonts</a> using an ancient format that effectively included a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/programming">programming</a> language. So someone could send an unsolicited message to your iPhone that could probe for weaknesses in the rest of the phone.</p><p>In this way, attackers were able to benefit from security bugs in the phone’s millions of lines of code. You don’t need a high bug density to find <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/PEGA/DV/2023/05-08/REPORTcompromises_EN.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an exploitable hole</a> in millions of lines of code.</p><p>Wiping out all the bugs in your code won’t save you from the decision to implement a feature to automatically execute code embedded in documents.</p><p>Apple could have prevented this situation by restricting previews to a far smaller range of image formats, or even a single “known good” image format. Apple could have saved themselves an enormous amount of pain simply by <a href="https://github.com/berthubert/sbox#sbox" target="_blank">exposing fewer lines of their code</a> to attackers. Incidentally, the E.U.’s Cyber Resilience Act <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/eu-cra-secure-coding-solution/" target="_blank">explicitly tells vendors to minimize the attack surface</a>.</p><p><span></span>Apple is (by far) not the worst offender in this field. But it is a widely respected and well-resourced company that usually thinks through what they do. And even they got it wrong by needlessly shipping and exposing too much code.</p><h2>Could we not write better code?</h2><p>There are those who think the biggest problem is the quality of the code, expressed in terms of the density of bugs in it. There are many interesting things happening on this front, like the use of <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3608324/us-and-international-partners-issue-recommendations-to-secure-software-products/" target="_blank">memory safe languages</a> like <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust</a>. Other languages are <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer" target="_blank">also upping their security game</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fuzzers</a>—test tools that automatically modify inputs to computer programs to find weaknesses and bugs—are also getting ever more advanced.</p><p>But many security problems are in the logic underlying the code. For example, the Barracuda email exploit originated in a third-party library that would actually <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2023-7101/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">execute code</a> in Excel spreadsheets when they were scanned for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/viruses">viruses</a>. Wiping out all the bugs in your code won’t save you from the decision to implement a feature to automatically execute code embedded in documents.</p><h2>The state of shipping software</h2><p>Another problem is that we often don’t know what code we are actually shipping. Software has gotten <em>huge</em>. In 1995 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Niklaus Wirth</a> lamented that software had grown to megabytes in size. In his article “A Plea for Lean Software,” he went on to describe his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(operating_system)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oberon operating system</a>, which was only 200 kilobytes, including an editor and a compiler. There are now projects that have more than 200 KB for their configuration files alone.</p><p>A typical app today is built on <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electron JS</a>, a framework that incorporates both Chromium (“Chrome”) and Node.JS, which provides access to tens of thousands of software packages for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/javascript">JavaScript</a>. I estimate just using Electron JS entails at least 50 million lines of code if you include dependencies. Perhaps more. The app meanwhile likely pulls in hundreds or thousands of helper packages. Many packages used will also, by default, snitch on your users to advertisers and other data brokers. Dependencies pull in further dependencies, and exactly what gets included in the build can change on a daily basis, and no one really knows.</p><p>If this app controls anything in your house, it will also connect to a software stack over at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amazon">Amazon</a>, probably also powered by Node.js, also pulling in many dependencies. </p><p>We are likely looking at over 50 million active lines of code to open a garage door….</p><p>But wait, there’s more. We used to ship software as the output of a compiler, or perhaps as a bunch of files to be interpreted. Such software then had to be <em>installed</em> and <em>configured</em> to work right. Getting your code packaged to ship like this is a lot of work. But it was good work since it forced people to think about what was in their “package.” This software package would then integrate with an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/operating-system">operating system</a> and with local services, based on the configuration.</p><p>Since the software ran on a different computer than the one it was developed on, people really had to know what they shipped and think it through. And sometimes it didn’t work, leading to the joke where a developer tells the operations people, “Well, it works on my system,” and the retort “Then back up your email, we’re taking your laptop into production!”</p><p>This used to be a joke, but these days we often ship software as containers, shipping not only the software itself but also including operating system files to make sure the software runs in a well-known environment. This frequently entails effectively shipping a complete computer disk image. This again vastly expands the amount of code being deployed. Note that you can do good things with containers like <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/docker">Docker</a> (see below), but there are a lot of images over 350 MB on the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/explore" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a>.</p><p>Add it all up and we are likely looking at over 50 million active lines of code to open a garage door, running several operating-system images on multiple servers.</p><p>Now, even if all the included dependencies are golden, are we sure that their security updates are making it to your garage door opener app? I wonder how many Electron apps are still shipping with the <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/09/critical-vulnerability-in-libwebp-library.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">image processing bug</a> that had Google and Apple scramble to put out updates last year. We don’t even know.</p><p>But even worse, it is a known fact that all these dependencies are <em>not</em> golden. The Node.js ecosystem has a <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/researchers-hijack-popular-npm-package.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">comical history</a> of package repositories <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/npm-security-preventing-supply-chain-attacks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">being taken over</a>, hijacked, or resurrected under the same name by someone else, someone with nefarious<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/19/npm_s3_buckets_malware/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> plans for your security</a>. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/02/novel_pypi_attack_reversinglabs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PyPI</a> (a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/python">Python</a> counterpart of Node.js) has suffered from <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/04/pypi_pytorch_dependency_attack/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similar problems</a>. Dependencies always need scrutiny, but no one can reasonably be expected to <a href="https://medium.com/graph-commons/analyzing-the-npm-dependency-network-e2cf318c1d0d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">check thousands of them frequently</a>. But we prefer not to think about this. (Note that you should also not overshoot and needlessly reimplement everything yourself to prevent dependencies. There are very good modules that <a href="https://sqlite.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">likely are more secure</a> than what you could type in on your own.)</p><p>The world is shipping far too much code where we don’t even know what we ship and we aren’t looking hard enough (or at all) at what we <em>do</em> know we ship.</p><h2>You <em>can</em> write lean code today</h2><p>Writing has been called the process by which you find out you don’t <a href="https://fs.blog/writing-to-think/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">know what you are talking about</a>. Actually doing stuff, meanwhile, is the process by which you find out you also did not know what you were writing about.</p><p>In a small reenactment of Wirth’s Oberon Project, I too wrote some code to prove a point, and to reassure myself I still know what I am talking and writing about. Can you still make useful and modern software the old way? I decided to try to create a minimalistic but full-featured image-sharing solution that I could trust.</p><p>Trifecta is the result. It is <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/trifecta/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">actual stand-alone software</a> that lets you use a browser to drag and drop images for easy sharing. It has pained me for years that I had to use <a href="https://imgur.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imgur</a> for this purpose. Not only does imgur install lots of cookies and trackers in my browser, I also force these trackers onto the people who view the images that I share. If you want to self-host a Web service like this, you also don’t want to get hacked. Most image-sharing solutions I found that you could run yourself are based on huge frameworks that I don’t trust too much for the reasons outlined above.</p><p>So, also to make a point, I decided to create a minimalistic but also useful image-sharing solution that I could trust. And more important, that other people could trust as well, because you can check out all Trifecta’s code within a few hours. It consists of <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/trifecta-technology" target="_blank">1,600 lines of new source code</a>, plus around five important dependencies. </p><p>You end up with a grand total of 3 megabytes of code.</p><p>To contrast, <a href="https://github.com/CaramelFur/Picsur/pkgs/container/picsur" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one other image-sharing solution</a> ships as a 288-MB Docker image, although admittedly it looks better and has some more features. But not 285 MB worth of them. Another comparison is <a href="https://github.com/SashenJayathilaka/Photo-Sharing-Application" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this Node-based picture-sharing solution</a>, which <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/clocks">clocks</a> in at 1,600 dependencies, apparently totaling over 4 million lines of JavaScript.</p><p>The world ships too much code, most of it by third parties, sometimes unintended, most of it uninspected. <em></em></p><p><span></span>Note that Trifecta is not intended as a public site where random people can share images, as that does not tend to end well. It is however very suitable for company or personal use. You can read more about the project <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/trifecta" target="_blank">here</a>, and there is also <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/trifecta-technology" target="_blank">a page</a> about the technology used to deliver such a tiny self-contained solution.</p><h2>Response to Trifecta</h2><p>This has been rather interesting. The most common response to Trifecta so far has been that I should use a whole bag of Amazon Web Services to deploy it. This is an exceedingly odd response to a project with the clearly stated goal of providing stand-alone software that does not rely on external services. I’m not sure what is going on here.</p><p>Another reaction has been that I treat Docker unfairly, and that you could definitely use containers for good. And I agree wholeheartedly. But I also look at what people are actually doing (also with other forms of containers or virtual machines), and it’s not so great.</p><p>I want to end this post with some observations from <a href="https://cr.yp.to/bib/1995/wirth.pdf" target="_blank">Niklaus Wirth’s 1995 paper</a>:</p><blockquote>“To some, complexity equals power. (…) Increasingly, <em>people seem to misinterpret complexity as sophistication</em>, which is baffling—the incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration.”</blockquote><p>I’ve similarly observed that some people prefer complicated systems. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tony Hoare</a> noted long ago, “[T]here are two methods in software design. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1283920.1283936" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One is to make the program so simple, there are obviously no errors</a>. The other is to make it so complicated, there are no obvious errors.” If you can’t do the first variant, the second way starts looking awfully attractive perhaps.</p><p>Back to Wirth: </p><blockquote>“Time pressure is probably the foremost reason behind the emergence of bulky software. The time pressure that designers endure discourages careful planning. It also discourages improving acceptable solutions; instead, it encourages quickly conceived software additions and corrections. Time pressure gradually corrupts an engineer’s standard of quality and perfection. It has a detrimental effect on people as well as products.”</blockquote><p>Why spend weeks paring down your software when you can also ship a whole pre-installed operating-system image that just works?</p><blockquote>“The plague of software explosion is not a ‘law of nature.’ It is avoidable, and it is the software engineer’s task to curtail it.”</blockquote><p>If this is indeed on the shoulders of software people, we should perhaps demand more time for it.</p><p>The world ships too much code, most of it by third parties, sometimes unintended, most of it uninspected. Because of this, there is a huge <em>attack surface</em> full of mediocre code. Efforts are ongoing to improve the quality of code itself, but many exploits are due to logic fails, and less progress has been made scanning for those. Meanwhile, great strides could be made by paring down just how much code we expose to the world. This will increase time to market for products, but legislation is around the corner that should force vendors to take security more seriously.</p><p>Trifecta is, like Wirth’s Oberon Project mentioned above, meant as a proof that you can deliver a lot of functionality even with a limited amount of code and dependencies. With effort and legislation, maybe the future could again bring sub-50-million-line garage-door openers. Let’s try to make it happen.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">The Drug Enforcement Administration has quietly ended its body camera program barely four years after it began, according to an internal email obtained by ProPublica.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">On April 2, DEA headquarters emailed employees announcing that the program had been terminated effective the day before. The DEA has not publicly announced the policy change, but by early April, <a href="https://www.dea.gov/es/node/223436">links to pages about body camera policies</a> on the DEA’s website were broken.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">The email said the agency made the change to be “consistent” with a Trump executive order rescinding the 2022 requirement that all federal law enforcement agents use body cameras.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">But at least two other federal law enforcement agencies within the Justice Department — the U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — are still requiring body cameras, according to their spokespeople. The FBI referred questions about its body camera policy to the Justice Department, which declined to comment.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">The DEA did not respond to questions about its decision to stop using the cameras, saying that the agency “does not comment on tools and techniques.” Reuters reported on the change as part of a story about <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-seeks-budget-cuts-justice-department-law-enforcement-offices-sources-2025-05-02/">budget cuts for law enforcement offices</a>.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">One former federal prosecutor expressed concern that the change would make life more difficult for DEA agents.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">“The vast majority of times I viewed body camera footage is based on allegations from a defense attorney about what a cop did,” said David DeVillers, former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Ohio. “And I would say 95% of the time it absolves the cop of wrongdoing.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">The Justice Department started requiring that its federal agents wear the devices in 2021 in the wake of the protests over George Floyd’s death the previous summer.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">“We welcome the addition of body worn cameras and appreciate the enhanced transparency and assurance they provide to the public and to law enforcement officers working hard to keep our communities safe and healthy,” then-DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-first-federal-agents-use-body-worn-cameras?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Sept. 1, 2021, press release</a> announcing the use of the cameras.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">In May 2022, then-President Joe Biden issued an executive order expanding the use of body cameras to all federal law enforcement officers. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.1">In January, the incoming Trump administration rescinded that order, along with almost 100 others it considered “harmful.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">In early February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, was <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5147728-border-patrol-to-stop-usage-of-body-cameras-in-the-field-report/">one of the first agencies to get rid of its body cameras</a>. Subsequent videos show plainclothes immigration agents making arrests with no visible body cameras.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">The DOJ wrote in a 2022 Office of Inspector General management report that the cameras were a “means of enhancing police accountability and the public’s trust in law enforcement.” Studies have consistently shown that departments that use body cameras experience a drop in complaints against officers, according to the <a href="https://www.policeforum.org/assets/BWCdecadelater.pdf">nonprofit Police Executive Research Forum</a>, though it’s not clear if the drop is due to improvements in officer behavior or to a decrease in frivolous complaints.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0">“Eliminating these videos is really taking away a tool that we’ve seen be of benefit to law enforcement practices,” said Cameron McEllhiney, executive director of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement. “It’s also a great teaching tool, besides keeping community members safe from the potential misconduct that could occur.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">The DOJ put a lot of money into the body camera initiative. In August of 2021, it awarded Axon, the company that dominates the body camera market, a $30.4 million contract for cameras and the software to handle the evidence they created. The contract, according to Axon, remains active. But only about one-sixth of it has been paid out, according to <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_IDV_15DDHQ21D00000010_1524">federal contracting data</a>.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">The most recent publicly available version of the DEA’s body camera policy dates to December 2022. It only required agents to wear the devices when they were conducting preplanned arrests or searches and seizures that required a warrant. It also only required DEA officers to wear their body cameras when they were working within the United States.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">Agents had 72 hours after the end of an operation to upload their video evidence, unless there was a shooting, in which case they were instructed to upload the video evidence as soon as possible. The policy laid out in detail how and by whom evidence from the cameras should be handled in the event officers used force, and it authorized the DEA to use the video evidence when investigating its own officers.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">The DEA had planned to implement the policy in phases so that eventually its officers nationwide would be wearing the devices when serving warrants or carrying out planned arrests. In its 2025 fiscal year <a href="https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/dea_fy_2025_presidents_budget_narrative_omb_cleared_03-07-2024_final_leg_changes_1.pdf">budget request</a> to Congress, the agency asked for $15.8 million and 69 full time employees, including five attorneys, “to enable the DEA’s phased implementation plan of nationwide use of Body Worn Cameras.”</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">Records obtained via Freedom of Information Act request by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington show that the Biden-era DOJ had an ambitious plan to capture agencywide metrics and data about the efficiency and use of body cameras by its law enforcement officers.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">Laura Iheanachor, senior counsel at CREW, said that before federal law enforcement started wearing body cameras, several local <a href="https://www.startribune.com/ear-after-bidens-executive-order-body-cameras-majority-federal-agents-minnesota-not-yet-wearing/600278243?utm_source=chatgpt.com">police agencies had declined to participate</a> in federal task forces because doing so would have forced their officers to remove their cameras.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">“It’s a protective measure for officers, for the public,” Iheanachor said. “And it allows state and federal law enforcement to work together in harmony.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Following a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">ruling on April 30th</a> by the <em>Epic Games v. Apple</em> judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, Apple can no longer collect a 27 percent commission on purchases made outside of apps or restrict how developers can direct users to alternate payment options. Apple has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661032/apple-epic-games-app-store-antitrust-ninth-circuit">appealed the decision</a>, but is also complying with it in the interim, prompting several companies to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660084/spotify-app-iphone-apple-update-external-payment-links">announce app updates</a> making it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659754/patreon-update-iphone-ios-app-apple-payment-system-ruling">easier for users to pay for subscriptions and services</a>. That now includes Amazon’s iOS Kindle app. Contrary to prior limitations, there is now a prominent orange “Get book” button on Kindle app’s book listings.</p><p>“We regularly make improvements to our apps to help ensure we are providing customers the most convenient experience possible,” Amazon spokesperson Tim Gillman told <em>The Verge</em> over email. “By selecting ‘Get Book’ within the Kindle for iOS app, customers can now complete their purchase through their mobile web browser.”</p><p>Amazon wasn’t the first company to release a dedicated reading device with an E Ink screen. Companies like Sony beat them to the punch by a couple of years. What helped make the Kindle popular, and arguably destined to dominate the e-reader market, was that you could buy books right on the device, even if you didn’t have Wi-Fi access thanks to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598747/kindle-3g-network-shutdown-e-readers-no-internet">Amazon’s now discontinued cellular Whispernet</a> service.</p><p>Before today’s updates, buying books wasn’t a feature you’d find in the Kindle mobile app following app store rule changes Apple implemented in 2011 that required developers to remove links or buttons leading to alternate ways to make purchases. You could <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/30/4572170/amazon-finds-clever-way-around-apple-restrictions-with-kindle-ios-app">search for books that offered samples</a> for download, add them to a shopping list, and read titles you already own, but you couldn’t actually buy titles through the Kindle or Amazon app, or even see their prices. </p><p>To avoid having to pay Apple’s 30 percent cut of in-app purchases, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/18/24042892/apple-critics-27-percent-app-store-tax">27 percent tax on alternative payment methods</a> Apple introduced in January 2024, Amazon previously required you to visit and login to its online store through a device’s web browser to purchase ebooks on your iPhone or iPad, which were then synchronized to the app. It was a cumbersome process compared to the streamlined experience of buying ebooks directly on a Kindle e-reader.</p><p>Amazon probably isn’t going to change its mind about avoiding Apple’s 30 percent cut on ebook sales, but the update to the Kindle app now makes it much easier to purchase ebooks on your iPhone for those times when your Kindle e-reader doesn’t have a reliable Wi-Fi connection.</p><p>However, there’s still the chance Apple could win its appeal, forcing Amazon to undo these updates and improvements and once again make buying ebooks on iPhones overcomplicated and inconvenient.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                    <p>Despite their misleading marketing, TeleMessage, the company that makes a modified version of Signal used by senior Trump officials, can access plaintext chat logs from its customers.</p><p>In this post I give a high level overview of how the TeleMessage fake Signal app, called TM SGNL, works and why it's so insecure. Then I give a thorough analysis of the source code for TM SGNL's Android app, and what led me to conclude that TeleMessage can access plaintext chat logs. Finally, I back up my analysis with as-of-yet unpublished details about the <a href="https://micahflee.com/the-signal-clone-the-trump-admin-uses-was-hacked/" rel="noreferrer">hack</a> of TeleMessage.</p><p>But first, here's a quick timeline of events.</p><ul><li>On Thursday, 404 Media <a href="https://www.404media.co/mike-waltz-accidentally-reveals-obscure-app-the-government-is-using-to-archive-signal-messages/" rel="noreferrer">reported</a> that in the Reuters <a href="https://www.reutersconnect.com/item/us-national-security-advisor-mike-waltz-attends-a-cabinet-meeting-held-by-president-trump-at-the-white-house-in-washington/dGFnOnJldXRlcnMuY29tLDIwMjU6bmV3c21sX1JDMkg4RUFEOEtGRw%3D%3D?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">photo</a> showing former National Security Advisor and <a href="https://zeteo.com/p/signal-chat-war-crimes-revealed-yemen-trump-admin" rel="noreferrer">war criminal</a> Mike Waltz checking his Signal messages under the table, he was actually using an obscure modified Signal app called TM SGNL, and not the real and actually secure Signal app.</li><li>On Friday, I wrote <a href="https://micahflee.com/tm-sgnl-the-obscure-unofficial-signal-app-mike-waltz-uses-to-text-with-trump-officials/" rel="noreferrer">an analysis</a> of everything I could find out about TM SGNL using OSINT, including the fact that it's nearly impossible to install without a device enrolled in an MDM service that's tied to an Apple Business Manager or a Google Enterprise account.</li><li>On Saturday, after <a href="https://todon.eu/@ljrk/114444796069542288" rel="noreferrer">discovering</a> that TeleMessage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250503004419/https://www.telemessage.com/developer/api-libraries/" rel="noreferrer">published</a> the source code for the TM SGNL apps for Android and iPhone themselves, I <a href="https://micahflee.com/heres-the-source-code-for-the-unofficial-signal-app-used-by-trump-officials/" rel="noreferrer">re-published them</a> on GitHub with the goal of making them easier to research.

The modified Signal app is almost entirely identical to the authentic version of Signal, except it also archives copies of every message to a destination determined by the TeleMessage customer. (Presumably, WhatsApp, Telegram, and WeChat work in the same way, but I have only analyzed the TM SGNL for Android source code.)</p><h3 id="the-tm-sgnl-app">The TM SGNL app</h3><p>TM SGNL is interoperable with Signal. When a TM SGNL user registers a new account, they're registering it with the official Signal server. TM SGNL users can send messages to Signal users and visa versa. If you're a Signal user, you have no way of knowing when you're talking to a TM SGNL user, because the apps are nearly identical and use the same infrastructure.</p><p>This is how Mike Waltz could accidentally add The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a group chat where they discussed <a href="https://zeteo.com/p/signal-chat-war-crimes-revealed-yemen-trump-admin" rel="noreferrer">bombing an apartment building full of civilians</a>: Waltz was presumably using TM SGNL, and Goldberg was presumably using Signal.</p><p>Note that we don't know how long Trump officials have been using TM SGNL. It's possible they've been using it since around Trump's inauguration on January 20. If this is the case, the chat logs for the Signal group where Waltz invited Goldberg will have been collected by TeleMessage. But it's also possible that they only started using TM SGNL <em>after</em> Signalgate, maybe as a way to attempt to start complying with record keeping laws. So far, we don't know the timeline. This would be good to get to the bottom of to understand what laws they have already broken.</p><p>Anyway, on Mike Waltz's phone – and quite likely, the phones of Pete Hegseth, Marco Rubio, Tulsi Gabbard, JD Vance, and many others, possibly even including Donald Trump – the TM SGNL app basically works like this:</p><ul><li>Every message the TM SGNL app sees gets stored in a SQLite database with a <code>status</code> column set to <code>WaitingToBeDelivered</code>.</li><li>TM SGNL registers with the phone's background syncing service. On a regular basis, the app runs some sync code that selects messages that are <code>WaitingToBeDelivered</code>. If there are any, it delivers them to TeleMessage's archive server at <code>https://archive.telemessage.com</code>, and updates their status to <code>Sent</code>.</li></ul><h3 id="telemessages-archive-server">TeleMessage's archive server</h3><p>As I discussed in <a href="https://micahflee.com/tm-sgnl-the-obscure-unofficial-signal-app-mike-waltz-uses-to-text-with-trump-officials/" rel="noreferrer">my initial OSINT analysis</a>, according to this documentation <a href="https://micahflee.com/content/files/2025/05/Capture-Mobile--TeleMessage-_Signal-Capture_20250502.pdf" rel="noreferrer">PDF</a>, the admins for organizations that use TeleMessage set up archive plans and assign users to them.</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-02-13-09-10-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1795" height="771" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-02-13-09-10-1.png 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-02-13-09-10-1.png 1000w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-02-13-09-10-1.png 1600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-02-13-09-10-1.png 1795w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption><span>How TM SNGL archive plans work, on page 22 of the documentation PDF</span></figcaption></figure><p>Each archive plan has a source messaging app (like TM SGNL) and a destination, which is controlled by the TeleMessage customer. Destinations can include Microsoft 365, email servers (SMTP), or file servers (SFTP). The admin assigns TeleMessage users – like Mike Waltz –  to an archive plan, which determines where their chat logs will get archived.</p><p>Once the TM SGNL app sends chat logs to the archive server, the archive server is supposed to do something like this: It looks up the user that sent the chat log, then looks up that user's archive plan, then forwards the messages to destination defined in the archive plan (via SMTP or SFTP), and presumably (but who really knows for sure) deletes the chat logs from the archive server.</p><p>Here's a diagram of how the whole system appears to work:</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/TM-SGNL-diagram-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="825" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/TM-SGNL-diagram-2.png 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/TM-SGNL-diagram-2.png 1000w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/TM-SGNL-diagram-2.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Diagram of how TeleMessage archives Signal messages, based on my analysis of the source code</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="microsoft-365">Microsoft 365</h3><p>The archive server appears to connect directly to SMTP and SFTP destinations to push chat logs. However, according to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/archive-signal-archiver-data" rel="noreferrer">Microsoft's documentation</a>, Microsoft 365 works the opposite way: Microsoft 365 logs into the archive server and pulls the chat logs once a day. Their docs state:</p><blockquote>The Signal Archiver connector that you create in the Microsoft Purview portal connects to the TeleMessage site every day and transfers the email messages from the previous 24 hours to a secure Azure Storage area in the Microsoft Cloud.</blockquote><p>They even published their own diagram explaining how it works:</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/signalconnectorworkflow.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="748" height="457" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/signalconnectorworkflow.png 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/signalconnectorworkflow.png 748w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Using a connector to archive Signal communication data in Microsoft 365, from Microsoft's documentation</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="why-this-is-so-terribly-insecure">Why this is so terribly insecure</h3><p>Signal is the gold standard of end-to-end encrypted messaging apps.</p><p>Messages are encrypted between endpoints – whether that's a phone running Signal, a computer running Signal Desktop, or even a phone running TM SGNL. The Signal server, and any internet eavesdroppers, cannot access the chat logs.</p><p>However, once they're at an endpoint, they are in plaintext (if they weren't, you wouldn't be able to read your texts). At this point, they're protected by various forms of disk encryption depending on the device. This is how Signal messages sometimes end up as evidence in court records: someone's phone or laptop with Signal installed was searched, after the messages were already decrypted.</p><p><strong>TM SGNL <em>completely breaks this security</em>. The communication between the TM SGNL app and the final archive destination <em>is not end-to-end encrypted</em>.</strong></p><p>TeleMessage lies about this in their marketing material, claiming that TM SGNL supports "End-to-End encryption from the mobile phone through to the corporate archive."</p><p>Here's a screenshot from an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250501200805/https://www.telemessage.com/mobile-archiver/signal-archiver/" rel="noreferrer">archived version</a> of their site (since they've taken down all of the content):</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-05-20-22-08.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1637" height="1239" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-05-20-22-08.png 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-05-20-22-08.png 1000w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-05-20-22-08.png 1600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-05-20-22-08.png 1637w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>TeleMessage falsely claims that TM SGNL supports "End-to-End encryption from the mobile phone through to the corporate archive"</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead, TM SGNL sends the plaintext, already decrypted versions of chat logs to the archive server. (There might be some encryption involved some of the time, which I go over the "Corroborative evidence from the hack" section at the bottom.)</p><p>The archive server then forwards these to the destination.</p><p>Anyway, after TM SGNL decrypts messages, it sends the plaintext chat logs to TeleMessage's archive server. <strong>At this point, a lot of people might have access to the chat logs.</strong></p><p>The archive server was hosted in the public AWS cloud in their data center in Northern Virginia. This is not an approved place to store classified information, and potentially rogue AWS employees could have had access. This server was open to the public – anyone in the world could send HTTP requests to it to try to get chat logs back in a response. On Saturday, <a href="https://micahflee.com/the-signal-clone-the-trump-admin-uses-was-hacked/" rel="noreferrer">one of those people did</a>.</p><p>I'm saying the server "was" hosted in AWS because TeleMessage <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/telemessage-suspends-services-hackers-say-breached-app-rcna204925" rel="noreferrer">took down</a> their archive server shortly after we published the story about the hack. As of this writing, their archive server is offline.</p><p>TeleMessage also might be sharing chat logs with Israeli intelligence.</p><p>TeleMessage is an Israeli company. It was founded in 1999 by Guy Levit, the same year he left his job in the Israel Defense Force where he "served as the head of the planning and development of one of the IDF’s Intelligence elite technical units," according to his bio on the TeleMessage website (they have since taken all the content off their website).</p><p>Levit, and others at his firm, have access to the archive server and all of the chat logs it contains. I don't know what Israel's version of the Patriot Act is like, but I do know that it would be trivial for TeleMessage to add a bit of code that forwards a copy of everything to Israeli intelligence – far simpler than it was to add code to Signal to forward a copy to themselves.</p><p>To be clear, there's no evidence yet that TeleMessage is sharing chat logs with the Israeli government. <strong>But the fact that they designed their archiving system to <em>not be end-to-end encrypted</em>, and that they lie about it, is quite a big red flag.</strong></p><p>This is the app that Mike Waltz uses. While we don't really know the timeline, it's possible that everyone in the 19-person Signalgate group, where they discussed bombing Yemen, were also using this app same app. These include JD Vance, John Ratcliffe, Marco Rubio, Pete Hegseth, Stephen Miller, Tulsi Gabbard, and others. It's plausible that Israeli intelligence has been reading the internal chat logs of the most powerful members of Trump's authoritarian government.</p><h2 id="analysis-of-the-tm-sgnl-android-source-code">Analysis of the TM SGNL Android source code</h2><p>I've only analyzed the the <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/TM-SGNL-Android" rel="noreferrer">TM SGNL Android source code</a>, not the <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/TM-SGNL-iOS" rel="noreferrer">iPhone source code</a>. I'm assuming that the iPhone app works in the same way as the Android app, and anything that I learn from analyzing the Android app is applicable to the iPhone app as well.</p><p>I've focused on Android because it's much easier to reverse engineer Android apps than iPhone apps.

Furthermore, Android apps are programmed in Java and Kotlin (which both compile to Java bytecode), and it's easy to decompile Java bytecode, turning it back into human readable source code, and making it so much easier to work with.</p><p>Also, while TeleMessage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250503004419/https://www.telemessage.com/developer/api-libraries/" rel="noreferrer">posted links</a> to ZIP files claiming to be contain the Android and iOS source code on their website, the iOS version <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/TM-SGNL-iOS/issues/1" rel="noreferrer">appears</a> to actually be the source code for Signal for iOS itself, without any extra TeleMessage code added.</p><div><p>💡</p><p>As you can see in the <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/TM-SGNL-Android/blob/libs/LICENSE" rel="noreferrer">LICENSE</a> file included with the source code, TM SGNL is licensed under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.

I haven't tried running it, much less setting up a dummy archive server to see what data the app tries to send (something that is worth trying, but that I haven't had nearly enough time to implement).</p><p>But on Saturday night, a hacker exploited a vulnerability in the archive server and exfiltrated plaintext messages from it, including Signal messages, as I <a href="https://micahflee.com/the-signal-clone-the-trump-admin-uses-was-hacked/" rel="noreferrer">reported</a> in 404 Media. This confirms my findings that communication between the TM SGNL app and the archive destination is not end-to-end encrypted, and that the archive server has access to plaintext chat logs.</p><h2 id="corroborative-evidence-from-the-hack">Corroborative evidence from the hack</h2><p>As Joseph Cox and I reported, a hacker was able to obtain "snapshots of data passing through TeleMessage’s servers at a point in time." The snapshots contained fragments of data, including chat logs in JSON format, that was in the archive server's memory at the moment it was exploited.</p><p>To prove that the archive server has plaintext access to chat logs, I'm sharing redacted samples of some of that data here. Below is a plaintext Signal message, a plaintext Telegram message, and a plaintext WhatsApp message.</p><p>I'm also sharing an encrypted WhatsApp message. As I hinted at earlier in this post, some of the chat logs have encrypted content, and I have not yet uncovered how that works.</p><p>The snapshots of data from my source contained fragments of WeChat messages, but no complete WeChat messages, so I don't have an example of those to show.</p><p>Finally, I'm also sharing a redacted screenshot of a private key I found in the snapshots of data from the archive server.</p><h3 id="a-plaintext-signal-message">A plaintext Signal message</h3><p>We mentioned a Signal message that was present in one of those snapshots:</p><blockquote>A message sent to a group chat called “Upstanding Citizens Brigade” included in the hacked data says its “source type” is “Signal,” indicating it came from TeleMessage’s modified version of the messaging app. The message itself was a link to this tweet posted on Sunday which is a clip of an NBC Meet the Press interview with President Trump about his memecoin. The hacked data includes phone numbers that were part of the group chat.</blockquote><p>Here's the JSON object version of that Signal message. I have redacted the phone numbers in this JSON object by replacing them with <code>==redacted==</code>.</p><pre><code>{

<p dir="auto"><code>brush</code> is functional for interactive use as a daily driver! It can execute most <code>sh</code> and <code>bash</code> scripts we've
encountered. Known limitations are tracked with filed issues. Out of an abundance of caution,
we wouldn't recommend using it yet in <em>production</em> scenarios in case it doesn't behave identically
to your existing stable shell. (If you do find any behavioral differences, though, please report them with an
issue!)</p>

<p dir="auto">There are some known gaps in compatibility. Most notably:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Some <code>set</code> and <code>shopt</code> options.</strong>
The <code>set</code> builtin is implemented, as is <code>set -x</code> and many frequently used <code>set</code>/<code>shopt</code> options, but a number aren't fully implemented. For example, <code>set -e</code> will execute but its semantics aren't applied across execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Anything tagged with a <code>TODO</code> comment or where <code>error::unimp()</code> is used to return a "not implemented" error</strong>.
These aren't all tracked with GitHub issues right now, but there's a number of these scattered throughout the code base. Some are indicative of missing functionality that may be straightforward to implement; others may be more complicated.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Matt Godbolt, of <a href="https://godbolt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compiler Explorer</a> fame, is awesome and you should scour the web for every single bit of content he puts out. That is exactly what I was doing when I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSm3Haxz0I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Correct by Construction: APIs That Are Easy to Use and Hard to Misuse</a>. After 20+ years of working with C/C++, this theme resonates a lot with me.</p>
<p>While watching the talk I kept thinking "Yes! And that's why Rust does it that way." I came out at the end thinking that this talk was actually a great way of getting the intuition for how Rust helps you beyond the whole memory safety thing, and that is what this article intends to show.</p>
<p>But before we talk about that we should talk about the problems Matt raised and how he proposes to solve them in C++. Do yourself a favor and watch the full talk, but let me break one of them down!</p>
<h3>What's in a type</h3>
<p>Matt starts the talk by showing what a function that sends orders to a stock exchange might look like.</p>
<pre>void sendOrder(const char *symbol, bool buy, int quantity, double price)</pre>
<p>Before we go any further, let me just say he acknowledges floating point is not right for price and later talks about how he usually deals with it. But it makes for a nice example, bear with us.</p>
<p>Another obvious improvement that anyone used to this stuff will call out immediately is the bool for identifying a buy. That is error prone and Matt does call it out towards the end of this section.</p>
<p>But he first focuses on quantity and price and how C++ makes it really hard for you to stop callers from confusing them: the compiler will allow 1000.00 for quantity and 100 for price with no warnings, despite them being different types. It just silently converts.</p>
<p>How about some type aliasing?</p>
<pre>#include 

using Price = double;
using Quantity = int;

void sendOrder(const char *symbol, bool buy, int quantity, double price) {
  std::cout &lt;&lt; symbol &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; buy &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; quantity &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; price
            &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

int main(void) {
  sendOrder("GOOG", false, Quantity(100), Price(1000.00)); // Correct
  sendOrder("GOOG", false, Price(1000.00), Quantity(100)); // Wrong
}</pre>
<p>No luck! Both clang 19 and gcc 14 will take that and not complain - <em>even with -std=c++23 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic</em>, which I use for all of the C++ code in this article! A few rounds of improvements and we have the following version:</p>
<pre>#include 

class Price {
public:
  explicit Price(double price) : m_price(price) {};
  double m_price;
};

class Quantity {
public:
  explicit Quantity(unsigned int quantity) : m_quantity(quantity) {};
  unsigned int m_quantity;
};

void sendOrder(const char *symbol, bool buy, Quantity quantity, Price price) {
  std::cout &lt;&lt; symbol &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; buy &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; quantity.m_quantity &lt;&lt; " "
            &lt;&lt; price.m_price &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

int main(void) {
  sendOrder("GOOG", false, Quantity(100), Price(1000.00));  // Correct
  sendOrder("GOOG", false, Quantity(-100), Price(1000.00)); // Wrong
}</pre>
<p>We have classes, we have explicit constructors (very important or C++ will trip you!), we have unsigned types… and now it's hard to put a Price where you want a Quantity! But we can still give Quantity a negative value without a single compiler warning, even though we moved to an unsigned type. A bit more magic and we can make that go away:</p>
<pre>#include 
#include 

class Price {
public:
  explicit Price(double price) : m_price(price) {};
  double m_price;
};

class Quantity {
public:
  template  explicit Quantity(T quantity) : m_quantity(quantity) {
    static_assert(std::is_unsigned(), "Please use only unsigned types");
  }

  unsigned int m_quantity;
};

void sendOrder(const char *symbol, bool buy, Quantity quantity, Price price) {
  std::cout &lt;&lt; symbol &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; buy &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; quantity.m_quantity &lt;&lt; " "
            &lt;&lt; price.m_price &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

int main(void) {
  sendOrder("GOOG", false, Quantity(100u), Price(1000.00)); // Correct
  sendOrder("GOOG", false, Quantity(-100), Price(1000.00)); // Wrong
}</pre>
<p>Finally we can get clang (and gcc) to complain loudly that this is being misused. All it took was a templated constructor that performs a static assert at compile time. Nice!</p>
<pre>order/order-5.cpp:13:19: error: static assertion failed due to requirement 'std::is_unsigned()': Please use only unsigned types
   13 |     static_assert(std::is_unsigned(), "Please use only unsigned types");
      |                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
order/order-5.cpp:26:28: note: in instantiation of function template specialization 'Quantity::Quantity' requested here
   26 |   sendOrder("GOOG", false, Quantity(-100), Price(1000.00)); // Wrong
      |                            ^
1 error generated.</pre>
<p>It's a lot of code, but at least we now have compiler protection. We are good, there is no other way to misuse quantity and price. Right?</p>
<p>What if we need to pass in a value the user typed on a UI, such that we need to convert it from string? Well, you are out of luck again:</p>
<pre>sendOrder("GOOG", false, Quantity(static_cast(atoi("-100"))),
            Price(1000.00)); // Wrong</pre>
<p>Not only will it not fail to compile, but it will also not produce any errors at runtime. You will end up selling 4294967196 shares and going bankrupt.</p>
<p>Not ideal.</p>
<p>Matt keeps going, showing a few more magic tricks (and their pitfalls) to perform the runtime checks you will need to fully defend against this. I think this is a good point for us to stop on the C++ side and look at how Rust does, shall we?</p>
<h3>Enter Rust</h3>
<p>So is Rust any better? Rust has the benefit of decades of learning from all of these issues. And learn it did. Let's take a look. How does our first attempt fare?</p>
<pre>fn send_order(symbol: &amp;str, buy: bool, quantity: i64, price: f64) {
    println!("{symbol} {buy} {quantity} {price}");
}

fn main() {
    send_order("GOOG", false, 100, 1000.00); // Correct
    send_order("GOOG", false, 1000.00, 100); // Wrong
}</pre>
<p>After all the work we had to do with C++ it can't be this easy, can it?</p>
<pre>error[E0308]: arguments to this function are incorrect
 --&gt; order/order-1.rs:7:5
  |

  |                               |

  |
7 |     send_order("GOOG", false, 100, 1000.00); // Wrong
  |               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</pre>
<p>Welp, what do you know? It even tells us the arguments we swapped, and everything. It's like we live in the future! Ok, but numbers are still easy to confuse, we could also create types like we did in C++ to make it extra explicit, right? Indeed, and let's throw in protection against negative values by switching from i64 to u64. Is it that easy?</p>
<pre>struct Price(pub f64);
struct Quantity(pub u64);

fn send_order(symbol: &amp;str, buy: bool, quantity: Quantity, price: Price) {
    println!("{symbol} {buy} {} {}", quantity.0, price.0);
}

fn main() {
    send_order("GOOG", false, Quantity(100), Price(1000.00)); // Correct
    send_order("GOOG", false, Quantity(-100), Price(1000.00)); // Wrong
}</pre>
<p>Yes, it is that easy:</p>
<pre>error[E0600]: cannot apply unary operator `-` to type `u64`
  --&gt; order/order-4.rs:10:40
   |
10 |     send_order("GOOG", false, Quantity(-100), Price(1000.00)); // Wrong
   |                                        ^^^^ cannot apply unary operator `-`
   |
   = note: unsigned values cannot be negated</pre>
<p>Ok, all that remains is the case where we need to convert the number from a string the user typed. I got you now, Rust… runtime input is not something you can fix at compile time, how would you ever be able to improve on the C++ case?</p>
<pre>struct Price(pub f64);
struct Quantity(pub u64);

fn send_order(symbol: &amp;str, buy: bool, quantity: Quantity, price: Price) {
    println!("{symbol} {buy} {} {}", quantity.0, price.0);
}

fn main() {
    send_order("GOOG", false, Quantity(100), Price(1000.00)); // Correct
    send_order(
        "GOOG",
        false,
        Quantity("-100".parse::()),
        Price(1000.00),
    ); // Wrong
}</pre>
<p>How about forcing the user to handle potential bad conversions caused by the target type not being able to represent the number we have on the string, does that help?</p>
<pre>error[E0308]: mismatched types

error: aborting due to 1 previous error</pre>
<p>Yes, it does help, I can’t just blindly cast.</p>
<p>Damn, you’re good.</p>
<p>This error should be enough for me as a user of this API to understand that I should elegantly handle this possibility and maybe return an error all the way to the UI saying "no negative numbers, please". But what if I just go ahead and add that .expect() it is telling me about and then a user types a negative number? Well, then I get a crash at runtime. Better than going bankrupt? I would say so.</p>

<h3>Closing thoughts</h3>
<p>You know what's the most interesting part of this whole article? The thing Rust is very famous for, memory safety, did not feature at all. Sure, you could make the argument that mixing integers with floats is a memory issue, but you'd be stretching the definition most people have for memory safety.</p>
<p>What we learn in this exercise is that a well designed language can protect you from mistakes in ways that go way beyond stopping you from writing a use after free or a data race. The design can save you a lot of brain cycles by not forcing you to think about how to protect your code from the simplest mistakes — the language has your back.</p>
<p>Now, let's be honest. Most of the brain power you save will go, as a Rust beginner, to figuring out how to convince the borrow checker what you are doing is correct. It gets better, I promise. But I won't lie to you: your first few months with the borrow checker will suck.</p>
<p>Are we done here? Not really. There are two more topics that Matt covers in his talk that I will discuss in future articles, one of them related to my biggest pet peeve with C++. And for those of you who are thinking "if C++ had decades to learn it would also have features that are this well designed", well… let's just say you are in for a treat.</p>
<p>Again, go check <a href="https://xania.org/MattGodbolt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Godbolt</a>. Listen to what the man says, read everything he writes, watch every video of his talks on YouTube, and play with his Compiler Explorer. You'll learn a lot and have fun while doing it!</p>

We recently launched Exa Websets, an embeddings-powered search engine designed to return exactly what you’re asking for. You can get precise results for complex queries like “all startups working on open-source developer tools based in SF, founded 2021-2025”. 
Demo here - <a href="https://youtu.be/Unt8hJmCxd4" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/Unt8hJmCxd4</a></p><p>We started working on Exa because we were frustrated that while LLM state-of-the-art is advancing every week, Google has gotten worse over time. The Internet used to feel like a magical information portal, but it doesn’t feel that way anymore when you’re constantly being pushed towards SEO-optimized clickbait.</p><p>Websets is a step in the opposite direction. For every search, we perform dozens of embedding searches over Exa’s vector database of the web to find good search candidates, then we run agentic workflows on each result to verify they match exactly what you asked for.</p><p>Websets results are good for two reasons. First, we train custom embedding models for our main search algorithm, instead of typical keyword matching search algorithms. Our embeddings models are trained specifically to return exactly the type of entity you ask for. In practice, that means if you search “startups working in nanotech”, keyword-based search engines return listicles about nanotech startups, because these listicles match the keywords in the query. In contrast, our embedding models return actual startup homepages, because these startup homepages match the meaning of the query.</p><p>The second is that LLMs provide the last-mile intelligence needed to verify every result. Each result and piece of data is backed with supporting references that we used to validate that the result is actually a match for your search criteria. That’s why Websets can take minutes or even hours to run, depending on your query and how many results you ask for. For valuable search queries, we think this is worth it.</p><p>Also notably, Websets are tables, not lists. You can add “enrichment” columns to find more information about each result, like “# of employees” or “does author have blog?”, and the cells asynchronously load in. This table format hopefully makes the web feel more like a database.</p><p>A few examples of searches that work with Websets:</p><p>- “Math blogs created by teachers from outside the US”: <a href="https://websets.exa.ai/cma1oz9xf007sis0ipzxgbamn">https://websets.exa.ai/cma1oz9xf007sis0ipzxgbamn</a></p><p>- "research paper about ways to avoid the O(n^2) attention problem in transformers, where one of the first author's first name starts with "A","B", "S", or "T", and it was written between 2018 and 2022”: <a href="https://websets.exa.ai/cm7dpml8c001ylnymum4sp11h">https://websets.exa.ai/cm7dpml8c001ylnymum4sp11h</a></p><p>- “US based healthcare companies, with over 100 employees and a technical founder": <a href="https://websets.exa.ai/cm6lc0dlk004ilecmzej76qx2">https://websets.exa.ai/cm6lc0dlk004ilecmzej76qx2</a></p><p>- “all software engineers in the Bay Area, with experience in startups, who know Rust and have published technical content before”: <a href="https://youtu.be/knjrlm1aibQ" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/knjrlm1aibQ</a></p><p>You can try it at <a href="https://websets.exa.ai/">https://websets.exa.ai/</a> and API docs are at <a href="https://docs.exa.ai/websets">https://docs.exa.ai/websets</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43906442">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi everyone, my name is Kevin Lin, and this is a Show HN for my sheet music smart glasses project. My video was on the front page on Friday: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43876243">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43876243</a>, but dang said we should do a Show HN as well, so here goes!</p><p>I’ve wanted to put sheet music into smart glasses for a long time, but the perfect opportunity to execute came in mid-February, when Mentra (YC W25) tweeted about a smart glasses hackathon they were hosting - winners would get to take home a pair. I went, had a blast making a bunch of music-related apps with my teammate, and we won, so I got to take them home, refine the project, and make a pretty cool video about it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j36u2i7PKKE" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j36u2i7PKKE</a>).</p><p>The glasses are Even Realities G1s. They look normal, but they have two microphones, a screen in each lens, and can be even made with a prescription. Every person I’ve met who tried them on was surprised at how good the display is, and the video recordings of them unfortunately don’t do them justice.</p><p>The software runs on AugmentOS, which is Mentra’s smart glasses operating system that works on various 3rd-party smart glasses, including the G1s. All I had to do to make an app was write and run a typescript file using the AugmentOS SDK. This gives you the voice transcription and raw audio as input, and text or bitmaps available as output to the screens, everything else is completely abstracted away. Your glasses communicate with an AugmentOS app, and then the app communicates with your typescript service.</p><p>The only hard part was creating a Python script to turn sheet music (MusicXML format) into small, optimized bitmaps to display on the screens. To start, the existing landscape of music-related Python libraries is pretty poorly documented and I ran into multiple never-before-seen error messages. Downscaling to the small size of the glasses screens also meant that stems and staff lines were disappearing, so I thought to use morphological dilation to emphasize those without making the notes unintelligible.  The final pipeline was MusicXML -&gt; music21 library to render chunks of bars to png -&gt; dilate with opencv- &gt; downscale -&gt; convert to bitmap with Pillow -&gt; optimize bitmaps with imagemagick. This is far from the best code I’ve ever written, but the LLMs attempt at this whole task was abysmal and my years of Python experience really got to shine here. The code is on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/kevinlinxc/AugmentedChords">https://github.com/kevinlinxc/AugmentedChords</a>.</p><p>Putting it together, my typescript service serves these bitmaps locally when requested. I put together a UI where I can navigate menus and sheet music with voice commands (e.g. show catalog, next, select, start, exit, pause) and then I connected foot pedals to my laptop. Because of bitmap sending latency (~3s right now, but future glasses will do better), using foot pedals to turn the bars while playing wasn’t viable, so I instead had one of my pedals toggle autoscrolling, and the other two pedals sped up/temporarily paused the scrolling.</p><p>After lots of adjustments, I was able to play a full song using just the glasses! It took many takes and there was definitely lots of room for improvement. For example: - Bitmap sending is pretty slow, which is why using the foot pedals to turn bars wasn’t viable. - The resolution is pretty small, I would love to put more bars in at once so I can flip less frequently. - Since foot pedals aren’t portable, it would be cool to have a mode where the audio dictates when the sheet music changes. I tried implementing that with FFT but it was often wrong and more effort is needed. Head tilt controls would be cool too, because full manual control is a hard requirement for practicing.</p><p>All of these pain points are being targeted by Mentra and other companies competing in the space, and so I’m super excited to see the next generation! Also, feel free to ask me anything!</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

This update features even stronger coding capabilities, for you to start building with before Google I/O later this month. Expect meaningful improvements for front-end and UI development, alongside improvements in fundamental coding tasks such as transforming and editing code, and creating sophisticated agentic workflows.</p><blockquote data-block-key="5l7r8"><i><sup>“We found Gemini 2.5 Pro to be the best frontier model when it comes to "capability over latency" ratio.

We’re particularly excited about how this model can be used in the following cases.</p><h3 data-block-key="43g6o" id="video-to-code"><b><br>Video to code</b></h3><p data-block-key="djkbd">Gemini 2.5 Pro delivers state-of-the-art video understanding, scoring 84.8% on the VideoMME benchmark. Combining this with coding enables new flows that were previously not possible with previous versions. For example, the <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apps/bundled/video-to-learning-app?showPreview=true">Video to Learning App</a> in Google AI Studio demonstrates how Gemini 2.5 Pro creates an interactive learning app based on a single YouTube video.

    <h3 data-block-key="nqxom" id="easier-feature-development"><b>Easier feature development</b></h3><p data-block-key="c8rhp">Gemini 2.5 Pro is strong at front-end web development, helping you get more done. Implementing new features means manually diving into design files and inspecting components to match style properties like colors, fonts, padding, margins, and borders then manually writing the CSS code needed to replicate those visual properties accurately. Now imagine using Gemini 2.5 Pro in an IDE and having the model generate new features, like adding a video player in the style of the other apps in the <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/apps/bundled/gemini_95?showPreview=true">Gemini 95</a> starter app.</p>

The new <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/apps/bundled/gemini-dictation?showPreview=true">dictation starter app</a>, built using the updated model, is a great example of this in action. Pay attention to some of the details like the wavelength animations, responsive design, and subtle button hover effects. By default, the model has a real taste for aesthetic web development while maintaining its steerability, helping developers quickly take a concept to a working web app. Gemini 2.5 Pro was able to design and code the microphone UI animation for the dictation starter app.</p>

            Clippy lets you run a variety of large language models (LLMs)
            locally on your computer while sticking with a user interface of the
            1990s. It's a love letter and homage to the late, great Clippy - and
            the visual design created by Microsoft in that era.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Simple, familiar, and classic chat interface</strong>.
              Send messages to your models, get a response.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Batteries included: No complicated setup</strong>. Just
              open the app and chat away. Thanks to llama.cpp and
              <code>node-llama-cpp</code>, the app will automatically discover
              the most efficient way to run your models (Metal, CUDA, Vulkan,
              etc).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Custom models, prompts, and parameters</strong>: Load your
              own downloaded models and play with the settings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Offline, local, free</strong>: Everything runs on your
              computers. The only network request Clippy makes is to check for
              updates (which you can disable).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This app is not affiliated, approved, or supported by Microsoft.
            This project isn't trying to be your best chat bot. I'd like you to
            enjoy a weird mix of nostalgia for 1990s technology paired with one
            the most magical technologies we can run on our computers in 2025.
          </p>
          <p>Do you want to download Clippy for your computer?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <section id="intro">
          <p>
            We work with accents a lot at
            <a href="https://boldvoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BoldVoice</a>, the AI-powered accent coaching app for non-native English
            speakers. Accents are subtle patterns in speech—vowel shape, timing,
            pitch, and more. Usually, you need a linguist to make sense of these
            qualities. However, our goal at BoldVoice is to get machines to
            understand accents, and machines don’t think like linguists. So, we
            ask: how does a machine learning model understand an accent, and
            specifically, how strong it is?
          </p>
          <p>
            To begin this journey, we first introduce the “accent fingerprint,”
            an embedding that is generated by inferencing an English speech
            recording through BoldVoice’s large-scale accented speech model.

            In this post we’ll show where the accent fingerprint lives in a
            latent space, how distances and directions in that space correspond
            to accent similarity and language background, and how we use it to
            coach our product management intern Victor, a non-native English
            speaker, toward the American English accent of our expert accent
            coach Eliza.
          </p>

          <h3>The Original Recordings</h3>
          <p>First off, here's how Victor sounds when speaking English:</p>
          <figure>

          <p>
            Now have a listen to Eliza reading the same passage. Eliza is
            demonstrating our “target” American accent.
          </p>

          </figure>
          <p>
            Compared to Eliza, who is an American English native speaker, Victor
            has a noticeably strong Chinese accent when speaking English.

        <section id="latent-space">
          <h3>The Latent Space</h3>
          <p>
            So that we can make sense of how the machine learning model
            understands both of these recordings, we now populate a latent space
            with 1,000 speech recordings sourced from our internal data
            representing varied levels of accent. Feel free to inspect the 2D
            visualization of the latent space<sup>1</sup> and hover over the
            points to see details about each recording.
          </p>

          <p>
            The full dimensional latent space contains information about speaker
            identity, accent, intelligibility, emotion, and other
            characteristics. This visualization has been pruned to show only the
            information relevant to "accent strength", that is "how strong is
            the speaker's accent relative to native speakers of English?"
          </p>
          <p>
            More specifically, we apply PLS regression to identify the latent
            space directions which correlate most with human accent strength
            ratings, and for the purpose of this visualization only, we apply 2D
            UMAP dimensionality reduction. The x-axis represents the first
            hidden dimension of accent strength, while the y-axis represents the
            second hidden dimension.<sup>2</sup>
          </p>

          <p>
            The below pseudocode shows how the dimensions of the latent space
            are selected:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code>accent_strength_directions = PLSRegression.fit(train_accent_fingerprints, train_accent_strength_ratings)
accent_strength_features = test_accent_fingerprints[accent_strength_directions]
visualization_features = UMAP(n_components=2).fit_transform(accent_strength_features)</code></pre>
          </figure>

          <p>
            <sup>1</sup> For the sake of brevity, we will use the term latent
            space to refer to both the full dimensional space, as well as the
            pruned 2D visualization.
          </p>
          <p>
            <sup>2</sup> The dimensions are not readily interpretable, are not
            orthogonal, and are chosen solely to maximize their utility for
            discriminating between accent strength in L2 English (English as a
            second language).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="victor-original">
          <h3>Plotting Accents</h3>
          <p>
            Now, let’s visualize the accent fingerprints of Victor’s and Eliza’s
            recordings in this latent space. You can see a purple diamond in the
            bottom left representing Eliza’s recording and a yellow diamond
            towards the top right representing Victor’s recording.
          </p>

          <p>
            From what we can see, the more towards the lower left of the plot a
            recording is, the more ”native sounding” and “less strong” its
            speaker’s accent is. Accordingly, we labeled the points as Native,
            Near Native, Advanced, Intermediate, and Beginner based on their
            distance from Eliza’s position in the latent space.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another finding we immediately see is that the latent space is not
            biased towards different native languages, as we don’t see any
            clustering based on the speaker’s native language, and a fairly
            uniform distribution of native languages across all proficiency
            levels.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, let’s look at some creative ways that we can use our in-house
            suite of speech models and tools to help Victor get closer to
            Eliza’s accent.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="victor-cleaned">
          <h3>Cleaning the Background Noise</h3>
          <p>
            The first thing that jumps out is that Eliza’s recording is much
            cleaner than Victor’s. Perhaps it will be easier for him to focus on
            just the accent differences if we can get rid of the background
            noise in his recording?
          </p>
          <figure>
            <audio controls="" src="https://accent-strength.boldvoice.com/victor-cleaned.wav"></audio>
            <figcaption>Victor (cleaned recording)</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Surprise! This didn’t change Victor's position in the latent space
            much, the cleaned recording lands very close to Victor's original at
            the top right of the latent space. This is a good sanity check that
            our latent space is working correctly—the recording quality and
            level background noise are not relevant to accent strength.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="victor-converted">
          <h3>Converting the Accent</h3>
          <p>
            Next, perhaps Victor finds it difficult to mimic Eliza’s accent
            because the register of his voice is so much lower than hers. So
            we’re going to use BoldVoice’s in-house accent conversion model to
            hear what Victor sounds like with Eliza's accent. (Yes, we can
            really do that—we'll share more about this in a future post.)
          </p>
          <figure>
            <audio controls="" src="https://accent-strength.boldvoice.com/victor-cleaned.wav"></audio>
            <figcaption>Victor's original recording</figcaption>

            <figcaption>Victor (converted recording)</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            As you can see, the position of Victor with Eliza’s accent is right
            next to Eliza’s original position in the latent space. Phonetically
            speaking, there are still some differences in vowel shapes,
            emphasis, pitch, and timing, but even without expert knowledge,
            Victor will have a much easier time mimicking Eliza’s accent now
            that it’s in his own voice.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="victor-after">
          <h3>Practicing the Accent</h3>
          <p>
            We left Victor with this audio of his voice with Eliza's accent for
            about 10 minutes to give him time to practice mimicking it. Here’s
            what Victor sounds like after that practice:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <audio controls="" src="https://accent-strength.boldvoice.com/victor-after.wav"></audio>
            <figcaption>Victor (after practice recording)</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure>
            <audio controls="" src="https://accent-strength.boldvoice.com/eliza-original.wav"></audio>
            <figcaption>Compare to Eliza's original recording</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Not bad—Victor matched her timing, intonation and stress pretty
            well, but some of the vowel shapes still aren’t quite the same.
            Let’s see how far he is from Eliza in the latent space now.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s quite an improvement! Victor’s new position in the latent
            space is right on the border of Intermediate and Advanced.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Victor wanted to move beyond this point, the sound-by-sound
            phonetic analysis available in the BoldVoice app would allow him to
            understand the patterns in pronunciation and stress that contribute
            to Eliza’s accent and teach him how to apply them in his own speech.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion">
          <h3>What did we learn?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This machine learning model can clearly distinguish the strength
              of a speaker’s accent.
            </li>
            <li>
              The model’s assessment of accent strength appears independent of
              the speaker's native language background.
            </li>
            <li>
              The accent strength of a speaker is something that can be changed
              with practice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Voice conversion technology can map a target accent onto a
              different voice, providing a useful tool for practice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Changes to the acoustic environment, such as denoising, don’t
              result in a large change in measured accent strength.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Applications and Next Steps</h3>
          <p>
            The accent strength metric derived from this model has several
            promising applications.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              It offers a quantitative way to track an English learner’s accent
              journey over multiple recordings by measuring their distance from
              a target accent profile in the latent space.
            </li>
            <li>
              This same quantitative approach can be applied to rigorously
              evaluate automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for
              performance variations across different accent strengths.
            </li>
            <li>
              It can similarly monitor text-to-speech (TTS) systems for unwanted
              changes in accent, often referred to as “accent drift.”
            </li>
          </ol>

            <div id="news-story">
                        <p>Lyme disease, a disease transmitted when deer ticks feed on infected animals like deer and rodents, and then bite humans, impacts nearly <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#:~:text=Recent%20estimates%20using%20other%20methods,not%20actually%20have%20Lyme%20disease.">half a million</a> individuals in the U.S. annually. Lyme can be devastating; but early treatment with antibiotics can prevent chronic symptoms like heart and neurological problems and arthritis from developing.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What’s new</strong></h2>
<p>In two new studies led by bacteriologist <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=62640">Brandon L. Jutras</a>, Northwestern scientists have identified an antibiotic that cures Lyme disease at a fraction of the dosage of the current “gold standard” treatment and discovered what may cause a treated infection to mimic chronic illness in patients. The studies were published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</p>
<p>Jutras, who joined Northwestern faculty last summer, is an associate professor of microbiology-immunology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a member of the Center for Human Immunobiology at Northwestern. He has been studying Lyme disease for more than 15 years.</p>
<h2><strong>Besting the gold standard</strong></h2>
<p>The antibiotic doxycycline is the current gold standard treatment for Lyme. However, doxycycline and other generic antibiotics, wreak havoc on the microbiome, killing beneficial bacteria in the gut and causing troubling side effects even as it kills <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, the bacteria that causes Lyme. In addition to its negative impact on the gut, doxycycline also fails to help between 10 and 20% of individuals who take it, and it is not approved for use in young children —&nbsp;who are at the highest risk of tick bites, and therefore, of developing Lyme.</p>
<p>More effective, or at least more specified, treatment options are needed as climate change extends tick seasons and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-lyme-disease#:~:text=Between%201992%20and%202022%2C%20the%20incidence%20of,per%20100%2C000%20people%20in%202022%20(Figure%201).&amp;text=Lyme%20disease%20is%20much%20more%20common%20in,Midwest%20than%20in%20other%20regions%20(Figure%202).">Lyme becomes more prevalent</a>.</p>
<p>Northwestern scientists identified that piperacillin, an antibiotic in the same class as penicillin, effectively cured mice of Lyme disease at 100-times less than the effective dose of doxycycline. At such a low dose, piperacillin also had the added benefit of “having virtually no impact on resident gut microbes,” <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr9091">according to the study</a>.</p>
<p>The team screened nearly 500 medicines in a drug library, using a molecular framework to understand potential interactions between antibiotics and the Borrelia bacteria. Once the group had a short list of potentials, they performed additional physiological, cellular and molecular tests to identify compounds that did not impact other bacteria.</p>
<p>The authors argue that piperacillin, which has already been FDA-approved as a safe treatment for pneumonia, could also be a candidate for preemptive interventions for those potentially exposed to Lyme (with a known deer tick bite).</p>
<p>They found that piperacillin exclusively interfered with the unusual cell wall synthesis pattern common to Lyme bacteria, preventing the bacteria from growing or dividing and ultimately leading to its death.</p>
<h2><strong>Understanding when Lyme lingers</strong></h2>
<p>Symptoms that persist long after Lyme disease is treated are not uncommon —&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.hopkinslyme.org/lyme-disease/treatment-and-prognosis-of-lyme-disease/#:~:text=Most%20patients%20with%20early%20Lyme,includes%20misdiagnoses%20and%20treatment%20delays.">2022 study found</a> that 14% of patients who were diagnosed and treated early with antibiotic therapy would still develop Post Treatment Lyme Disease (PTLD). Yet doctors puzzle over the condition’s causes and how to help their patients through symptoms ranging from severe fatigue and cognitive challenges to body pain and arthritis.</p>
<p>Northwestern scientists believe they now know what causes the treated infection to mimic chronic illness: The body may be responding to remnants of the Borrelia cell wall which breaks down during treatment yet lingers in the liver. (This matches one theory behind the underlying causes of long COVID-19, in that persisting viral molecules may encourage a strong, albeit unnecessary, immune response, according to Jutras.)</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr2955">another new study</a>, researchers tracked the biodistribution of peptidoglycan, a structural feature of virtually all bacterial cells and a common target of antibiotics, from different bacteria. They found that Lyme disease’s peptidoglycan persists for weeks to months.</p>
<p>Lyme’s peptidoglycan is structurally unique, and this difference may be behind its persistence in humans. Instead of looking the same as with other bacteria, the Lyme peptidoglycan is fundamentally distinct, which is facilitated in part by sucking up sugars from its tick vector. Upon bacterial cell death — by antibiotics or the immune system — surviving molecules tend to relocate to the liver, which can’t process the modified peptidoglycan. Without this modification, it seems likely that the peptidoglycan would clear right away, as in other infections.</p>
<p>“The unusual chemical properties of Borrelia peptidoglycan promote persistence, but it’s the individual patient response to the molecule that likely impacts the overall clinical outcome,” Jutras said. “Some patients will have a more robust or stronger immune response, which could result in a worse disease outcome, while the immune system of others may largely ignore the molecule. So, in essence, it’s not about whether the molecule is there or not, it’s more about how an individual responds to it.”</p>
<h2><strong>What’s next</strong></h2>
<p>Jutras hopes the groundbreaking findings will lead to development of more accurate tests, possibly for PTLD patients, and refined treatment options when antibiotics have failed. To effectively stymie PTLD, instead of neutralizing an infection that may no longer exist, efforts are underway to neutralize the inflammatory molecule.</p>
<p>Lyme prevention also remains a challenge — no approved human vaccine exists — and Jutras hopes his research moving forward will help with developing proactive strategies to diagnose and treat it.</p>
<p>“I think the future for Lyme disease patients is bright in that we are approaching an era of customized medicine, and we can potentially create a particular drug, or a combination to treat Lyme disease when others fail,” Jutras said. “The more we understand about the various strains and species of Lyme disease-causing Borrelia, the closer we get to a custom approach.”</p>

            <div>
                <p><strong>May 6, 2025</strong> – Ubuntu 25.10 is set to adopt <strong>sudo-rs</strong> by default. Sudo-rs is a memory-safe reimplementation of the widely-used <code>sudo</code> utility, written in the Rust programming language.</p>
<p>This move is part of a broader effort by <strong>Canonical</strong> to improve the resilience and maintainability of core system components. Sudo-rs is developed by the <strong>Trifecta Tech Foundation (TTF)</strong>, a nonprofit organization that creates secure, open source building blocks for infrastructure software.</p>
<h3 id="a-memory-safe-future-for-ubuntu">A Memory-Safe Future for Ubuntu</h3>
<p>The decision to adopt sudo-rs is in line with Canonical’s commitment to <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/carefully-but-purposefully-oxidising-ubuntu/56995">Carefully But Purposefully</a> increase the resilience of critical system software, by adopting Rust. Rust is a programming language with strong memory safety guarantees that eliminates many of the vulnerabilities that have historically plagued traditional C-based software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm delighted to be investing in critical, low-level software utilities. Ubuntu is the most widely deployed Linux operating system, and by choosing to adopt sudo-rs I hope to accelerate the path to wider adoption across the Linux ecosystem".<br>
-- Jon Seager, VP Engineering Ubuntu at Canonical</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sudo-rs is part of the Trifecta Tech Foundation's <a href="https://trifectatech.org/initiatives/privilege-boundary/">Privilege Boundary initiative</a>, which aims to handle privilege escalation with memory-safe alternatives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While no piece of software - in any language - is flawless, we believe the transition to Rust in systems programming is a vital step forward. It is very exciting to see Ubuntu committing to sudo-rs and taking a leading role in moving the needle."<br>
-- Erik Jonkers, Chair of the Trifecta Tech Foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="preparing-for-mainstream-adoption-by-linux-distributions">Preparing for Mainstream Adoption by Linux Distributions</h3>
<p>To prepare for mainstream adoption, the maintainers of sudo-rs will complete work outlined in the project’s <a href="https://trifectatech.org/initiatives/workplans/sudo-rs/#current-work">Milestone 5 workplan</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coarse-grained shell escape prevention (NOEXEC) on Linux</li>
<li>The ability to control AppArmor profiles</li>
<li><code>sudoedit</code></li>
<li>Support for Linux Kernels older than version 5.9, used by Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</li>
</ul>
<p>Canonical is sponsoring this milestone to make sudo-rs an even better implementation of the <code>sudo</code> command. With the above features, more users and system administrators should be able to use sudo-rs without any change to their current workflows.</p>
<p>The maintainers of sudo-rs are sticking to the "less is more" approach: some features of the original sudo will not be implemented in sudo-rs if they serve only highly niche use cases. The maintainers continue their collaboration with Todd Miller, the incumbent <code>sudo</code> maintainer for over thirty years, thus indirectly improving original sudo as a by-product of this engagement.</p>
<h3 id="targeting-ubuntu-25-10">Targeting Ubuntu 25.10</h3>
<p>Canonical plans to make sudo-rs the default in Ubuntu 25.10. This will allow time for acceptance testing by end-users and ensure that sudo-rs is battle-tested before its inclusion in the next Long Term Support (LTS) release: Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, which will be supported for a minimum of 12 years. We are looking forward to learning from the community how we can further improve sudo-rs.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>What does it mean to get things done? In the abstract, you can complete a mathematical proof or a problem set, but the real world is much fuzzier. Suppose I plant a tree in my backyard. Once the sapling is in the ground, is that done? Not really. There’s always more work to do: clearing the ground around it, watering, keeping pests away, pruning, and so on. Programming large web applications is more like planting a tree than completing a mathematical proof. Once you write a service, you can keep working on it forever if you want to.</p>
<p>In large tech companies, this fact is a trap for competent but unagentic engineers. They see an infinite queue of tasks that they’re capable of doing, and they start delivering a stream of marginal improvements to a particular subsystem<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. From their perspective, it feels like they’re crushing it. After all, they’re putting out work at their top speed: no downtime, no waiting on other teams. But they’re not doing their actual job, which is to deliver the most value they can to their company. From the perspective of their manager and skip-level, they’re not getting anything done.</p>
<p>What does it mean to get things done in large companies? Most importantly, it means <strong>finishing</strong> things. How can you finish things in a world where you can keep improving systems indefinitely? It means <strong>getting them to a point where the decision-makers at the company are happy</strong>. At that point, you have to declare victory and walk away! Go and do something else! I’ve seen many engineers stick around delivering one more tweak or one more refactor - long past the point where their work stopped being perceived as a successful project and started being perceived as wasted time. Better to deliver two more things in that time.</p>
<p>Second, it means delivering the kind of things that are <strong>legible</strong> to the decision-makers at the company: i.e. visible to your manager, plus 1-3 skip levels, depending on your title. The easiest way to do this is to deliver things that they already know about, such as projects that they’ve asked you to do, or incidents that are serious enough that they’re involved in them. It’s possible to make other work legible to them as well. If your work produces or saves money, that will make it immediately legible, for instance (or you could just be really convincing). By default, work you do isn’t legible: to the decision-makers, it’s generic technical nonsense. They don’t know whether it’s crucial high-impact work or pointless code reshuffling, and will tend to assume the latter.</p>
<p>In short, getting things done means getting them in a state where:</p>
<p>(a) executives at the company understand what’s happened, and
(b) are happy with it</p>
<p>To many, this will be an unsatisfying definition of what it means to get things done. Lots of engineers will want a more solid definition than “it’s a social construct”. However, as someone with a philosophy background, I have a healthy respect for social constructs. The concept “chair” is a social construct, and chairs are plenty real[2]. In some ways, “getting things done” is even more real. It can pay your rent! If you don’t respect it, it can even get you fired.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Just because you’re doing work doesn’t mean you’re getting things done</li>
<li>Nothing is ever “done” in the non-abstract world. Everything can be worked on indefinitely</li>
<li>If you want to get things done you can’t be a gardener. You have to aim for a bullet-point list of achievements</li>
<li>So what’s “done” mean in that context? It means the company is happy with the state of it</li>
<li>Declare victory and walk away: go and do something else!</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Take a look at the following code.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>string</span> <span>input</span> <span>=</span> <span>"interesting"</span><span>;</span>
<span>bool</span> <span>comparison</span> <span>=</span> <span>input</span><span>.</span><span>ToUpper</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>"INTERESTING"</span><span>;</span>
<span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>"These things are equal: "</span> <span>+</span> <span>comparison</span><span>);</span>
<span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>ReadLine</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s imagine that <code>input</code> is actually user input or some value we get from an API. That’s going to print out <code>These things are equal: True</code> right? Right?!</p>

<p>Well not if you live in Turkey. Or more accurately, not if the current culture of your operating system is <code>tr-TR</code> (which is likely if you live in Turkey).</p>

<p>To prove this to ourselves, let’s force this application to run using the Turkish locale. Here’s the full source code for a console
application that does this.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>using</span> <span>System</span><span>;</span>
<span>using</span> <span>System.Globalization</span><span>;</span>
<span>using</span> <span>System.Threading</span><span>;</span>
<span>internal</span> <span>class</span> <span>Program</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Main</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>[]</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>      
        <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>CurrentThread</span><span>.</span><span>CurrentCulture</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>CultureInfo</span><span>(</span><span>"tr-TR"</span><span>);</span>
        <span>const</span> <span>string</span> <span>input</span> <span>=</span> <span>"interesting"</span><span>;</span>
        
        <span>bool</span> <span>comparison</span> <span>=</span> <span>input</span><span>.</span><span>ToUpper</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>"INTERESTING"</span><span>;</span>

        <span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>"These things are equal: "</span> <span>+</span> <span>comparison</span><span>);</span>
        <span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>ReadLine</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we’re seeing this print out <code>These things are equal: False</code>.</p>

<p>To understand why this is the case, I recommend reading much more detailed treatments of this topic:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/turkish-i18n.html" title="Internationalization Guy on Turkish I">Internationalization for Turkish: Dotted and Dotless Letter “I”</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/03/whats-wrong-with-turkey.html" title="What's Wrong With Turkey">What’s Wrong With Turkey</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The tl;dr summary summary is that the uppercase for <code>i</code> in English is <code>I</code> (note the lack of a dot) but in Turkish it’s dotted, <code>İ</code>. So while we have two i’s (upper and lower), they have four.</p>

<h2 id="my-app-is-english-only-amurrica">My app is English only. AMURRICA!</h2>

<p>Even if you have no plans to translate your application into other languages, your application can be affected by this. After all, the
sample I posted is English only.</p>

<p>Perhaps there aren’t going to be that many Turkish folks using your app, but why subject the ones that do to easily preventable bugs? If you don’t pay attention to this, it’s very easy to end up with a costly security bug as a result.</p>

<p>The solution is simple. In most cases, when you compare strings, you want to compare them using
<code>StringComparison.Ordinal or StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase</code>. It just turns out there are so many ways to compare strings. It’s not just <code>String.Equals</code>.</p>

<p>I’ve always been a fan of FxCop. At times it can seem to be a nagging nanny constantly warning you about crap you don’t care about. But hidden among all those warnings are some important rules that can prevent some of these stupid bugs.</p>

<p>If you have the good fortune to start a project from scratch in Visual Studio 2010 or later, I highly recommend enabling Code Analysis (FxCop has been integrated into Visual Studio and is now called Code Analysis). My recommendation is to pick a set of rules you care about and make sure that the <strong>build breaks if any of the rules are broken</strong>. Don’t turn them on as warnings because warnings are pointless noise. If it’s not important enough to break the build, it’s not important enough to add
it.</p>

<p>Of course, many of us are dealing with existing code bases that haven’t enforced these rules from the start. Adding in code analysis after the fact is a daunting task. Here’s an approach I took recently that helped me retain my sanity. At least what’s left of it.</p>

<p>First, I manually created a file with the following contents:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;?</span><span>xml</span> <span>version</span><span>=</span><span>"1.0"</span> <span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>"utf-8"</span><span>?&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>RuleSet</span> <span>Name</span><span>=</span><span>"PickAName"</span> <span>Description</span><span>=</span><span>"Important Rules"</span> <span>ToolsVersion</span><span>=</span><span>"10.0"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>Rules</span> <span>AnalyzerId</span><span>=</span><span>"Microsoft.Analyzers.ManagedCodeAnalysis"</span>
      <span>RuleNamespace</span><span>=</span><span>"Microsoft.Rules.Managed"</span><span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;</span><span>Rule</span> <span>Id</span><span>=</span><span>"CA1309"</span> <span>Action</span><span>=</span><span>"Error"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>    
  
  <span>&lt;/</span><span>Rules</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>RuleSet</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You could create one per project, but I decided to create one for my solution. It’s just a pain to maintain multiple rule sets. I named this file <em>SolutionName.ruleset</em> and put it in the root of my solution (the name doesn’t matter. Just make the extension <code>.ruleset</code>)</p>

<p>I then configured each project that I cared about in my solution (I ignored the unit test project) to enable code analysis using this
ruleset file. Just go to the project properties and select the <em>Code Analysis</em> tab.</p>

<p><a href="https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/70bb1ffd73a5_C2A0/CodeAnalysisRuleSet_2.png"><img src="https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/70bb1ffd73a5_C2A0/CodeAnalysisRuleSet_thumb.png" alt="CodeAnalysisRuleSet" title="CodeAnalysisRuleSet"></a></p>

<p>I changed the selected Configuration to “All Configurations”. I also checked the “Enable Code Analysis…” checkbox. I then clicked “Open” and selected my ruleset file.</p>

<p>At this point, every time I build, Code Analysis will only run the one rule, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb385972.aspx" title="Use ordinal StringComparison">CA1309</a>, when I build. This way, adding more rules becomes manageable. Every time I fixed a warning, I’d add that warning to this file one at a time. I
went through the following lists looking for important rules.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182125" title="Code Analysis Design Rules">Design Warnings</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182184" title="Code Analysis Globalization Rules">Globalization Warnings</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182193" title="Code Analysis Interoperability Rules">Interoperability Warnings</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182211" title="Code Analysis Maintainability Rules">Maintainability Warnings</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182218" title="Code Analysis Mobility Rules">Mobility Warnings</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182232" title="Code Analysis Naming Rules">Naming Warnings</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182260" title="Code Analysis Performance Rules">Performance Warnings</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182282" title="Code Analysis Portability Rules">Portability Warnings</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182287" title="Code Analysis Reliability Rules">Reliability Warnings</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182296" title="Code Analysis Security Rules">Security Warnings</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182324" title="Code Analysis Usage Rules">Usage Warnings</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I didn’t add every rule from each of these lists, only the ones I thought were important.</p>

<p>At some point, I reached the point where I was including a large number of rules and it made sense for me to invert the list so rather than listing all the rules I want to include, I only listed the ones I wanted to exclude.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;?</span><span>xml</span> <span>version</span><span>=</span><span>"1.0"</span> <span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>"utf-8"</span><span>?&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>RuleSet</span> <span>Name</span><span>=</span><span>"PickAName"</span> <span>Description</span><span>=</span><span>"Important Rules"</span> <span>ToolsVersion</span><span>=</span><span>"10.0"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>IncludeAll</span> <span>Action</span><span>=</span><span>"Error"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>Rules</span> <span>AnalyzerId</span><span>=</span><span>"Microsoft.Analyzers.ManagedCodeAnalysis"</span>
      <span>RuleNamespace</span><span>=</span><span>"Microsoft.Rules.Managed"</span><span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;</span><span>Rule</span> <span>Id</span><span>=</span><span>"CA1704"</span> <span>Action</span><span>=</span><span>"None"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>    
  
  <span>&lt;/</span><span>Rules</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>RuleSet</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Notice the <code>IncludeAll</code> element now makes every code analysis warning into an error, but then I turn CA1704 off in the list.</p>

<p>Note that you don’t have to edit this file by hand. If you open the ruleset in Visual Studio it’ll provide a GUI editor. I prefer to simply edit the file.</p>

<p><a href="https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/70bb1ffd73a5_C2A0/RuleSetEditor_2.png"><img src="https://haacked.com/assets/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/70bb1ffd73a5_C2A0/RuleSetEditor_thumb.png" alt="RuleSetEditor" title="RuleSetEditor"></a></p>

<p>One other thing I did was for really important rules where there were too many issues to fix in a timely manner, I would simply use Visual Studio to suppress all of them and commit that. At least that ensured that no new violations of the rule would be committed. That allowed me to fix the existing ones at my leisure.</p>

<p>I’ve found this approach makes using code analysis way more useful and less painful than simply turning on every rule and hoping for the best. Hope you find this helpful as well. May you never ship a bug with the Turkish I problem again!</p>
