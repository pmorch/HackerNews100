<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  

  <p>
    <time datetime="2026-01-31 00:00:00 +0000">2026-01-31</time>
  </p>
  
  <p>In iOS 26.3, Apple introduced a new privacy feature which limits “precise location” data made available to cellular networks via cell towers. The feature is only available to devices with Apple’s in-house modem introduced in 2025. The announcement<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cellular networks can determine your location based on which cell towers your device connects to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is well-known. I have served on a jury where the prosecution obtained location data from cell towers. Since cell towers are sparse (especially before 5G), the accuracy is in the range of tens to hundreds of metres<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>But this is not the whole truth</strong>, because cellular standards have built-in protocols that make your device silently send GNSS (i.e. GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou) location to the carrier. This would have the same precision as what you see in your Map apps, in single-digit metres.</p>

<p>In 2G and 3G this is called <a href="https://projects.osmocom.org/projects/security/wiki/RRLP">Radio Resources LCS Protocol (RRLP)</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the network simply asks “tell me your GPS coordinates if you know them” and the phone will respond<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 4G and 5G this is called <a href="https://tech-academy.amarisoft.com/LTE_LPP.html">LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP)</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RRLP, RRC, and LPP are natively control-plane positioning protocols. This means that they are transported in the inner workings of cellular networks and are practically invisible to end users<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s worth noting that GNSS location is never <em>meant</em> to leave your device. GNSS coordinates are calculated entirely passively, your device doesn’t need to send a single bit of information. Using GNSS is like finding out where you are by reading a road sign: you don’t have to tell anyone else you read a road sign, anyone can read a road sign, and the people who put up road signs don’t know who read which road sign when.</p>

<p>These capabilities are not secrets but somehow they have mostly slid under the radar of the public consciousness. They have been used in the wild for a long time, such as by the DEA in the US in 2006<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[T]he DEA agents procured a court order (but not a search warrant) to obtain GPS coordinates from the courier’s phone via a ping, or signal requesting those coordinates, sent by the phone company to the phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And by Shin Bet in Israel, which tracks everyone everywhere all the time<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The GSS Tool was based on centralized cellular tracking operated by Israel’s General Security Services (GSS). The technology was based on a framework that tracks all the cellular phones running in Israel through the cellular companies’ data centers. According to news sources, it routinely collects information from cellular companies and identifies the location of all phones through cellular antenna triangulation and GPS data<sup id="fnref:7:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notably, the Israeli government started using the data for contact tracing in March 2020<sup id="fnref:7:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>, only a few weeks after the first Israeli COVID-19 case. An individual would be sent an SMS message informing them of close contact with a COVID patient and required to quarantine. This is good evidence that the location data Israeli carriers are collecting are far more precise than what cell towers alone can achieve.</p>

<p>A major caveat is that I don’t know if RRLP and LPP are the exact techniques, and the only techniques, used by DEA, Shin Bet, and possibly others to collect GNSS data; there could be other protocols or backdoors we’re not privy to.</p>

<p>Another unknown is whether these protocols can be exploited remotely by a foreign carrier. Saudi Arabia has abused SS7 to spy on people in the US<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>, but as far as I know this only locates a device to the coverage area of a Mobile Switching Center, which is less precise than cell tower data. Nonetheless, given the abysmal culture, competency, and integrity in the telecom industry, I would not be shocked if it’s possible for a state actor to obtain the precise GNSS coordinates of anyone on earth using a phone number/IMEI.</p>

<p>Apple made a good step in iOS 26.3 to limit at least one vector of mass surveillance, enabled by having full control of the modem silicon and firmware. They must now allow users to disable GNSS location responses to mobile carriers, and notify the user when such attempts are made to their device.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Lunch break at the Finnish International School of Tampere (FISTA) is a boisterous time.</p><p>The yard is filled with children — ranging from grades 1 to 9, or ages 6 to 16 — running around, shouting, playing football, shooting basketball hoops, doing what kids do.</p><p>And there's not a single screen in sight.</p><p>FISTA has taken advantage of the <a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20103459" role="link">law change</a>, brought in last August, which allows schools to restrict or completely ban the use of mobile phones during school hours. At FISTA, this means no phones at all unless specifically used for learning in the classroom.</p><p>"We've seen that cutting down on the possibilities for students to use their phones, during the breaks for instance, has spurred a lot of creativity," FISTA vice principal <strong>Antti Koivisto</strong> notes.</p><p>"They're more active, doing more physical things like playing games outdoors or taking part in the organised break activities or just socialising with each other."</p><p>With the smartphone restriction in schools widely considered to have been a success, Finland's government has now set its sights on social media platforms.</p><p>Prime Minister <strong>Petteri Orpo</strong> (NCP) <a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20204220" role="link">said earlier this month</a> that he supports banning the use of social media by children under the age of 15.</p><p>"I am deeply concerned about the lack of physical activity among children and young people, and the fact that it is increasing," Orpo said at the time.</p><p>And there is a growing groundswell of support for Finland introducing such a ban. Two-thirds of respondents to a survey published earlier this week <a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20206519" role="link">said they back a ban</a> on social media for under-15s. This is a near 10 percentage point jump compared to a similar survey carried out just last summer.</p><h2>"Uncontrolled human experiment"</h2><p>The concerns over social media, and in particular the effects on children, have been well-documented — but Finnish researcher <strong>Silja Kosola</strong>'s <a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20205877" role="link">recent description of the phenomenon</a> as an "uncontrolled human experiment" has grabbed people's attention once again.</p><p>Kosola, an associate professor in adolescent medicine, has researched the impact of social media on young people, and tells Yle News that the consequences are not very well understood.</p><p>"We see a rise in self-harm and especially eating disorders. We see a big separation in the values of young girls and boys, which is also a big problem in society," Kosola explains.</p><p><strong>In the video below, Silja Kosola explains the detrimental effects that excessive use of social media can have on young people.</strong></p><figure><figcaption><span>Silja Kosola speaking on the All Points North podcast.</span></figcaption></figure><p>She further notes that certain aspects of Finnish culture — such as the independence and freedom granted to children from a young age — have unwittingly exacerbated the ill effects of social media use.</p><p>"We have given smartphones to younger people more than anywhere else in the world. Just a couple of years ago, about 95 percent of first graders had their own smartphone, and that hasn't happened anywhere else," she says.</p><h2>All eyes on Australia</h2><p>Since 10 December last year, children under the age of 16 in Australia have been banned from using social media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.</p><p>Prime Minister <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> began drafting the legislation after he received a heartfelt letter from a grieving mother who lost her 12-year-old daughter to suicide.</p><p>Although Albanese has never revealed the details of the letter, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-13/how-australia-developed-social-media-ban-under-16s/106137700" role="link">he told public broadcaster</a> ABC that it was "obvious social media had played a key role" in the young girl's death.</p><p>The legislation aims to shift the burden away from parents and children and onto the social media companies, who face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (29 million euros) if they consistently fail to keep kids off their platforms.</p><p><strong>Clare Armstrong</strong>, ABC's chief digital political correspondent, told Yle News that the initial reaction to the roll-out has been some confusion but no little "relief".</p><p>"The government often talks about this law as being a tool to help parents and other institutions enforce and start conversations about tech and social media in ways that before, they couldn't," she says.</p><p>Although it is still early days, as the ban has only been in force for about six weeks, Armstrong adds that the early indicators have been good.</p><p><strong>ABC journalist Clare Armstrong explains in the video below how children in Australia have been spending their time since the social media ban was introduced.</strong></p><figure><figcaption><span>Clare Armstrong speaking on the All Points North podcast.</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, she adds a note of caution to any countries — such as Finland — looking to emulate the Australian model, noting that communication is key.</p><p>"Because you can write a very good law, but if the public doesn't understand it, and if it can't be enforced at that household level easily, then it's bound to fail," Armstrong says.</p><h2>Playing to Finland's strengths</h2><p><strong>Seona Candy,</strong> an Australian living in Helsinki for over eight years, has been keenly following the events in her homeland since the social media ban came into effect in December.</p><p>She has heard anecdotally that if kids find themselves blocked from one platform, they just set up an account on another, "ones that maybe their parents don't even know exist".</p><p>"And this is then much, much harder, because those platforms don't have parental controls, so they don't have those things already designed into them that the more mainstream platforms do," Candy says.</p><p>Because of this issue, and others she has heard about, she warns against Finland introducing like-for-like legislation based around Australia's "reactive, knee-jerk" law change.</p><p>"I think the Finnish government should really invest in digital education, and digital literacy, and teach kids about digital safety. Finland is world-famous for education, and for media literacy. Play to your strengths, right?"</p><p><em>The All Points North podcast asked if Finland should introduce a similar ban on social media as in Australia.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>US authorities have reportedly investigated claims that Meta can read users’ encrypted chats on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/whatsapp" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">WhatsApp</a> messaging platform, which it owns.</p><p>The reports follow a lawsuit filed last week, which claimed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/meta" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Meta</a> “can access virtually all of WhatsApp users’ purportedly ‘private’ communications”.</p><p>Meta has denied the allegation, reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-29/us-has-investigated-claims-that-whatsapp-chats-aren-t-private" data-link-name="in body link">Bloomberg</a>, calling the lawsuit’s claim “categorically false and absurd”. It suggested the claim was a <a href="https://x.com/andymstone/status/2016920479362171305" data-link-name="in body link">tactic</a> to support the NSO Group, an Israeli firm that develops spyware used against activists and journalists, and which recently lost a lawsuit brought by WhatsApp.</p><p>The firm that filed last week’s lawsuit against Meta, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, attributes the allegation to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2026/01/29/whatsapp-lawsuit-read-messages-denied/" data-link-name="in body link">unnamed</a> “courageous” whistleblowers from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa.</p><p>Quinn Emanuel is, in a separate case, helping to represent the NSO Group in its appeal against a <a href="https://www.davispolk.com/experience/trial-victory-meta-and-whatsapp-spyware-case" data-link-name="in body link">judgment</a> from a US federal court last year, which ordered it to pay $167m to WhatsApp for violating its terms of service in its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/pegasus-project" data-link-name="in body link">deployment</a> of Pegasus spyware against more than 1,400 users.</p><p>“We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines,” said Carl Woog, a Meta spokesperson, in a statement. “This is the same firm that is trying to help NSO overturn an injunction that barred their operations for targeting journalists and government officials with spyware.”</p><p>Adam Wolfson, a partner at Quinn Emanuel said: “Our colleagues’ defence of NSO on appeal has nothing to do with the facts disclosed to us and which form the basis of the lawsuit we brought for worldwide WhatsApp users.</p><p>“We look forward to moving forward with those claims and note WhatsApp’s denials have all been carefully worded in a way that stops short of denying the central allegation in the complaint – that Meta has the ability to read WhatsApp messages, regardless of its claims about end-to-end encryption.”</p><p>Steven Murdoch, professor of security engineering at UCL, said the lawsuit was “a bit strange”. “It seems to be going mostly on whistleblowers, and we don’t know much about them or their credibility,” he said. “I would be very surprised if what they are claiming is actually true.”</p><p>If WhatsApp were, indeed, reading users’ messages, this was likely to have been discovered by staff and would end the business, he said. “It’s very hard to keep secrets inside a company. If there was something as scandalous as this going on, I think it’s very likely that it would have leaked out from someone within WhatsApp.”</p><p>The Bloomberg article cites reports and interviews from officials within the US Department of Commerce in claiming that the US has investigated whether Meta could read WhatsApp messages. However, a spokesperson for the department called these assertions “unsubstantiated”.</p><p>WhatsApp <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/820124435853543" data-link-name="in body link">bills itself</a> as an end-to-end encrypted platform, which means that messages can be read only by their sender and recipient, and are not decoded by a server in the middle.</p><p>This contrasts with some other messaging apps, such as Telegram, which encrypt messages between a sender and its own servers, preventing third parties from reading the messages, but allowing them – in theory – to be decoded and read by Telegram itself.</p><p>A senior executive in the technology sector told the Guardian that WhatsApp’s vaunted privacy “leaves much to be desired”, given the platform’s willingness to collect metadata on its users, such as their profile information, their contact lists, and who they speak to and when.</p><p>However, the “idea that WhatsApp can selectively and retroactively access the content of [end-to-end encrypted] individual chats is a mathematical impossibility”, he said.</p><p>Woog, of Meta, said: “We’re pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing a meritless lawsuit that was designed purely to grab headlines. WhatsApp’s encryption remains secure and we’ll continue to stand up against those trying to deny people’s right to private communication.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="text-1">
<p>
Feel free to skip this section if you don't really care about backstories. I just figured it makes sense to recap how and why one might start having an interest in declarative distros before tackling the main topic.
</p>

<p>
I've been a Linux-only<sup><a role="doc-backlink" id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> user for about ten years now and, like many others, I too embarked on the arduous journey of distro-hopping. I started with <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">Mint</a> and when that felt too slow, I switched to <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. When Ubuntu felt too handholdy<sup><a role="doc-backlink" id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>, I switched to <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a>, which proved to be my main driver for well over five or so years. And when I couldn't resist the Siren's call, I moved on to <a href="https://gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>, thinking surely "harder is better". Which resulted in severe burnout in a few months, so I capitulated and switched to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>, which was very stable and honestly an all around excellent system. But once more, my interest was piqued, and (before today's adventure) I finally switched to <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>.
</p>

<p>
I've always had a passing interest towards Nix ever since I've first heard about it, but until fairly recently, I always dismissed it as a tool for DevOps guys. The syntax was <i>weird</i>, the need for reproducible environments seemingly irrelevant, and stuff like the oft-recommended <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/">Nix Pills</a> seemed anything but newbie-friendly.
</p>

<p>
So then why would someone like me, who's so adamant about not needing Nix eventually choose to go all-in? I guess it was at first less about Nix being better and just the rest being worse.
</p>

<p>
Of the two big reasons for the switch, one was that I realized that having per-directory environments for your projects is actually a very handy thing to do when you like to toy around with many technologies. I used to generate my <a href="https://oddwords.hu/">other blog</a> using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and, no matter which distro I used, it was always a pain in the neck to have a good Ruby environment set up. <code>bundler install</code> didn't really want to work without privileges and I wasn't really a fan of unleashing <code>sudo</code> on it, but usually that was the only way I could get things to work.
</p>

<p>
With Nix, however, it was a matter of just describing a few packages in a shell and boom, Ruby in one folder, no Ruby (and thus no mess) everywhere else. <b>I was hooked!</b> I started adding <code>shell.nix</code> files to all my little projects, hell, I started planning projects by first adding a <code>shell.nix</code> with all the dependencies I would reasonably need.
</p>

<p>
The other reason, which ultimately cemented that I need to commit, was that I was getting tired of my installed packages slowly drifting out of control. Sure, every package manager has some method of listing what's installed, but these are usually cumbersome and completely ephemeral (in the sense that any listing becomes invalid the moment you change anything).
</p>

<p>
With NixOS, the equation is flipped on its head: No longer did I query the system to tell me what's installed and what's not, it was now the system that worked based on files that I edit. The difference sounds small on paper, but for me it was an extremely liberating feeling to know that I could edit my system configuration in a versionable, explicit, and centralized way.
</p>

<p>
But NixOS isn't the only declarative distro out there. In fact GNU forked Nix fairly early and made their own spin called <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a>, whose big innovation is that, instead of using the unwieldy Nix-language, it uses Scheme. Specifically <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile Scheme</a>, GNU's sanctioned configuration language. I've been following Guix for a bit, but it never felt quite ready to me with stuff like KDE being only barely supported and a lot of hardware not working out of the box.
</p>

<p>
However, now that (after three years) Guix announced its <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2026/gnu-guix-1.5.0-released/">1.5.0 release</a> with a lot of stuff stabilized and KDE finally a first-party citizen, I figured now is the best time to give it a fresh shot. This post captures my experiences from installation to the first 3-4 days.

Plug your USB in, <code>dd</code> the file onto the drive, reboot, nothing unusual. If you've ever installed a Linux system, it's more of the same.
</p>

<p>
After selecting the pendrive in my BIOS settings, the monitor began to glow in a deep, radiant blue as the Guix System logo appeared on my screen… only to suddenly switch to a menacing red: My CPU's integrated GPU is not supported by free firmware. A helpful popup gave me a gentle nudge about picking free hardware next time (buddy, have you seen the PC part prices these days?) and off I went into the installer proper.
</p>

<p><span>Figure 1: </span>Picture of the installer graciously borrowed from the Guix installer manual.</p>
</div>

<p>
The installer itself is refreshingly barebones and I mean this in a positive way. It asks all the necessary questions and provides a nice basic configuration file, all done in a retro <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/1.5.0/en/html_node/Guided-Graphical-Installation.html">Ncurses-based TUI</a>. I was really happy to see that, unlike my last attempt at using Guix System in the early 2020-s, KDE Plasma is now a first-party choice during installation. I never really vibed too much with GNOME and the other options didn't appeal either, so the choice was obvious.
</p>

<p>
Now, I'm not sure if I just picked the worst possible time or if the Guix servers were facing unusual load or whatever may have happened, but after such a breeze of a setup, the moment I pressed install, my PC became unusable for the next 2.5 <b>hours.</b> Which is unacceptable for an installation process these days in my opinion. I am lucky enough to live in a household with fiber-optic internet, that merely shrugs at bandwidth of up to a gigabyte per second and yet nearly all packages downloaded with a whopping 50 <i>kilobytes</i> per second, meaning even small-ish 5-10 megabyte packages took long minutes to download.<sup><a role="doc-backlink" id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
A reboot later my issues only got worse.

<h2 id="i-can-t-find-my-way-land"><span>3.</span> I Can't Find my Way-land</h2>
<div id="text-3">
<p>
I was assuming I'd get SDDM after having chosen KDE Plasma, but (what a later, <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/X-Window.html#:~:text=by%20default%20the%20GNOME%20Display%20Manager%20(GDM).">closer read</a> of the manual made me realize is the expected outcome for a default config) it was GDM that loaded in. I entered my name and password, and I was greeted with the familiar Plasma 6 spinner. The first hint that something might be off was that it loaded a bit longer than usual, but I was not going to get mad at waiting 10 seconds instead of 3. After all, I did just wait magnitudes longer to get here.
</p>

<p>
With practically nothing installed beyond the very basics, I clicked on Konsole, hoping to start prodding around my config and add some of my day to day apps. To my horror, it opened in the top left corner, without a titlebar and without any borders. What's more, no matter what I did, I couldn't move it. It also didn't show up on the menu bar, despite the application launcher still being completely usable. At this point I was fairly exhausted by these antics, but I figured,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Well, it's a brand new release, perhaps this just snuck in. Let's give updating a shot and see if that helps.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So I issued <code>guix pull</code>… The download whizzed by with speed quite unexpected after what I experienced with the installer… Only to crash into the brick wall that's indexing. Okay, whatever, another 10-12 minutes down the drain, at least now I have newest version.
</p>


<div>
<p><img src="https://nemin.hu/assets/imgs/2026-01-26-guix/downloads.avif" alt="downloads.avif">
</p>
<p><span>Figure 2: </span>Better than before download speeds</p>
</div>

<p>
Except I didn't. Because, unlike Nix, the <code>guix</code> executable is not an omnipresent, unique thing that anyone and everyone uses on your PC. Not only does every user have their own instance, if you don't issue a certain set of commands, you won't start using the new version, despite updating it.
</p>

<p>
To Guix's credit, the CLI does scream at you to update your environment or else you'll keep using the old version, but I still find this system very disorientating compared to Nix. I'm certain experienced Guixheads are long past being tripped up by this sort of stuff and might even struggle to remember that there was a time they had to do these special steps too, but as a new user it felt a bit rough, especially consdering this is Guix System, i.e. the system whose whole purpose is to be integrate Guix as much as it can.
</p>

<p>
Back to our issue at hand. I issued <code>sudo -s</code> and <code>guix pull</code>-ed again. Once more 10-12 minutes passed indexing. But at least I could finally call <code>guix system reconfigure /etc/config.scm</code>. Interestingly things are much faster this time around, I saw speeds up to 30-50 Mbps. Before long the system was updated to the newest commit and I rebooted with high hopes.
</p>

<p>
High hopes, that were immediately dashed when Plasma loaded in the same messed up way. At this point I started to suspect this might be an issue with the GPU driver, so I enabled the LXQT desktop environment and rebooted once more. Thankfully that one worked like a charm and I was able to boot up both Emacs (editing Scheme with GNU Nano is a pain I do not wish on anyone) and <a href="https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a> (Firefox's de-Mozilla-d variant).
</p>

<p>
Not having found anything too useful in the docs, I decided to make my problem someone else's so I fired up ERC<sup><a role="doc-backlink" id="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> and connected to Libera.chat's <code>#guix</code> channel. After around half an hour of wait, a user by the name of Rutherther stepped up and offered me some help. We were able to figure it out that Nouveau wasn't able to drive my GPU (an RTX 5070), so his recommendation was that I should try booting with <code>nomodeset</code>. I did, but it sadly didn't help much either.

<p>
At this point I was out of ideas. Ideas of solving this using pure-Guix System, that is. There was still one option I wanted to avoid as long as I could, but alas, it seemed like the only option, that still had a realistic chance of working.
</p>




<p>
Enter <a href="https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix">Nonguix</a>, the Mr. Hyde to Guix's Dr. Jekyll, the shady guy who offers you a hit and first time's for free, the… Erm, in a nutshell, it's the repository for non-free applications and drivers packages for Guix System, basically. Interestingly enough, by Guix's own findings <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2025/guix-user-and-contributor-survey-2024-the-results-part-2/">about 64% of users</a> utilize the Nonguix channel, which is perhaps not "literally everyone", but it does paint a picture that there is still stuff out there that you simply cannot replace with FOSS software yet.
</p>

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Enabling the repo wasn't exactly difficult. You just paste the short excerpt from above (also found in the README) into your <code>~/.config/guix/channels.scm</code> and <code>/etc/guix/channels.scm</code> files, <code>guix pull</code>, let it index to its heart's content again, and then you have access to all that is nasty (yet occasionally useful) in the world.
</p>

<p>
I figured perhaps if <a href="https://www.fsfla.org/ikiwiki/selibre/linux-libre/">Linux-libre</a> and its free firmware couldn't deal with my GPU, then surely Linux proper with its binary blobs could. Hell, for good measure I threw in the NVIDIA transform, which is supposed to automagically translate all dependencies to use the proprietary drivers.
</p>

<p><span>Figure 4: </span>What haste and half-reading manuals gets you…</p>
</div>

<p>
Turns out my eagerness was a mistake. Not only did the process take yet another half an hour (if not more, I stopped counting), upon reboot all I was met with was a kernel panic about the driver not being able to cope with the GPU it found and a massive spew of FSCK logs.
</p>

<p><span>Figure 5: </span>'FSCK' was indeed very close to the first words that came to my mind at this moment.</p>
</div>

<p>
With no better ideas in mind, I took out my pendrive again and burned Nonguix's own pre-built ISO on it using my partner's PC. While it ultimately did get me a working system, this version has three unfortunate hindrances:
</p>

<ol>
<li>It was built in 2022, far before Guix's <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2025/migrating-to-codeberg/">migration to Codeberg</a>, meaning it still attempts to pull content from the unfathomably slow <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/">GNU Savannah</a> mirror. I had to manually override my <code>channels.scm</code> to point at the Codeberg repo instead, but with no easy means of finding its "<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/1.5.0/en/html_node/Channel-Authentication.html">channel introduction</a>"<sup><a role="doc-backlink" id="fnr.5" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>, I had to pass in <code>--disable-authentication</code> to Guix when updating my system. A bit scary, but I trust the Codeberg repo.</li>
<li>Because of its age, I got a lot of somewhat intimidating errors about hardware not being recognized and other stuff I couldn't even decipher, but ultimately the system booted to the installer without issue.</li>
<li>For some reason while the installer itself does include Nonguix stuff, it actually does not include the repo in the resulting channels files, nor the substitution server for the project. The README has a warning about this, but if you happen to miss it, you could accidentally install a non-Nonguix Guix System (say that three times fast).</li>
</ol>

<p>
None of these were particularly hard to fix, however, and soon enough I was back where I started. That is to say, in a <code>nomodeset</code> X11 session, except this time running <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>, as LXQT wasn't an available option on an installer this old. There was certainly a bit of a hacker-ish vibe to messing with code files in an environment like that, but I was honestly much more looking forward to finally having a usable desktop.
</p>

<p>
Having learned from my hastiness, this time I was smarter. I only enabled the full kernel and firmware blobs, without going anywhere near the NVIDIA transform. I issued another <code>guix system reconfigure</code> and, after having time for another tea session, my update was finally finished.
</p>

<p>
I rebooted with tentative nervousness and… Success? Huh.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-goals">
<h2 id="goals"><span>5.</span> Goals</h2>
<div id="text-5">
<p>
Obviously there is little point in throwing Guix System on my PC and declaring success. I wanted to be able to at least reproduce the kind of workflow I'm used to using NixOS. For that, I need the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>A browser:</b> preferably Firefox, as I'm not a huge fan of Chrome / Chromium,</li>
<li><b>An E-mail client:</b> preferably Thunderbird,</li>
<li><b>A basic office suite:</b> preferably LibreOffice,</li>
<li><b>Dev environments:</b> for Rust, Zig, Scheme, and TypeScript (with the option for more, if possible),</li>
<li><b>Emacs:</b> I do almost all my text editing in it these days, falling back to Neovim for quick tasks,</li>
<li><b>Discord:</b> for chatting with friends,</li>
<li><b>Telegram:</b> for chatting with family,</li>
<li><b>Steam:</b> for the very rare occasions I want to game,</li>
<li><b>NVIDIA drivers:</b> I prefer to offload day-to-day usage to my CPU's integrated GPU, as it cuts my energy usage in half.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Of these it was obvious that two would be relatively hard and one "outright impossible". The two being Steam and the drivers (as both are non-free and thus not in Guix's default repos) and the "impossible" one being Discord (which not even the non-free repo has packaged). But I was ready to compromise a little bit since I am requesting stuff that's explicitly against Guix's goals.

</div>

<p>
While there has been occasional bumps and hitches along the ride, I must say I'm very impressed with Guix System so far. Let's go through this list in order:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Browser:</b> So far I'm really enjoying LibreWolf. It feels a lot snappier than Firefox and I'm really baffled how much speed I was apparently missing out on.</li>
<li><b>E-mails:</b> I installed Icedove, which is basically just Thunderbird without Mozilla branding. It works as expected.</li>
<li><b>Office suite:</b> LibreOffice is available as expected. Not much to say about it. I guess it's interesting that Guix isn't following the usual <code>-stale</code> / <code>-fresh</code> packaging schema, but I don't really mind not having cutting edge versions of an office suite :)</li>
<li><b>Dev environments:</b> I've only briefly toyed with development environments so far, but to me it seems like for simple use-cases it might be even easier to use than <code>shell.nix</code> (you don't need any sort of ceremony, just a <code>manifest.scm</code> file with a <code>(specifications-&gt;manifest &lt;list of packages&gt;)</code> form inside and you have a dev env ready to go.)</li>
<li><b>Emacs:</b> Installed just fine. I had to install <code>emacs-vterm</code> to make <a href="https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm">Vterm</a> work, but all that took was the very simple process of adding the library to my home configuration and then referencing it in my Emacs config as per this <a href="https://reddit.com/r/GUIX/comments/11gzhyu/how_to_compile_the_vterm_module_from_emacs_and/">Reddit post</a>.</li>
<li><b>Discord:</b> I decided to just use Discord's browser version, which works just as fine (if not better). It's trading a tiny bit of convenience in return for not having to figure out how to manually add a package for it from some random third-party source. From what I've read elsewhere Flatpak is also an option, but I prefer having just one package manager at a time.</li>
<li><b>Steam:</b> Installed shockingly easily. I have to really give props to the Nonguix team. I tested Portal 2 with the Nouveau driver, it is a little disheartening to see a 15 years old game<sup><a role="doc-backlink" id="fnr.6" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup> lag, but I understand the people's hands are tied when it comes to the free drivers. After I managed to install the proprietary drivers, I was able to play even Portal RTX, which is something I never managed to get to work using NixOS.</li>
<li><b>NVIDIA drivers:</b> This time I actually read the docs properly and it didn't take long for me to realize the initial problem that caused my previous install to be unbootable was of course found between the chair and keyboard. This time, after making sure I enabled the open drivers and kernel mode-setting, I crossed my fingers, issued a reconfigure and it works beautifully!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-the-good">
<h3 id="the-good"><span>6.1.</span> The Good</h3>
<div id="text-6-1">
<ul>
<li><p>
<b>Helpful community:</b> While I do feel like Guix's community could be much larger (see below), the one that exists is very helpful and nice from my limited experience. In all places I've looked so far (Libera's <code>#guix</code>, /r/Guix, and the guix/guix Codeberg repository) I was met with genuinely kind and helpful people.
</p>

<p>
That is not to say I haven't seen some bad eggs, especially in posts from years ago, but I don't think there is any community without those, so I'm not going to cite this as a negative.
</p></li>
<li><b>Home configuration:</b> Having <code>guix home</code> be a built-in, first class citizen, instead of a community made "extension" is excellent. Instead of needing to consult a third-party resource like Home Manager's <a href="https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/">documentation</a> you can simply use what you already know about Guix and, if you happen to hit a wall, you can just read the <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/1.5.0/en/html_node/Home-Configuration.html">official handbook</a> which is guaranteed to always stay up to date with the rest of the system.</li>
<li><b>Package availability:</b> As long as you largely use FOSS stuff (which is much easier than one might think), the amount of choice is awesome. I could basically just copy over the list of packages from my Nix config and practically everything had an equivalent.</li>
<li><p>
<b>Scheme:</b> I'm not really a seasoned Schemer, but I have dabbled in the language previously and it feels so much better to me than Nix (the language) ever did. One great benefit of this is that it's a lot easier to start digging into package definitions to figure things out for yourself.
</p>

<p>
This is "<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#make-changes">Freedom 1</a>" of GNU's Four Essential Freedoms in effect. Since the code is pretty much just Scheme and the different mechanisms available are fairly well documented (see caveat below), the barrier to entry is much lower than with Nix in my opinion.<sup><a role="doc-backlink" id="fnr.7" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Another nice benefit of this is that you can use Emacs' extensive Scheme support to help your configuration. Tools like <a href="https://github.com/emacsmirror/geiser">Geiser</a> can plug right into Guix and help you find package and function names and, once you're experienced enough, debug your config/packages on the fly. I personally haven't yet achieved mastery of such level yet, but having the REPL confirm if I've entered names in correctly before running the code is already a boon.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b>Ease of hacking:</b> In the "to tinker on" sense, rather than "being insecure". With Nix, merely pulling in Nixpkgs is an effort, due to the repository being massive. My otherwise beefy machine struggled to switch between branches and make commits, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence in contributing, even though it was otherwise something I was excited to do. Meanwhile, with Guix I was able to get a fully functioning development environment in 15 minutes tops, which includes cloning the repo, authenticating all commits, generating bytecode for the entire repository, and getting Emacs set up to work nice with the codebase.
</p>

<p>
Not to mention, at the time of writing <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/453219">my Nixpkgs PR of guile-colorized</a> is still not accepted, despite being open since October, 2025. Which is kind of disheartening, when the package is really trivial and has a very low blast-radius. With Guix I <a href="https://codeberg.org/guix/guix/pulls/5962">got an answer</a> to an extremely noobish question on my first PR in mere hours.
</p>

<p>
On a separate, but related note, I also found it a lot easier to test my package in a "live" environment as <code>guix pull</code> supports a parameter called <code>--url</code> which you can easily point to a folder on your own PC. So once I was confident my code should work, I could just "check out" my local repository clone and build it like I was an end user. This let me make sure it really does work.

<div id="text-6-2">
<ul>
<li><p>
<b>Search:</b> <code>guix search</code> not taking an extra parameter like <code>nix search</code> is both very convenient and a bit of a bummer.
</p>

<p>
Its absence is not a deal breaker, but I really loved how with Nix, you could search in <i>anything</i>, that has a flake. Be that Nixpkgs, a repo you downloaded, a repo that's on a git forge, etc. I remember being awestruck that I could just do <code>nix search github:mozilla/nixpkgs-mozilla</code> and search for their builds of Firefox without having to manually check out anything.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<b>The documentation:</b> Oof, this one is a bit hard to pass definite judgment on.
</p>

<p>
On one hand I love the thoroughness of it all. You can get a fairly decent idea of what Guix, what it can do for your, how to use it, and how to extend it, just by reading the manual. It is evident that the Guix team and GNU in general takes its mission to educate using free software very seriously. Stuff like the <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/cookbook/en/html_node/Packaging-Tutorial.html">Packaging tutorial</a> make it very easy for complete beginners to hack together package definitions without needing to consult any other resource.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it really is just a manual, not a tutorial. What I mean by this is that concepts that could belong together aren't placed near each other. A simple example would be <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/1.5.0/en/html_node/Services.html">services</a> and <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/1.5.0/en/html_node/Service-Reference.html#:~:text=modify-services%20services">customizing them</a>. Assuming, you're in one of the sub-pages of Services and you suddenly realize you want to replace/modify one of the services, you are left completely clueless how that works. You have to go to a completely different chapter and find one particular function's description and then apply what you learn there. The <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/cookbook/en/guix-cookbook.html">Guix Cookbook</a> has some examples, but you have to know about the cookbook in the first place.
</p>

<p>
And before anyone misunderstands me, I'm fine with RTFM, but in my opinion one of the preconditions of mass-appeal is having "pre-chewed" solutions for common problems, that don't require perusing multiple chapters.

<div id="text-6-3">
<ul>
<li><b>Substitute server stability:</b> I imagine this is an issue that only a massive bag of money could fix, but the CI/CD servers could definitely use some more processing power. It's really annoying when you're trying to test something and you're suddenly forced to wait 10-15 minutes because the server can only spare 50-100 kbps for you.</li>
<li><p>
<b>Content out there:</b> Clearly this isn't the Guix team's fault (and it's something I'm trying to lessen with this post, even if just a tiny bit), but it's really hard to find good quality material when it comes to Guix.
</p>

<p>
I mean, sure, there is the excellent <a href="https://systemcrafters.net/craft-your-system-with-guix/">System Crafters</a> tutorial series, and the odd gems like <a href="https://dthompson.us/posts/guix-for-development.html">DThompson's dev env tutorial</a>, but as a whole you're largely left to your own to trawl through the manual, IRC logs, Reddit threads, Codeberg and the previous issue tracker, etc. It's not an impossible task, especially if you're used to doing Linux things "the hard way", but it's certainly a far cry from such one-stop shops as <a href="https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixos-with-flakes/introduction-to-flakes">the Nix Flakes book</a> or <a href="https://mhwombat.codeberg.page/nix-book/">Wombat's Book of Nix</a>.
</p></li>
<li><b>Guix's own build speed:</b> Nix excels in speed, so I was hoping Guix would be the same. Yet stuff like <code>guix pull</code> really bog things down. Doubly so, if you want to update not just your own <code>guix</code> instance, but also root's.</li>
<li><b>Clarity of commands:</b> The fact that all concerns are lumped together (unlike Nix's many utilities) means that to the new user the many commands such as <code>guix pull</code>, <code>guix {system, home} reconfigure</code>, <code>guix update</code> can easily feel overwhelming and unclear what's updating/changing what. With time I'm sure you obtain a sort of mental muscle memory and you never think about it again, but starting out it's definitely a confusing part.</li>

In a nutshell I'm very positively surprised by Guix System. After struggling so much with it years ago, this time everything just clicked after a much shorter battle. So much so that I'm happy to make it my daily driver for the foreseeable future. Beyond the slightly slower execution speed, I'm getting a comparable experience to NixOS, with all the usual pros a declarative environment brings and without having to put up with Nixlang.
</p>

<p>
My only recurring issues so far are the occasional slow download speeds and that I have to start my kernel in <code>nomodeset</code> because otherwise the graphical environment crashes without me being able to switch to a TTY. It's a bummer, but honestly, I'm not too bothered by it so far. I'm trusting a driver update will fix it soon enough and, if not, it's not exactly difficult to <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/1.5.0/en/html_node/operating_002dsystem-Reference.html#:~:text=kernel-arguments">throw in a kernel parameter</a> into your config.
</p>

<p>
I'm hoping to do a followup post about packaging in Guix, because I've been dipping my toes into it by <a href="https://codeberg.org/guix/guix/pulls/6020">trying to package</a> Wezterm and the journey there was similarly arduous as installing the system itself.
</p>

<p>
Till then, thank you for reading and see you next time!

The stuff you see below are all I managed to write down mid-process. Some of these I threw it into the file from Nano, some from half-broken X11 sessions. Because of this, it's not exactly well-edited, but I hope it might provide a glimpse into my mind at the time.
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The installer is decently simple
<ul>
<li>I appreciate the warning about incompatible hardware</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2.5 hours at least to install (mirrors throttle connection to 50kbps)</li>
<li>KDE is simply not working out of the box (titlebars are missing)
<ul>
<li>It seems to also default to X11, when I'm looking for Wayland</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The first <code>guix pull</code> is horrendously slow</li>
<li>Wayland continues to elude me, seems to be an Nvidia issue
<ul>
<li>IRC recommends <code>nomodeset</code>, doesn't help</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Try enabling Nonguix, system no longer boots</li>
<li>Try installing using the Nonguix ISO
<ul>
<li>Lots of errors, terribly old release</li>
<li>Having to <code>guix pull</code> myself to the present day again</li>
<li>Also I'm missing the introduction, so I have to run it using <code>--disable-authentication</code>, not great, but I trust the Codeberg repo</li>
<li>At least the download speed seems to have normalized</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It isn't entirely clear when you have to use <code>sudo</code></li>
<li>Running <code>i3</code> on a shitty low-res has a certain vibe to it, but I'd prefer a system working out of the box</li>

<p><span>Opinion</span> I'm an eighth-generation American, and let me tell you, I wouldn't trust my data, secrets, or services to a US company these days for love or money. Under our current government, we're simply not trustworthy.</p>
<p>In the Trump‑redux era of 2026, European enterprises are finally taking data seriously, and that means packing up from Redmond-by-Seattle and moving their most sensitive workloads home. This isn't just compliance theater; it's a straight‑up national economic security play.</p>

<p>Europe's digital sovereignty paranoia, long waved off as regulatory chatter, is now feeding directly into procurement decisions. Gartner told <em>The Reg</em> last year that IT spending in Europe is set to grow by 11 percent in 2026, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/14/it_spending_europe/">hitting $1.4 trillion</a>, with a big chunk rolling into "sovereign cloud" options and on‑prem/edge architectures.</p>
<p>The kicker? Fully <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/13/gartner_cio_cloud_sovereignty/">61 percent of European CIOs and tech leaders</a> say they want to increase their use of local cloud providers. More than half say geopolitics will prevent them from leaning further on US‑based hyperscalers.</p>
<p>The American hypercloud vendors have figured this out. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/15/aws_european_sovereign_cloud/">AWS recently made its European Sovereign Cloud available</a>. This AWS cloud, Amazon claims, is "entirely located within the EU, and physically and logically separate from other AWS Regions." On top of that, EU residents will "independently operate it" and "be backed by strong technical controls, sovereign assurances, and legal protections designed to meet the needs of European governments and enterprises for sensitive data."</p>

    

<p>Many EU-based companies aren't pleased with this Euro-washing of American hypercloud services. The Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers in Europe (CISPE) trade association accuses the EU Cloud Sovereignty Framework of being <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/27/cispe_eu_sovereignty_framework/">set up to favor the incumbent</a> (American) hypercloud providers.</p>

        


        

<p>They're not wrong.</p>
<p>You don't need a DEA warrant or a Justice Department subpoena to see the trend: Europe's 90‑plus‑percent dependency on US cloud infrastructure, as former European Commission advisor <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/22/europe_gets_serious_about_cutting/">Cristina Caffarra put it, is a single‑shock‑event security nightmare</a> waiting to rupture the EU's digital stability.</p>

        

<p>Seriously. What will you do if Washington decides to unplug you? Say Trump gets up on the wrong side of the bed and decides to invade Greenland. There goes NATO, and in all the saber-rattling leading up to the 10th Mountain Division being shipped to Nuuk, he orders American companies to cut their services to all EU countries and the UK.</p>

<p>With the way things are going, they're not going to say no. I mean, CEOs Tim Cook of Apple, Eric Yuan of Zoom, Lisa Su of AMD, and – pay attention – Amazon's Andy Jassy all went obediently to watch a feature-length White House screening of Melania, the universally-loathed, 104‑minute Amazon‑produced documentary about First Lady Melania Trump.</p>

<p>Sure, that's a silly example, but for American companies to do business today, they're kowtowing to Trump. Or, take a far more serious example, when Minnesota company CEOs called for "de-escalation" in the state, there was not one word about ICE or the government's role in the bloodshed. It was the corporate equivalent of the mealy-mouthed "thoughts and prayers" American right-wingers always say after a US school shooting.</p>
<p>Some companies have already figured out which way the wind is blowing. Airbus, the European aerospace titan, has put out a €50 million, decade‑long tender to migrate its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/19/airbus_sovereign_cloud/">mission‑critical applications to a "sovereign European cloud."</a> Airbus wants its whole stack – data at rest, data in transit, logging, IAM, and security‑monitoring infrastructure – all rooted in EU law and overseen by EU operators. As Catherine Jestin, Airbus's executive vice president of digital, told <em>The Register</em>: "We want to ensure this information remains under European control."</p>
<p>Who can blame them? Thanks to the American CLOUD Act and related US surveillance statutes, US‑headquartered providers must hand over European data regardless of where the bytes sit. Exhibit A is that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/25/microsoft_admits_it_cannot_guarantee/">Microsoft has already conceded that it cannot guarantee data independence from US law enforcement</a>. Airbus is betting that "data residency on paper" from AWS‑styled "EU sections" is not enough. Real sovereignty demands EU‑owned and run operations with full contractual and legal firewalls. Sure, your data may live in Frankfurt, but your fate still rests in Seattle, Redmond, or Mountain View if an American company owns your cloud provider.</p>
<p>Besides, do you really want some Trump apparatchik getting their hands on your data? I mean, this is a government where Madhu Gottumukkala, the acting director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/cisa-madhu-gottumukkala-chatgpt-00749361">uploaded sensitive data into ChatGPT</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/06/uk_urged_to_unplug_from/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>In response, Brussels is pushing an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/29/europes_cloud_challenge_building_an/">open source‑led exit from hyperscaler lock‑in</a>. Ministries are standardizing on Nextcloud‑style collaboration stacks instead of Microsoft 365 to fund Euro‑native clouds via the European Cloud Alliance. Some countries, like France, are already <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/france_videoconferencing_visio/?td=rt-3a">shoving Zoom, Teams, and other US videoconferencing platforms out the door</a> in favor of a local service.</p>
<p>If you're running an EU‑based firm in 2026, the takeaway isn't that AWS‑in‑Frankfurt is evil; it's that for certain workloads, especially national security, industrial IP, or high‑profile consumer data franchises, EU‑native cloud and services are no longer a nice‑to‑have but a business continuity plan requirement.</p>

        

<p>It's time to get serious about digital sovereignty. The clock is ticking, and there's no telling when Trump will go off. ®</p>

<section id="newslist"><article data-news-id="159"><h2><a href="https://antirez.com/news/159">Automatic programming</a></h2></article></section><topcomment><article data-comment-id="159-" id="159-"><span><span><a href="https://antirez.com/user/antirez">antirez</a></span> 3 hours ago. 17855 views.  </span><pre>In my YouTube channel, for some time now I started to refer to the process of writing software using AI assistance (soon to become just "the process of writing software", I believe) with the term "Automatic Programming".

In case you didn't notice, automatic programming produces vastly different results with the same LLMs depending on the human that is guiding the process with their intuition, design, continuous steering and idea of software.

Please, stop saying "Claude vibe coded this software for me". Vibe coding is the process of generating software using AI without being part of the process at all. You describe what you want in very general terms, and the LLM will produce whatever happens to be the first idea/design/code it would spontaneously, given the training, the specific sampling that happened to dominate in that run, and so forth. The vibe coder will, at most, report things not working or not in line with what they expected.

When the process is actual software production where you know what is going on, remember: it is the software *you* are producing. Moreover remember that the pre-training data, while not the only part where the LLM learns (RL has its big weight) was produced by humans, so we are not appropriating something else. We can pretend AI generated code is "ours", we have the right to do so. Pre-training is, actually, our collective gift that allows many individuals to do things they could otherwise never do, like if we are now linked in a collective mind, in a certain way.

That said, if vibe coding is the process of producing software without much understanding of what is going on (which has a place, and democratizes software production, so it is totally ok with me), automatic programming is the process of producing software that attempts to be high quality and strictly following the producer's vision of the software (this vision is multi-level: can go from how to do, exactly, certain things, at a higher level, to stepping in and tell the AI how to write a certain function), with the help of AI assistance. Also a fundamental part of the process is, of course, *what* to do.

I'm a programmer, and I use automatic programming. The code I generate in this way is mine. My code, my output, my production. I, and you, can be proud.

If you are not completely convinced, think to Redis. In Redis there is not much technical novelty, especially at its start it was just a sum of basic data structures and networking code that every competent system programmer could write. So, why it became a very useful piece of software? Because of the ideas and visions it contained.

Programming is now automatic, vision is not (yet).</pre></article></topcomment>

								<p>The CERN particle-physics lab near Geneva <a href="https://home.cern/news/press-release/cern/private-donors-pledge-860-million-euros-cerns-future-circular-collider">has received $1bn</a> from private donors towards the construction of the <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/future-circular-collider">Future Circular Collider</a> (FCC). The cash marks the first time in the lab’s 72-year history that individuals and philanthropic foundations have agreed to support a major CERN project. If built, the FCC would be the successor to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where the Higgs boson was discovered.</p>
<p>CERN originally released&nbsp;<a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/europe-unveils-successor-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">a four-volume conceptual design report</a>&nbsp;for the FCC in early 2019, with more detail included in a <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2928193">three-volume feasibility study</a> that came out last year. It calls for a giant tunnel some 90.7 km in circumference – roughly three times as long as the LHC&nbsp; – that would be built about 200&nbsp;m underground on average.</p>
<p>The FCC has been recommended as the preferred option for the next flagship collider at CERN in the <a href="https://url.uk.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/xtPXC0Rv8tvN53FRhwF9G-Hn?domain=u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net">ongoing process to update the European Strategy for Particle Physics</a>, which will be passed over to the &nbsp;CERN Council in May 2026.If the plans are given the green light by CERN Council in 2028, construction on the FCC electron-positron machine, dubbed FCC-ee, would begin in 2030. It would start operations in 2047, a few years after the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) closes down, and run for about 15 years until the early 2060s.</p>
<p>The FCC-ee would focus on creating a million Higgs particles in total to allow physicists to study its properties with an accuracy an order of magnitude better that possible with the LHC. The FCC feasibility study then calls for a hadron machine, dubbed FCC-hh, to replace the FCC-ee in the existing 91 km tunnel. It would be a “discovery machine”, smashing together protons at high energy – about 85 TeV – with the aim of creating new particles. If built, the FCC-hh will begin operation in 2073 and run to the end of the century.</p>
<p>The funding model for the FCC-ee, which is expected to have a price tag of about $18bn, is still a work in progress. But it is estimated that at least two-thirds of the construction costs will come from CERN’s 24 member states with the rest needing to be found elsewhere. One option to plug that gap is private donations and in late December CERN received a significant boost from several organizations including the Breakthrough Prize Foundation, the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fund for Strategic Innovation, and the entrepreneurs John Elkann and Xavier Niel. Together, they pledged a total of $1bn towards the FCC-ee.</p>
<p>Costas Fountas, president of the CERN Council, says CERN is “extremely grateful” for the interest. “This once again demonstrates CERN’s relevance and positive impact on society, and the strong interest in CERN’s future that exists well beyond our own particle physics community,” he notes.</p>
<p>Eric Schmidt, who founded Google, claims that he and Wendy Schmidt were “inspired by the ambition&nbsp;of this project and by what it could mean for the future of humanity”. The FCC, he believes, is an instrument that “could push the boundaries of human knowledge and deepen our understanding of the fundamental laws of the Universe” and could lead to technologies that could benefit society “in profound ways” from medicine to computing to sustainable energy.</p>
<p>The cash promised has been welcomed by outgoing CERN director-general Fabiola Gianotti. “It’s the first time in history that private donors wish to partner with CERN to build an extraordinary research instrument that will allow humanity to take major steps forward in our understanding of fundamental physics and the universe,” she said. “I am profoundly grateful to them for their generosity, vision, and unwavering commitment to knowledge and exploration.”</p>
<h3>Further boost</h3>
<p>The cash comes a few months after the Circular Electron–Positron Collider (CEPC) – a rival collider to the FCC-ee that also involves building a huge 100 km tunnel to study the Higgs in unprecedented detail – was not considered for inclusion in China’s next five-year plan, which runs from 2026 to 2030. There has been much discussion in China about whether the CEPC is the right project for the country, with the collider facing criticism from particle physicist and Nobel laureate Chen-Ning Yang, before he died last year.</p>
<p>Wang Yifang of the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) in Beijing says they will submit the CEPC for consideration again in 2030 unless FCC is officially approved before then. But for particle theorist John Ellis from Kings College London, China’s decision to effectively put the CEPC on the back burner &nbsp;“certainly simplifies the FCC discussion”. “However, an opportunity for growing the world particle physics community has been lost, or at least deferred [by the decision],” Ellis told <em>Physics World</em>.</p>
<p>Ellis adds, however, that he would welcome China’s participation in the FCC. “Their accelerator and detector [technical design reviews] show that they could bring a lot to the table, if the political obstacles can be overcome,” he says. </p><article>

<p>However, if the FCC-ee goes ahead China could perhaps make significant “in-kind” contributions rather like those that occur with the ITER experimental fusion reactor, which is currently being built in France. In this case, instead of cash payments, the countries provide components, equipment and other materials.</p>
<p>Those considerations and more will now fall to the British physicist Mark Thomson, who took over from Gianotti as CERN director-general on 1 January for a five-year term. As well as working on funding requirements for the FCC-ee, top of his in-tray will actually be shutting down the LHC in June to make way for further work on the HL-LHC, which involves installing powerful new superconducting magnets and improving the detection.</p>
<p>About 90% of the 27 km LHC accelerator will be affected by the upgrade with a major part being to replace the magnets in the final focus systems of the two large experiments, ATLAS and CMS. These magnets will take the incoming beams and then focus them down to less than 10 µm in cross section. The upgrade includes the installation of brand new state-of-the-art niobium-tin (Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn) superconducting focusing magnets.</p>
<p>The HL-LHC will probably not turn on until 2030, at which time Thomson’s term will nearly be over, but that doesn’t deter him from leading the world’s foremost particle-physics lab. “It’s an incredibly exciting project,” Thomson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/dec/31/large-hadron-collider-head-of-cern-mark-thomson">told the <em>Guardian</em></a>. “It’s more interesting than just sitting here with the machine hammering away.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<blockquote>
<p>TLDR: I made a CLI tool that can resolve an IP address to a country, US state and even a city. <a href="https://github.com/jimaek/geolocation-tool?ref=blog.globalping.io">https://github.com/jimaek/geolocation-tool</a><br>
It works well and confirms ipinfo's findings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently, I read how <a href="https://ipinfo.io/blog/vpn-location-mismatch-report?ref=blog.globalping.io">ipinfo finally proved</a> what most technical people assumed: VPN providers don't actually maintain a crazy amount of infrastructure in hundreds of countries. They simply fake the IP geolocation by intentionally providing wrong location data to ARIN, RIPE, and Geo DB providers via geofeeds.</p>
<p>They achieved their results using a novel approach compared to other geo IP providers. Based on their blog and HackerNews comments, they built a large probe network and used it to trace and ping every (or most) IP addresses on the internet.</p>
<p>This latency and hop data, most likely along with advanced algorithms and data cross-reference, provides a reliable way of correctly detecting the physical geolocation of an IP address, without relying on faked data available in public sources.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting approach that makes total sense, and I'm sure their clients appreciate it and heavily rely on it.</p>
<p>While I can't ping every single IP address on the internet from hundreds of locations just yet, I can do it to a limited subset using Globalping. So I decided to try it out and see if I can replicate their results and build a small tool to allow anyone to do the same.</p>
<p>Globalping is an open-source, community-powered project that allows users to self-host container-based probes. These probes then become part of our <a href="https://globalping.io/network?ref=blog.globalping.io">public network</a>, which allows anyone to use them to run network testing tools such as ping and traceroute.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.globalping.io/content/images/2025/12/network-map-globalping.png" alt="network-map-globalping.png" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>At the moment, the network has more than 3000 probes, which in theory should be plenty to geolocate almost any IP address down to a country and even a US state level.</p>
<p>To automate and simplify this process, I made a little CLI tool using the <a href="https://github.com/jsdelivr/globalping-typescript?ref=blog.globalping.io">globalping-ts</a> library. My original idea was simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept a single IP as input</li>
<li>Ping it a few times per continent to select the continent</li>
<li>Then ping the IP from many different probes on that continent</li>
<li>Group and sort the results; the country with the lowest latency should be the correct one</li>
<li>And as a bonus, repeat the same process for USA states if the winning country was the US</li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially, what I had to do was simply create a few measurements and pass the location I needed using Globalping’s magic field, which would automatically figure out what I was looking for and select a few pseudo-random probes that fit the location and limit.</p>
<p>Now initially, I used <code>ping</code> with 2 packets to run all measurements as quickly as possible, but I quickly realized it wasn’t a good idea as most networks block ICMP traffic. Next, I tried switching to TCP-based <code>ping</code>, which required trying a few popular ports to get it to work. I quickly realized this was too complicated and unreliable and switched to <code>traceroute</code>.</p>
<p>It worked perfectly. Even though <code>traceroute</code> uses ICMP by default, it did not matter to me if the target IP’s network allowed ICMP or not, I simply analyzed the latency of the last available hop. Even if you block ICMP, your upstream most likely allows it, and in most cases, it’s located in the same country.</p>
<p>Of course, this means the resulting data is not 100% perfect. A better approach would be to analyze each IP using different methods, including TCP and UDP-based <code>traceroute</code> on different ports, and expand to the last few hops instead of just one. Maybe even try to figure out the location of the registered ASNs and use a weights system in combination with public whois info in order to “vote” for the right location based on different inputs. Probably even mark low certainty IPs to be retested with a double amount of probes. (end of rant)</p>
<p>But that’s something for a commercial provider to figure out, which it seems they did.</p>
<p>For continent detection, I decided to use just 5 probes per continent; the results were extremely accurate. Although for IPs just on the "border" of continents it might be ineffective, a higher amount of probes would generate better results. For this use case, it was good enough.</p>
<p>My home IP in central Europe was too easy to detect:</p>
<pre><code>Phase 1: Detecting continent...
  North America: 137.18 ms
  Europe: 32.39 ms
  Asia: 174.54 ms
  South America: 215.08 ms
  Oceania: 244.15 ms
  Africa: 156.83 ms
</code></pre>
<p>In phase 2, all we need to do is run a single measurement with the winning continent as the location and a higher limit. Initially, I started with 250 probes with great accuracy.</p>
<p>Eventually, I decided to drop down to 50 as the default. Based on my tests, the results continued to look really good, and it would allow the tool to be run even without authentication, as the Globalping API allows 250 tests per hour per IP and 50 probes per measurement.</p>
<p>Although I recommend registering for a free account at <a href="https://dash.globalping.io/?ref=blog.globalping.io">https://dash.globalping.io/</a> and authenticating with a token to get up to 500 tests per hour and run more tests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you need more tests than that, you can either host a probe to generate passive credits to be used as tests, or donate via GitHub Sponsors. We will automatically detect it and credit your account.</p>

<p>Great, now we have a basic IP-to-country resolver that only takes a few seconds to provide a response, and I didn’t even have to understand or write any complicated math. Although I’m sure someone smarter could use a formula to geolocate IPs with even fewer probes and higher accuracy.</p>
<p>For phase 3, we want to resolve the US to a specific state or territory, just like ipinfo did, and luckily they even provided a few sample IPs and locations to benchmark against during testing.</p>
<p>Again, this was as simple as creating a new measurement with the USA as the location. I used 50 probes as the default limit and tested the NordVPN IP advertised as Bahamas but resolved to Miami by ipinfo.</p>

<p>The tool agrees, Florida is the correct location. But how accurate can this system be? Can we expand it to show the city too?</p>
<p>Let's make a new phase, which again, will simply set the resulting country or state as the location and extract the city of the probe with the lowest latency. Here, since there are too many possible cities and towns per state and country, I expect the accuracy to be low and only point to the closest major hub. But in theory, this should be more than enough for use cases like routing or performance debugging.</p>
<p>And here we go, the same result ipinfo got</p>

<p>The current results are good but could be better. The main problem is with how the magic field works: when setting, for example, 'Europe' as the location, it tries to spread the tests across all European probes but does not guarantee that every single country is going to be included.</p>
<p>This results in inconsistencies where a probe in the same country as the target IP was not selected, and so the tool assumes the IP is located in a different neighbouring country.</p>
<p>To fix this and make the results more consistent, you would need to change the selection logic and manually set every country per continent and US state. By passing the full list of countries/states to the Globalping API, you ensure that at least one probe in that location is going to be selected. Additionally, you fully control the number of probes per location, which is very important to control the accuracy.</p>
<p>For example, North America technically contains 43 countries and territories. This means you can't just set a limit of one probe per country, it is not enough to properly understand the latency to the target IP from the disproportionately larger USA. A better limit would be around 200 probes for the USA, 20 for Canada, and 10 for Mexico.</p>
<p>But the goal of this tool was to use a minimum amount of probes to allow unauthenticated users to test it out. The current approach works great, it is simple to implement and it is very easy to control the accuracy by simply setting a higher limit of probes.</p>
<p>Overall, latency-based geolocation detection seems to be a great way to verify the location of any IP as long as you have enough vantage points. It will most likely fall apart in regions with minimal or no coverage.</p>
<p>The tool itself is open source and you can run it like this:</p>
<p><code>geolocate $IP</code></p>
<p>You can also use the –limit parameter to use more probes per phase. But be careful as it applies the set value to all phases and this will very quickly eat through your limit. Check the full docs in GitHub.</p>
<p>Pull requests with improvements are welcome!</p>
<p>Feel free to email me if you need some free credits to play around with <a href="mailto:d@globalping.io">d@globalping.io</a></p>
<p>And of course consider hosting a probe, it’s as simple as running a container <a href="https://github.com/jsdelivr/globalping-probe?ref=blog.globalping.io">https://github.com/jsdelivr/globalping-probe</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p><strong>Update 30/01/26 – 12:50 pm (IST)</strong>: In a statement to the folks over at <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-background-play-broken-3636179/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android Authority</a>, Google confirmed that they’ve tweaked the platform experience to prevent non-Premium users from accessing background playback when using browsers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Background playback is a feature intended to be exclusive for YouTube Premium members. While some non-Premium users may have previously been able to access this through mobile web browsers in certain scenarios, we have updated the experience to ensure consistency across all our platforms.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Original article published on January 28, 2026, follows:</strong></em></p>
<p>It looks like YouTube has thrown a wrench into the works for a lot of mobile users who enjoy listening to videos with their screen off. Over the past few days, reports have been flooding in that the handy background video playback feature has suddenly stopped working on Samsung Internet.</p>
<p>Judging by the reports, it seems that the problem seems to have cropped up around a week ago and has since been impacting more users. While a majority of <a href="https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S25/Background-Play-on-Samsung-Browser-stop-working/m-p/3467684#M50167" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">reports</a> are coming from Samsung Internet users, it’s not the only browser impacted. Users on <a href="https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Samsung-Apps-and-Services/Background-Video-Play-Issue/td-p/3464259" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Brave</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1qni74a/background_audio_play_not_working_on_one_ui_8/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Vivaldi</a>, and even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/comments/1qmhv2n/background_playback_not_working/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Microsoft Edge</a> have complained about the issue.</p>
<p>What’s happening is pretty specific. When users try to minimize the browser or turn off their screen, the audio cuts out. On Samsung devices, some users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1qo2rp0/background_play_issue/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">noticed</a> a fleeting notification that said “MediaOngoingActivity” right before the media controls vanished entirely.</p>
<p><a href="https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/samsung-internet-youtube-background-play-not-working-complaint.webp"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/samsung-internet-youtube-background-play-not-working-complaint.webp" alt="samsung-internet-youtube-background-play-not-working-complaint" width="600" height="339" srcset="https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/samsung-internet-youtube-background-play-not-working-complaint.webp 600w, https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/samsung-internet-youtube-background-play-not-working-complaint-300x170.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>For years, people have relied on these mobile browser workarounds to get a free taste of what YouTube Premium offers: ad-free viewing and, crucially, background audio. This sudden, simultaneous failure across multiple browsers strongly suggests a targeted change by YouTube.</p>
<p>Samsung’s community forums and subs like r/oneui and r/youtube are becoming hubs to discuss the problem. Users have confirmed that basic troubleshooting tips, like ensuring that PiP mode and JavaScript are enabled, and also clearing the app’s cache, do not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the privacy-focused Brave browser has a new open issue on its <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/52254" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">GitHub page</a>, confirming that the background play feature, which was working perfectly, has now failed. This widespread nature makes it hard to blame a single browser update or a simple bug.</p>
<p><a href="https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave-browser-youtube-background-playback-bug.webp"><img decoding="async" src="https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave-browser-youtube-background-playback-bug.webp" alt="brave-browser-youtube-background-playback-bug" width="600" height="1474" srcset="https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave-browser-youtube-background-playback-bug.webp 600w, https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave-browser-youtube-background-playback-bug-122x300.webp 122w, https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave-browser-youtube-background-playback-bug-417x1024.webp 417w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>That said, at least one Brave user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/comments/1qmhv2n/comment/o1zaa1q/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claims</a> that this problem was fixed, and it now works fine. So I’d suggest Brave users keep an eye out for any new updates and try again (the same goes for other browsers too).</p>
<p>While YouTube hasn’t officially commented, the consensus among users is that the company has finally closed a popular loophole, effectively breaking the YouTube Premium workaround for millions. If you’re searching for why your YouTube background play is not working, or your Samsung Internet background video issue is suddenly a problem, you’re definitely not alone.</p>
<p>If this isn’t a random glitch, then the move is a clear push to convert more users to a paid subscription, leaving those who relied on the feature to either pay up or keep their screens on. We’ve already reported on YouTube’s fresh <a href="https://piunikaweb.com/2026/01/28/newpipe-content-unavailable-error-fix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crackdown on third-party clients like NewPipe</a>. So it won’t be a stretch to assume that YouTube is indeed patching such workarounds.</p>
<p>It’s a tough break for anyone who used this trick to listen to podcasts or music videos on the go.</p>

<p>For more than 150 years scientists have tried to solve the mystery of a notorious cuneiform clay tablet that reveals that in the past the impact case of so-called Köfel was detected. The circular stone-cast tablet was discovered in the late 1800s from the 650 BC King Ashurbanipal ‘s underground library in Nineveh, Iraq.</p>



<p>Data processing, which was long believed to be an Assyrian tablet, mirrored the sky over Mesopotamia in 3300 BC and proved to be much more <a href="https://archaeologyworlds.com/">ancient Sumerian origin</a>.</p>



<p>The tablet is the first astronomical instrument, the “Astrolabe.”&nbsp; It consists of a segmented, disk-shaped star chart with marked units of angle measure inscribed upon the rim.</p>



<p>Unfortunately considerable parts of the planisphere on this tablet are missing (approximately 40%), damage which dates to the sacking of Nineveh. The reverse of the tablet is not inscribed.</p>

<p>Still under study by modern scholars, the cuneiform tablet in the <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British Museum</a> collection No K8538 (known as “the Planisphere”) provides extraordinary proof for the existence of sophisticated Sumerian astronomy.</p>



<p>In 2008 two authors, Alan Bond and Mark Hempsell published a book about the tablet called&nbsp;“A Sumerian Observation of the Kofels’ Impact Event”.</p>



<p>Raising a storm in archaeological circles, they re-translated the cuneiform text and asserted the tablet records an ancient asteroid strike, the Köfels’ Impact, which struck Austria sometime around 3100 BC.</p>



<p>The giant landslide centred at Köfels in Austria is 500m thick and five kilometres in diameter and has long been a mystery since geologists first looked at it in the 19th century.</p>



<p>The conclusion drawn by research in the middle 20th century was that it must be due to a very large meteor impact because of the evidence of crushing pressures and explosions. But this view lost favor as a much better understanding of impact sites developed in the late 20th century.</p>



<p>In the case of Köfels there is no crater, so to modern eyes it does not look as an impact site should look. However, the evidence that puzzled the earlier researchers remains unexplained by the view that it is just another landslide.</p>



<p>So what is the connection between the sophisticated Sumerian star chart discovered in the underground library in Nineveh and mysterious impact that took place in Austria?</p>



<p>Examination of the clay tablet reveals that it is an astronomical work as it has drawings of constellations on it and the text has known constellation names. It has attracted a lot of attention but in over a hundred years nobody has come up with a convincing explanation as to what it is.</p>



<p>With modern computer programs that can simulate trajectories and reconstruct the night sky thousands of years ago the researchers have established what the Planisphere tablet refers to. It is a copy of the night notebook of a Sumerian astronomer as he records the events in the sky before dawn on 29 June 3123 BC (Julian calendar).</p>



<p>Half the tablet records planet positions and cloud cover, the same as any other night, but the other half of the tablet records an object large enough for its shape to be noted even though it is still in space.</p>



<p>The astronomers made an accurate note of its trajectory relative to the stars, which to an error better than one degree is consistent with an impact at Köfels.</p>

</div>


<p>The observation suggests the asteroid is over a kilometer in diameter and the original orbit about the Sun was an Aten type, a class of asteroids that orbit close to the Earth, that are resonant with the Earth’s orbit.</p>



<p>This trajectory explains why there is no crater at Köfels. The incoming angle was very low (six degrees) and means the asteroid clipped a mountain called Gamskogel above the town of Längenfeld, 11 kilometers from Köfels, and this caused the asteroid to explode before it reached its final impact point. As it traveled down the valley it became a fireball, around five kilometers in diameter (the size of the landslide).</p>



<p>When it hit Köfels it created enormous pressures that pulverized the rock and caused the landslide but because it was no longer a solid object it did not create a classic impact crater.</p>



<p>Mark Hempsell, discussing the Köfels event, said: “Another conclusion can be made from the trajectory. The back plume from the explosion (the mushroom cloud) would be bent over the Mediterranean Sea re-entering the atmosphere over the Levant, Sinai, and Northern Egypt.</p>



<p>“The ground heating though very short would be enough to ignite any flammable material – including human hair and clothes. It is probable more people died under the plume than in the Alps due to the impact blast.”</p>



<p>In other words, the remarkable ancient star map shows that the Sumerians made an observation of an Aten asteroid over a kilometer in diameter that impacted Köfels in Austria in the early morning of 29th June 3123 BC.</p>

		<p>ICE is using a smartphone app called “Mobile Fortify” to scan faces and capture contactless fingerprints, instantly pulling back names and biographical data — and court filings say the same encounters are being followed by revocations of Global Entry and TSA PreCheck. 
</p><p>That turns “trusted traveler” into chilling of speech. DHS runs both the surveillance and the program, and being “under investigation” can be enough to lose your status even if protesting itself cannot legally be a disqualifier.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expanding use of identificationand tracking – not just immigration targets but also on U.S. citizens who are documenting, protesting, and observing enforcement operations.  And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/technology/tech-ice-facial-recognition-palantir.html" target="_blank">participating in these events is getting Global Entry yanked</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241111_090022.jpg"></p>
<p>The government is using a smartphone app called <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobile-fortify-face-recognition-nec-ice-cbp/" target="_blank">“Mobile Fortify”</a> that lets agents scan a face and even capture ‘contactless’ fingerprints and run them through biometric matching systems to return names and biographical data. Reportedly the agency has used Mobile Fortify <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/27/ice-facial-recognition-minnesota" target="_blank">over 100,000 times</a>. They use <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/28/metro/ice-surveillance-data/" target="_blank">BI2 Technologies for smartphone iris scanning</a> against a large law enforcement iris database. The agency defends this all as “lawful.”</p>
<p>In addition, ICE <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2026/ice-surveillance-immigrants-protesters/" target="_blank">uses</a> license plate reader data, commercial phone location data, drones, and other tools to monitor protests by U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Global Entry is administered by the Department of Homeland Security, its data was used to train Mobile Fortify, and citizens in the program are subject to having the status revoked if they’re being investigated.  DHS investigates people protesting DHS.</p>
<ul><li>Customs and Border Protection can deem you ineligible “at its sole discretion” if you present a potential risk for terrorism, criminality, or are otherwise no longer considered low risk.  It bases risk determinations partly on demonstrated compliance.
</li><li>They can kick yo uout for arrests or being the subject of an investigation by any law enforcement agency, or suspect conduct that is ‘terrorism-related’.</li></ul>

<p>Protesting isn’t a listed or ‘valid’ reason for having Global Entry revoked, but being arrested at a protest is.  Impeding or interfering with the agency is.  And being investigated is. </p>
<p>In a court filing, Nicole Cleland <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.229758/gov.uscourts.mnd.229758.98.0.pdf" target="_blank">says</a> she observing ICE activities in her neighborhood when an agent approached her vehicle, addressed her by name, said they had “facial recognition” and warned she was “impeding” and could be arrested if it happened again. Three days later, she received email notice her Global Entry and TSA PreCheck status was revoked.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lax-tsa-bradley-terminal.jpg"></p>
<p>Homeland Security <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/u-s-government-is-monitoring-all-global-entry-members-daily/" target="_blank">does continuous checks on Global Entry members</a>, and may uncover a past conviction that wasn’t disclosed during the application (generally minor offenses over 10 years old, such as a DUI, are fine if you disclose them) or a new conviction. Breaking program rules or rules in the immigration hall such as failing to declare items or bringing ineligible family members with you into the Global Entry queues can get you kicked out if the customs officer decides to make an issue of it.</p>
<p>You can lose Global Entry <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/you-can-lose-global-entry-for-complaining-about-a-cbp-officer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for complaining about a customs officer</a>.  <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/woman-fined-500-pocketing-delta-onboard-snack-may-lose-global-entry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putting an apple from your flight in your bag, and then not declaring it</a> can cost you your Global Entry.  So can <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/trump-attorney-learns-that-attempting-a-coup-will-mean-losing-tsa-precheck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempting a coup against the United States</a>. </p>
<p>So, too, now it seems just for protesting against government policy.  And that has a huge chilling effect on public dissent. If you’re punished for expressing views contrary to those in power, you’ll be less likely to express those views.  It’ll then appear to others that there’s a consensus supporting those in power, making it harder for still others to dissent.  That’s what you get in authoritarian regimes – preference falsification, where everyone publicly tows the dominant line and is unwilling to reveal their true beliefs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kiosk.jpg"></p>
<p>While more people are being kicked out of Global Entry than ever before, <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/more-travelers-are-being-kicked-out-of-global-entry-than-approved-but-39-win-appeals/" target="_blank">39% of people who appeal the revocation win</a>.  Plus, <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/had-your-global-entry-taken-away-court-says-dhs-decisions-now-subject-to-review-roundup/" target="_blank">DHS decisions on Global Entry are subject to judicial review</a>, at least in the ninth circuit.</p>

            <pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 00:51:27 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://simedw.com/2026/01/31/ear-pronunication-via-ctc/">https://simedw.com/2026/01/31/ear-pronunication-via-ctc/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46832074">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>TL;DR:</span> Mandarin pronunciation has been hard for me, so I took ~300 hours of transcribed speech and trained a small CTC model to <em>grade</em> my pronunciation. You can try it <a href="https://simedw.com/projects/ear">here</a>.</p>
<p>In my previous post about <a href="https://simedw.com/2025/12/15/langseed/">Langseed</a>, I introduced a platform for defining words using only vocabulary I had already mastered. My vocabulary has grown since then, but unfortunately, people still struggle to understand what I'm saying.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is tones. They're fairly foreign to me, and I'm bad at hearing my own mistakes, which is deeply frustrating when you don’t have a teacher.</p>
<h2 id="first-attempt-pitch-visualisation">First attempt: pitch visualisation</h2>
<p>My initial plan was to build a pitch visualiser: split incoming audio into small chunks, run an FFT, extract the dominant pitch over time, and map it using an energy-based heuristic, loosely inspired by Praat. </p>
<p>But this approach quickly became brittle. There were endless special cases: background noise, coarticulation, speaker variation, voicing transitions, and so on.</p>
<p>And if there’s one thing we’ve learned over the last decade, it’s the <em>bitter lesson</em>: when you have enough data and compute, learned representations usually beat carefully hand-tuned systems.</p>
<p>So instead, I decided to build a <strong>deep learning–based Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT)</strong> system that could run entirely on-device. There are already commercial APIs that do this, but hey, where’s the fun in that?</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>I treated this as a specialised Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task. Instead of just transcribing text, the model needs to be pedantic about <em>how</em> something was said.</p>
<p>I settled on a <strong>Conformer encoder</strong> trained with <strong>CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification)</strong> loss.</p>
<h2 id="why-conformer">Why Conformer?</h2>
<p>Speech is weird: you need to catch both local and global patterns:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Local interactions</strong><br>
   The difference between a retroflex <em>zh</em> and an alveolar <em>z</em> happens in a split second. CNNs are excellent at capturing these short-range spectral features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Global interactions</strong><br>
   Mandarin tones are relative (a "high" pitch for me might be low for a child) and context-dependent (tone sandhi)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Transformers excel at modeling this longer-range context.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Conformers combine both: convolution for local detail, attention for global structure.</p>
<h2 id="why-ctc">Why CTC?</h2>
<p>Most modern ASR models (e.g. Whisper) are sequence-to-sequence: they turn audio into the <em>most likely text</em>. The downside is they'll happily auto-correct you.</p>
<p>That’s a feature for transcription, but it’s a bug for language learning. If my tone is wrong, I don’t want the model to guess what I <em>meant</em>. I want it to tell me what I actually said.</p>
<p>CTC works differently. It outputs a probability distribution for every frame of audio (roughly every 40 ms). To handle alignment, it introduces a special <code>&lt;blank&gt;</code> token.</p>
<p>If the audio is "hello", the raw output might look like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>h h h &lt;blank&gt; e e &lt;blank&gt; l l l l &lt;blank&gt; l l o o o
</code></pre></div>

<p>Collapsing repeats and removing blanks gives <code>hello</code>. This forces the model has to deal with what I actually said, frame by frame.</p>
<h2 id="forced-alignment-knowing-when-you-said-it">Forced alignment: knowing <em>when</em> you said it</h2>
<p>CTC tells us <em>what</em> was said, but not exactly <em>when</em>.</p>
<p>For a 3-second clip, the model might output a matrix with ~150 time steps (columns), each containing probabilities over all tokens (rows). Most of that matrix is just <code>&lt;blank&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>If the user reads "Nǐ hǎo" (ni3, hao3), we expect two regions of high probability: one for <code>ni3</code>, one for <code>hao3</code>.</p>
<p>We need to find a single, optimal path through this matrix that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starts at the beginning</li>
<li>Ends at the end</li>
<li>Passes through <code>ni3</code> → <code>hao3</code> in order</li>
<li>Maximises total probability</li>
</ul>

<p>This is exactly what the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm">Viterbi algorithm</a> computes, using dynamic programming. </p>
<h2 id="tokenisation-pinyin-tone-as-first-class-tokens">Tokenisation: Pinyin + tone as first-class tokens</h2>
<p>Most Mandarin ASR systems output Hanzi. That hides pronunciation errors, because the writing system encodes meaning rather than pronunciation.</p>
<p>Instead, I created a token for every <strong>Pinyin syllable + tone</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>zhong1</code> is one token  </li>
<li><code>zhong4</code> is a completely different token</li>
</ul>
<p>If I say the wrong tone, the model explicitly predicts the wrong token ID.</p>
<p>I also normalised the neutral tone by forcing it to be tone 5 (<code>ma5</code>). This resulted in a vocabulary of <strong>1,254 tokens</strong>, plus <code>&lt;unk&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;blank&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p>I combined the <strong>AISHELL-1</strong> and <strong>Primewords</strong> datasets (~300 hours total), augmented by SpecAugment (time/frequency masking). On 4× NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090s, training took about 8 hours. 
Instead of obsessing over loss, I mostly focused on these metrics: </p>
<ol>
<li>TER (Token Error Rate): overall accuracy.</li>
<li>Tone Accuracy: accuracy over tones 1-5.</li>
<li>Confusion Groups: errors between difficult initial pairs like zh/ch/sh vs z/c/s.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="honey-i-shrank-the-model">Honey, I shrank the model</h2>
<p>I started with a "medium" model (~75M parameters). It worked well, but I wanted something that could run in a browser or on a phone without killing the battery.</p>
<p>So I kept shrinking it, and I was honestly surprised by how little accuracy I lost:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th># Parameters</th>
<th>TER</th>
<th>Tone accuracy</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>75M</td>
<td>4.83%</td>
<td>98.47%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>35M</td>
<td>5.16%</td>
<td>98.36%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9M</td>
<td>5.27%</td>
<td>98.29%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The 9M-parameter model was barely worse. This strongly suggests the task is <strong>data-bound, not compute-bound</strong>.</p>
<p>The FP32 model was ~37 MB. After INT8 quantisation, it shrank to ~11 MB with a negligible accuracy drop (+0.0003 TER). Small enough to load instantly via <code>onnxruntime-web</code>.</p>
<h2 id="alignment-bug-silence-ruins-everything">Alignment bug: silence ruins everything</h2>
<p>To highlight mistakes, we need forced alignment. But I hit a nasty bug with <strong>leading silence</strong>.</p>
<p>I recorded myself saying "我喜欢…" and paused for a second before speaking.
The model confidently told me my first syllable was wrong.
Confidence score: 0.0.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The alignment assigned the silent frames to <code>wo3</code>. When I averaged probabilities over that span, the overwhelming <code>&lt;blank&gt;</code> probability completely drowned out <code>wo3</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-fix">The fix</h3>
<p>I decoupled <strong>UI spans</strong> (what gets highlighted) from <strong>scoring frames</strong> (what contributes to confidence).</p>
<p>We simply ignore frames where the model is confident it’s seeing silence:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>_filter_nonblank_frames</span><span>(</span><span>span_logp</span><span>:</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>Tensor</span><span>,</span> <span>blank_id</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>thr</span><span>:</span> <span>float</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.7</span><span>):</span>
<span>    </span><span>"""</span>
<span>    Only keep frames where the probability of &lt;blank&gt; is below a threshold.</span>
<span>    If we filter everything (total silence), we fall back to scoring the whole span.</span>
<span>    """</span>
    <span>p_blank</span> <span>=</span> <span>span_logp</span><span>[:,</span> <span>blank_id</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span>()</span>
    <span>keep</span> <span>=</span> <span>p_blank</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>thr</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>keep</span><span>.</span><span>any</span><span>():</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>span_logp</span><span>[</span><span>keep</span><span>]</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>span_logp</span>  <span># Fallback</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This single change moved my confidence score for the first syllable from <strong>0.0 → 0.99</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I can already feel my pronunciation improving while beta testing this. It’s strict and unforgiving, exactly what I needed.</p>
<p>Native speakers, interestingly, complained that they had to over-enunciate to get marked correct. That’s likely a domain-shift issue: AISHELL is mostly read speech, while casual speech is faster and more slurred. Kids do poorly too: their pitch is higher, and they're basically absent from the training data. Adding conversational datasets like Common Voice feels like the obvious next step.</p>

                    <h3>🤔 What is PeerWeb?</h3>
                    <p>
                        PeerWeb is a revolutionary way to host and share websites using WebTorrent technology. Instead
                        of relying on centralized servers, websites are distributed across a peer-to-peer network,
                        making them censorship-resistant and always available. 🌍✨

However, they gained steam in afternoon U.S. trading as investors who piled into the metals raced to book profits. Metals were also under pressure as the dollar spiked higher, making it more expensive for foreign investors to buy gold and silver and spoiling the theory that metals would replace the greenback as the globe's reserve currency.</p><p> The <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-5"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DXY/">dollar index</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> last traded around 0.8% higher. </p><p>"This is getting crazy," said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. "Most of this is probably 'forced selling.' This has been the hottest asset for day traders and other short-term traders recently. So, there has been some leverage built up in silver. With the huge decline today, the margin calls went out."</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>Trump picks Warsh</h2><div><p>National Economic Council Director&nbsp;Kevin Hassett had been the favorite to replace Powell for some time, but Warsh became the front-runner in prediction markets in recent days. </p><p>In a note on Friday morning, Evercore ISI's Krishna Guha said the market was "trading Warsh hawkish."</p><p>"The Warsh pick should help stabilize the dollar some and reduce (though not eliminate) the asymmetric risk of deep extended dollar weakness by challenging debasement trades – which is also why gold and silver are sharply lower," the firm's vice chairman said.</p><p>"But, we advise against overdoing the Warsh hawkish trade across asset markets – and even see some risk of a whipsaw. We see Warsh as a pragmatist not an ideological hawk in the tradition of the independent conservative central banker."</p><p>Claudio Wewel, FX strategist at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, told CNBC's "<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-europe/">Squawk Box Europe</a>" on Friday that a "perfect storm" of geopolitical tensions had helped precious metals move higher this year, pointing to the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Washington's threats to use military force in Greenland and Iran.</p><p>More recently, he said, speculation over who would be nominated as the next Fed chair had been influencing metals markets. </p><p>"The market has clearly been pricing the risk of a much more dovish contender, that's been largely helping the gold price along with other precious metal prices. Over the last 24 hours, the news flow has changed a little bit," Wewel said, prior to Trump's announcement. </p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>'Even good assets can sell-off'</h2><div><p>Gold and silver both enjoyed record-smashing rallies in 2025, surging 66% and 135%, respectively, over the course of the year.</p><p><span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-7"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CDE/">Coeur Mining</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> lost 17%. Silver ETFs were dragged into the action, with the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AGQ?qsearchterm=proshares%20ultra%20silv">ProShares Ultra Silver</a> fund last seen more than 62% lower. The <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-9"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SLV/">iShares Silver Trust</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> ETF lost 31%. Both funds were headed for their worst days on record. </p><p>Precious metals have been on a stellar rally over the past 12 months, amid broader market volatility, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/us-dollar-usd-greenback-dxy-sell-america-bear-market-bubble.html">decline</a> of the U.S. dollar, bubbling geopolitical tensions and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/12/fed-chair-powell-investigation.html">concerns</a> about the independence of the Federal Reserve. </p><p>Katy Stoves, investment manager at British wealth management firm Mattioli Woods, told CNBC on Friday morning that the moves were likely "a market-wide reassessment of concentration risk."</p><p>&nbsp;"Just as tech stocks — particularly AI-related names — have dominated market attention and capital flows, gold has similarly seen intense positioning and crowding," she said. "When everyone is leaning the same way, even good assets can sell off as positions get unwound. The parallel isn't accidental: both represent areas where capital has flooded in based on powerful narratives, and concentrated positions eventually face their day of reckoning."</p><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;Toni Meadows, head of investment at BRI Wealth Management, contended that gold's run to the $5,000 mark had happened "too easily." He noted that the unwinding of the greenback had supported gold prices, but that the dollar had appeared to stabilize. </p><p>"Central bank buying has driven the longer-term rally but this has tailed off in recent months," he said. "The case for further reserve diversification is still there though as Trump's trade policies and intervention in foreign affairs will make a lot of countries nervous about holding U.S. assets, especially those countries in the emerging markets or aligned to China or Russia. Silver will mirror the direction of gold, so it is not surprising to see falls there."</p></div></div></div>]]></description>
