<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>You asked for it. A lot.</p>

<p>So we built it: our Claude Code integration is now available in public beta, running natively in Zed through our new <a href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/">Agent Client Protocol (ACP)</a>.</p>
<p>For months, developers have been asking us to bring Claude Code into Zed. We didn’t just want to bolt on a one-off integration; we wanted to build something better. ACP is our new open standard that lets any agent connect to Zed (and other editors, too). Claude Code is a perfect example of what’s possible.</p>
<p>Now you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run Claude Code as a first-class citizen</strong> in Zed's high-performance editor, not just a terminal interface</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://zed.dev/docs/ai/agent-panel#following-the-agent">Follow along</a> in real-time</strong> as it edits across multiple files, with full syntax highlighting and language server support</li>
<li><strong>Review and approve granular changes</strong> in a <a href="https://zed.dev/docs/multibuffers">multibuffer</a> - accept or reject individual code hunks</li>
<li><strong>Keep Claude Code's task list anchored</strong> in your sidebar, so you always see what the agent is working on</li>
<li><strong>Define custom workflows</strong> with <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands#custom-slash-commands">Claude Code's custom slash commands</a> for your most common development tasks</li>
</ul>

<p>Claude Code has gained broad popularity among developers thanks to its powerful code generation and finely tuned tools. While the command-line interface is powerful, when Claude Code is making changes across multiple files or refactoring complex logic, you may want to see the bigger picture and have more control on what code you accept or reject. With Zed, you get the best of both worlds: Claude Code's intelligence, freed from the terminal and deeply integrated into a highly performant editor.</p>
<p>You can now run Claude Code directly in Zed and use it side-by-side with Zed's first-party agent, Gemini CLI, and any other ACP-compatible agent. Make sure you’re on <a href="https://zed.dev/releases/stable">the latest version of Zed</a> and find your available agents in the Plus menu in the Agent Panel.</p>
<h2 id="built-with-acp"><a href="#built-with-acp" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Built with ACP</span></a></h2>
<p>Rather than creating a tightly-coupled integration specific to Claude Code, we built this integration using the <a href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/">Agent Client Protocol</a>. We <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/bring-your-own-agent-to-zed">launched ACP</a> as our open standard for connecting any AI agent with any compatible editor.</p>
<p>We built an adapter that wraps Claude Code's SDK and translates its interactions into ACP's JSON RPC format. This adapter bridges between Claude Code and ACP's standardized interface, allowing Claude Code to run as an independent process while Zed provides the user interface.</p>
<p>We are open sourcing the Claude Code adapter under the Apache license, making it freely available for any editor that’s adopted ACP to use; you can find <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/claude-code-acp">the source code here</a>. Since the popular <a href="https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim">CodeCompanion plugin</a> for Neovim has already adopted ACP, Claude Code will <em>also</em> be available in Neovim.</p>
<p>We want to thank <a href="https://github.com/Xuanwo">GitHub user Xuanwo</a> for all his work since the ACP launch in building an ACP implementation for Claude Code - your speed to solution inspired us to work hard to keep up! We appreciate you for your contribution to the protocol's adoption. Give him a follow on <a href="https://github.com/Xuanwo">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://x.com/OnlyXuanwo">Twitter/X</a>.</p>

<p>We want every agent usable in Zed. Gemini CLI and Claude Code are a great start, and we have more on the way, but there are new agents released every week and many great existing ones not yet speaking the protocol. ACP makes it simple to bring any agent into Zed's, Neovim's, or any other ACP-adapted editor's interface!</p>
<p>This beta delivers as much core Claude Code functionality as possible via the SDK. We're adding features like Plan mode in the coming days, and more advanced capabilities as Anthropic expands SDK support; for example, many built-in slash commands are not yet supported by the SDK. From here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building an agent?</strong> We want to help you integrate with Zed - <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed">reach out</a> with questions.</li>
<li><strong>Want more Claude Code features?</strong> Join us in asking Anthropic to bring the SDK to parity with Claude Code or <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6686">adopt ACP directly</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Ready to contribute?</strong> Contribute <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol">to or discuss ACP</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/claude-code-acp">the Claude Code adapter</a> repos.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're always looking for <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol">feedback on ACP</a>, and welcome contributions from other agent (and client) builders. The more agents that work in Zed, the more choice you have as a developer.</p><hr><div><h3 id="looking-for-a-better-editor">Looking for a better editor?</h3>

I managed to break the washing machine door's closing mechanism some time in 2006, so for a few weeks, whenever we did the washing, we had to lean a chair against the door so it wouldn't open. At the time, we were both students and living on a small budget.</p><p>Eventually, later in the same year, we bought an Electrolux machine that has accompanied us ever since. First on our move to Hamburg, then there through three apartments, and finally back to Spain, where we live now in the Catalonian countryside. Anyway, the washing machine had a motor damage last week, so after almost 20 years, it was time for a new one. I ordered it online (another Electrolux, <em>without</em> Internet nor WiFi), it was delivered swiftly, and I installed it hopefully correctly.</p><p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-368.avif 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-700.avif 700w" sizes="auto"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-368.webp 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-700.webp 700w" sizes="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-368.png" alt="Our new Electrolux washing machine." width="700" height="700" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-368.png 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-700.png 700w" sizes="auto"></picture></p><p>The washing machine came with a voluntary 10 year warranty if you registered it. The brochure where this offer was announced featured a free telephone number and a QR code that pointed at the number (in plain text, not making use of the <code>tel:</code> protocol). I called the number, and to my <em>absolute surprise</em> there were currently more callers than usual. After about 20 minutes, I had an agent on the phone, but after saying what I wanted, they just hung up on me (or the connection cut, whatever). Fine, I called again, but now, the call center was over capacity and they didn't even let me enter in the wait loop.</p><p>They did offer to send me a link to a chat service on their website via SMS, though, so I went for that option. The SMS literally pointed me at something like <code>https://www.</code> broken up by a space and then <code>example.com/gc/</code>. When I clicked the linkified <code>example.com/gc/</code>, I ended up on a broken site whose certificate wasn't trusted. After fixing the link manually and prepending the <code>https://www.</code> part, the page didn't load.</p><p>At this point I was close to giving up, but I had one last card that I wanted to play: I searched Google for "electrolux warranty register", and it pointed me at a site <code>https://www.example.com/mypages/register-a-product/</code> as the first result. This looked promising. The <code>mypages</code> already suggested that this was gated behind a login, so I created an account, which was painless. (Turns out, after having an account and being logged in, the chat URL also worked—what an oversight on their part.) On the page, they had a field where you could enter the washing machine's product number from the identification plate on the door of the washing machine, together with helpful information where to find the data.</p><p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-368.avif 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-736.avif 736w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-1459.avif 1459w" sizes="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-368.webp" alt="Annotated Electrolux identification plate." width="1459" height="468" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-368.webp 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-736.webp 736w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-1459.webp 1459w" sizes="auto"></picture></p><p>But even better, they offered a service where you could just upload a picture of the identification plate, and some AI on their server then extracted the product number and let you register the product with two clicks. What a fantastic experience compared to the crappy (and likely for the operator way more expensive) call center experience.</p><p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-368.avif 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-736.avif 736w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-4080.avif 4080w" sizes="auto"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-368.webp 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-736.webp 736w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-4080.webp 4080w" sizes="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-368.jpeg" alt="Electrolux identification plate cell phone photo." width="4080" height="3072" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-368.jpeg 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-736.jpeg 736w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-4080.jpeg 4080w" sizes="auto"></picture></p><p>Why they didn't just put this URL on the brochure and the QR code is beyond me. As the title suggests: <strong>For all that's holy, can you just leverage the Web, please?</strong> Don't make me talk to people! They could still offer to register the machine by telephone as an alternative, but in 2025, the default for such things should just be the Web.</p><h2 id="bonus" tabindex="-1">Bonus </h2><p>Since I work on <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in">built-in AI</a> as my day job in the Chrome team at Google, I could not <em>not</em> notice this <em>"extract the product number from this identification plate"</em> use case for client-side AI. I coded up a quick <a href="https://tomayac.github.io/blogccasion-demos/built-in-ai-product-number-ocr/">demo</a> using the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/prompt-api">Prompt API</a> embedded below that shows this in action. Here's a quick walkthrough of the code:</p><ol><li>Create a session with the <code>LanguageModel</code>, informing the user of download progress if the model needs to be downloaded, and telling the model about the to-be-expected inputs (English texts and images) and outputs (English texts). In the system prompt, I tell the model what its overall task is (identify product numbers from photos of identification plates).</li><li>Prompt the model using the <code>promptStreaming()</code> method with a multimodal prompt, one textual and one image. The Prompt API supports <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/structured-output-for-prompt-api?hl=en">structured output</a> in the form of a JSON Schema or regular expression. Product numbers have nine digits, so I pass the regular expression <code>/\d{9}/</code> as the <code>responseConstraint</code> option.</li><li>Iterate over the chunks of the response. Since I'm just expecting nine digits, this is probably a bit overkill, but, hey…</li><li>(Not shown) On the server, verify that the recognized product number actually exist. Companies typically have some sort of verification rules like checksums, or washing machine product numbers always start with <code>91</code> or something. If you know those rules, you can of course make them part of the <code>responseConstraint</code>, but you always need to verify untrusted user input (which the output of an LLM counts as) on the server.</li></ol><pre><code><span>const</span> session <span>=</span> <span>await</span> LanguageModel<span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>By<strong> <a href="https://x.com/NicHulscher">Nicolas Hulscher, MPH</a></strong></p>
<p>A new MIT study titled, <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872" rel="noopener">Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task</a>,</strong> has found that using ChatGPT to help write essays leads to long-term cognitive harm—measurable through EEG brain scans. Students who repeatedly relied on ChatGPT showed <strong>weakened neural connectivity, impaired memory recall, and diminished sense of ownership</strong> <strong>over their own writing</strong>. While the AI-generated content often scored well, the brains behind it were shutting down.</p>

<p>The findings are clear: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Grok don’t just help students write—they train the brain to disengage. Here’s what the researchers found:</p>

<h4><strong>Brain Connectivity Declines with AI Use</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>EEG scans revealed a systematic scaling down of neural connectivity in the brain with increasing reliance on external tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Brain-only group:</strong> strongest, most widespread connectivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search Engine group:</strong> intermediate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LLM group:</strong> weakest connectivity across alpha, beta, delta, and theta bands.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>LLM use resulted in under-engagement of critical attention and visual processing networks, especially in Session 4 when participants tried to write without AI.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>LLM Users Forget What They Just Wrote</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In post-task interviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>83.3% of LLM users were unable to quote even one sentence from the essay they had just written.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In contrast, 88.9% of Search and Brain-only users <em>could</em> quote accurately.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>0% of LLM users could produce a <em>correct quote</em>, while most Brain-only and Search users could.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>AI Use Disrupts Memory and Learning Pathways</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Participants previously using LLMs (then writing without it in Session 4) showed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Weaker memory recall</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower alpha and beta neural engagement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signs of <em>cognitive adaptation</em> toward passivity and “efficiency” at the cost of effortful learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>LLM Users Felt Detached From Their Work</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When asked about authorship:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>LLM users gave responses like “50/50” or “70% mine.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some claimed no ownership at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brain-only group participants almost universally reported full ownership.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Switching from LLM to Brain Use Doesn’t Fully Restore Function</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Session 4: LLM-to-Brain participants showed lingering cognitive deficiency, failing to return to their original (Session 1) brain activity patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their neural activity remained below baseline, even after AI use was stopped.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Search Engine Users Showed Healthier Brain Engagement</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Search users maintained stronger executive function, memory activation, and quote recall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EEG data showed more robust occipital and parietal activation supporting visual processing and cognitive effort.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>AI Dependency Leads to “Cognitive Offloading”</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Researchers noted a trend toward neural efficiency adaptation: the brain essentially “lets go” of the effort required for synthesis and memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This adaptation led to passivity, minimal editing, and low integration of concepts.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Short-Term Gains, Long-Term Cognitive Debt</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Despite receiving decent scores from judges, the LLM group’s writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lacked strategic integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Used fewer diverse structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was shorter and more robotic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over time, the group showed a <strong>consistent decline in engagement, performance, and self-reported satisfaction</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on this study, as more of the global population begins to rely on artificial intelligence to complete complex tasks, our cognitive abilities and creative capacities appear poised to take a nosedive into oblivion.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: if you currently use AI, take regular breaks—and give your own mind the chance to do the work. Otherwise, you may face severe cognitive harm and dependence.</p>
<p>The machines aren’t just taking over our work—they’re taking over our minds.</p>

<p dir="auto">We introduce HunyuanWorld-Voyager, a novel video diffusion framework that generates world-consistent 3D point-cloud sequences from a single image with user-defined camera path. Voyager can generate 3D-consistent scene videos for world exploration following custom camera trajectories. It can also generate aligned depth and RGB video for efficient and direct 3D reconstruction.</p>

<p dir="auto">Voyager consists of two key components:</p>
<p dir="auto">(1) World-Consistent Video Diffusion: A unified architecture that jointly generates aligned RGB and depth video sequences, conditioned on existing world observation to ensure global coherence.</p>
<p dir="auto">(2) Long-Range World Exploration: An efficient world cache with point culling and an auto-regressive inference with smooth video sampling for iterative scene extension with context-aware consistency.</p>
<p dir="auto">To train Voyager, we propose a scalable data engine, i.e., a video reconstruction pipeline that automates camera pose estimation and metric depth prediction for arbitrary videos, enabling large-scale, diverse training data curation without manual 3D annotations.

      <p>
        VibeVoice is a novel framework designed for generating <b>expressive, long-form, multi-speaker </b>conversational audio, such as podcasts, from text. It addresses significant challenges in traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, particularly in scalability, speaker consistency, and natural turn-taking.
A core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of 7.5 Hz. These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. VibeVoice employs a next-token diffusion framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details.
The model can synthesize speech up to 90 minutes long with up to 4 distinct speakers, surpassing the typical 1-2 speaker limits of many prior models.

                <p>In April 2009, a Sega fan decided to look into emulating the Mega LD, a quirky and little-known hybrid of Genesis and LaserDisc. This week he finished the job.</p>

            <p>Hey there <em><strong>ROM</strong></em> readers! I've got an absolute whopper of a story this issue with a genuine longform dive into the emulation of the LaserActive, <em>plus</em> a bit of backstory on the new fan translation of the Cowboy Bebop game for PS2, <em>plus</em> your usual quick hits on emulator improvements, FPGA happenings and other fan translation progress. That means there's absolutely no more time or space to waste on this intro.</p><p>LET'S GET TO IT.</p><hr><h2 id="the-big-two">The Big Two</h2><h3 id="1-the-laseractive-might-be-the-last-vintage-home-console-of-note-which-hadnt-been-emulated-but-no-longer">1. The LaserActive "might be the last vintage home console of note which hadn't been emulated," but no longer</h3><figure><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/pioneer-laseractive-header.jpg" alt="Ad scan via @VGArtAndTidbits" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="400" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/pioneer-laseractive-header.jpg 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/pioneer-laseractive-header.jpg 1000w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/pioneer-laseractive-header.jpg 1600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/pioneer-laseractive-header.jpg 2372w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The story behind the birth of any new emulator has some common ingredients. Fearsome programming skills; hundreds or thousands of hours of thankless work; the drive to understand <em>exactly</em> how and why a piece of technology works. None of these things come without patience. But lifelong Sega fan Nemesis, who released <a href="https://ares-emu.net/news/ares-v146-released?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">the first-ever emulator</a> for the Pioneer LaserActive this week — 16 <em>years </em>after first pondering the idea — had no choice but to be patient. Because for most of the last decade, emulating the LaserActive was simply impossible.</p><p>"All along the way, the video made things difficult," he says. "The hardware to capture the signal properly didn’t exist. The software to decode the captured signal properly didn’t exist. And finally, a format to store the decoded video in a form suitable for emulation, also didn’t exist."</p><p>There's no other game console quite like the Pioneer LaserActive, which was released in 1993, sold abysmally and was dead in the ground by 1996. That's not a unique story for a '90s game system, but the LaserActive kinda... wasn't one. It was a LaserDisc player with an expansion bay that owners could slot different modules into. One transformed the LaserActive into a karaoke machine. Another would give it the guts of a PC Engine. And a third added the brains of a Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, able to play Sega CD games as well as about two dozen made for the short-lived Mega LD.</p><p>The Mega LD format represented a technological leap over early LaserDisc-based arcade games like Dragon's Lair. The mid-'90s promise of FULL MOTION VIDEO GAMEPLAY may be quaint as hell today, but it's the reason the LaserActive has been impossible to emulate for 30 years. And it still would be today, if Nemesis hadn't spent much of the 21st century proactively collecting Sega hardware and Mega LD games with the goal of one day preserving them. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WQvkTN3Vvlc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The LaserActive: Wonders of the Retro Gaming World"></iframe></figure><p>Nemesis's history with both games and emulation started with the Genesis (which I will refer to as the Mega Drive for the rest of this issue, out of respect for his native Australia). After owning a Mega Drive, 32X and Mega CD growing up, he played his first emulator, the Nesticle successor Genecyst, on a Pentium 133 circa 1997. That eventually led to contributing to reverse-engineering and emulation efforts.</p><p>"I did a lot of work on the YM2612 FM chip in the Mega Drive back in 2008 in particular, and a lot of Mega Drive emulators finally had decent FM sound after that as a result," he says. "Sharing that research, seeing the results made use of, and finally hearing the games I remembered from my childhood sound right for the first time, was a really good feeling."</p><p>In 2004, when buying loads of retro consoles was not yet a universal pasttime for nostalgic millenials and Gen Xers, he paid about $200 for one of the approximately 10,000 LaserActives that Pioneer manufactured in its short life, along with the Mega LD "PAC" module. Throughout the rest of the decade he scooped up every bit of Sega hardware he could get his hands on with an eye towards future reverse-engineering projects, but it wasn't until 2009 when he started thinking: <em>Why isn't there an emulator for the LaserActive?</em></p><p>So he did what any retro game fan would do in 2009: started a forum thread about it.</p><p>"This system keeps popping into my mind," he wrote in the thread, which is <a href="https://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=563&amp;ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">still online today</a>. "I don't think anyone's had a serious crack at emulating it yet, and I really don't think it would be very hard to do."</p><p>Well. About that.</p><p>"I honestly feel like I've nearly 'solved' this system half a dozen times over by now," Nemesis says here in 2025.</p><p>"The <em>digital</em> side of the system was actually pretty straightforward. When you break it down, the LaserActive is really more like a big oversized add-on to the console hardware. What that add-on provides is a different drive control interface, another audio source, and another video source, with mixing features to combine that video/audio with the console video/audio. That's really about it. On paper, it's pretty simple. In reality though, the LaserActive hardware did present a lot of challenges, mostly due to its inherent unreliability."</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-2.jpg" width="1800" height="2400" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-2.jpg 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-2.jpg 1000w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-2.jpg 1600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-2.jpg 1800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-6.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-6.jpg 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-6.jpg 1000w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-6.jpg 1600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-6.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>1:</strong></b><span> "Some of the internal mods to the player.

But the problem started to pile up immediately. First there were the almost 100 capacitors in the Sega PAC that were guaranteed to fail at some point, causing many to have to be replaced on even a mint condition system. Pioneer's cost-cutting inside the LaserDisc player caused other parts to break, too. Learning to fix the LaserActive was a necessary step to figuring out how it worked.</p><p>2011 was a year of progress. Nemesis: </p><ul><li>Coded a program to load onto a Mega Drive flash cart that allowed him to "probe" the LaserActive hardware</li><li>Disassembled the system BIOS to identify that "ll the interaction with the LaserActive hardware happened over a custom register block"</li><li>Coded another program that allowed direct read/write access to those registers using a controller</li><li>With the help of other forumites, mapped most of the registers by comparing the system's actions to the code in the disassembldd BIOS and documented what it was doing</li></ul><p>The next two years were focused on figuring out how to rip the LaserActive's games. This involved writing multiple more custom programs and using a special <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521053653/http://krikzz.com/link-unit.html" rel="noreferrer">USB-to-MD link cable</a> to copy the digital data from the disc, which contained the game code as well as audio tracks. When that didn't prove to be enough to capture the TOC (or table of contents) data that essentially acted as a guide to how all the data on the disc was organized, he had to go deeper.</p><p>"I soldered a bunch of physical tapping wires into my Sega PAC-S10 module, and used a Saleae logic analyzer clone to do a streaming capture of the data lines when the TOC region was being read, which the hardware didn't make directly available. I wrote a program to parse the bus trace and extract the data from the raw capture and reconstruct the lead-in. At this point, I had everything I needed to rip a full bin/cue image of the digital data from a LaserDisc."</p><p>In 2014, Nemesis started soliciting other members of the forum where he chronicled the project to send him Mega LD games to dump (shout out to doc eggfan, who acquired most of the library including two Myst prototypes; "if he hadn't done that, there's a good chance they would have been lost forever). With a pile of games in hand, he bought a PC video capture card to rip the audio and video from the discs. And this is where the 2-3 people reading this who have an intimate understanding of the LaserActive will probably reflexively say "uh oh."</p><p>LaserDisc, despite looking like a jumbo DVD, is an analog video medium. No big deal if you're just capturing a movie. But for a <em>game</em>? Big big deal. Here's the long-form breakdown — skip ahead if you don't want to get <em>way</em> deep into analog-to-digital misery.</p><blockquote>"No analog capture cards of the day were actually up to the task of what we were trying to do. ... The LaserActive has one of the fastest, most powerful control systems for LaserDisc playback ever made, and the game has direct, immediate control over it. Rarely is the player just playing back a video normally. Games will often have completely different video footage per field, with only one shown, or skip over every second frame, to mix four or more video streams in the same area of the disc. Many games use this for seamless 'branching' such as whether you go left or right, and this can change constantly and seamlessly during playback. The unit can play faster or slower, even playing in reverse, such as in Rocket Coaster as you speed up, or slide backwards down a slope. The unit can perform rapid nearly instant seeks with seamless looping, and does for games like Myst. In fact, the entire Myst title is basically using the LaserDisc as a set of random, short transitions, and still images, and other titles do this as well to differing degrees. ...<p>Games used the skip play features to further interleave different video streams at half the framerate between each other. Analog capture cards of the day didn't deal with this well. None of them could compress lossless video, everything was encoded to lossy formats. Most of them would assume a 480i image. This would cause the separate video streams in each field to 'bleed into' each other, destroying the image. The same problem occurred between frames when they had separate video streams interleaved together, where inter-frame compression would cause artifacts from the two streams to bleed together.</p><p>A high end Canopus capture card I had was the only one that was capable of compressing into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffyuv?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">huffyuv</a>, not in a lossless form, but at least in a format that prevented this bleeding problem. Unfortunately, this card still had a limitation, in that it couldn't capture the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_blanking_interval?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">VBI</a> data. It was common in the day for special 'control codes' to be encoded into lines normally hidden on a normal TV, which contained information. In the case of LaserDiscs, it contained frame numbers, timecodes, picture stop codes, video TOC information in the lead-in, and other such data. None of that could be captured by capture cards of the day. For cards that had VBI capture features, they didn't work on LaserDiscs, since LaserDiscs used different lines/formats than other sources, and no capture cards in the world expected to be capturing LaserDisc video.</p><p>At this point, I felt like I'd hit a bit of a dead end. It could, perhaps, have been possible to cobble something together at this point in 2014, but I felt the result would be poor, and the discs would not have been properly preserved. I decided a different approach was needed for the analog video content, but the technology to do what I needed to do at this point, didn't seem to exist."</p></blockquote><p>With an increasingly busy home life thanks to two young kids, a long commute and demanding workload at the office, Nemesis did the only thing that made sense at that point. He put the LaserActive on the shelf.</p><p>Two years later, he took another stab at it by trying to build his own hardware capture setup. By tapping into the LaserActive directly, he was able to capture a full, raw composite video signal — but it was useless unless he could decode it. Back on the shelf it went for another two years.</p><p>A house move, shorter commute and more balanced work-life, er, balance, later, Nemesis decided to dust off the LaserActive. Enter the Domesday Duplicator — an open source, community-driven hardware project dedicated to ripping LaserDiscs.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QDlbwl3f39Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Domesday Duplicator - Ultimate LaserDisc Preservation"></iframe></figure><p><em>Surely</em> this was the capture solution he'd been waiting for. Turns out it was... but not in 2018. A key companion to the Domesday Duplicator, <a href="https://www.readonlymemo.com/playdate-crankboy-emulator-interview/" rel="noreferrer">ld-decode</a>, was then still "in its infancy." At the time there was no publicly available software solution to decoding composite video; by the time computers were fast enough to do it without dedicated hardware, analog was donezo. Nemesis went down the path of trying to write his own decoder to mixed results, but when he found out kid #4 was on the way, he decided to wait for the broader community effort to mature.</p><p>And it did mature by a <em>lot, </em>with both the Duplicator and ld-decode improving process of ripping LaserDiscs in the higest possible quality. But there was still a problem when it came to LaserActive discs — they were interactive games, not static films. In 2020 Nemesis started chipping in to ld-decode:</p><blockquote>"I started pushing for the need to add extra features into the decode process. Until then, focus had been entirely around the requirements of capturing movies on LaserDiscs, as you'd expect. LaserActive games needed more though. I needed a way to capture the full lead-in, which stored the TOC data for both the analog video and the digital data. If you're just ripping a LaserDisc to an mp4, you don't need this info, but we do for emulation. I also needed the full 525 lines of NTSC video, with VBI data. That was stripped by ld-decode, they just cared about the visible region you'd see on a TV. I needed to deal with mixed-mode 'CD' images in the digital data track. They just needed audio tracks to work. I needed to be able to play through picture stop codes seamlessly without corrupting the audio data, they didn't need to worry about that. All kinds of things like this added up, to mean that ld-decode increasingly worked great for regular LaserDiscs, but still wasn't checking all the boxes for LaserActive games."</blockquote><p>Before he could fully commit to adding those features himself, COVID upended everything and the LaserActive went back into storage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-1.jpg 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>"This is from 2019, showing the old digital ripping process where I stream the data over the second control port."</span></figcaption></figure><p>2024: 15 years after he'd first suggested emulating the LaserActive didn't seem like it'd be <em>that</em> tricky, set up in a new house with a new workspace, Nemesis finally vowed to finish what he'd started.</p><p>It was a year of whirlwind activity: </p><ul><li>Using the LaserActive's test mode and a custom firmware mod he developed to properly capture the lead-in and lead-out from every disc</li><li>Rewriting the flaky USB capture code for the Domesday Duplicator's capture program to ensure error-free rips</li><li>Expanding the program's capabilities to record more data about the disc itself, the player, and the signal quality</li><li>Rewriting ld-decode's digital audio decoding, which had issues with drifting out of sync with the video, and finally making it possible to parse the TOC data</li><li>Improving the video decoding to output full frame data, with all 525 lines of NTSC video and the VBI data</li></ul><p>"With all these bits in place, I was now able to rip discs and extract the actual contents in a form suitable for emulation," Nemesis says. 2024 ticked over to 2025, and he began removing LaserActive games from the sleeves they'd rested within for decades undisturbed. Most of them had been bought new and never opened; for years he'd resisted the urge, not wanting to risk even a tiny accidental scratch until everything was ready.</p><p>After so many years and so many obstacles, the final mile was, at long last, an easy run:</p><blockquote>"Most of the work reverse engineering the hardware I'd already done and published notes on over 13 years prior. I sat down and implemented the emulation code according to my notes, double checking things on the hardware as I went using the same testing program I'd written all those years ago, and filling the gaps in my notes for parts I hadn't fully mapped out. Space Berserker was quickly running, and after that, as more games finished decoding most of them worked on the first try, with no issues. Since I'd set out to emulate the complete hardware, with all its quirks and unusual features, whatever a game tried to do, it should just work. A few games flushed out some things I'd missed here and there, but mostly it was just fixing bugs in my implementation, until after a few weeks, everything was fully working in the emulator, just the same way it did on the hardware."</blockquote><p>Nemesis decided to write his LaserActive emulation as a component of multi-system emualtor Ares, partially out of respect for its late creator, Near. Its existing Mega Drive support made for an easy starting point, and current Ares maintainer Luke Usher had actually done some ground work to support the Mega LD in the future by creating a "skeleton" that defined it in relation to the Mega Drive and CD.</p><p>"It was all sitting there, just needed the actual code to be written to emulate the LaserActive hardware," Nemesis says. "I'd never touched the Ares code before, but having this delivered to me is what allowed me to get the basics of drive control to have Mega CD games booting in days, from work over a few evenings. Without that, there's a good chance I wouldn't have started when I did."</p><p>There's one final wrinkle to LaserActive emulation, and that's the disc image files themselves. Basically, they're huge, in the dozens of gigabytes range. And that, again, is because the way LaserActive games utvi makes them allergic to compression. They may want to jump to specific frames in an instant, play backwards, or interleave frames, all of which means a specific moment in time needs to be a keyframe, not a compressed, modified frame that only contains the small amount of data that's changed from the frame before it, which is how video files are greatly reduced in size. You could still compress a LaserActive game to about 10GB per size with every frame preserved as a keyframe...</p><p>"That still isn’t suitable though, as heavyweight video codecs are too intensive to decode alongside emulating an entire Mega Drive + MegaCD in realtime without involving hardware decoding," Nemesis says. "In order to keep everything running at 60fps, you have to be able to do everything in under 16ms per frame. Using hardware decoding would take decoding burden off the CPU, but the video mixing with the graphics output from the Mega Drive now becomes more complex, and you also now place specific GPU requirements on any system that’s going to try and play these games."</p><p>So they stuck to a lossless format that preserves quality and takes the pressure off the CPU (and puts none at all on a graphics card). Any system that can currently run Ares should have no trouble with the LaserActive, with the caveat that you'll definitely want to have these mondo files on an SSD rather than an old spinning platter to avoid any issues with read speeds.</p><figure><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-3-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="910" height="525" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-3-1.png 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-3-1.png 910w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>"This is a fully decoded single frame of video from one of the Myst prototypes.

And it represents a milestone in game preservation that could've easily been missed — due to indifference, the literal string of inventions it took to make it a reality, or the inexorable march of time. </p><p>"There are other titles I don’t have access to at all, however I’m in discussions with a number of people who have offered to loan discs to help complete the dumping efforts," Nemesis says. "It’s been great to see people step up and offer to help. It’s vital this is done now, because Laserdisc titles don’t last forever. I have one disc in my possession that was a new, sealed copy, pressed in 1994, which is suffering from laser-rot. It’s likely that eventually, all Laserdiscs will be rendered unplayable, so we need to ensure these games are preserved now, while we still can."</p><p>He's now looking into the prospect of preserving the PC Engine PAC, which will — fingers crossed — not be too much more complicated than plugging Ares' existing PC Engine CD code into the new LaserActive code. But that's a story for another day. </p><p>For now, the emulation code being out in the wild represents <em>relief</em> most of all. "It was a long journey, with a lot of false starts and wrong turns getting to that point," Nemesis says. "A lot of it was work and time which nobody else had been able to see. I don't keep a blog. I don't tend to share the various steps I take to make something or get something working, I only tend to reach out when I have something to share or when I'm asking for help from other people.</p><p>"A lot of my time and energy had gone into this system over the years, and it was good to finally be able to show something for all that work."</p><div><p>💸</p><p><i><em>If you enjoy </em></i><i><b><strong>ROM</strong></b></i><i><em>, I'd love it if you'd consider </em></i><a href="https://www.readonlymemo.com/#/portal/support"><i><b><strong>a small tip</strong></b></i></a><i><em> to help me cover my monthly costs.

The breakthrough "not every anime is Dragon Ball Z" series was a huge hit on Cartoon Network, channeled the American jazz of Art Blakey, and even saw a then-rare theatrical run for its movie spin-off. But neither its PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 2 games ever made it out of Japan.</p><p><em>*Hard bop drum roll</em>*</p><p>...Until now! I'm delighted that translator Sonicman69, along with an anonymous hacker, has brought the PS2 beat 'em up <a href="https://github.com/SONICMAN69/Bebop-PS2-English?tab=readme-ov-file&amp;ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">Cowboy Bebop: Tsuioku no Serenade to English players</a> to celebrate the game's 20th anniversary. Regular <strong><em>ROM</em></strong> readers may remember Sonicman69's translation of a Detective Conan PlayStation 2 game <a href="https://www.readonlymemo.com/turns-out-a-lot-of-stuff-happened-20-30-years-ago-the-accidental-anniversary-issue/" rel="noreferrer">featured last year</a>, both prime examples of a period when games based on popular anime were still far from a sure thing localization-wise.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJbmZnN3Sdg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Cowboy Bebop PS2 English Patch Launch"></iframe></figure><p>Well, for Conan that may unfortunately still be the case, as I don't know if the boy-sized genius has ever really <em>made it</em> in America. But I'm pretty sure a Cowboy Bebop game released in 2025 would be targeting English-speaking audiences even before Japanese ones. As I theorized <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/exactly-20-years-after-it-was-released-exclusively-in-japan-the-cowboy-bebop-ps2-game-is-now-playable-in-english/?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">earlier this week on PC Gamer</a>, Tsuioku no Serenade's developer Bandai merging with Namco right around the time this game was being released may be the culprit — the ensuing corporate chaos of layoffs and reorganizations could easily have killed it in the cradle.</p><p>I haven't had a chance to play Tsuioku no Serenade myself despite being lucky enough to track down a (seemingly somewhat rare, now) copy, but general consensus is it's an <em>okay</em> brawler but quite a nice little Bebop sidestory with some handsome late-era PS2 graphics. And there's original Yoko Kanno music, so, like, what else do you really want?</p><p>I reached out to translator Sonicman69 for a bit of insight into the translation effort, who first watched Bebop around 2014 and learned later that the game had never been released in English. "From that exact moment I felt like I could be the one to do it," he said. "Keep in mind at this time I knew maybe three words in Japanese and was still in high school. Big expectations. I figured someone else would get around to it eventually."</p><p>But they didn't, so after off-and-on attempts to learn Japanese and gaining some translation and editing experience contributing to the Conan patch, he set sights on Bebop with the aim of finishing the patch by the game's 20th anniversary:</p><blockquote>I'd say the most challenging thing that people don't really think about is how often text would be reused at different points in the game. Trying to figure out a translation for a sentence that works in one context that also has to work in another — Conan had this a little bit but it was a lot more annoying with Bebop and frankly I don't think I nailed it. Aside from that the interstitials between scenes are poetic and I'm still a Japanese novice and have no poetic ability at all so I had a tough time at those and I think they came out kind of bad.<p>I am admittedly a little apologetic about the quality of the translation, I've received unanimous praise so far but I know I could have done better if I studied more but if I didn't translate the game now it would have never happened at all. What I'm most proud of aside from the fact we actually got it done and released it in time for the 20th anniversary? People keep telling me I did a good job writing the lines for the characters in a way that stays true to how they talked in the English dub of the show. I'm hesitant to accept that since I'm pretty critical of it myself but if I really was able to capture the characters then I did my job."</p></blockquote><p>Sonicman69 also argues that the game is "not a simple button mashing beat 'em up due to how deep the combat actually is," but some annoying tutorials and the language barrier made it easy to write off. Take it from the person who's beaten it a dozen times: it's worth playing. "As far as how well the story captures the vibe of the show I think they did a pretty admirable job, but obviously it's never going to get anywhere near the best scenes from the show. Any Bebop fan who wishes there was just a little bit more to chew on should at least enjoy the game a little bit. Especially the bonus mode you unlock after completing the game on normal but I don't want to spoil too much."</p><p>You can find the English patch <a href="https://github.com/SONICMAN69/Bebop-PS2-English?tab=readme-ov-file&amp;ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">on Github</a> and throw a few bucks to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/sonicman69?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">Sonicman69 on Ko-fi</a> if you appreciate getting to spend a little more time in the Bebopverse after all these years.</p><hr><h2 id="patching-in">Patching In</h2><figure><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2024/01/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fac94fc02-b2d1-4e35-b730-79de780d09d7_1200x200.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fac94fc02-b2d1-4e35-b730-79de780d09d7_1200x200.png 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fac94fc02-b2d1-4e35-b730-79de780d09d7_1200x200.png 1000w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2024/01/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fac94fc02-b2d1-4e35-b730-79de780d09d7_1200x200.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13142?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Sometimes emudev is all about fixing a texture issue in Colin McRae Rally 2005</strong></a> – I always try to look into random Github commits with names I don't understand to see what they're all about, and sometimes PCSX2 being update to "Handle texture shuffle with pixel reversals" is just about adding some code to ignore when a game is flipping pixels horizontally and then flipping them back again because it screwed things up.

<p>The rapid deployment of large language models (LLMs) has introduced significant security vulnerabilities due to misconfigurations and inadequate access controls. This paper presents a systematic approach to identifying publicly exposed LLM servers, focusing on instances running the Ollama framework. Utilizing Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices, we developed a Python-based tool to detect unsecured LLM endpoints. Our study uncovered over 1,100 exposed Ollama servers, with approximately 20% actively hosting models susceptible to unauthorized access. These findings highlight the urgent need for security baselines in LLM deployments and provide a practical foundation for future research into LLM threat surface monitoring.</p>



<h2 id="h-introduction">Introduction</h2>



<p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into diverse applications has surged in recent years, driven by their advanced capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. Widely adopted platforms such as ChatGPT, Grok, and DeepSeek have contributed to the mainstream visibility of LLMs, while open-source frameworks like Ollama and Hugging Face have significantly lowered the barrier to entry for deploying these models in custom environments. This has led to widespread adoption by both organizations and individuals of a broad range of tasks, including content generation, customer support, data analysis, and software development.</p>



<p>Despite their growing utility, the pace of LLM adoption has often outstripped the development and implementation of appropriate security practices. Many self-hosted or locally deployed LLM solutions are brought online without adequate hardening, frequently exposing endpoints due to default configurations, weak or absent authentication, and insufficient network isolation. These vulnerabilities are not only a byproduct of poor deployment hygiene but are also symptomatic of an ecosystem that has largely prioritized accessibility and performance over security. As a result, improperly secured LLM instances present an expanding attack surface, opening the door to risks such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unauthorized API Access</strong> — Many ML servers operate without authentication, allowing anyone to submit queries.</li>



<li><strong>Model Extraction Attacks</strong> — Attackers can reconstruct model parameters by querying an exposed ML server repeatedly.</li>



<li><strong>Jailbreaking and Content Abuse</strong> — LLMs like GPT-4, LLaMA, and Mistral can by manipulated to generate restricted content, including misinformation, malware code, or harmful outputs.</li>



<li><strong>Resource Hijacking (ML DoS Attacks)</strong> — Open AI models can be exploited for free computation, leading to excessive costs for the host.</li>



<li><strong>Backdoor Injection and Model Poisoning</strong> — Adversaries could exploit unsecured model endpoints to introduce malicious payloads or load untrusted models remotely.</li>

<p>This work investigates the prevalence and security posture of publicly accessible LLM servers, with a focus on instances utilizing the Ollama framework, which has gained popularity for its ease of use and local deployment capabilities. While Ollama enables flexible experimentation and local model execution, its deployment defaults and documentation do not explicitly emphasize security best practices, making it a compelling target for analysis.</p>



<p>To assess the real-world implications of these concerns, we leverage the Shodan search engine to identify exposed Ollama servers and evaluate their security configurations. Our investigation is guided by three primary contributions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Development of a proof-of-concept tool, written in Python, to detect exposed Ollama servers through Shodan queries</li>



<li>Analysis of identified instances evaluate authentication enforcement, endpoint exposure, and model accessibility</li>



<li>Recommendations for mitigating common vulnerabilities in LLM deployments, with a focus on practical security improvements</li>
</ul>



<p>Our findings reveal that a significant number of organizations and individuals expose their LLM infrastructure to the internet, often without realizing the implications. This creates avenues for misuse, ranging from resource exploitation to malicious prompt injection and data inference.</p>



<h2 id="h-methodology">Methodology</h2>



<p>The proposed system utilizes Shodan, a search engine that indexes internet-connected devices, to identify potentially vulnerable AI inference servers. This approach was selected with privacy and ethical considerations in mind, specifically to avoid the risks associated with directly scanning remote systems that may already be exposed or improperly secured. By relying on Shodan’s existing database of indexed endpoints, the system circumvents the need for active probing, thereby reducing the likelihood of triggering intrusion detection systems or violating acceptable use policies.</p>



<p>In addition to being more ethical, leveraging Shodan also provides a scalable and efficient mechanism for identifying LLM deployments accessible over the public internet. Manual enumeration or brute-force scanning of IP address ranges would be significantly more resource-intensive and potentially problematic from both legal and operational perspectives.</p>



<p>The system operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, Shodan is queried to identify publicly accessible Ollama servers based on distinctive network signatures or banners. In the second stage, each identified endpoint is programmatically queried to assess its security posture, with a particular focus on authentication and authorization mechanisms. This includes evaluating whether endpoints require credentials, enforce access control, or expose model metadata and functionality without restriction.</p>



<p>An overview of the system architecture is illustrated in Figure 1, which outlines the workflow from endpoint discovery to vulnerability analysis.</p>

<p>Our approach focuses on identifying deployments of popular LLM hosting tools by scanning for default ports and service banners associated with each implementation. Below we provide a list of LLM platforms examined and their associated default ports, which are used as heuristics for identification:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ollama / Mistral / LLaMA models — Port 11434</li>



<li>vLLM — Port 8000</li>



<li>llama.cpp — Ports 8000, 8080</li>



<li>LM Studio — Port 1234</li>



<li>GPT4All — Port 4891</li>



<li>LangChain — Port 8000</li>
</ul>



<p>Using the Shodan API, the system retrieves metadata for hosts operating on these ports, including IP addresses, open ports, HTTP headers, and service banners. To minimize false positives, such as unrelated applications using the same ports, the developed system performs an additional filtering step based on banner content. For example, Ollama instances are verified using keyword matching against the service banner (e.g., port:11434 “Ollama”), which increases confidence that the endpoint is associated with the targeted LLM tooling rather than an unrelated application using the same port.</p>



<p>During analysis, we identified an additional signature that enhanced the accuracy of fingerprinting Ollama deployments. Specifically, a significant proportion of the discovered Ollama instances were found to be running the Uvicorn ASGI server, a lightweight, Python-based web server commonly employed for serving asynchronous APIs. In such cases, the HTTP response headers included the field Server: “uvicorn”, which functioned as a valuable secondary indicator, particularly when the service banner lacked an explicit reference to the Ollama platform. Conversely, our research also indicates that servers running Uvicorn are more likely to host LLM applications as this Python-based web server appears to be popular among software used for self-hosting LLMs.</p>



<p>This observation strengthens the resilience of our detection methodology by enabling the inference of Ollama deployments even in the absence of direct product identifiers. Given Uvicorn’s widespread use in Python-based microservice architectures and AI inference backends, its presence, especially when correlated with known Ollama-specific ports (e.g., 11434) substantially increases the confidence level that a host is serving an LLM-related application. A layered fingerprinting approach improves the precision of our system and reduces reliance on single-point identifiers that may be obfuscated or omitted.</p>



<p>The banner-based fingerprinting method draws from established principles in network reconnaissance and is a widely accepted approach in both academic research and penetration testing contexts. According to prior work in internet-wide scanning, service banners and default ports provide a reliable mechanism for characterizing software deployments at scale, albeit with limitations in environments employing obfuscation or non-standard configurations.</p>



<p>By combining port-based filtering with banner analysis and keyword validation, our system aims to strike a balance between recall and precision in identifying genuinely exposed LLM servers, thus enabling accurate and responsible vulnerability assessment.</p>

<p>Once a potentially vulnerable Ollama server is identified, we initiate a series of automated API queries to determine whether access controls are in place and whether the server responds deterministically to standardized test inputs. This evaluation specifically assesses the presence or absence of authentication enforcement and the model’s responsiveness to benign prompt injections, thereby providing insight into the system’s exposure to unauthorized use. To minimize operational risk and ensure ethical testing standards, we employ a minimal, non-invasive prompt structure as follows:</p>



<p>A successful HTTP 200 response accompanied by the correct result (e.g., “4”) indicates that the server is accepting and executing prompts without requiring authentication. This represents a high-severity security issue, as it suggests that arbitrary, unauthenticated prompt execution is possible. In such cases, the system is exposed to a broad range of attack vectors, including the deployment and execution of unauthorized models, prompt injection attacks, and the deletion or modification of existing assets.</p>



<p>Moreover, unprotected endpoints may be subjected to automated fuzzing or adversarial testing using tools such as Promptfoo or Garak, which are designed to probe LLMs for unexpected behavior or latent vulnerabilities. These tools, when directed at unsecured instances, can systematically uncover unsafe model responses, prompt leakage, or unintended completions that may compromise the integrity or confidentiality of the system.</p>



<p>Conversely, HTTP status codes 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden) denote that access controls are at least partially enforced, often through default authentication mechanisms. While such configurations do not guarantee full protection, particularly against brute-force or misconfiguration exploits, they substantially reduce the immediate risk of casual or opportunistic exploitation. Nonetheless, even authenticated instances require scrutiny to ensure proper isolation, rate limiting, and audit logging, as part of a comprehensive security posture.</p>



<h2 id="h-findings">Findings</h2>



<p>The results from our scans confirmed the initial hypothesis: a significant number of Ollama servers are publicly exposed and vulnerable to unauthorized prompt injection. Utilizing an automated scanning tool in conjunction with Shodan, we identified 1,139 vulnerable Ollama instances. Notably, the discovery rate was highest in the initial phase of scanning, with over 1,000 instances detected within the first 10 minutes, highlighting the widespread and largely unmitigated nature of this exposure.</p>



<p>Geospatial analysis of the identified servers revealed a concentration of vulnerabilities in several major regions. As depicted in Figure 3, the majority of exposed servers were hosted in the United States (36.6%), followed by China (22.5%) and Germany (8.9%). To protect the integrity and privacy of affected entities, IP addresses have been redacted in all visual documentation of the findings.</p>






<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1640" height="1062" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/2025/09/tool_findings_exposed_llm_server.webp" alt="Tool findings on expose LLM Server analysis" data-old-src="//blogs.cisco.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/2025/09/tool_findings_exposed_llm_server.webp"><figcaption>Fig. 3: Tool findings on exposed LLM Server Analysis</figcaption></figure></div>






<p>Out of the 1,139 exposed servers, 214 were found to be actively hosting and responding to requests with live models—accounting for approximately 18.8% of the total scanned population with Mistral and LLaMA representing the most frequently encountered deployments. A review of the least common model names was also conducted, revealing what appeared to be primarily self-trained or otherwise customized LLMs. In some instances, the names alone provided enough information to identify the hosting party. To safeguard their privacy, tha names of these models have been excluded from the findings. These interactions confirm the feasibility of prompt-based interaction without authentication, and thus the risk of exploitation.</p>



<p>Conversely, the remaining 80% of detected servers, while reachable via unauthenticated interfaces, did not have any models instantiated. These “dormant” servers, though not actively serving model responses, remain susceptible to exploitation via unauthorized model uploads or configuration manipulation. Importantly, their exposed interfaces could still be leveraged in attacks involving resource exhaustion, denial of service, or lateral movement.</p>



<p>An additional observation was the widespread adoption of OpenAI-compatible API schemas across disparate model hosting platforms. Among the discovered endpoints, 88.89% adhered to the standardized route structure used by OpenAI (e.g., v1/chat/completions), enabling simplified interoperability but also creating uniformity that could be exploited by automated attack frameworks. This API-level homogeneity facilitates the rapid development and deployment of malicious tooling capable of interacting with multiple LLM providers with minimal modification.</p>



<p>These findings showcase a critical and systemic vulnerability in the deployment of LLM infrastructure. The ease with which these servers can be located, fingerprinted, and interacted with raises urgent concerns regarding operational security, access control defaults, and the potential for widespread misuse in the absence of robust authentication and model access restrictions.</p>



<h2 id="h-limitations">Limitations</h2>



<p>While the proposed system effectively identified a substantial number of exposed Ollama servers, several limitations should be acknowledged that may impact the completeness and accuracy of the results.</p>



<p>First, the detection process is inherently limited by Shodan’s scanning coverage and indexing frequency. Only servers already discovered and cataloged by Shodan can be analyzed, meaning any hosts outside its visibility, due to firewalls, opt-out policies, or geographical constraints remain undetected.</p>



<p>Secondly, the system relies on Shodan’s fingerprinting accuracy. If Ollama instances are configured with custom headers, reverse proxies, or stripped HTTP metadata, they may not be correctly classified by Shodan, leading to potential false negatives.</p>



<p>Third, the approach targets default and commonly used ports (e.g., 11434), which introduces a bias toward standard configurations. Servers running on non-standard or intentionally obfuscated ports are likely to evade detection entirely.</p>



<p>Finally, the analysis focuses exclusively on Ollama deployments and does not extend to other LLM hosting frameworks. While this specialization enhances precision within a narrow scope, it limits generalizability across the broader LLM infrastructure landscape.</p>



<h2 id="h-mitigation-strategies">Mitigation Strategies</h2>



<p>The widespread exposure of unauthenticated Ollama servers highlights the urgent need for standardized, practical, and layered mitigation strategies aimed at securing LLM infrastructure. Below, we propose a set of technical and procedural defenses, grounded in best practices and supported by existing tools and frameworks.</p>



<h3 id="h-enforce-authentication-and-access-control">Enforce Authentication and Access Control</h3>



<p>The most critical step in mitigating unauthorized access is the implementation of robust authentication mechanisms. Ollama instances, and LLM servers in general, should never be publicly exposed without requiring secure API key-based or token-based authentication. Preferably, authentication should be tied to role-based access control (RBAC) systems to limit the scope of what users can do once authenticated.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Enforce API key or <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OAuth2-based authentication</a></li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> OAuth 2.0 Framework <a href="https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OWASP API Security Top 10</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-network-segmentation-and-firewalling">Network Segmentation and Firewalling</h3>



<p>Publicly exposing inference endpoints over the internet, particularly on default ports, dramatically increases the likelihood of being indexed by services like Shodan. LLM endpoints should be deployed behind network-level access controls, such as firewalls, VPCs, or reverse proxies, and restricted to trusted IP ranges or VPNs.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Use security groups, firewalls, and private subnets to isolate LLM services</li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-best-practices/aws-security-best-practices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWS Security Best Practices</a>, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/207/final">Zero Trust Architecture</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-rate-limiting-and-abuse-detection">Rate Limiting and Abuse Detection</h3>



<p>To prevent automated abuse and model probing, inference endpoints should implement rate limiting, throttling, and logging mechanisms. This can hinder brute-force attacks, prompt injection attempts, or resource hijacking.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Integrate API gateways (e.g., Kong, Amazon API Gateway) to enforce limits and monitor anomalous behavior</li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> OWASP <a href="https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/0xa4-lack-of-resources-and-rate-limiting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rate Limiting Guide</a>, <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana for Monitoring</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-disable-default-ports-and-obfuscate-service-banners">Disable Default Ports and Obfuscate Service Banners</h3>



<p>Default ports (e.g., 11434 for Ollama) make fingerprinting trivial. To complicate scanning efforts, operators should consider changing default ports and disabling verbose service banners in HTTP responses or headers (e.g., removing “uvicorn” or “Ollama” identifiers).</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Modify default configurations to suppress identifiable metadata</li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> Nginx <a href="https://docs.nginx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reverse proxy configuration</a>, <a href="https://systemd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">systemd hardening</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-secure-model-upload-and-execution-pipelines">Secure Model Upload and Execution Pipelines</h3>



<p>Ollama and similar tools support dynamic model uploads, which, if unsecured, present a vector for model poisoning or backdoor injection. Model upload functionality should be restricted, authenticated, and ideally audited. All models should be validated against a hash or verified origin before execution.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Use content whitelisting, digital signatures, or harsh verification for uploaded models</li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/model-card-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Model Card Toolkit</a>, <a href="https://slsa.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secure Supply Chain principles</a> from SLSA</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-continuous-monitoring-and-automated-exposure-audits">Continuous Monitoring and Automated Exposure Audits</h3>



<p>Operators should implement continuous monitoring tools that alert when LLM endpoints become publicly accessible, misconfigured, or lack authentication. Scheduled Shodan queries or custom scanners can help detect regressions in deployment security.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Use automated tools like Project Discovery’s naabu, or write custom Shodan monitoring scripts</li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> <a href="https://projectdiscovery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Discovery Tools</a>, <a href="https://developer.shodan.io/api/alert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shodan Alert API</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>This study reveals a concerning landscape of insecure large language model deployments, with a particular focus on Ollama-based servers exposed to the public internet. Through the use of Shodan and a purpose-built detection tool, we identified over 1,100 unauthenticated LLM servers, a substantial proportion of which were actively hosting vulnerable models. These findings highlight a widespread neglect of fundamental security practices such as access control, authentication, and network isolation in the deployment of AI systems.</p>



<p>The uniform adoption of OpenAI-compatible APIs further exacerbates the issue, enabling attackers to scale exploit attempts across platforms with minimal adaptation. While only a subset of the exposed servers were found to be actively serving models, the broader risk posed by dormant yet accessible endpoints cannot be understated. Such infrastructure remains vulnerable to abuse through unauthorized model execution, prompt injection, and resource hijacking. Our work underscores the urgent need for standardized security baselines, automated auditing tools, and improved deployment guidance for LLM infrastructure.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, future work should explore the integration of multiple data sources, including Censys, ZoomEye, and custom Nmap-based scanners to improve discovery accuracy and reduce dependency on a single platform. Additionally, incorporating adaptive fingerprinting and active probing techniques could enhance detection capabilities in cases where servers use obfuscation or non-standard configurations. Expanding the system to identify deployments across a wider range of LLM hosting frameworks, such as Hugging Face, Triton, and vLLM, would further increase coverage and relevance. Finally, non-standard port detection and adversarial prompt analysis offer promising avenues for refining the system’s ability to detect and characterize hidden or evasive LLM deployments in real-world environments.</p>

    <p>Some memory corruption bugs are much harder to exploit than others. They can involve race conditions, crash the system, and impose limitations that make a researcher's life difficult. Working with such fragile vulnerabilities demands significant time and effort. CVE-2024-50264 in the Linux kernel is one such hard bug, which received the Pwnie Award 2025 as the Best Privilege Escalation. In this article, I introduce my personal project <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill">kernel-hack-drill</a> and show how it helped me to exploit CVE-2024-50264.</p>

<h2 id="bug-collision-story">Bug collision story</h2>

<p>I first found a bug in <code>AF_VSOCK</code> back in 2021 and published the article <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2021/02/09/CVE-2021-26708.html">Four Bytes of Power: Exploiting CVE-2021-26708 in the Linux kernel</a>. In April 2024, I was fuzzing this kernel subsystem with a customized syzkaller and found another crash in <code>AF_VSOCK</code>. I minimized the crash reproducer and disabled KASAN. This resulted in an immediate null-ptr-deref in a kernel worker (<code>kworker</code>). Convinced the path forward would be painful, I shelved the bug. This was a wrong decision.</p>

<p>Later, in autumn 2024, I decided to look at this bug again and got promising results. Then, one calm evening, I realized I'd collided with Hyunwoo Kim (<a href="https://x.com/v4bel">@v4bel</a>) and Wongi Lee (<a href="https://x.com/_qwerty_po">@qwerty</a>): they'd already disclosed the bug as CVE-2024-50264 and used it at kernelCTF. <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/vmw_vsock?id=6ca575374dd9a507cdd16dfa0e78c2e9e20bd05f">Their patch</a> turned my PoC exploit into a null-ptr-deref:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/vsock_patch.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>Anyone who has dealt with a bug collision can imagine what I felt. I was wondering whether to keep digging into this vulnerability or just give it up.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/Vityaz.jpg" width="80%"><br>Viktor Vasnetsov: Vityaz at the Crossroads (1882)</center>


<p>The <a href="https://github.com/google/security-research/pull/145/files">exploit strategy</a> by @v4bel and @qwerty looked very complicated. I had other ideas, so I decided to continue my research. I chose Ubuntu Server 24.04 with a fresh OEM/HWE kernel (v6.11) as the target for my PoC exploit.</p>

<h2 id="cve-2024-50264-analysis">CVE-2024-50264 analysis</h2>

<p>The vulnerability <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50264">CVE-2024-50264</a> was introduced in August 2016 by commit <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/vmw_vsock?id=06a8fc78367d070720af960dcecec917d3ae5f3b">06a8fc78367d</a> in Linux v4.8. It is a race condition in <code>AF_VSOCK</code> sockets that happens between the <code>connect()</code> system call and a POSIX signals, resulting in a use-after-free (UAF). An unprivileged user can trigger this bug without user namespaces, which makes it more dangerous.</p>

<p>The kernel uses a freed <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> object. Its size is 80 bytes, which is suitable for the <code>kmalloc-96</code> slab cache. The memory corruption is a UAF write executed by a kernel worker.</p>

<p>However, this vulnerability also brings a bunch of nasty limitations for exploitation. I can say that <strong>it's the worst bug to exploit I've ever seen</strong>. The Pwnie Award is well-deserved. I'll outline those constraints shortly.</p>

<h2 id="reproducing-the-bug-using-an-immortal-signal">Reproducing the bug using an "immortal signal"</h2>

<p>First, an attacker should create a listening virtual socket (server vsock):</p>
<div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>int</span> <span>vsock1</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>vsock1</span> <span>=</span> <span>socket</span><span>(</span><span>AF_VSOCK</span><span>,</span> <span>SOCK_STREAM</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>vsock1</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] creating vsock"</span><span>);</span>

	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] binding vsock"</span><span>);</span>

<span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>vsock1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span> <span>/* backlog = 0 */</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>ret</span> <span>!=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] listening vsock"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then the attacker should try to open a connection from a client vsock:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>#define UAF_PORT 0x2712
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>vsock2</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

	<span>.</span><span>svm_cid</span> <span>=</span> <span>VMADDR_CID_LOCAL</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>vsock2</span> <span>=</span> <span>socket</span><span>(</span><span>AF_VSOCK</span><span>,</span> <span>SOCK_STREAM</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>

	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] creating vsock"</span><span>);</span>

<span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>vsock2</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>sockaddr</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>addr</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>sockaddr_vm</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To trigger the bug, the attacker should interrupt this <code>connect()</code> system call with a POSIX signal. @v4bel &amp; @qwerty used <code>SIGKILL</code>, but that kills the exploit process. My fuzzer stumbled on a cleaner trick that surprised me:</p>

<p>My fuzzer discovered that a timer can fire signal 33 and interrupt <code>connect()</code>. Signal 33 is special. The Native POSIX Threads Library (NPTL) keeps it for internal work and the operating system quietly shields applications from it. As <code>man 7 nptl</code> explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NPTL makes internal use of the first two real-time signals (signal numbers 32 and 33).
One of these signals is used to support thread cancellation and POSIX timers (see <code>timer_create(2)</code>);
the other is used as part of a mechanism that ensures all threads in a process always have
the same UIDs and GIDs, as required by POSIX. These signals cannot be used in applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, these signals cannot be used in applications, but they are perfect for my exploit 😉</p>

<p>I use <code>timer_settime()</code> for <code>race_timer</code>, which lets me choose the exact moment signal 33 interrupts <code>connect()</code>. Moreover, the signal is invisible to the exploit process and doesn't kill it.</p>

<p>The race condition succeeds when a signal interrupts the <code>connect()</code> system call while the vulnerable socket is in the <code>TCP_ESTABLISHED</code> state.

<p>The field <code>virtio_vsock_sock.peer_fwd_cnt</code> tracks how many bytes have been pushed through vsock using <code>sendmsg()</code>/<code>recvmsg()</code>. It is zero by default (four zero bytes).</p>

<h2 id="not-so-fast-cve-2024-50264-has-limitations">Not so fast. CVE-2024-50264 has limitations</h2>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, this vulnerability has a lot of nasty limitations for the exploitation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> client object is allocated together with the server object from the same slab cache. That disturbs cross-cache attacks.</li>
  <li>Reproducing this race condition is very unstable.</li>
  <li>The UAF write occurs in a kworker a few microseconds after <code>kfree()</code>, too quickly for typical cross-cache attacks.</li>
  <li>A null-ptr-deref in the kworker follows the UAF write. That's why I shelved the bug at first.</li>
  <li>Even if that kernel oops is avoided, another null-ptr-deref occurs in the kworker after <code>VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT</code> (eight seconds).</li>
  <li>The kworker hangs in <code>spin_lock_bh()</code> if <code>virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock</code> is not zero, as noted above.</li>
</ol>

<p>I uncovered each obstacle one by one while developing the PoC exploit for CVE-2024-50264. It remains the worst bug to exploit I've ever seen. I guess that's why it received the Pwnie Award 2025 as the Best Privilege Escalation.</p>

<p>I felt I could make the PoC exploit for CVE-2024-50264 much simpler. My first thought was to steer the UAF write into some victim object and build a useful exploit primitive around it.</p>

<p>I decided not to search victim objects inside the <code>kmalloc-96</code> slab cache. Ubuntu Server 24.04 ships with <code>kconfig</code> options that neutralize naive heap spraying for UAF exploitation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS=y</code>, which creates a set of separate slab caches for allocations with user-controlled data</li>
  <li><code>CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES=y</code>. Here's a quote from the kernel documentation about it:
    <blockquote>
      <p>It is a hardening feature that creates multiple copies of slab caches for normal kmalloc allocation and makes kmalloc randomly pick one based on code address, which makes the attackers more difficult to spray vulnerable memory objects on the heap for the purpose of exploiting memory vulnerabilities.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That's why I decided to perform the cross-cache attack anyway.</p>

<p>The first victim object I decided to try was <code>struct cred</code>. Its size is 184 bytes, and the kernel allocates these objects in slabs of size 192 bytes. That would allow only two possible offsets of the UAF in the victim <code>cred</code>, because slabs for the vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> have size 96 bytes (half of 192). The diagram below shows how two vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects overlap the <code>cred</code> object. The memory corruption may happen on one of the <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_cred2.png" width="80%"></center>


<p>Unfortunately, <code>struct cred</code> reallocated at the place of the freed <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects doesn't provide anything useful for the attacker:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the UAF happened on the first <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>, the kernel would hang in <code>spin_lock_bh()</code>, because <code>cred</code> has a non-null <code>uid</code> value at the place of <code>virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock</code>.</li>
  <li>If the UAF happened on the second <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>, writing controlled data to <code>virtio_vsock_sock.peer_buf_alloc</code> would corrupt the <code>cred.request_key_auth</code> pointer. I had no idea how to use it without a prior infoleak.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>cred</code> object didn't work for me, so I started to search for the next candidate. My next victim object for the memory corruption was <code>msg_msg</code>. I like this object: I first used it for heap spraying in 2021 (you can find the details in the article <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2021/02/09/CVE-2021-26708.html">"Four Bytes of Power: Exploiting CVE-2021-26708 in the Linux kernel"</a>).</p>

<p>It was a novel approach back then. This time, I set out to create something new again.</p>

<p>I chose a 96-byte <code>msg_msg</code> because the slab allocator would use slabs of the same size for this <code>msg_msg</code> and <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>. That would allow the UAF write to land at a fixed offset in the victim <code>msg_msg</code> object. The following diagram shows what happens with the <code>msg_msg</code> object allocated at the place of the freed <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_msg_msg.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>The <code>msg_msg.m_list.prev</code> is the kernelspace pointer to the previous object in the linked list. This pointer is zero when <code>msg_msg</code> is created (see <code>CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON</code>) and then it is initialized with a non-null value when <code>msg_msg</code> <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.15.5/source/ipc/msg.c#L941">is inserted</a> into the message queue. Unfortunately, this non-null pointer is interpreted as <code>virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock</code>. That makes the <code>virtio_transport_space_update()</code> function hang while executing <code>spin_lock_bh()</code>.</p>

<p>To bypass this restriction, I needed the kernel to initialize <code>msg_msg.m_list.prev</code> after the UAF write. I looked for a way to postpone placing <code>msg_msg</code> in the message queue and eventually found the solution.</p>

<h2 id="msg_msg-spray-allowing-m_list-field-corruption-novel-technique">msg_msg spray allowing m_list field corruption (novel technique)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>I filled the message queue almost completely before sending the target <code>msg_msg</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>The message queue size is <code>MSGMNB=16384</code> bytes.</li>
      <li>I sent 2 clogging messages of 8191 bytes each without calling the <code>msgrcv()</code> syscall.</li>
      <li>Only 2 bytes were left in the queue.</li>

<p>Cool! This technique is also useful for blind overwriting of <code>msg_msg</code> using the out-of-bounds write. No kernel infoleak is needed. The kernel restores the corrupted <code>m_list</code> pointers. In my particular case, this approach allowed me to avoid <code>virtio_transport_space_update()</code> hanging in <code>spin_lock_bh()</code>:</p>

<p>To implement the UAF write into an <code>msg_msg</code> object, I needed to perform cross-cache attack turning <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> into <code>msg_msg</code>. On Ubuntu Server 24.04, the <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects live in one of 16 <code>kmalloc-rnd-?-96</code> slab caches enabled by <code>CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES</code>. The <code>msg_msg</code> objects live in a dedicated <code>msg_msg-96</code> slab cache enabled by <code>CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS</code>.</p>

<p>To implement the cross-cache attack, I needed to learn how these attacks work on the latest Ubuntu kernel, but testing exploit primitives together with this crazy race condition was really painful. Then, I got an idea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If an unstable race condition creates problems, let's use a testing ground for developing the exploit primitives!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fun fact: when I chose the name <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> for this project, I used the word <code>drill</code> to mean <code>training</code> or <code>workout</code> for Linux kernel security. My friends and students read it differently. They thought I meant something like this:</p>

<p>The <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> project is a bit similar to <a href="https://github.com/hacktivesec/KRWX">KRWX</a>, but much simpler. Moreover, it ships with ready-made PoC exploits:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_callback.c</code>: a UAF exploit that invokes a callback inside a freed <code>drill_item_t</code> structure. It hijacks control flow and gains LPE.</li>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c</code>: a UAF exploit that writes into a freed <code>drill_item_t</code>. It uses a cross-cache attack and overwrites <code>msg_msg.m_ts</code> enabling out-of-bounds reading of the kernel memory. I wrote this PoC while working on the bug described in this article.</li>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c</code>: a UAF exploit that writes into a freed <code>drill_item_t</code>. It performs a cross-cache attack and overwrites <code>pipe_buffer.flags</code> to implement the Dirty Pipe technique and gain LPE. This PoC exploit was also developed during my experiments with CVE-2024-50264.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recent contributions added new variants (kudos to the contributors!):</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_callback_rop_smep.c</code>: an improved version of <code>drill_uaf_callback.c</code> that adds a ROP chain to bypass SMEP on <code>x86_64</code>.</li>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_w_pte.c</code>: a UAF exploit that writes to a freed <code>drill_item_t</code>. It performs a cross-allocator attack and overwrites a page table entry (PTE) to implement the Dirty Pagetable technique and gain LPE on <code>x86_64</code>.</li>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_w_pud.c</code>: an improved version of <code>__drill_uaf_w_pte.c__</code> that overwrites a page upper directory (PUD) instead of a PTE and implements the Dirty Pagetable attack via huge pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I revisited <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> during my CVE-2024-50264 work, this spare-time project hadn't seen an update in years. But now <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> offers a solid set of resources that Linux kernel security researchers can explore.</p>

<h2 id="experimenting-with-cross-cache-attack-using-kernel-hack-drill">Experimenting with cross-cache attack using kernel-hack-drill</h2>

<p>My first step was to learn how cross-cache attacks behave on the latest Ubuntu kernel with slab allocator hardening turned on.</p>

<p>I implemented a standard cross-cache attack in <code>drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c</code>. You can see <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill/blob/e3a105cde99912c89c2c1470a29101eb0d9c2d56/drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c">the full code in the repository</a>, so I'll sketch the flow here. For background, I highly recommend <a href="https://xairy.io/about">Andrey Konovalov</a>'s talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hYzxsWeNcE">SLUB Internals for Exploit Developers</a>.</p>

<p>To plan the attack, I pulled the needed info from <code>/sys/kernel/slab</code>. The slab caches that hold <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> (80 bytes) or <code>drill_item_t</code> (95 bytes) each keep 120 slabs in per-CPU partial lists (<code>cpu_partial=120</code>) and 42 objects in each slab (<code>objs_per_slab=42</code>).</p>

<p>The cross-cache attack algorithm:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Allocate <code>objs_per_slab</code> objects to create a fresh active slab. Active slab is the slab that will be used by the kernel for the next allocation.</li>
  <li>Allocate <code>objs_per_slab * cpu_partial</code> objects. This creates the <code>cpu_partial</code> number of full slabs that will later populate the partial list at step 6.</li>
  <li>Create a slab that contains the UAF object. Allocate <code>objs_per_slab</code> objects and keep a dangling reference to the vulnerable object in that slab.</li>
  <li>Create a new active slab again: allocate <code>objs_per_slab</code> objects. This step is <strong>very important</strong> for keeping the cross-cache attack stable. Otherwise, the slab with the vulnerable object remains active and cannot be reclaimed by the page allocator.</li>
  <li>Completely free the slab that holds the UAF object. To do that, free <code>(objs_per_slab * 2 - 1)</code> of the objects allocated just before the last one. The active slab now contains only the last object, and the slab with the UAF object becomes free and moves to the partial list.</li>
  <li>Fill up the partial list: free one of each <code>objs_per_slab</code> objects in the reserved slabs from step 2. That makes the slab allocator clean up the partial list and move the free slab containing the UAF object to the page allocator.</li>
  <li>Reclaim the page that contained the UAF object for another slab cache: spray the target <code>msg_msg</code> objects. As a result, one <code>msg_msg</code> is allocated where the vulnerable object (<code>drill_item_t</code> in my case) used to be.</li>
  <li>Exploit the UAF! Overwrite <code>msg_msg.m_ts</code> to read kernel memory out of bounds.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've seen plenty of publications that cover cross-cache attack, but none of them explain how to debug it. I'll fill that gap.</p>

<p>Let's examine the <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill/blob/e3a105cde99912c89c2c1470a29101eb0d9c2d56/drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c">attack</a> in <code>drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c</code>. To watch it in action and debug it, make the following tweaks in your kernel sources:</p>

<p>In <code>__put_partials()</code> I print the address of the slab that returns to the page allocator when <code>discard_slab()</code> runs. In <code>alloc_msg()</code> I print the kernel address of each newly allocated <code>msg_msg</code> object.</p>

<p>When the cross-cache attack succeeds, the slab that held <code>drill_item_t</code> objects is handed back to the page allocator and then reused for <code>msg_msg</code> objects. Running the PoC exploit <code>drill_uaf_w_msg_msg</code> makes this visible, as we observe:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the kernel log:
    <div><pre><code>[   32.719582] drill: kmalloc'ed item 5123 (0xffff88800c960660, size 95)

</code></pre></div>
  </li>
  <li>Then in GDB (using with <a href="https://github.com/bata24/gef">bata24/gef</a>):
    <div><pre><code>gef&gt; slab-contains 0xffff88800c960660

  </li>
  <li>Finally, in the kernel log:

</code></pre></div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We see the <code>drill_item_t</code> object <code>0xffff88800c960660</code> in slab <code>0xffffea0000325800</code> reallocated as <code>msg_msg</code>, which confirms that the cross-cache attack worked.</p>

<p>After experimenting with <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> on Ubuntu Server 24.04, I found that <code>CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES</code> and <code>CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS</code> block naive UAF exploitation, yet they also make cross-cache attacks absolutely stable. So, in my humble opinion:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/slab_hardening.jpg" width="60%"></center>


<p>It seems that, without a mitigation such as <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230915105933.495735-15-matteorizzo@google.com/">SLAB_VIRTUAL</a>, the Linux kernel remains wide-open to cross-cache attacks.</p>

<h2 id="adapting-the-cross-cache-attack-to-cve-2024-50264">Adapting the cross-cache attack to CVE-2024-50264</h2>

<p>As noted in the limitations, the vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> client object is allocated together with the server object (<strong>Limitation #1</strong>). That hurts the exploit for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On one hand, leaving the server vsock open stops the slab that holds the UAF object from being freed, which kills the cross-cache attack.</li>
  <li>On the other hand, closing the server vsock disturbs the UAF itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>How to deal with it? @v4bel and @qwerty used the <a href="https://github.com/IAIK/SLUBStick">SLUBStick</a> timing side channel to spot when the allocator switched to a new active slab. I went another way:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What if I hit the <code>connect()</code> syscall with a signal <strong>almost immediately</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, I used <strong>one more race condition</strong> to exploit the main race condition – and it worked:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I sent the "immortal" signal 33 to the vulnerable <code>connect()</code> syscall after a 10000 ns timeout, far earlier than the delay needed to trigger the UAF.</li>
  <li>Then I verified the early race condition:
    <ol>
      <li>The <code>connect()</code> syscall must return "Interrupted system call"</li>
      <li>Another testing client vsock should still connect to the server vsock without trouble</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I discovered that when both checks passed, only a single vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> for the client vsock was created. The interrupting signal arrived before the kernel could create the second <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> for the server vsock. This bypassed <strong>Limitation #1</strong> (paired-object creation). After that, I sent signal 33 again – this time after the normal timeout – to interrupt the vulnerable <code>connect()</code> a second time and provoke the UAF. The cross-cache attack against <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> was unlocked!</p>

<p>Looping this early race and checking its result was quick. Once the early race succeeded, the main race that triggers the UAF became more stable; I could now hit the UAF about once per second instead of once every several minutes, solving the instability noted in <strong>Limitation #2</strong>. My race condition "speedrun" also eased <strong>Limitation #5</strong>: I managed roughly five UAF writes before the kworker hit a null-ptr-deref at <code>VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT</code> (8 seconds).</p>

<p>To address <strong>Limitation #4</strong> (the immediate null-ptr-deref in the kworker after UAF), I tried one more race condition, similarly to @v4bel and @qwerty. Right after the UAF-triggering <code>connect()</code>, I called <code>listen()</code> on the vulnerable vsock. If <code>listen()</code> ran before the kworker, it changed the vsock state to <code>TCP_LISTEN</code>, preventing the crash. Unfortunately, this step remains the most unstable part of the whole exploit; the rest is far more stable.</p>

<p>At that point my list of CVE-2024-50264 limitations looked like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li><del>The vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> client object is allocated together with the server object from the same slab cache. That disturbs cross-cache attacks.</del></li>
  <li><del>Reproducing this race condition is very unstable.</del></li>
  <li><strong>The UAF write occurs in a kworker a few microseconds after <code>kfree()</code>, too quickly for typical cross-cache attacks.</strong></li>
  <li><del>A null-ptr-deref in the kworker follows the UAF write. That's why I shelved the bug at first.</del></li>
  <li><del>Even if that kernel oops is avoided, another null-ptr-deref occurs in the kworker after <code>VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT</code> (eight seconds).</del></li>
  <li><strong>The kworker hangs in <code>spin_lock_bh()</code> if <code>virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock</code> is not zero.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>With the early-signal trick in place, only two limitations were still blocking my exploit.</p>

<h2 id="oh-so-slow-the-cross-cache-attack-shows-up-late-to-the-party">Oh so slow! The cross-cache attack shows up late to the party</h2>

<p>As noted in <strong>Limitation #3</strong>, the UAF write in the kworker fires only a few μs after <code>kfree()</code> for the <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>. A cross-cache attack needs much more time, so the UAF write lands on the original <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> and never reaches the <code>msg_msg</code>.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_and_cross_cache.jpeg" width="50%"></center>


<p>I didn't know how to make cross-cache procedure faster, but I knew how to slow down the attacked kernel code instead. That approach is described in Jann Horn's article <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/03/racing-against-clock-hitting-tiny.html">Racing against the clock</a>. It allowed to make my kworker slower than a sluggish cross-cache attack.</p>

<p>The main idea is to hammer the kworker with a <code>timerfd</code> watched by a huge pile of <code>epoll</code> instances. Here is the short recipe (see <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/03/racing-against-clock-hitting-tiny.html">Jann's article</a> for full detail):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Call <code>timerfd_create(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, 0)</code>.</li>
  <li>Create 8 forks.</li>
  <li>In each fork, call <code>dup()</code> for the <code>timerfd</code> 100 times.</li>
  <li>In each fork, call <code>epoll_create()</code> 500 times.</li>
  <li>For every <code>epoll</code> instance, use <code>epoll_ctl()</code> to add all duplicated file descriptors to the interest list – each <code>epoll</code> instance now monitors all available <code>timerfd</code> copies.</li>
  <li>Finally, arm the <code>timerfd</code> so the interrupt hits the kworker at just the right moment:
    <div><pre><code><span>timerfd_settime</span><span>(</span><span>timerfd</span><span>,</span> <span>TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>retard_tmo</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This procedure made my race-condition window around 80 times longer.</p>

<p>I wanted some more time to complete the cross-cache attack with a guarantee, but ran into a limit not mentioned in the original write-up. If you exceed the limit in <code>/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches</code>, <code>epoll_ctl()</code> fails. From <code>man 7 epoll</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This specifies a limit on the total number of file descriptors that a user can register across all epoll instances on the system. The limit is per real user ID. Each registered file descriptor costs roughly 90 bytes on a 32-bit kernel, and roughly 160 bytes on a 64-bit kernel. Currently, the default value for max_user_watches is 1/25 (4%) of the available low memory, divided by the registration cost in bytes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Ubuntu Server 24.04 with 2 GiB of RAM, <code>/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches</code> is 431838, which is not huge. I could afford 8 forks × 500 <code>epoll</code> instances × 100 duplicated file descriptors, for a total of 400000 <code>epoll</code> watches.</p>

<p>That was just enough to beat <strong>Limitation #3</strong>, and I finally got <code>msg_msg</code> data size corruption: the vsock UAF changed <code>msg_msg.m_ts</code> from 48 bytes to 8192 (<code>MSGMAX</code>). Now I could do out-of-bounds reading of the kernel memory using the <code>msgrcv()</code> syscall.</p>

<h2 id="sorting-the-loot">Sorting the loot</h2>

<p>The corrupted <code>msg_msg</code> allowed me to read 8 KiB of data from the kernelspace.  I sorted this loot and found a promising infoleak: a kernel address <code>0xffffffff8233cfa0</code> [1]. This infoleak was quite stable and worked with high probability, so I decided to investigate it without doing any additional heap feng shui. GDB showed that it was a pointer to the <code>socket_file_ops()</code> kernel function. I was excited to discover that this function pointer is part of <code>struct file</code>, because the <code>file</code> kernel object also contains the <code>f_cred</code> pointer [2], which leaked as well.</p>

<p>Here's how I examined the memory leaked by <code>msg_msg</code> at <code>0xffff88800e75d600</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef&gt; p *((struct file *)(0xffff88800e75d600 + 96*26 + 64))
$61 = {
  f_count = {
    counter = 0x0
  },
  f_lock = {
    {
      rlock = {
        raw_lock = {
          {
            val = {
              counter = 0x0
            },
            {
              locked = 0x0,
              pending = 0x0
            },
            {
              locked_pending = 0x0,
              tail = 0x0
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  f_mode = 0x82e0003,
  f_op = 0xffffffff8233cfa0 &lt;socket_file_ops&gt;,    [1]
  f_mapping = 0xffff88800ee66f60,

  f_inode = 0xffff88800ee66e00,
  f_flags = 0x2,
  f_iocb_flags = 0x0,
  f_cred = 0xffff888003b7ad00,                    [2]
  f_path = {
    mnt = 0xffff8880039cec20,
    dentry = 0xffff888005b30b40
  },
  ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>As a result, my PoC exploit obtained a pointer to <code>struct cred</code>, the structure that stores the current process credentials. The last piece needed for privilege escalation was arbitrary address writing. With that, I could overwrite the exploit process credentials and become root. That would be a data-only attack with no control-flow hijack.</p>

<h2 id="in-search-of-arbitrary-address-writing-primitive">In search of arbitrary address writing primitive</h2>

<p>The most interesting and difficult part of the research began here. I was searching for a target kernel object for my UAF write, which could provide an arbitrary address writing exploit primitive. The search was exhausting. I've done the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Looked through dozens of kernel objects,</li>
  <li>Read many kernel exploit write-ups,</li>
  <li>Tried <a href="https://kernelctf-dash.storage.googleapis.com/processed/v6.1.111/index.html#!heap/*/msg_msg/64..128">Kernel Exploitation Dashboard</a> by Eduardo Vela and the KernelCTF team.</li>
</ul>

<p>One idea was to combine my limited UAF write with the Dirty Page Table attack (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250226150503/https://yanglingxi1993.github.io/dirty_pagetable/dirty_pagetable.html">well described</a> by Nicolas Wu). Tweaking page tables can let an attacker read and write data at arbitrary physical address.</p>

<p>I could combine my UAF with a cross-cache attack (or more accurately, cross-allocator attack) to modify page tables. To overwrite kernel text or heap, though, I still needed to know the physical address of the target memory. Two options came to mind:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Bruteforcing physical addresses. Not practical here: I could trigger the UAF only about five times before the kworker crashed, nowhere near enough tries.</li>
  <li>Using the KASLR infoleak from my <code>msg_msg</code> out-of-bounds read. I decided to try that.</li>
</ol>

<p>I ran a quick experiment to see how KASLR behaves on <code>X86_64</code> with <code>CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE</code> and <code>CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY</code> enabled. Booting a virtual machine several times, I compared the virtual and physical addresses of kernel <code>_text</code>.</p>

<p>VM run #1:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef&gt; ksymaddr-remote
[+] Wait for memory scan
0xffffffff98400000 T _text

gef&gt; v2p 0xffffffff98400000
Virt: 0xffffffff98400000 -&gt; Phys: 0x57400000
</code></pre></div>

<p>VM run #2:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef&gt; ksymaddr-remote
[+] Wait for memory scan
0xffffffff81800000 T _text

gef&gt; v2p 0xffffffff81800000
Virt: 0xffffffff81800000 -&gt; Phys: 0x18600000
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then I calculated the difference between the virtual and physical addresses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>VM run #1: <code>0xffffffff98400000 − 0x57400000 = 0xffffffff41000000</code></li>
  <li>VM run #2: <code>0xffffffff81800000 − 0x18600000 = 0xffffffff69200000</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Because <code>0xffffffff41000000</code> is not equal to <code>0xffffffff69200000</code>, leaking the virtual KASLR offset doesn't help against physical KASLR.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/kaslr.jpg" width="60%"></center>


<p>Thereby to perform Dirty Page Table attack, I needed a way to leak a kernel physical address. Ideally I would do this by mixing some page-allocator feng shui with my out-of-bounds read. That felt messy, and I wanted a cleaner solution.</p>

<p>I kept looking for a target kernel object for my UAF write, which could provide an arbitrary address writing and eventually focused on <code>pipe_buffer</code>.</p>

<p>When a pipe is created with the <code>pipe()</code> system call, the kernel allocates an array of <code>pipe_buffer</code> structures. Each <code>pipe_buffer</code> item in this array corresponds to a memory page that holds data written to the pipe. The diagram below shows the internals of this object:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/pipe_buffer.png" width="50%"></center>


<p>This object looked like a good UAF target. I could make a <code>pipe_buffer</code> array the same size as <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> by changing the capacity of the pipe: <code>fcntl(pipe_fd[1], F_SETPIPE_SZ, PAGE_SIZE * 2)</code>. The kernel changes the array size to <code>2 * sizeof(struct pipe_buffer) = 80 bytes</code>, exactly matching the <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> size.</p>

<p>In addition, 4 attacker-controlled bytes from the vsock UAF write at offset 24 can flip <code>pipe_buffer.flags</code>, just as in Max Kellermann's original <a href="https://dirtypipe.cm4all.com/">Dirty Pipe attack</a>.</p>

<p>The original Dirty Pipe attack doesn't even need an infoleak and grants privilege escalation with a one-shot write. Impressed, I decided to experiment with <code>pipe_buffer</code> in my <code>kernel-hack-drill</code>.</p>

<h2 id="experimenting-with-the-dirty-pipe-attack">Experimenting with the Dirty Pipe attack</h2>

<p>First, I built a Dirty Pipe prototype in <code>kernel-hack-drill</code>; the PoC exploit <code>drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c</code> is in the <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill/blob/e3a105cde99912c89c2c1470a29101eb0d9c2d56/drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c">repository</a>. It:</p>
<ol>
  <li>performs a cross-cache attack and reclaims the slab that held <code>drill_item_t</code> objects as a slab for <code>pipe_buffer</code> objects</li>
  <li>exploits the UAF write to <code>drill_item_t</code>; the attacker-controlled bytes written to <code>drill_item_t</code> at offset 24, modify <code>pipe_buffer.flags</code></li>
  <li>implements the Dirty Pipe attack, achieving LPE in one shot without an infoleak, cool!</li>
</ol>

<p>To use this technique in my CVE-2024-50264 PoC exploit, I still had to bypass the last remaining <strong>Limitation #6</strong>: the kworker hangs before the UAF write if <code>virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock</code> is non-zero. I managed to solve that by doing <code>splice()</code> from a regular file to the pipe, starting at offset zero:</p>
<div><pre><code>	<span>loff_t</span> <span>file_offset</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
	<span>ssize_t</span> <span>bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

	<span>/* N.B. splice modifies the file_offset value */</span>
	<span>bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>splice</span><span>(</span><span>temp_file_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>file_offset</span><span>,</span> <span>pipe_fd</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
		<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] splice"</span><span>);</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>!=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
		<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] splice short"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In that case, the <code>pipe_buffer.offset</code> field remains zero, so the kworker does not hang while acquiring the spinlock:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_pipe_buffer2.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>This seemed like a breakthrough – until I noticed that the UAF write also corrupted the <code>pipe_buffer.ops</code> function pointer by four zero bytes of <code>peer_fwd_cnt</code>. That unfortunate side effect provoked kernel crashes on every later operation involving <code>pipe_buffer</code> ☹️:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_pipe_buffer3.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>This brought me to the following line of reasoning:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Completing the Dirty Pipe attack requires a working <code>pipe_buffer</code> with an unchanged <code>ops</code> pointer value.</li>
  <li>Preserving <code>0xffffffff</code> in the most significant bytes of the <code>pipe_buffer.ops</code> function pointer requires that same value in <code>peer_fwd_cnt</code>.</li>
  <li>Setting <code>peer_fwd_cnt</code> in <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> means sending data through the vsock.</li>
  <li>Sending data through a vsock first needs a successful <code>connect()</code>.</li>
  <li>However, a successful <code>connect()</code> on the vulnerable vsock makes the UAF impossible ⛔.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alas!</p>

<h2 id="pipe-buffer-entertainment">Pipe buffer entertainment</h2>

<p>So the original Dirty Pipe technique wouldn't fit my CVE-2024-50264 PoC exploit. But suddenly an idea struck me:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What if I create a pipe with capacity <code>PAGE_SIZE * 4</code> forcing the kernel to allocate four <code>pipe_buffer</code> objects in <code>kmalloc-192</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In that case, the memory object overlapping looked like this: four <code>pipe_buffer</code> objects in one <code>kmalloc-192</code> slab are allocated at the place of two <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects in two <code>kmalloc-96</code> slabs. The following diagram illustrates the overlap:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_pipe_buffer7.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>Here, memory corruption can land on either of the two <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects. I'll cover these cases one at a time.</p>

<p>To avoid the kernel hang and crash when the UAF hits <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> <strong>#1</strong>, I used two tricks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Performed a <code>splice()</code> from a regular file to the pipe with a starting offset of zero. As mentioned earlier, this keeps the <code>offset</code> field of the first <code>pipe_buffer</code> at zero, so the kworker doesn't hang while acquiring the spinlock.</li>
  <li>Discarded that first <code>pipe_buffer</code> <strong>before triggering the UAF</strong>, leaving its <code>offset</code> field untouched:
    <div><pre><code> <span>/* Remove the first pipe_buffer without changing the `pipe_buffer.offset` */</span>
 <span>bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>splice</span><span>(</span><span>pipe_fd</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>temp_pipe_fd</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
 <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
 	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] splice"</span><span>);</span>
 <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
 	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] splice short"</span><span>);</span>

 <span>/*
  * Let's read this byte and empty the first pipe_buffer.
  * So if the UAF writing corrupts the first pipe_buffer,
  * that will not crash the kernel. Cool!
  */</span>
 <span>bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>temp_pipe_fd</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>pipe_data_to_read</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span> <span>/* 1 spliced byte */</span>
 <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
 	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] pipe read 1"</span><span>);</span>
 <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>!=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
 	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] pipe read 1 short"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>
    <p>After this sequence of <code>splice()</code> and <code>read()</code>, the first <code>pipe_buffer</code> becomes inactive. Even if the subsequent UAF overwrites its <code>ops</code> pointer, later pipe operations won't dereference that corrupted pointer, so no kernel crash occurs.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I wanted to exploit the UAF on <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> <strong>#2</strong> to overwrite the fourth <code>pipe_buffer</code>. To prevent the kernel hang when the UAF hits this second <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>, I called the same <code>splice(temp_file_fd, &amp;file_offset, pipe_fd[1], NULL, 1, 0)</code> two more times. These syscalls initialized the second and third <code>pipe_buffer</code> objects, leaving their <code>flags</code> at zero, since this pipe operation doesn't set any <code>PIPE_BUF_FLAG_*</code> bits. Therefore, if the UAF occurs on the second <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>, the <code>spin_lock_bh()</code> in <code>virtio_transport_space_update()</code> will not hang.</p>

<p>These preparations of the pipe opened a door for corrupting the <code>page</code> pointer of the fourth <code>pipe_buffer</code>:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_pipe_buffer6.png" width="90%"></center>


<p><code>kernel-hack-drill</code> let me experiment with <code>pipe_buffer</code> objects. Without it, crafting this exploit primitive for the tricky CVE-2024-50264 would have been extremely hard.</p>

<h2 id="aarw-and-kaslrs-last-revenge">AARW and KASLR's last revenge</h2>

<p>In a <code>pipe_buffer</code>, the <code>page</code> pointer holds the address of a <code>struct page</code> inside the virtual memory map (<code>vmemmap</code>). <code>vmemmap</code> is an array of these structures that allows the kernel to address physical memory efficiently. It is <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.15.5/source/Documentation/arch/x86/x86_64/mm.rst">mentioned</a> in <code>Documentation/arch/x86/x86_64/mm.rst</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>____________________________________________________________|___________________________________________________________
                  |            |                  |         |

</code></pre></div>

<p>Hence, when I managed to perform a UAF write of controlled data to the <code>pipe_buffer.page</code> pointer, I gained arbitrary address reading and writing (AARW) via the pipe. However, I wasn't able to change the AARW target address many times, as I mentioned in <strong>Limitation #5</strong>, so I had to choose the target in <code>vmemmap</code> carefully.</p>

<p>My first thought was to overwrite part of the kernel code. But with KASLR enabled, I didn't know the physical address of kernel <code>_text</code> and therefore couldn't determine its location inside <code>vmemmap</code>.</p>

<p>That's why I decided to use the pipe AARW against <code>struct cred</code> in the kernel heap. As I described earlier, I leaked the virtual address of <code>cred</code> using my <code>msg_msg</code> out-of-bounds read. This virtual address looked like <code>0xffff888003b7ad00</code>, and I understood it was from the direct mapping of all physical memory. So I used the following formula to calculate the offset of the corresponding <code>struct page</code> in <code>vmemmap</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>#define STRUCT_PAGE_SZ 64lu
#define PAGE_ADDR_OFFSET(addr) (((addr &amp; 0x3ffffffflu) &gt;&gt; 12) * STRUCT_PAGE_SZ)
</span><span>uaf_val</span> <span>=</span> <span>PAGE_ADDR_OFFSET</span><span>(</span><span>cred_addr</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The idea behind it is simple:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>addr &amp; 0x3ffffffflu</code> gives the offset of the <code>struct cred</code> from the <code>page_offset_base</code>.</li>
  <li>Right shift by 12 gives the number of the memory page containing <code>struct cred</code>.</li>
  <li>Finally, multiplication by 64 (the size of <code>struct page</code>) gives the offset of the corresponding <code>struct page</code> in the <code>vmemmap</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This formula should be adapted if the system has more than 4 GiB of RAM. In that case, <code>ZONE_NORMAL</code> containing kernel allocations usually starts at address <code>0x100000000</code>. Hence, to calculate the offset of the needed <code>struct page</code>, we should add <code>(0x100000000 &gt;&gt; 12) * STRUCT_PAGE_SZ</code>.</p>

<p>Excellent, the described formula is independent of KASLR for physical addresses, so I could use it to calculate the four lower bytes of the target address for exploiting the pipe AARW against the <code>struct cred</code>. Why I needed only four lower bytes of <code>pipe_buffer.page</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My UAF write to <code>peer_buf_alloc</code> performed partial overwriting of the first half of the <code>pipe_buffer.page</code> pointer, as I showed at the diagram above.</li>
  <li><code>x86_64</code> is little-endian, so the first half of the pointer contains four lower bytes of the address.</li>
</ul>

<p>But when I tried this approach, KASLR carried out its last revenge. It randomized the <code>vmemmap_base</code> address, and the four lower bytes of the <code>struct page</code> pointers carried <strong>two random bits</strong>. Ouch!</p>

<p>However, I decided to brute-force those two bits because I could achieve the UAF write around 5 times before the kworker got a null-ptr-deref after <code>VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT</code> (8 sec).</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/bruteforce4.jpg" width="60%"></center>


<p>I found that probing different values of <code>pipe_buffer.page</code> from userspace works perfectly well:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In case of fail, reading from the pipe simply returns <code>Bad address</code>.</li>
  <li>In case of success, reading from the pipe gives <code>struct cred</code> contents.</li>
</ul>

<p>Great! I could finally determine a proper AARW target address, write to the pipe, overwrite euid and egid with 0, and get root. See the PoC exploit demo:</p>

<p>There are more ways to store energy than just using batteries. Some are using fire bricks, particularly for process heat for industries that rely on high heat in manufacturing. Others propose an arrangement of <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/01/19/gravity-energy-storage-mine-shafts-romania/">massive concrete blocks</a> that move up and down like the weights of a giant grandfather clock, converting kinetic energy to potential energy and back again. In Finland, two intrepid engineers began experimenting with a sand battery a few years ago.</p>
<p>As we reported when the first <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2022/07/05/sand-battery-trials-begin-in-finland/">prototype</a> was unveiled three years ago, the idea of a sand battery began with two Finnish engineers, Markku Ylönen and Tommi Eronen. The concept is simplicity itself. Make a really big pile of sand. Heat it with excess renewable electricity to around 500°C (932°F), then use that heat later to heat homes, factories, even swimming pools. They say the sand can stay hot for 3 months or more. The pair have founded Polar Night Energy, which constructed a prototype consisting of 100 tons of sand inside what looks like a silo in the town of Kankaanpää.</p>
<p>Many Americans are unfamiliar with the concept of district heating, but it is widely used in other counties, especially in Scandinavia where keeping schools, municipal buildings, arenas, factories, and homes warm in winter is a challenge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.loval.com/en/about-us/news/loviisan-lampo">Loviisan Lämpö</a> is a Finnish district heating company that supplies district heating to customers in Loviisa, Pukkila, Pornainen, and Pyhtää. It has collaborated with Polar Night on a new sand battery — one that is much larger than the prototype — which began operating in the city of Pornainen in southern Finland this month, where it is expected to reduce carbon emissions from district heating by 70 percent.</p>
<p>Previously, the majority of heat needed for the system came from burning oil, but that has now been completely eliminated. The system will continue to burn wood chips to supplement the sand battery. Wood chips are at least carbon neutral, although not an ideal solution since it takes years for trees to grow but only minutes for the chips to burn.</p>
<p>At the commissioning ceremony for the new battery, Mikko Paajanen, CEO of Loviisan Lämpö, said, “A couple of years ago, we started considering how to take district heating in Pornainen to the next level. It would have been easy to simply replace the old wood chip power plant with a new one of the same kind, but that didn’t align with our goals. We evaluated every possible alternative, and the Sand Battery proved to be the best option.”</p>
<p>The battery is a 42 foot tall, 50 foot wide steel cylinder filled with 2,000 tons of crushed stone. According to <em><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91393820/in-finland-this-giant-battery-is-helping-heat-apartments-and-offices-using-sand">Fast Company</a></em>, when extra renewable electricity is available, the system uses it to heat up the crushed stone, where it is stored until needed. Then the heat from the battery travels to other buildings through a system of pipes filled with hot water. Each building has its own equipment to distribute the heat to radiators, floor heaters, or other heating devices.</p>
<p>“We have already learnt that our system has even more potential than we initially calculated. It’s been a positive surprise,” said Ylönen after the prototype was placed in service. “Whenever there’s a high surge of available green electricity, we want to be able to get it into the storage really quickly.” The need to use energy more wisely was driven home for Finns after Russia stopped providing electricity, methane, and oil to Finland when it voted to join NATO. Finland and Russia share a common border.</p>
<h3>Sand Battery Is Simple &amp; Efficient</h3>
<figure id="attachment_359222" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-359222"><img decoding="async" src="https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/06-91393820-finnish-sand-battery.jpg" alt="sand battery" width="1200" height="900" srcset="https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/06-91393820-finnish-sand-battery.jpg 1200w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/06-91393820-finnish-sand-battery-400x300.jpg 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/06-91393820-finnish-sand-battery-800x600.jpg 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/06-91393820-finnish-sand-battery-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-359222">Credit: Polar Night</figcaption></figure>
<p>The sand battery is simplicity itself. “We just heat air and [circulate it] through sand,” says Liisa Naskali, COO of Polar Night Energy. But materials other than sand can be used. The new battery actually uses crushed soapstone chips from a local fireplace manufacturer. Sand, or other material crushed into sand-size particles, has the ability to store heat for weeks. Unlike some other batteries, the system doesn’t rely on chemicals, doesn’t degrade, and won’t catch on fire. In operation, the sand battery has demonstrated a round trip efficiency of 90 percent.</p>
<p>Inside the steel tank, a heat exchanger and a closed loop system are used to circulate the heat. Software runs heaters when electricity prices are low. So far this summer, the district heating operator has paid only about 10 percent of the average price of electricity because heating the system only occurred at optimal times. That helps make the technology cost competitive, although the initial installation cost is fairly high.</p>
<p>Polar Night is now in talks with other district heating companies and factory owners with a need for high temperature process heat. For the company, the project in Pornainen is a critical proof point. “This is really important for us because now we can show that this really works,” a spokesperson for Polar Night said.</p>
<h3>Investment Opportunities</h3>
<p>Polar Night and its partners see a <a href="https://polarnightenergy.com/news/worlds-largest-sand-battery-inaugurated/">bright financial future</a> for sand batteries because&nbsp;they can participate in electricity reserve markets, reduce dependence on single energy sources in heat production, and serve as an excellent example of sector integration between electricity and heat.</p>
<p>“For us, the sand battery is a great commercial investment, but we also wanted to boldly support an innovative solution that benefits customers, the municipality, and the entire electricity market. This is a concrete example of a cost efficient and sustainable investment. If it works here, it will work anywhere,” said Sauli Antila, the investment director at CapMan Infra, the corporate owner of Loviisan Lämpö.</p>
<p>The profitability of the sand battery is based on charging it according to electricity prices and Fingrid’s reserve markets. Its large storage capacity enables balancing the electricity grid and optimizing consumption over several days or even weeks. The reserve market operations and optimization of the Pornainen Sand Battery are managed by the software unit division of Elisa Industriq.</p>
<p>“The Pornainen plant can be adjusted quickly and precisely, and it also has a remarkably long energy buffer, making it well suited for reserve market optimization. Our AI solution automatically identifies the best times to charge and discharge the Sand Battery and allocates flexibility capacity to the reserve products that need it most. Continuous optimization makes it a genuinely profitable investment,” explained Jukka-Pekka Salmenkaita, vice president of AI and special projects at Elisa Industriq.</p>
<p>Polar Night has a clear vision for the future. Construction of an electricity production pilot will begin in the coming weeks in Valkeakoski, Finland, and the company is in active negotiations for several large-scale thermal storage projects in district heating, hot air, and process steam production. “Industrial applications are particularly promising, especially where heat above 100°C is required, something electric boilers and heat pumps cannot provide,” said Polar Night COO Liisa Naskali.</p>
<p>This technology is never going to replace grid-scale battery storage, but could be useful in many situations where battery storage is not. A comment on the YouTube video below complained, “Not a word about return on investment in the presentation. That means it’ll never pay off. They just wasted taxpayers’ money to stroke their own egos.” MAGAlomaniacs are everywhere these days.</p>

<p><a href="https://ziglang.org/news/2024-financials/">Previous Year</a></p><p>Zig Software Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which I am proud to say makes <strong>extremely efficient use of monetary resources</strong>. Unlike many of our peers, our primary expense is direct payments to contributors for their enhancements to the Zig project.</p><p>Don’t take my word for it - let’s look at some numbers.</p><h2>2024 Expenditures</h2>

<td>$154,263.32</td>
<td>ZSF has one employee which is yours truly, Andrew Kelley, serving the role of 
Lead Software Engineer. In 2024, I also volunteered my time as President of Zig Software Foundation,
volunteered as Accounting Clerk, and volunteered as Development Director. In the future, it would be
nice to have dedicated staff for these roles so that I could focus more on being Lead Software Engineer.
</td>

<td>Accounting</td>
<td>$18,463.62</td>
<td>This is entirely paying our accountant,
<a href="https://www.stradafg.com/">Strada Financial Group</a>, to keep the American
legal system happy and keep our organization tax-exempt. I suspected we were being overcharged,
and in 2025 switched to a different accountant.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>CI &amp; Website</td>
<td>$14,986.73</td>
<td>Zig has great cross-compiling abilities in part
due to investing in testing infrastructure for different systems. Some of these costs were
one-time costs to purchase machines that sit in our homes and offices while others
are market-rate Hetzner bare metal machines that we run GitHub Actions on.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Taxes</td>
<td>$13,089.07</td>
<td>Although ZSF is a tax-exempt organization, employees are still required
to pay income tax.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Travel</td>
<td>$6,955.61</td>
<td>In a 2024 meeting, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RBIB3hY2z-gKLGQyvAO3vtWJzoiS6fVLC5XRF4owPn0/edit?usp=sharing">the board decided</a>
that the previous year's travel budget successfully helped grow Zig adoption,
and retained the same budget of $15,000. In 2024, ZSF spent $6,956
of those allocated funds, increasing Zig's presence in <a href="https://softwareyoucan.love/">Italy</a> and <a href="https://zigtoberfest.de/">Germany</a>.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sponsorships</td>
<td>$5,846.24</td>
<td>The Zig project is mostly comprised of in-house code, however,
it also relies on third party projects. Today, every Zig
installation includes some source files or ported code from
<a href="http://musl.libc.org/">musl libc</a>,
<a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/">mingw-w64</a>, and others.
ZSF donates money to these projects as a way to say thanks, give back to the ecosystem,
and increase the sustainability of Zig's dependencies.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bank Fees</td>
<td>$782.23</td>
<td>This is a tiny slice of the pie, but every time ZSF
wires money, there is a transaction fee. Our contractors graciously bill
infrequently when possible to help reduce this cost.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Total Expenses</td>
<td>$520,748.91</td>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="content"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header></header><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>I deal with a lot of servers at work, and one thing everyone wants to know about their servers is how close they are to being at max utilization. It should be easy, right? Just pull up <code>top</code> or another system monitor tool, look at network, memory and CPU utilization, and whichever one is the highest tells you how close you are to the limits.</p><p><img alt="A screenshot of a system monitor app showing 24 cores, half of which are at 100% utitilization and half of which are close to 0%." src="https://www.brendanlong.com/images/cpu-utilization-lie/system-monitor-screenshot.png"></p><p>For example, this machine is at 50% CPU utilization, so it can <a href="#matrix-math">probably do twice as much of whatever it's doing</a>.</p><p>And yet, whenever people actually try to project these numbers, they find that CPU utilization doesn't quite increase linearly. <strong>But how bad could it possibly be?</strong></p><p>To answer this question, I ran a bunch of stress tests and monitored both how much work they did and what the system-reported CPU utilization was, then graphed the results.</p><h2 id="setup"><a href="#setup">Setup</a></h2><p>For my test machine, I used a desktop computer running Ubuntu with a <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/5000-series/amd-ryzen-9-5900x.html">Ryzen 9 5900X</a> (12 core / 24 thread) processor. I also enabled <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/CPU-PB2.html">Precision Boost Overdrive</a> (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Turbo_Core">Turbo</a>).</p><p>I vibe-coded <a href="https://github.com/brendanlong/cpu-utilization-graphs">a script</a> that runs <a href="https://github.com/ColinIanKing/stress-ng">stress-ng</a> in a loop, first using 24 workers and attempting to run them each at different utilizations from 1% to 100%, then using 1 to 24 workers all at 100% utilization. It used different stress testing method and measured the number of operations that could be completed ("Bogo ops<sup id="fnref:jvyu8i00sms"><a href="#fn:jvyu8i00sms">1</a></sup>").</p><p>The reason I did two different methods was that operating systems are smart about how they schedule work, and scheduling a small number of workers at 100% utilization can be done optimally (spoilers) but with 24 workers all at 50% utilization it's hard for the OS to do anything other than spreading the work evenly.</p><h2 id="results"><a href="#results">Results</a></h2><p>You can see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QKdYa3NIFGTixG_LdnsbwbeLDnE2GNVVsS9-dfkcT20/edit?usp=sharing">the raw CSV results here</a>.</p><h2 id="general-cpu"><a href="#general-cpu">General CPU</a></h2><p>The most basic test just runs all of stress-ng's CPU stress tests in a loop.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://www.brendanlong.com/images/cpu-utilization-lie/cpu_utilization_analysis_cpu.png"></p><p>You can see that when the system is reporting 50% CPU utilization, it's actually doing 60-65% of the actual maximum work it can do.</p><h2 id="64-bit-integer-math"><a href="#64-bit-integer-math">64-bit Integer Math</a></h2><p>But maybe that one was just a fluke. What if we just run some random math on 64-bit integers?</p><p><img alt="" src="https://www.brendanlong.com/images/cpu-utilization-lie/cpu_utilization_analysis_int64.png"></p><p>This one is even worse! At "50% utilization", we're actually doing 65-85% of the max work we can get done. It can't possibly get worse than that though, right?</p><h2 id="matrix-math"><a href="#matrix-math">Matrix Math</a></h2><p><img alt="" src="https://www.brendanlong.com/images/cpu-utilization-lie/cpu_utilization_analysis_matrixprod.png"></p><p>Something is definitely off. <strong>Doing matrix math, "50% utilization" is actually 80% to 100% of the max work that can be done.</strong></p><p>In case you were wondering about the system monitor screenshot from the start of the article, that was a matrix math test running with 12 workers, and you can see that it really did report 50% utilization even though additional workers do absolutely nothing (except make the utilization number go up).</p><h2 id="whats-going-on"><a href="#whats-going-on">What's Going On?</a></h2><h2 id="hyperthreading"><a href="#hyperthreading">Hyperthreading</a></h2><p>You might notice that this the graph keeps changing at 50%, and I've helpfully added piecewise linear regressions showing the fit.</p><p>The main reason this is happening is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading">hyperthreading</a>: Half of the "cores" on this machine (and most machines) are sharing resources with other cores. If I run 12 workers on this machine, they each get scheduled on their own physical core with no shared resources, but once I go over that, each additional worker is sharing resources with another. In some cases (general CPU benchmarks), this makes things slightly worse, and in some cases (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data">SIMD</a>-heavy matrix math), there are no useful resources left to share.</p><h2 id="turbo"><a href="#turbo">Turbo</a></h2><p>It's harder to see, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Turbo_Core">Turbo</a> is also having an effect. This particular processor runs at 4.9 GHz at low utilization, but slowly drops to 4.3 GHz as more cores become active<sup id="fnref:yk2lmnusjj"><a href="#fn:yk2lmnusjj">2</a></sup>.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://www.brendanlong.com/images/cpu-utilization-lie/clock_speed_vs_cpu_all.png"></p><p>Note the zoomed-in y-axis. The clock speed "only" drops by 15% on this processor.</p><p>Since CPU utilization is calculated as busy cycles / total cycles, this means the denominator is getting smaller as the numerator gets larger, so we get yet another reason why actual CPU utilization increases faster than linearly.</p><h2 id="does-this-matter"><a href="#does-this-matter">Does This Matter?</a></h2><p><img alt="" src="https://www.brendanlong.com/images/cpu-utilization-lie/cpu_utilization_combined_adjusted.png"></p><p>If you look at CPU utilization and assume it will increase linearly, you're going to have a rough time. If you're using the CPU efficiently (running above "50%" utilization), the reported utilization is an underestimate, sometimes significantly so.</p><p>And keep in mind that I've only shown results for one processor, but hyperthreading performance and Turbo behavior can vary wildly between different processors, especially from different companies (AMD vs Intel).</p><p>The best way I know to work around this is to run benchmarks and monitor actual work done:</p><ol><li>Benchmark how much work your server can do before having errors or unacceptable latency.</li><li>Report how much work your server is currently doing.</li><li>Compare those two metrics instead of CPU utilization.</li></ol></div></article></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>If you glance over this blog, you will see that I am an avid Android fan. After setting up numerous Linux <code>proot</code> desktops on phones, I wanted to see if I use a phone as a server and run my blog from an Android phone. Since you are reading this, I was successful.</p>
<p>I was inspired my a few Mastodon posts earlier this week to give it a go. First, I stumbled on a post from <a href="https://sunny.garden/@kaimac/113030644224867695">@kaimac</a> who is running a site from an ESP32 microcontroller. In the comments of that post, I saw <a href="https://post.lurk.org/@computersandblues/112570463568163343">a mention</a> to <a href="https://compost.party/">compost.party</a> created by user <a href="https://post.lurk.org/@computersandblues">@computersandblues</a> that runs completely on an Android device and a solar panel. Last, <a href="https://bladerunner.social/@stevelord">@stevelord</a> who is essentially running <a href="https://thedorkweb.bearblog.dev/my-openwrt-home-server/">a homelab on a TP-Link router</a> with OpenWRT installed.</p>
<p>I think a lot about power consumption of my homelab and I also love using old hardware for random projects to give them new life. I was truly inspired by the above works, so I got right down to business.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>I looked through the devices I had laying around and I chose a Google Pixel 5 my brother-in-law gave me after he upgraded. The Pixel 5 is carrier locked to Verizon, which is notorious for making it impossible to also unlock the bootloader and install custom ROMs. At first I wanted a device that I could install PostmarketOS to run a proper Linux server. In the end, I’m glad I didn’t go that route.</p>
<p>Another reason I chose the Pixel 5 is because it supports USB-OTG and can use docks with hard-wired internet. I didn’t want to run the site on wifi and having an ethernet connection was mandatory.</p>
<p>Last, it is the most current phone I have. This device is open to the internet, so I wanted to make sure it is an updated as possible.</p>
<h4 id="solar-powered-blog">Solar powered blog!</h4>
<p>This summer I’ve been testing using a 100w solar panel I got from <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/100-watt-monocrystalline-solar-panel-57325.html">Harbor Freight Tools</a> so I can learn more about how it all works before diving into larger projects. I have that panel connected to a <a href="https://www.jackery.com/products/explorer-160-portable-power-station">Jackery 160w power station</a> to keep it charged up and we use it to charge our mobile devices. I got the Jackery last year as a power bank I use while on jobsites.</p>
<p>Since I already have this set up, I am now using it to power this blog. I’m happy with this setup as I’ve been getting more into <a href="https://permacomputing.net/">permacomputing</a>. Having a website that is fully offgrid using recycled parts is exciting!</p>
<h2 id="what-i-used-to-create-the-site-termux-is-the-goat">What I used to create the site (Termux is the GOAT)</h2>
<p>While considering what projects I could do with this phone, I was thinking I was going to install a <code>proot</code> desktop and then run from within a Linux environment. Before I started I decided to check out a few packages that are in <a href="https://termux.dev/en/">Termux</a> (the flat out amazing terminal emulator) to see how far I could push it.</p>
<p>I checked for some basics and read about setting up an <code>ssh</code> connection. Then I randomly searched for <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, which is what my blog was already built on. Sure enough, it is right there in the Termux repos! Turns out, it has been in there for a long time. I see a lot of posts from 2018 with people using it.</p>
<h2 id="how-has-it-been-going">How has it been going</h2>
<p>Great! Site is fast and reliable. I ran into a few hiccups on the first day or so, which were mostly around the version of Hugo on my server and the newer version I am using on the phone. The other is related to my solar setup and keeping an eye on the battery levels.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t think anyone can tell it is running on an Android phone instead of a x86 Linux box or a hyperscaler VPS.</p>
<p>At the moment I have no plans to change this setup and will leave it as-is until some issue arises. But, there’s really not much to report other than it works fantastic.</p>
<p>Below are my longform notes on how I set it up. But, the short version is it was way simpler than I thought it would be. You can get up and running with a Hugo site by just installing <code>git</code>, <code>screen</code>, your favorite text editor, and <code>hugo</code> straight from the repos.</p>
<p>Not included in this post is how I add new posts to the phone. I can use <code>scp</code> to send a files, but I prefer to use <a href="https://github.com/sigoden/dufs">dufs</a> that is a static file server in that can be accessed in the browser. Using <code>dufs</code> I can upload files and make quick edits straight in the browser from any device. Surprise! <code>dufs</code> is also in the Termux repos and is so easy to get up and running. Again, message me if you’d like to see a write-up about it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="installs">Installs</h2>
<p>Of course I need some basic utilities. These are the utilities I need to have at a minimum when working with a Linux system:</p>
<ul>
<li>rsync</li>
<li>openssh</li>
<li>git</li>
<li>wget</li>
<li>curl</li>
<li>fish shell</li>
<li>cronie</li>
<li>termux-services</li>
<li>iperf3</li>
<li>speedtest-go</li>
<li>screen</li>
<li>helix</li>
<li>hugo</li>
</ul>
<p>Restart Termux and use <code>sv-enable</code> to run certain items as services. I do this for <code>sshd</code> and <code>cronie</code>. It looks like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>$ sv-enable sshd
</span></span><span><span>$ sv-enable cronie
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After running <code>sv-enable</code>, restart Termux.</p>
<h4 id="openssh">openssh</h4>
<p>I could build all of this straight from the phone using either the touchscreen keyboard or connecting a standard keyboard and mouse either with a USB-C dock or bluetooth. But, I want to manage this like all of my other servers, which is to <code>ssh</code> into the device and work from my desk.</p>
<p>There is an <a href="https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Remote_Access#Using_the_SSH_server">official guide</a> for setting up an <code>ssh</code> server. All I will add here is some pointers I learned along the way.</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding an <code>ssh</code> key is simple and should be one of the first steps done. After generating the key and importing with <code>ssh-copy-id</code> from the desktop, edit the <code>sshd</code> file in <code>$PREFIX/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>.</li>
<li>Termux generates its own username and cannot be changed. Run <code>whoami</code> to see what it is.</li>
<li>It is the same for the <code>ssh</code> port. As far as I can tell you cannot change the port, which is automatically set to <strong>8022</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="running-the-site">Running the site</h2>
<p>There are lots of guides out there on how to setup a <code>hugo</code> site. I have an existing site that I migrated from a VM to this phone, so my notes do not include how to get a <code>hugo</code> site running. I also do not need to do any port forwarding as I already have a reverse proxy that I just changed where it points for my blog.</p>
<p><strong>I would like to hear feedback if there is a need to add those notes here. Message me on Mastodon or by email using the links at the bottom of this post.</strong></p>
<p>Below are notes on how I use the package <code>cronie</code> to start the blog using <code>screen</code> and the automatically reload the blog occasionally. <code>cronie</code> is for setting up <code>cron</code> tasks. Once installed and enabled, run <code>crontab -e</code> like usual to setup tasks.</p>
<p>This is how I do it.</p>
<p>First, set a <code>fish</code> alias for the command to reload the blog:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>alias blog_run<span>=</span><span>'cd /data/data/com.termux/files/home/&lt;website_root_dir&gt; &amp;&amp; /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/hugo serve --bind=0.0.0.0 --baseURL=https://blog.ctms.me --appendPort=false --environment=production --disableFastRender --cacheDir /data/data/com.termux/files/home/&lt;website_root_dir&gt;/cache'</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>funcsave blog_run
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, create a script and place in <code>~/scripts</code> that closes a previous instance of <code>screen</code>, clears the cache, and then starts a new <code>screen</code> session titled “hugo” and execute the alias:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span>#! /bin/bash
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>screen -X -S <span>"hugo"</span> quit
</span></span><span><span>rm -rf /data/data/com.termux/files/home/&lt;website_root_dir/cache/&lt;site_name_dir&gt;/filecache/getresource/
</span></span><span><span>screen -S hugo -d -m fish -c <span>'blog_run; exec fish'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Last, set it to run with <code>cron</code></p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gdscript3"><span><span><span>*/</span><span>5</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span> cd <span>/</span>data<span>/</span>data<span>/</span>com<span>.</span>termux<span>/</span>files<span>/</span>home<span>/</span>scripts <span>&amp;&amp;</span> sh blog_reload<span>.</span>sh
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="backing-up">Backing up</h2>
<p>Since Termux supports <code>ssh</code> connections, I can use it on remote machines to pull the files from the phone using <code>rsync</code>.</p>
<p>First, need to install <code>rsync</code> on the phone with <code>pkg install rsync</code>.</p>
<h4 id="desktop-backup">Desktop backup</h4>
<p>Now we can run it from my desktop to pull the files:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>rsync -aP pixel:~/&lt;website_root_dir&gt; /local/dir/pixel_blog/
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>On my desktop, I have this for <code>cron</code></p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>@reboot sleep <span>30</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> rsync -aP pixel:~/&lt;website_root_dir&gt; /local/dir/pixel_blog/ &gt;&gt; $HOME/logs/pixel-hugo-backup.log 2&gt;&amp;<span>1</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="nas-backup">nas backup</h4>
<p>This is the same configuration. The only difference is the backup location and the <code>cron</code> timing.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>rsync -aP pixel:~/&lt;website_root_dir&gt; /local/dir/pixel_blog
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The automation:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span>5</span> <span>6</span> * * * rsync -aP pixel:~/&lt;website_root_dir&gt; /local/dir/pixel_blog &gt;&gt; $HOME/logs/pixel-hugo-backup.log 2&gt;&amp;<span>1</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="git-backup">git backup</h4>
<p>I have a local self-hosted git instance I push backups to, but you can totally set it up to send them to Github or whatever forge you use. No instructions here because there are plenty of guides out there on how to set this up.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="articleBody">
	

<p>I once had a job interview for a backend position. Their stack was Node.js, MySQL, nothing exotic. The interviewer asked: "If you have an array containing a million entries, how would you sort the data by name?"</p>

<p>My immediate thought was: <em>If you have a JavaScript array with a million entries, you're certainly doing something wrong.</em></p>

<p>The interviewer continued: "There are multiple fields that you should be able to sort by."</p>

<p>This felt like a trick question. Surely the right answer was to explain why you shouldn't be sorting millions of records in JavaScript. Pagination, database indexing, server-side filtering. So I said exactly that.</p>

<p>I was wrong. He wanted me to show him <code>Array.prototype.sort()</code>.</p>

<p>My crime? Prioritizing real-world efficiency over theatrical scale. The interviewer didn't see a practical engineer, he saw a candidate who "lacked vision."</p>

<h2>The Theater of Technical Interviews</h2>

<p>I once read that "a complex system usually reflects an absence of good design." It's brilliant. True. And if you're prepping for a system design interview, forget it immediately.</p>

<p>In real-world engineering, simplicity is king. In interviews, <strong>complexity is currency.</strong></p>

<p>Job interviews aren't assessments. They're auditions for a job title: <strong>The Architect Who Solves Hard Problems™.</strong></p>

<p>You're not being evaluated on whether you can build the described system efficiently. You're being evaluated on whether you can <strong>perform the role</strong> of someone who could theoretically build Google.</p>

<h2>The Unwritten Script</h2>

<p>Every system design interview follows the same theatrical formula:</p>

<p><strong>Act I: Summon the Dragons</strong><br>
First, you assume infinite users and planetary-scale traffic. Multiply every reasonable number by 1,000. Treat a todo app like it's handling the New York Stock Exchange. The interviewer nods approvingly as you describe millions of concurrent users for what is essentially a digital notepad.</p>

<p><strong>Act II: Draw the Arcane Symbols</strong><br>
Next, you cover the whiteboard in boxes, arrows, and at least one redundant Kubernetes cluster. Add a message queue, Kafka obviously, regardless of whether you need one. Sprinkle in some microservices because monoliths are for peasants, and draw load balancers like protective talismans around every component.</p>

<p><strong>Act III: Invoke the Gods of Tech</strong><br>
Finally, you debate consensus algorithms for a blog comment system, mention observability and SLOs for good measure, and whisper "eventual consistency" like an incantation that will ward off all future scaling problems.</p>

<p>The performance has nothing to do with the actual job. It's about proving you know the <strong>vocabulary of scale</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Interview World</strong>: Complexity = Competence</p>

<ul>
<li>Show knowledge of distributed systems patterns</li>
<li>Demonstrate familiarity with enterprise-grade tools</li>
<li>Prove you can architect for theoretical millions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Real World</strong>: Simplicity = Good Design</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with the simplest solution that works</li>
<li>Add complexity only when genuinely needed</li>
<li>Optimize for maintainability, not theoretical scale</li>
</ul>

<p>I've seen great engineers fail interviews because they suggested using a relational database instead of a distributed NoSQL cluster, for a system that would handle 100 requests per day.</p>

<p>I've also seen mediocre engineers get hired because they could fluently discuss sharding strategies for problems that didn't need sharding.</p>

<h2>Why the Theater Exists</h2>

<p>This isn't malicious. It's structural, driven by several interconnected forces:</p>

<p><strong>Signal vs. Noise</strong>: Complexity is easier to evaluate than judgment. Anyone can memorize CAP theorem and recite the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases. But knowing about when <em>not</em> to use distributed systems? That's harder to assess in a 45-minute conversation. Interviewers gravitate toward what they can measure.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Aversion</strong>: Hiring committees fear false negatives more than false positives. A "simple" answer feels risky. What if this person can't handle complexity when it's genuinely needed? A "complex" answer feels safer, even if it's complete overkill for the actual problem at hand.</p>

<p><strong>The Aspiration Gap</strong>: Companies hire for their <em>aspirational</em> selves, not their current reality. They want "Senior Staff Engineers" who can theoretically scale to millions of users, not "People Who Write Maintainable Code" for their current 10,000 daily active users. The fantasy of future scale drives present hiring decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer Incentives</strong>: Discussing load balancing strategies and distributed consensus is more intellectually stimulating than talking about boring CRUD operations. Even if CRUD is 90% of what the actual job entails. Interviewers are human, and humans prefer interesting conversations over practical ones.</p>

<p>Once you're hired, the script flips entirely. You'll spend your days deleting unused microservices that "future-proofed" against scale that never came, arguing against message queues for problems that cron jobs solve perfectly, and consolidating databases that were split "for scalability" but now just create maintenance overhead. You'll find yourself explaining to eager junior developers why the new feature doesn't need its own Kubernetes namespace, and why sometimes a simple bash script is more reliable than a distributed system.</p>

<p>The very complexity that got you hired becomes the tech debt you'll spend years dismantling. I've worked with engineers who aced system design interviews by proposing elaborate architectures, then spent their first year on the job simplifying systems that previous hires had over-engineered using the exact same interview logic. It's a cycle of complexity creation and subsequent complexity destruction, driven entirely by hiring theater.</p>

<h2>The Cost of Honesty</h2>

<p>What happens when you try to be pragmatic in interviews?</p>

<p><strong>The Backpressure Question</strong>: "How do you handle backpressure in your system?"</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Honest answer</strong>: "We don't generate enough load to need backpressure handling."</li>
<li><strong>Interview answer</strong>: "We implement exponential backoff with circuit breakers and queue depth monitoring."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Database Question</strong>: "SQL or NoSQL for this use case?"</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Honest answer</strong>: "Postgres handles this fine and the team knows SQL."</li>
<li><strong>Interview answer</strong>: "We'll use a polyglot persistence strategy with Redis for caching, Cassandra for time-series data, and Neo4j for the social graph."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Scaling Question</strong>: "How do you handle 10 million users?"</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Honest answer</strong>: "We don't have 10 million users. We have 10,000. Let's solve that first."</li>
<li><strong>Interview answer</strong>: "We'll implement horizontal sharding with consistent hashing and auto-scaling Kubernetes pods."</li>
</ul>

<p>The honest answers demonstrate experience. The interview answers demonstrate vocabulary. Guess which ones get job offers?</p>

<h2>How to Win the Game</h2>

<p>I'm not advocating dishonesty, I'm acknowledging reality. Interviews are a ritual, and rituals have rules. Here's how to navigate them:</p>

<p><strong>Separate Performance from Practice</strong>: Playing the interview game doesn't make you a hypocrite. It makes you pragmatic about a broken system. You can excel at interview theater while still being a principled engineer once you're hired.</p>

<p><strong>Learn the Sacred Texts</strong>: Study distributed systems patterns even if you'll never use them. Memorize the CAP theorem even if it's mostly irrelevant to your daily work. Practice drawing architecture diagrams that look impressive on whiteboards. Think of it as learning a foreign language you'll only speak during interviews.</p>

<p><strong>Embrace the Tropes</strong>: Always start discussions with "At scale, we'd need to consider..." Mention monitoring and observability early and often, even for simple systems. Add redundancy everywhere, even for non-critical components. Use the magic words that signal competence in interview-land.</p>

<p><strong>Then Drop the Act</strong>: Once hired, advocate ruthlessly for simplicity. Be the voice of reason who asks "Do we actually need this complexity?" Use your hard-earned credibility to push back against unnecessary over-engineering. This is where the real engineering work begins.</p>

<p>This system is frustrating but not permanent. Some companies are starting to recognize the disconnect and experiment with better approaches. They're giving candidates real problems the company actually faces rather than theoretical scaling challenges. They're rewarding engineers who question complexity, not just those who can implement it. They're asking candidates to identify over-engineering in existing systems rather than create new complexity from scratch.</p>

<p>But until these practices become widespread, we're stuck with the performance. The theater continues because it serves too many psychological needs: it makes interviewers feel smart, companies feel rigorous, and candidates feel like they're solving important problems.</p>

<hr>

<p>Technical interviews exist in a parallel universe where different rules apply. The stage demands a <strong>performance of complexity</strong>; the job rewards <strong>mastery of simplicity</strong>.</p>

<p>The system is broken, but individual actors can't fix it by martyring themselves. Play your part, get the role, then use your position to advocate for sanity.</p>

<p>Remember: the goal isn't to perpetuate the theater forever. It's to get inside the building where you can help others see that the emperor's distributed microservices architecture has no clothes.</p>

<p>The best revenge against interview theater isn't failing the performance, it's succeeding at it. Then you can spend your career deleting the unnecessary complexity it celebrated.</p>

<p>The United States’ carbon emissions increased while China’s declined in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2024, pointing to a massive shift in roles between the world’s two biggest climate polluters if the trend continues.</p>



<p>Between January 1 and June 30 this year, U.S. emissions rose 4.2% while China’s fell 2.7%, <a href="https://carbonmonitor.org/variation">reports</a> Carbon Monitor, a global emissions tracker led by Tsinghua University, France’s Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences, the University of California, Irvine, and China’s Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Institute.</p>



<p>In China, emissions were down 1.4% across the power sector and industry, and held statistically even across all other economic sectors. The United States was one of just three countries, along with Japan and Brazil, that saw emissions rise across their entire economies—including increases of 2% in ground transport and 1.3% in the power sector.</p>



<p>Across all the individual countries in the Carbon Monitor database, Spain recorded the highest emissions increase, at 6%, followed by Brazil at 5.6%, Germany at 5.2%, the European Union plus the United Kingdom at 4.6%, and the U.S. at 4.2%.</p>



<p>Between the world’s two leading emitters, the data show “a reversal of the usual trend over the past decade, when global heat-trapping emissions inched higher in large part because U.S. reductions have been offset by higher CO2 output from China,” Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2025/08/13/a-new-way-the-us-may-be-falling-behind-china-00506487">writes</a>. “It also comes after decades of American politicians of both parties complaining about China failing to clean up its act.”</p>



<p>The numbers could still be shifted by factors like weather, short-term economic trends, and natural gas prices, Politico writes. “But there are also signs of structural changes in the global economy.” International Energy Agency (IEA) figures show Chinese coal consumption falling 2.6% in the first half of the year, largely due to a boom in solar that saw the country add 92 gigawatts of capacity—that’s 92 billion watts—in a single month in May, compared to all-time U.S. installations of 134 GW.</p>



<p>That reflects a fundamental shift in the way China consumes energy, climate scientist Glen Peters of the Oslo-based Center for International Climate Research (CICERO) told Politico, though it’s still early to declare a permanent change. “Even if Chinese emissions decline this year, I would not start saying they have peaked,” he said. “I would want to see emissions trending down for a few years.”</p>



<p>But U.S. per capita emissions are still well above China’s, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2025">according to</a> the latest IEA data. And with Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theenergymix.com/a-self-inflicted-tragedy-congress-approves-reversal-of-u-s-climate-policy/">moving on all fronts</a> to increase fossil fuel production and revoke renewable energy incentives and confirmed contracts, Stanford University earth systems scientist Rob Jackson said the broader trends are clear—even if it’s too soon to say where the 2025 data will land.</p>



<p>“It’s fair to say that China and the U.S. are on different trajectories now,” he told Politico, with clean technology adoption likely to drive down emissions over the next five years. The U.S., by contrast, is “heading in the opposite direction.”</p>

<p>The United States’ carbon emissions increased while China’s declined in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2024, pointing to a massive shift in roles between the world’s two biggest climate polluters if the trend continues.</p>



<p>Between January 1 and June 30 this year, U.S. emissions rose 4.2% while China’s fell 2.7%, <a href="https://carbonmonitor.org/variation">reports</a> Carbon Monitor, a global emissions tracker led by Tsinghua University, France’s Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences, the University of California, Irvine, and China’s Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Institute.</p>



<p>In China, emissions were down 1.4% across the power sector and industry, and held statistically even across all other economic sectors. The United States was one of just three countries, along with Japan and Brazil, that saw emissions rise across their entire economies—including increases of 2% in ground transport and 1.3% in the power sector.</p>



<p>Across all the individual countries in the Carbon Monitor database, Spain recorded the highest emissions increase, at 6%, followed by Brazil at 5.6%, Germany at 5.2%, the European Union plus the United Kingdom at 4.6%, and the U.S. at 4.2%.</p>



<p>Between the world’s two leading emitters, the data show “a reversal of the usual trend over the past decade, when global heat-trapping emissions inched higher in large part because U.S. reductions have been offset by higher CO2 output from China,” Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2025/08/13/a-new-way-the-us-may-be-falling-behind-china-00506487">writes</a>. “It also comes after decades of American politicians of both parties complaining about China failing to clean up its act.”</p>



<p>The numbers could still be shifted by factors like weather, short-term economic trends, and natural gas prices, Politico writes. “But there are also signs of structural changes in the global economy.” International Energy Agency (IEA) figures show Chinese coal consumption falling 2.6% in the first half of the year, largely due to a boom in solar that saw the country add 92 gigawatts of capacity—that’s 92 billion watts—in a single month in May, compared to all-time U.S. installations of 134 GW.</p>



<p>That reflects a fundamental shift in the way China consumes energy, climate scientist Glen Peters of the Oslo-based Center for International Climate Research (CICERO) told Politico, though it’s still early to declare a permanent change. “Even if Chinese emissions decline this year, I would not start saying they have peaked,” he said. “I would want to see emissions trending down for a few years.”</p>



<p>But U.S. per capita emissions are still well above China’s, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2025">according to</a> the latest IEA data. And with Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theenergymix.com/a-self-inflicted-tragedy-congress-approves-reversal-of-u-s-climate-policy/">moving on all fronts</a> to increase fossil fuel production and revoke renewable energy incentives and confirmed contracts, Stanford University earth systems scientist Rob Jackson said the broader trends are clear—even if it’s too soon to say where the 2025 data will land.</p>



<p>“It’s fair to say that China and the U.S. are on different trajectories now,” he told Politico, with clean technology adoption likely to drive down emissions over the next five years. The U.S., by contrast, is “heading in the opposite direction.”</p>

  <p>It began with what seemed like a final mundane touch to <a href="https://dgross.ca/linux-time-machine-server/">my home server setup for hosting Time Machine backups</a>: I wanted it to automatically sleep when idle and wake up again when needed. You know, sleep on idle — hasn’t Windows had that built in since like Windows 98? How hard could it be to configure on a modern Ubuntu install?</p>

<p>To be fair, I wanted more than just sleep on idle, I also wanted <em>wake on request</em> — and that second bit turns out to be the hard part. There were a bunch of dead ends, but I stuck out it to find something that “just works” without the need to manually turn on the server for every backup. Join me on the full adventure further down, or cut to the chase with the setup instructions below.</p>

<h4 id="caveats"><em>Caveats</em></h4>
<ul>
  <li>The server’s network device needs to support wake-on-LAN from unicast packets</li>
  <li>To prevent unwanted wake-ups, you’ll need to ensure no device on the network is sending extraneous packets to the server</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-i-got-there">How I got there</h2>
<p>First, a bit about my hardware, as this solution is somewhat hardware-dependent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HP ProDesk 600 G3 SFF</li>
  <li>CPU: Intel Core i5-7500</li>
  <li>Network adapter: Intel I219-LM</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sleeping-on-idle">Sleeping on idle</h2>
<p>I started with sleep-on-idle, which boiled down to two questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to determine if the server is idle or busy at any given moment</li>
  <li>How to automatically suspend to RAM after being idle for some time</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the guides I found for sleep-on-idle, like <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/power-autosuspend.html.en">this one</a>, were for Ubuntu Desktop — sleep-on-idle doesn’t seem to be something that’s commonly done with Ubuntu Server. I came across a few tools that looked promising, the most notable being <a href="https://github.com/mrmekon/circadian"><code>circadian</code></a>. In general, though, there didn’t seem to be a standard/best-practice way to do it, so I decided I’d roll it myself the simplest way I could.</p>

<h3 id="determining-idlebusy-state">Determining idle/busy state</h3>
<p>I asked myself what server activity would constitute being busy, and landed on two things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Logged in SSH sessions</li>
  <li>In-progress Time Machine backups</li>
</ul>

<p>Choosing corresponding metrics was pretty straightforward:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Count of logged in users, using <code>who</code></li>
  <li>Count of connections on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol">AFP</a> port (548), using <code>lsof</code> (I’m using AFP for Time Machine network shares)</li>
</ul>

<p>For both metrics, I noted the values first at idle, and then again when the server was busy.</p>

<h3 id="automatically-suspending-to-ram">Automatically suspending to RAM</h3>
<p>To keep things simple, I opted for a cron job that triggers a bash script — check out <a href="#cron-auto-sleep">the final version shared above</a>. So far it’s worked fine; if I ever need to account for more metrics in detecting idle state, I’ll consider using a more sophisticated option like <code>circadian</code>.</p>

<h2 id="waking-on-request">Waking on request</h2>
<p>With sleep-on-idle out of the way, I moved on to figuring out how the server would wake on demand.</p>

<p>Could the machine be configured to automatically wake upon receiving a network request? I knew <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN">Wake-on-LAN</a> supported waking a computer up using a specially crafted “magic packet”, and it was straightforward to get this working. The question was if a regular, non-“magic packet” could somehow do the same thing.</p>

<h3 id="wake-on-phy">Wake on PHY?</h3>
<p>Some online searching yielded a <a href="https://superuser.com/q/205468">superuser discussion</a> that looked particularly promising. It pointed to the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ethtool.8.html">man page for ethtool</a>, the Linux utility used to configure network hardware. It shared ethtool’s complete wake-on-LAN configuration options:</p>
<div><pre><code>wol p|u|m|b|a|g|s|f|d...
      Sets Wake-on-LAN options.  Not all devices support
      this.  The argument to this option is a string of
      characters specifying which options to enable.

      p   Wake on PHY activity
      u   Wake on unicast messages
      m   Wake on multicast messages
      b   Wake on broadcast messages
      a   Wake on ARP
      g   Wake on MagicPacket™
      s   Enable SecureOn™ password for MagicPacket™
      f   Wake on filter(s)
      d   Disable (wake on nothing).  This option
          clears all previous options.
</code></pre></div>

<p>It pointed in particular to the <code>Wake on PHY activity</code> option, which seemed perfect for this use-case. It seemed to mean that any packet sent to the network interface’s MAC address would wake it. I enabled the flag using <code>ethtool</code>, manually put the machine to sleep, then tried logging back in using SSH and sending pings. No dice: the machine remained asleep despite multiple attempts. So much for that 😕</p>

<h3 id="breakthrough-wake-on-unicast">Breakthrough: wake on unicast</h3>
<p>None of <code>ethtool</code>’s other wake-on-LAN options seemed relevant, but some more searching pointed to the <code>Wake on unicast messages</code> as another option to try. I enabled the flag using <code>ethtool</code>, manually put the machine to sleep, then tried logging back in using SSH. Bingo! This time, the machine woke up. 🙌 With that, I figured I was done.</p>

<p>Not so fast — there were two problems:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sometimes, the server would wake up without any network activity that I knew of</li>
  <li>Some period of time after the server went to sleep, it would become impossible to wake it again using network activity other than a magic packet</li>
</ol>

<p>A closer look at the same <a href="https://superuser.com/a/881802">superuser discussion above</a> revealed exactly the reason for the second problem: shortly after going to sleep, the machine was effectively disappearing from the network because it was no longer responding to ARP requests.</p>

<h3 id="arp">ARP</h3>
<p>So the cached ARP entry for other machines on the network was expiring, meaning that they had no way to resolve the server’s IP address to its MAC address. In other words, an attempt to ping my server at <code>192.168.1.2</code> was failing to even send a packet to the server, because the server’s MAC address wasn’t known. Without a packet being sent, there was no way that server was going to wake up.</p>

<h4 id="static-arp">Static ARP?</h4>
<p>My first reaction: let’s manually create ARP cache entries on each network client. This is indeed possible on macOS using:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo arp -s [IP address] [MAC address]
</code></pre></div>

<p>But it also didn’t meet the goal of having things “just work”: I was not interested in creating static ARP cache entries on <em>each machine that would be accessing the server.</em> On to other options.</p>

<h4 id="arp-protocol-offload">ARP protocol offload?</h4>
<p>Some more searching revealed something interesting: <em>this problem had already been solved long ago in the Windows world</em>.</p>

<p>It was called <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/protocol-offloads-for-ndis-power-management">ARP protocol offload</a>, and it goes like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The network hardware is capable of responding to ARP requests independently of the CPU</li>
  <li>Before going to sleep, the OS configures the network hardware to respond to ARP requests</li>
  <li>While sleeping, the <em>network hardware responds to ARP requests on its own, without waking the rest of the machine to use the CPU</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Voila, this was <em>exactly</em> what I needed. I even looked at the <a href="https://d2pgu9s4sfmw1s.cloudfront.net/UAM/Prod/Done/a062E00001XMS8AQAX/43d78a73-304e-3eca-7538-3fc09206489a?response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename*%3DUTF-8%27%27ethernet-connection-i219-datasheet.pdf&amp;Expires=1995244074&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJKRNIMMSNYXST6UA&amp;Signature=dK5A9fqmCPew9BQ-LJWUmVJiuMJS-LzwJJ7yGmSDbfM~dDDQSCcZec9F5Bw1qzxGofmV3q~-qZ8mDpd8DTHh3GZ~SrBwonS1SOwEwRiZ9K4J7Gg6no5lzV1ULV7-2WU49vrcUPetrNPVEuJhF670FFORzx-cbZntvnbqq1J36At8JJVEgIYJYyeMrfBJ~PSMzPRk9wXBtPMIKltSNVanQiywCUesHAVuHUl3NNw4GDNYGXoaPtYvgwaGxNfA-7vmOfzib0SalFGYWmhKftOPmLmj2Mj5RJh3kL7ktvRivnL7IDRuJ2XgVeM00jpugGgytDq3pkDlDhPMNNItyYpp2A__">datasheet for my network hardware</a>, which lists ARP Offload as a feature on the front page.</p>

<p>The only problem? <em>No Linux support</em>. I searched the far reaches of the internet, then finally dug into the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/fcd476ea6a888ef6e6627f4c21a2ea8cca3e9312/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000/e1000_ethtool.c#L1678">Linux driver source code</a> to find that ARP offload isn’t supported by the Linux driver. This was when I briefly pondered trying to patch the driver to add ARP offload… before reminding myself that successfully patching Linux driver code is far beyond what I could hope to achieve in a little free-time project like this one. (Though maybe one day…)</p>

<h4 id="other-solutions-using-magic-packets">Other solutions using magic packets</h4>
<p>Some more searching led me to some other clever and elaborate solutions involving magic packets. The basic idea was to automate sending magic packets. One solution (<a href="https://github.com/nikp123/wake-on-arp">wake-on-arp</a>) listens for ARP requests to a specified host to trigger sending a magic packet to that host. <a href="https://maximiliangolla.com/blog/2022-10-wol-plex-server/">Another solution</a> implements a web interface and Home Assistant integration to enable triggering a magic packet from a smartphone web browser. These are impressive, but I wanted something simpler that didn’t require manually waking up the server.</p>

<p>I considered a few other options, but abandoned them because they felt too complex and prone to breaking:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Writing a script to send a magic packet and then immediately trigger a Time Machine backup using <code>tmutil</code>. The script would need to be manually installed and scheduled to run periodically on each Mac.</li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy</a> to proxy all relevant network traffic through the Raspberry Pi and using a hook to send a magic packet to the server on activity.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="breakthrough-arp-stand-in">Breakthrough: ARP Stand-in</h4>
<p>What I was attempting didn’t seem much different from the static IP mapping that’s routinely configured on home routers, except that it was for DHCP instead of ARP. Was there no way to make my router do the same thing for ARP?</p>

<p>Some more digging into the ARP protocol revealed that ARP resolution doesn’t even require a specific, authoritative host to answer requests — <em>any other network device</em> can respond to ARP requests. In other words, my router didn’t need to be the one resolving ARP requests, it could be anything. Now how could I just set up <em>something</em> to respond on behalf of the sleeping server?</p>

<p>Here’s what I was trying to do:</p>

<p>I thought it must be possible to implement as a Linux network configuration, but the closest thing I found was <a href="https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO/lartc.bridging.proxy-arp.html">Proxy ARP</a>, which accomplished a different goal. So I went one level deeper, to network programming.</p>

<p>Now, how to go about listening for ARP request packets? This is apparently <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16710040/arp-request-and-reply-using-c-socket-programming">possible to do using a raw socket</a>, but I also knew that <code>tcpdump</code> and <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> were capable of using filters to capture only packets of a given type. That led me to look into <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap.3pcap.html">libpcap</a>, the library that powers both of those tools. I learned that using <code>libpcap</code> had a clear advantage over a raw socket: <code>libpcap</code> <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">implements very efficient filtering directly in the kernel</a>, whereas a raw socket would require manual packet filtering in user space, which is less performant.</p>

<p>Aiming to keep things simple, I decided to try writing the solution in Ruby, which led me to the <a href="https://github.com/pcaprub/pcaprub">pcaprub</a> Ruby bindings for <code>libpcap</code>. From there, I just needed to figure out what filter to use with <code>libpcap</code>. Some research and trial/error yielded this filter:</p>

<div><pre><code>arp and arp[6:2] == 1 and arp[24:4] == [IP address converted to hex]
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, using a target IP address of <code>192.168.1.2</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>arp and arp[6:2] == 1 and arp[24:4] == 0xc0a80102
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s break this down, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol#Packet_structure">ARP packet structure definition</a> for byte offets and lengths:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>arp</code> — ARP packets</li>
  <li><code>arp[6:2] == 1</code> — ARP <strong>request</strong> packets. <code>[6:2]</code> means “the 2 bytes found at byte offset 6”.</li>
  <li><code>arp[24:4] == [IP address converted to hex]</code> — ARP packets with the <strong>specified target address</strong>. <code>[24:4]</code> means “the 4 bytes found at byte offset 24”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest is pretty straightforward and <a href="https://github.com/danielpgross/arp_standin/blob/45ad9e6418a720cbd1213afd55f10399cb0a5944/lib/arp_standin.rb">the whole solution</a> comes out to only ~50 lines of Ruby code. In short, <code>arp_standin</code> is a daemon that does the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Starts up, taking these configuration options:
    <ul>
      <li>IP and MAC address of the machine it’s standing in for (the “target”)</li>
      <li>Network interface to operate on</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Listens for ARP requests for the target’s IP address</li>
  <li>On detecting an ARP request for the target’s IP address, responds with the target’s MAC address</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the server’s IP → MAC address mapping is defined statically through the <code>arp_standin</code> daemon’s configuration, it doesn’t matter if the Raspberry Pi’s ARP cache entry for the server is expired.</p>

<p>ARP is used in IPv4 and is replaced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbor_Discovery_Protocol">Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)</a> in IPv6. I don’t have any need for IPv6 right now, so I disabled IPv6 entirely on the server using the <a href="#disable-ipv6">steps shown above</a>. It should be possible to add support for Neighbor Discovery to the ARP-Standin service as a future enhancement.</p>

<p>With the new service running on my Raspberry Pi, I used Wireshark to confirm that ARP requests being sent to the server were triggering responses from the ARP Stand-in. It worked 🎉 — things were looking promising.</p>

<h2 id="getting-it-all-working">Getting it all working</h2>
<p>The big pieces were in place:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the server went to sleep after becoming idle</li>
  <li>the server could wake up from unicast packets</li>
  <li>other machines could resolve the server’s MAC address using ARP, long after it went to sleep</li>
</ul>

<p>With the ARP Stand-in running, I turned on the server and ran a backup from my computer. When the backup was finished, the server went to sleep automatically. But there was a problem: the server was waking up immediately after going to sleep.</p>

<h3 id="unwanted-wake-ups">Unwanted wake-ups</h3>

<p>First thing I checked was the Linux system logs, but these didn’t prove too helpful, since they didn’t show what network packet actually triggered the wakeup. Wireshark/tcpdump were no help here either, because they wouldn’t be running when the computer was sleeping. That’s when I thought to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_mirroring">port mirroring</a>: capturing packets from an intermediary device between the server and the rest of the network. After a brief, unsuccessful attempt to repurpose an extra router running OpenWRT, a search for the least expensive network switch with port mirroring support yielded the <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/ca/business-networking/easy-smart-switch/tl-sg105e/">TP-Link TL-SG105E</a> for ~$30.</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption>TL-SG105E: a simple, inexpensive switch with port-mirroring support</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With the switch connected and port mirroring enabled, I started capturing with Wireshark and the culprits immediately became clear:</p>

<ol>
  <li>My Mac, which was configured to use the server as a Time Machine backup host using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol">AFP</a>, was sending AFP packets to the server after it had gone to sleep</li>
  <li>My Netgear R7000, acting as a wireless access point, was sending frequent, unsolicited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS">NetBIOS</a> <code>NBTSTAT</code> queries to the server</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="eliminating-afp-packets">Eliminating AFP packets</h4>
<p>I had a hunch about why the Mac was sending these packets:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Mac mounted the AFP share to perform a Time Machine backup</li>
  <li>The Time Machine backup finished, but the share remained mounted</li>
  <li>The Mac was checking on the status of the share periodically, as would be done normally for a mounted network share</li>
</ul>

<p>I also had a corresponding hunch that the solution would be to make sure the share got unmounted before the server went to sleep, so that the Mac would no longer ping the server for its status afterwards. I figured that shutting down the AFP service would trigger unmounting of shares on all its clients, achieving the goal. Now I just needed to ensure the service would shut down when the server was going to sleep, then start again when it woke back up.</p>

<p>Fortunately, <code>systemd</code> supports exactly that, and relatively easily — I defined a dedicated <code>systemd</code> service to hook into sleep/wake events (<a href="#stop-services-on-sleep">check out the configuration shared above</a>). A Wireshark capture confirmed that it did the trick.</p>

<h4 id="eliminating-netbios-packets">Eliminating NetBIOS packets</h4>
<p>This one proved to be harder, because the packets were unsolicited — they seemed random and unrelated to any activity being done by the server. I thought they might be related to <a href="https://www.samba.org/samba/what_is_samba.html">Samba</a> services running on the server, but the packets persisted even after I completely removed Samba from the server.</p>

<p>Why was my network router sending NetBIOS requests, anyway? Turns out that Netgear routers have a feature called <a href="https://www.netgear.com/support/product/readyshare_usb_storage_access">ReadySHARE</a> for sharing USB devices over the network using the SMB protocol. Presumably, the router firmware uses Samba behind the scenes, which uses NetBIOS queries to build and maintain its own representation of NetBIOS hosts on the network. Easy — turn off ReadySHARE, right? Nope, there’s no way to do that in Netgear’s stock firmware 😒.</p>

<p>That led me to take the plunge and flash the router with open-source <a href="https://freshtomato.org/">FreshTomato</a> firmware. I’m glad I did, because the firmware is much better than the stock one anyway, and it immediately stopped the unwanted NetBIOS packets.</p>

<h3 id="time-machine-not-triggering-wake-up">Time Machine not triggering wake-up</h3>
<p>I was getting close now: the server remained asleep, and I could reliably wake it up by logging in with SSH, even long after it went to sleep.</p>

<p>This was great, but one thing wasn’t working: when starting a backup on my Mac, Time Machine would show a loading state indefinitely with <code>Connecting to backup disk...</code> and eventually give up. Was the server failing to wake up from packets the Mac was sending, or was the Mac not sending packets at all?</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://dgross.ca/assets/post-assets/linux-home-server-auto-sleep/time-machine-searching.png" alt="Time Machine dialog stuck in connecting state">
</figure>

<p>A port-mirrored Wireshark capture answered that question: the Mac wasn’t sending any packets to the server, even long after it started to say <code>Connecting to backup disk...</code>. Digging into the macOS Time Machine logs with:</p>

<div><pre><code>log show --style syslog --predicate 'senderImagePath contains[cd] "TimeMachine"' --info
</code></pre></div>

<p>A few entries made it clear:</p>
<div><pre><code>(TimeMachine) [com.apple.TimeMachine:Mounting] Attempting to mount 'afp://backup_mbp@homeserver._afpovertcp._tcp.local./tm_mbp'
...
(TimeMachine) [com.apple.TimeMachine:General] Failed to resolve CFNetServiceRef with name = homeserver type = _afpovertcp._tcp. domain = local.
</code></pre></div>

<p>The Mac was using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS">mDNS (a.k.a. Bonjour, Zeroconf)</a> to resolve the backup server’s IP address using its hostname. The server was asleep and therefore not responding to the requests, so the Mac was failing to resolve its IP address. This explained why the Mac wasn’t sending any packets to the server, leaving it asleep.</p>

<h4 id="mdns-stand-in">mDNS stand-in</h4>
<p>I already had an ARP stand-in service, now I needed my Raspberry Pi to also respond to mDNS queries for the server while it slept. I knew that <a href="https://www.avahi.org/">Avahi</a> was one of the main mDNS implementations for Linux. I first tried <a href="https://superuser.com/a/1540940/275869">these instructions</a> using <code>.service</code> files to configure my Raspberry Pi to respond to mDNS queries on behalf of the server. I used the following on the Mac to check the result:</p>
<div><pre><code>dns-sd -L homeserver _afpovertcp._tcp local
</code></pre></div>

<p>For some reason, that approach just didn’t work; Avahi didn’t respond on behalf of the server. I experimented instead with <code>avahi-publish</code> (<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/avahi-publish">man page</a>), which (to my pleasant surprise) worked right away using the following:</p>
<div><pre><code>avahi-publish -s homeserver _afpovertcp._tcp 548 -H homeserver.local
</code></pre></div>

<p>With that, I just needed to create a <code>systemd</code> service definition that would automatically run the <code>avahi-publish</code> command on boot (<a href="#avahi-publish">check out the configuration shared above</a>).</p>

<h2 id="-finish">🏁 Finish</h2>
<p>With all the wrinkles ironed out, everything has been working well now for over a month. I hope you’ve enjoyed following along and that this approach works for you too.</p>

More than a month passed before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi" data-link-name="in body link">FBI</a> arrived at his door on 15 July.</p><p>The 35-year-old, who used his GI Bill to earn a degree in sustainable communities from<strong> </strong>Sonoma State University<strong>, </strong>was set to move into a 3,000-sq-ft house that day, which he had bought with his girlfriend, a nurse and fellow Afghanistan war veteran, with the help of a loan backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p><p>Mavalwalla’s father, a retired US army intelligence officer with three Bronze Stars earned during tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, brought his truck for the occasion. He planned to move his son into a dream home in a bucolic, southern section of Spokane that was large enough to accommodate their blended family (Mavalwalla has one child; his girlfriend, Katelyn Gaston, has three) and solidify the couple’s life together.</p><figure id="6e16be26-a95c-4287-8ba0-888ba7794517" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.YoutubeBlockElement"><gu-island name="YoutubeBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;30879003-2aa6-4e6a-8fe2-d81f9dccae33&quot;,&quot;assetId&quot;:&quot;YyhqLKKxDUE&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:8,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0},&quot;isMainMedia&quot;:false,&quot;expired&quot;:false,&quot;posterImage&quot;:&quot;https://media.guim.co.uk/164e158a19c30e9876245dfb65f1e2de7dbe71ae/0_0_1920_1080/1920.jpg&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:154,&quot;mediaTitle&quot;:&quot;FBI arrests US army veteran for ‘conspiracy’ over protest against Ice –&nbsp;video&quot;,&quot;origin&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com&quot;,&quot;stickyVideos&quot;:false,&quot;enableAds&quot;:true,&quot;iconSizeOnDesktop&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;iconSizeOnMobile&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;hidePillOnMobile&quot;:false}"><div data-chromatic="ignore"><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="36" height="23" viewBox="0 0 36 23"><path d="M3.2 0l-3.2 3.3v16.4l3.3 3.3h18.7v-23h-18.8m30.4 1l-8.6 8v5l8.6 8h2.4v-21h-2.4"></path></svg></span><span>FBI arrests US army veteran for ‘conspiracy’ over protest against Ice –&nbsp;video</span></figcaption></div></gu-island></figure><p>But at 6am the FBI knocked on Mavalwalla’s door and they arrested him.

I’m an American citizen.”</p><p>At 3pm, Mavalwalla, who receives disability compensation for post traumatic stress disorder connected to his service in Afghanistan, appeared in federal court along with eight other people indicted in connection with a protest against an Ice transport that occurred a month earlier.</p><p>While the indictment alleges other protesters struck federal officers and let the air out of the tires of an Ice transport, Mavalwalla was not charged with obstruction or assault. Instead, he was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edwa/pr/defendants-charged-assaulting-federal-law-enforcement-officers-other-offenses-during" data-link-name="in body link">charged</a> with “conspiracy to impede or injure officers”.</p><p>According to the indictment, Mavalwalla and his co-defendants “physically blocked the drive-way of the federal facility and/or physically pushed against officers despite orders to disperse and efforts to remove them from the property”.</p><p>Mavalwalla, who has no criminal record, pleaded not guilty.</p><p>His family says Mavalwalla’s actions were motivated by a commitment to non-violent protest, which traces back to the family’s deep connection to the Indian independence leader, Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p>A one-minute video <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKz9feUPZJe/" data-link-name="in body link">posted on Instagram</a> shows the army veteran briefly jostle with an officer whose face is covered by a ski mask and sunglasses. Mavalwalla then locks arms with other demonstrators to block the gate.</p><p>The conspiracy count carries a maximum penalty of six years in prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release. He was released on his own recognizance while awaiting trial, with a judge even giving him permission to travel to Disneyland for a previously planned family vacation.</p><h2 id="hes-a-test-case-to-see-how-far-they-can-go">‘He’s a test case to see how far they can go’</h2><p>The US attorney’s office in Spokane, which brought the charges, declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation.</p><p>The indictment was handed down two days after career prosecutor Richard Barker, the acting US attorney for eastern Washington state, resigned. In a social post, Barker called his exit “a very difficult decision”.</p><p>“I am grateful that I never had to sign an indictment or file a brief that I didn’t believe in,” he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7350949196650213377/" data-link-name="in body link">wrote</a>.</p><p>The current acting US attorney, nominated for the permanent post by Donald Trump, is Pete Serrano, a former litigator for the Silent Majority Foundation, a conservative advocacy group. In February, Serrano <a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/6a12d959/files/uploaded/89-1.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">filed an amicus brief</a> in support of Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship, a position at odds with the 14th amendment.

But a federal conspiracy <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/372" data-link-name="in body link">charge</a> is a crime of intent. In this case, prosecutors would just have to prove that defendants agreed in concert to impede or injure an officer.</p><p>“He’s a test case to see how far they can go,” said Luis Miranda, a former chief spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security under Joe Biden.</p><h2 id="honest-direct-polite-and-very-trustworthy">‘Honest, direct, polite and very trustworthy’</h2><p>The charges against Mavalwalla sent shockwaves through a tight community of veterans with connections forged in Afghanistan that intensified after the bungled August 2021 US withdrawal. The fall of Kabul to the Taliban brought them together again to evacuate Afghans who worked alongside the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">US military</a>.</p><p>After his arrest, Mavalwalla’s commanding officer, Col Charles Hancock, who is retired, wrote on Facebook that he knew the trained crypto-linguist to be “honest, direct, polite and very trustworthy” and was “deeply concerned about the current state of affairs in our country”.</p><p>Koop, the retired colonel, said Mavalwalla put the diplomatic connections he gained due to his security clearance at the disposal of Koop’s translator, who escaped and otherwise might have been murdered by the Taliban. “It was no surprise to me that concern for the individual, human rights and safety would be right up Bajun’s portfolio and mindset,” Koop said.</p><p>As word spread that Mavalwalla knew how to rescue people in the frenetic days after the fall of Kabul, more people reached out.</p><p>When Erin Piper, the community director at a church in Livonia, Michigan, learned that a relative of one of her son’s friends had worked as a custodian on a US military base in Afghanistan, she called Mavalwalla to see if he could help bring over an extended family of aunts, uncles and siblings who had been left behind.</p><figure id="553b645f-26e6-42bc-af60-579683c76f5a" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-1"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1ebd41765378378d999eb2fb65a5c7a9e9f5c47/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1ebd41765378378d999eb2fb65a5c7a9e9f5c47/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1ebd41765378378d999eb2fb65a5c7a9e9f5c47/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1ebd41765378378d999eb2fb65a5c7a9e9f5c47/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1ebd41765378378d999eb2fb65a5c7a9e9f5c47/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1ebd41765378378d999eb2fb65a5c7a9e9f5c47/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="plane in sky as a group of people stand outside" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1ebd41765378378d999eb2fb65a5c7a9e9f5c47/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A military transport plane launches off while Afghans who cannot get into the airport to evacuate, watch and wonder while stranded outside, in Kabul, Afghanistan, on 23 August 2021. </span> Photograph: Marcus Yam/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Mavalwalla sprung into action, locating safe houses for 20 members of the former custodian’s extended family and at least a dozen other Afghan civilians whose family members collaborated with the US military, she said.

You don’t have to prove that people sat down together and made a pledge. You don’t even have to write up an agreement they have verbally, but you have to prove that these people agreed to act in concert,” he said.</p><p>Because of the law’s sweeping power, prosecutors typically use discretion, experts said.</p><p>“It seems like what we have here is an issue of selective prosecution,” Robert Chang, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said that will lead to a “chilling effect on free speech under the first amendment”.</p><figure id="6f07bf6a-bbc7-4193-a6f7-3afed0332ab9" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:46,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;How Trump has supercharged the immigration crackdown - in data&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;6f07bf6a-bbc7-4193-a6f7-3afed0332ab9&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/23/trump-ice-data-deportations-detention&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>Antkowiak said he expected the justice department to bring conspiracy charges more frequently in the months ahead, given the Trump administration’s desire for Ice agents to pursue an agenda of rapid deportations unhindered.</p><p>Jennifer Chacón, a Stanford University law professor who studies the intersection of immigration and criminal law, said she would not be surprised if Ice increased monitoring social media to bring more cases like the one against Mavalwalla.</p><p>“You could view this as an attempt to send a message to everyone who feels a sense of justice and moral outrage over Ice raids – you could face prosecution, too,” she said.</p><p>Mavalwalla’s mother, US army veteran Ellyn Mavalwalla, said her son did not know Stuckart, the former city councilman whose social media post sparked the demonstration, and only met him in jail on 15 July, after both were arrested on federal charges by the FBI.</p><p>His father, retired intelligence officer Bajun Ray Mavalwalla, said he believed his son had been racially profiled – that in reviewing footage from the demonstration, federal authorities had fixated on the demonstrator “with a funny name”.</p><p>He said he worried the United States was being “taken over by fascists”, but also that the promise of America that drew his family here generations ago would endure.</p><p>“My father left India on the deck of a boat, at 19 years old,” the elder Mavalwalla<strong> </strong>said. “He floated for six days across the Arabian Sea to Kuwait.

It said that the US “shall not make operational use of commercial spyware that poses significant counterintelligence or security risks to the United States government or significant risks of improper use by a foreign government or foreign person”. The Biden administration also took the extraordinary step of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/nso-group-pegasus-spyware-us-blacklist" data-link-name="in body link">placing one of Paragon’s rival spyware makers, NSO Group, on a commerce department blacklist</a>, saying the company had knowingly supplied foreign governments to “maliciously target” the phones of dissidents, human rights activists and journalists.</p><p>Paragon has sought to differentiate itself from NSO Group. It has said that, unlike NSO – which previously sold its spyware to Saudi Arabia and other regimes – that it only does business with democracies. It has also said it has a no tolerance policy and will cut off government clients who use the spyware to target members of civil society, such as journalists. Paragon refuses to disclose who its clients are and has said it does not have insight into how its clients use the technology against targets.</p><p>Spyware makers like Paragon and NSO have said their products are intended to be used to prevent crime and terrorist attacks.

She also called on Congress to step in and limit the circumstances in which spyware could be deployed.</p><p>“Spyware like Paragon’s Graphite poses a profound threat to free speech and privacy,” Farid Johnson said. “It has already been used against journalists, human rights advocates, and political dissidents around the world. The quiet lifting of the stop work order also raises the troubling prospect that parts of the executive branch are acting without adherence to the government’s own vetting requirements.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

    <p>In this interactive article, we will explore the physical phenomena that create light and the fundamental laws governing its interaction with matter. We will learn how our human eyes capture light and how our brains interpret it as visual information. We will then model approximations of these physical interactions and learn how to create physically realistic renderings of various materials.</p>
    <h2>Chapter 1: What is light?</h2>
    <p>We are all familiar with light: it’s the <em>thing</em> that allows us to see the world, distinguish colors and textures, and keeps the universe from being a dark, lifeless void. But precisely defining what light is has proven to be a tricky question.</p><p>Throughout history, many philosophers (and later, physicists) studied light in an effort to demystify its nature. Some ancient Greeks considered it to be one of the four fundamental elements that composed the universe: beams of fire emanating from our eyes.</p>
    <p>Descartes proposed that light behaved like waves, while Newton thought that it consisted of tiny particles of matter called corpuscles.</p>

    <p>Each of these more or less scientific theories explained some aspects of light's behavior, but none could account for all of them in a single, unified framework. That was until the 1920s when physicists came up with <strong>quantum electrodynamics</strong>. This theory is, as of now, the most accurate way to describe every interaction of light and matter.</p>

    <p>You can hover the diagram below to see which light's phenomena can be explained using each model:</p>

<div>
        <ul>
            <li id="phenomenon-1">Reflection / Refraction / Transmission</li>
            <li id="phenomenon-2">Diffraction</li>
            <li id="phenomenon-3">Interference</li>
            <li id="phenomenon-4">Polarization</li>
            <li id="phenomenon-5">Dispersion</li>
            <li id="phenomenon-6">Fluorescence</li>
            <li id="phenomenon-7">Phosphorescence</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    

    <p>For the purpose of computer graphics, the ray optics model is accurate enough at simulating light interactions. But for the sake of scientific curiosity, we will explore some aspects of the other models, starting with <strong>electromagnetism</strong>.</p>

    <h2>The Electric force</h2>
    <p>One of the fundamental properties of matter is the electric charge, and it comes in two types: <strong>positive</strong> and <strong>negative</strong>.<br>Charges determine how particles interact: charges of the same type repel each other, while opposite charges attract.</p>
    <p>The amount of force affecting two charged particles is calculated using <strong>Coulomb's law:</strong></p>
    


    <p>Where <span data="k_{e}"></span> is a constant, <span data="q_{1}"></span>  and <span data="q_{2}"></span> are the quantities of each charge, and <span data="r"></span> is the distance between them.</p>

    <p>You can <strong>drag around</strong> these charges to see how the electric force affects them:</p>
    
    <p>Every charge contributes to the <strong>electric field</strong>, it represents the force exerted on other charges at each point in space. We can visualize the electric field with a  or a  :</p><br>
    
    
    <p>Another way to visualize the electric field is by coloring each point in space with a <strong>color gradient</strong> representing the force experienced by a small charge at that point:
    </p>

    <h2>Special relativity and magnetism</h2>
    <p>Imagine a moving object carrying a <strong>positive electric charge</strong> placed under a cable carrying an electrical current.<br>
    From , the object and the negative charges in the wire are moving, and since the <strong>positive</strong> and <strong>negative</strong> charges in the cable compensate each other, the object doesn't experience any force.</p>
    <p>In the , it appears to be static alongside the <strong>negative</strong> charges, while the <strong>positive</strong> charges are moving to the left, and the object still doesn't get affected by any force.</p>
    <p>Now if we take into account , the moving charges in the wire appear "stretched" due to relativistic effects, causing a change in the distribution of charges. This stretching leads to a repulsive force between the object and the wire, which we interpret as <strong>magnetism.</strong></p>
    
    
    <h2>Maxwell's equations</h2>
    <p>Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are created and interact with each other. We will focus on the third and fourth equations.</p>
    <p>Maxwell's third equation, known as <strong>Faraday's law of induction</strong>, shows how changing magnetic fields can generate electric currents.<br>An example of this is moving a magnet inside a coil, which induces an electric current in the wire due to the changing magnetic field.</p>
    <p>This is the principle behind electric generators: Mechanical energy (like the flow of steam) is used to move magnets inside coils (a turbine), converting it to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction.</p>
    <p>By moving the magnet left and right, we can see the voltmeter picking up a current and the electric charges in the coil moving back and forth:</p>
    
    <div>
        <p><label>Show magnetic field</label><br>
            
        </p>
        <p><label>Slide the magnet</label><br>
        </p>
    </div>

    
    <p>Maxwell's fourth and final equation, <strong>Ampère's Law</strong>, illustrates how electric currents (moving charges) produce magnetic fields around them. This is the basis of how electromagnets function:</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Together, these laws demonstrate how electric and magnetic fields are interdependent. A changing magnetic field generates an electric field, and a changing electric field generates a magnetic field.</p>
    <p>This continuous cycle enables <strong>self-sustaining, self-propagating electromagnetic waves</strong>, which can travel through space without requiring a medium.</p>
    <h2>Electromagnetic radiation</h2>
    <p>Electromagnetic radiation consists of waves created by synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields. These waves travel at the speed of light in a vacuum.</p>
    <p>The <strong>amplitude</strong> of a wave determines the maximum strength of its electric or magnetic field. It represents the wave's intensity or "brightness". In quantum terms, a higher amplitude corresponds to a greater number of photons.</p>
    <p>The <strong>frequency</strong> of a wave determines the energy of the individual photons that compose it. Higher frequencies correspond to shorter wavelengths and more energetic photons.</p>
    
    <p><label>Amplitude</label>
    </p>
    <p><label>Frequency</label>
    </p>

    <p>When the wavelength falls between approximately 400 nm and 700 nm, the human eye perceives it as <strong>visible light</strong>.</p>
    <p>While other wavelengths are invisible to the human eye, many are quite familiar in everyday life.
For example, microwaves are used for Wi-Fi and cooking, X-rays are used in medical imaging, and radio waves enable communication.</p>
<p>Some insects, like bees, can see ultraviolet light, which helps them locate flowers by revealing hidden patterns and markings created by specialized pigments, such as flavonoids, that reflect UV wavelengths.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, gamma rays are highly energetic and can be dangerous, they are generated by radioactive decay, nuclear bombs, and space phenomena like supernovas.</p>
    
    <p><label>Frequency</label>
    </p>

    <h2>Generating Light</h2>
    <p>There are many ways for light to be generated, the two most common ones we encounter everyday are incandescence and electroluminescence.</p>

    <p><strong>Incandescence</strong> is the process by which a material emits visible light due to high temperature. It is how incandescent lightbulbs and the <strong>sun</strong> generates light.</p>
    <p>An incandescent lightbulb produces light through the heating of a filament until it starts glowing. The filament is made of <strong>tungsten</strong>, an element with a high melting point, high durability, and a positive temperature coefficient of resistance, which means its resistance increases with temperature.</p>

    <p>When we increase the current flowing through the filament, it starts heating up (Due to <strong>Joule heating</strong>), which increases the resistance in turn causing more heat to get dissipated. This feedback loop stabilizes at around 2500°C.</p>

    <p>This heat makes the electrons in the filament wiggle and collide with each other, releasing photons in the process. This radiation can be approximated as <strong>Black-body radiation</strong>.</p>



<p><label>Voltage</label>
</p>

<p><strong>The Sun</strong> also generates light by incandescence, but unlike the lightbulb's filament glowing via Joule heating, the Sun’s energy is produced by nuclear fusion in the core, where hydrogen nuclei fuse to form helium and release photons as gamma rays.</p><p>These photons travel from the core through the radiative zone, getting absorbed and remitted countless times while shifting to longer wavelengths. After hundreds of thousands of years of bouncing around, the photons make it to the surface of the Sun, called the photosphere, where they get radiated away.</p>
<p>Most (~49%) of the sun's emissions are in infrared, which is responsible for the heat we get on Earth, ~43% is visible light and the ~8% left is ultraviolet.</p>

<p>An interesting fact is that illustrations of the Sun's cross-section typically depict the interior with bright orange or yellow colors. However, if we could actually see a cross-section of the Sun, even the hottest regions like the core would appear dark and opaque, because the radiation generated there isn't in the visible spectrum.</p>





<p>Another way to generate light is by <strong>electroluminescence</strong>, this is the phenomenon that powers LEDs</p>

<p>The main component of a light-emitting diode is a semiconductor chip. Semiconductors are materials whose electrical conductivity can be modified by mixing them with impurities in a process known as <strong>doping</strong>.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of impurity (called the dopant) used in the mix, the semiconductor can be turned into either an <strong>n-type</strong>, which has extra electrons freely moving around, or a <strong>p-type</strong>, which has a lack of electrons and instead carrying an electron "hole", also moving around and acting as a positive charge.</p>

<p>When you stick a p-type and an n-type semiconductor side by side, they form a <strong>p-n junction</strong>. When a current flows through the junction, the electrons and the holes recombine and emit photons in the process.</p>


<p>Aside from incandescence and electroluminescence, which are the two most common sources of light we encounter in everyday life, light can come from other places. Some materials <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence">glow when exposed to ultraviolet radiation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorescence">others</a> absorb that radiation and re-emit it after some time. Some animals like fireflies use special <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase">enzymes</a> to produce light. You can read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminescence">this page</a> to learn more about other sources of luminescence.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Abstracting Away</h2>

<p>In the previous chapter, we examined the nature of light and the various methods by which it can be emitted, we will now focus on how it interacts with matter.</p>

<p>When a photon hits a material, it interacts with the electrons in the atoms and molecules of that material, then two things can happen, it can either be <strong>absorbed</strong> or <strong>scattered</strong>.</p>

<p>The electrons occupy <strong>atomic orbitals</strong>: regions around the nucleus of the atom where an electron is most likely to be found. A higher orbital corresponds to a higher energy level of the electron.</p>
<!-- <small>(Or in the case of molecules, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system">conjugated systems</a>)</small> -->

<p>If the photon has the energy needed to excite the electron to a higher energy level, the photon can be absorbed. Eventually the electron returns to a lower level and releases the energy as heat.</p>

<p>If the photon does not get absorbed, its electric field will make the electrons oscillate in return and generate <strong>secondary waves</strong> that interfere constructively and destructively with the photon waves in complicated ways.</p>

<p>We can simplify these complicated interactions by making a few assumptions about the material:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The material is <strong>homogeneous</strong>, as in the material has the same properties everywhere</li>
    <li>The material is a <strong>perfectly smooth</strong> surface</li>
</ul>
<p>We can use Maxwell's equations to show that such a perfect flat material splits the incoming light waves into two parts: <strong>reflected</strong> and <strong>refracted</strong>.</p>

<p>The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence relative to the normal of the surface, as per the <strong>law of reflection</strong>:</p>




<p>The angle of refraction is determined by how much slower (or faster) light travels through the material, that speed is defined by <strong>the index of refraction</strong>, and the angle is calculated using <strong>Snell's law</strong>:</p>




<br>
<div>
        
        
        
        <p><label>Angle <span data="\theta_{1}"></span></label><br>
        <label>Index of refraction <span data="n_{1}"></span></label><br>
        <label>Index of refraction <span data="n_{2}"></span></label><br>
    </p></div>


<p>At a  and refractive indices light is no longer refracted and seems to disappear.</p>

<p>The amount of light that is reflected and refracted is calculated using <strong>Fresnel equations</strong>.</p>

<p>However, computing the full Fresnel equation in real time can be slow, so in 1994 Christophe <strong>Schlick</strong> came up with an approximation.</p>
<p>First we compute the reflectance at zero degrees from the normal:</p>


<p>Then we plug <span data="R_{0}"></span> in the approximation function for the reflectance:</p>


<p>The transmitted (or refracted) light simply becomes:</p>


<div>
        
        
        <p><label>Angle <span data="\theta_{1}"></span></label>
        <label>Index of refraction <span data="n_{1}"></span></label>
        <label>Index of refraction <span data="n_{2}"></span></label>
    </p></div>

<p>If we try the  where the refracted ray disappeared, we can now see it getting reflected back inside the medium, this is called <strong>total internal reflection</strong>.</p>

<p>Total internal reflection gives rise to an interesting phenomenon called <strong>Snell's window</strong>. If you dive underwater and look up, the light above the surface is refracted through a circular window 96 degrees wide, and everything outside is a reflection of the bottom of the water.</p>


<p><label>Angle</label><br>
</p>


<p>This is what it looks underwater:</p>

<h2>The Microfacet Model</h2>

<p>Like we saw earlier, we can explain light reflecting and refracting using different models, depending on the size of the surface irregularities we are considering.</p>
<p>For example, wave optics explains light interacting with matter as light waves diffracting on the surface nanogeometry.</p>
<p>If we zoom out a bit and use ray optics, we consider light as straight line rays that reflect and refract on the surface microgeometry. With this model we can use the optical laws we described earlier: <strong>law of reflection, Snell's law, Fresnel equations</strong>.</p>
<p>Now for rendering, we can zoom out even further and consider one pixel at a time, each pixel contains many microgeometry surfaces that we call a <strong>microfacet</strong>. We can use a statistical average of the microfacets in a pixel to simulate the appearance of the surface at that pixel, without considering each individual microfacet which would be unfeasible in real time.</p>
<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <th>Size</th>
        <th>Model</th>
        <th>Phenomenon</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Nanogeometry</td>
        <td>Wave optics</td>
        <td>Light diffraction</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Microgeometry</td>
        <td>Ray optics</td>
        <td>Reflection/refraction, change in local normal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Macrogeometry</td>
        <td>BRDF</td>
        <td>Statistical average over a pixel, wider cone -&gt; more roughness</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Here we can see a microgeometry surface, changing the <strong>roughness</strong> makes it more bumpy and the microfacets normals aren't aligned anymore:</p>

<p><label>Roughness</label>
</p>

<p>At the macrogeometry level, a bigger roughness value means light rays have a wider cone where they can spread out. The function that describes this cone is called <strong>bidirectional reflectance distribution function</strong>, we will discuss it in the next chapter.</p>

<p><label>Roughness</label>
</p>

<p>In our microfacet model, we distinguish two types of materials by the nature of their interaction with light: <strong>metals</strong> and <strong>non-metals</strong>.</p>

<h2>Metals</h2>

<p>Metals have a sea of free electrons that absorb light very easily when the photons enter a few nanometers deep inside the surface. The light that isn't absorbed is reflected equally across the visible light spectrum, this is why metals have that distinct "silvery" gray color.</p>
<p>Notable exceptions are <strong>gold</strong>, <strong>copper</strong>, <strong>osmium</strong> and <strong>caesium</strong>.</p>



<p>Changing the roughness of a metal only changes its specular reflection, making it more or less mirror-like. But there is no diffuse reflection at all.</p>

<p><label>Roughness</label>
</p>

<h2>Non-metals</h2>

<p>Also called <strong>dielectrics</strong>, these are materials that do not conduct electricity (insulators). They include <strong>plastic, wood, glass, water, diamond, air...</strong></p>



<p>When a photon hits a dielectric material, it only gets absorbed if it's energy matches the electron's energy in the material. So light either gets reflected, and the specular reflection depends on the roughness of the surface.</p>
<p>The light can also get refracted inside the dielectric material, it bounces around and interacts with the pigments inside the material until it exits the surface, this is called <strong>diffuse reflection</strong>.</p>


<p><label>Roughness</label>
</p>

<h2>Spectral Power Distribution</h2>

<p>If we take the example of a <strong>red apple</strong>. When we shine a white light (which contains all visible wavelengths) on it, the apple's pigments (anthocyanins) absorb most of the wavelengths like <strong>violet</strong>, <strong>blue</strong> and <strong>green</strong> wavelengths, thus decreasing the intensity of those colors from the light. The remaining wavelengths, mostly <strong>red</strong>, gets scattered off the apple's surface making us perceive the apple as red.</p>



<p>We can characterize the incoming light by describing the amount of energy it carries at each wavelength using a function called the <strong>Spectral Power Distribution</strong> or <strong>SPD</strong> for short.</p>
<p>For example, below is the SPD for <a href="https://cie.co.at/datatable/cie-standard-illuminant-d65">D65</a>, a theoretical source of light standardized by The International Commission on Illumination (CIE). It represents the spectrum of average midday light in Western Europe or North America:</p>

<p>We can compare this SPD to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_mass_(solar_energy)#Cases">AM0</a>, which is the measured solar radiation in outer space before entering Earth's atmosphere. Notice the absence of a dip in the ultraviolet range:</p>


<p>And here is the SPD of a typical tungsten incandescent light:</p>


<h2>Spectral Reflectance Curve</h2>
<p>The SPD shows us how much of each "color" a light is composed of. Another interesting function we can look at is called the spectral reflectance curve, which shows the fraction of incident light reflected by an object at each wavelength, effectivly representing the color of said object.</p>
<p>Going back to our apple example, since it reflects most of its light in the red wavelength, its spectral reflectance curve might look like this:</p>


<p>The light we see is the combination of the light spectral power distribution with the object spectral reflectance.</p>
<p>If we shine a light on our red apple, depending on the wavelengths of the light, the final color we see changes. A  makes the apple appear red, because it's like multiplying the apple's color by one. We get the same result with a , because the apple reflects mostly in the red spectrum.<br>However if we shine a , besides the leaf, the rest of the apple doesn't reflect any light, thus appearing black.</p>
<p>On the top right you can see the SPD of the flashlight, under it the reflectance curve of the apple, and the resulting reflected light below it:</p>



<p>If we now add a banana and shine a , we can obviously tell the apple and the banana apart, one being red while the other is yellow.<br>But what happens when the light is ? Both objects appear reddish to our eyes, because the banana doesn't have any green light to reflect, making it lose its yellow color. This phenomenon is called <strong>metamerism</strong>.</p>
<p>You can display the  or the  :</p>





<p>There are different types of metamerism, depending on when it happens during the light transport process. The apple and banana example is called <strong>illuminant metamerism</strong>, where objects that reflect light differently appear the same under some specific illumination.</p>
<p><strong>Observer metamerism</strong> is when objects appear different between observers, a good example of this is <strong>colorblindness</strong>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3 : The Rendering equation</h2>
<br>

<br>
<ul>
<li><span data="L_{o}(p, \omega_{o})"></span> is the outgoing light at point <span data="p"></span> to the direction <span data="\omega_{o}"></span></li>
<li><span data="L_{i}(p, \omega_{i})"></span> is the incoming light at point <span data="p"></span> from the direction <span data="\omega_{i}"></span></li>
<li>The <strong>BRDF</strong> (Bidirectional reflectance distribution function) is a function that tells use how much of the incoming light <span data="\omega_{i}"></span> is reflected to the outgoing direction <span data="\omega_{o}"></span> at point <span data="p"></span>, this function characterizes the surface of our material.</li>
<li>The dot product is called the <strong>cosine term</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>The rendering equation gives us the light reflected towards a direction <span data="L_{o}"></span> at a point <span data="p"></span> by summing all the incoming lights <span data="L_{i}"></span> at that point coming from direction <span data="\omega_{i}"></span> in the hemisphere <span data="\Omega"></span>, weighted by the BRDF at that point and the cosine term.</p>

<p>Let's peel off this equation step by step, starting with the easiest part:</p>

<h2>Lambert's cosine law</h2>

<p>When a beam of light hits a surface, the area it touches is inversly proportional to the cosine of the angle of incidence. When the angle of incidence is , the area is at minimum and the intensity is concentrated, but the more  the angle gets, the larger the area and the intensity gets spread out.</p>



<p><label>Angle</label>
</p>

<h2>The BRDF</h2>

<p>The BRDF is arguably the most important part of the rendering equation, it characterizes the surface of our material and its appearance. This is where the we can apply the <strong>microfacet theory</strong> and energy conservation to make our rendering model <strong>physically based</strong>.</p>

<p>It takes as input the incoming <span data="\omega_{i}"></span> and outgoing <span data="\omega_{o}"></span> light direction, and the roughness of the surface <span data="\alpha"></span>. It equals the diffuse and the specular components weighted by their respective coefficients <span data="k_{d}"></span> and <span data="k_{s}"></span>.</p>
<p>There are many different BRDFs, the most common in realtime rendering is <strong>the Cook-Torrance</strong> specular microfacet model combined with <strong>Lambertian diffuse</strong> model.</p>



<p>The lambertian diffuse component is the diffuse color, called <strong>albedo</strong>, multiplied by the cosine factor. But since we already have the cosine factor in the rendering equation, the diffuse equation becomes: <span data="\frac{c}{\pi}"></span></p>



<p>The Cook-Torrance specular component itself has three components: the normal distribution function <span data="D"></span>, the geometric function <span data="G"></span> and the Fresnel equation <span data="F"></span>.</p>

<h2>Normal Distribution Function</h2>

<p>The normal distribution function is an approximation of the number of microfacets oriented in such a way that they will reflect light from the incoming direction <span data="\omega_{i}"></span> to the outgoing direction <span data="\omega_{o}"></span>.</p>

<p>The one we will use is the <strong>Trowbridge-Reitz GGX</strong> function:</p>



<p><span data="\omega_{h}"></span> is the halfway vector between the incoming and outgoing directions, we calculate it like this:</p>




<p><label>Roughness</label>
</p>

<h2>Geometric Function</h2>

<p>Some incoming rays get occluded by some microfacets before they get a chance to bounce off to the outgoing direction, this is called <strong>shadowing</strong>. Other rays get occluded by microfacets on their way to the outgoing direction, this is called <strong>masking</strong>. The geometric function approximates this effect.</p>

<p>Here we can see the <strong>shadowed</strong> rays in <strong>red</strong> and the <strong>masked</strong> rays in <strong>blue</strong>. The <strong>yellow</strong> rays succesfully reflected to the outgoing direction:</p>

<p><label>Angle</label>
</p>

<p>We will use the Schlick-GGX geometric function:</p>




<p>Where:</p>



<p><label>Roughness</label>
</p>

<h2>Fresnel Equation</h2>

<p>Like we discussed in the previous chapter, we will use the Fresnel-Schlick approximation which is fast for realtime rendering and accurate enough:</p>



<p><label>Base reflectance F<sub>0</sub></label>
</p>

<h2>Combining everything</h2>

<p>Now we can combine the diffuse and specular components to get our final PBR render:</p>


<p><label>Roughness</label>
    <label>Metallic</label>
    <label>Albedo</label>
</p>

<p>Here is a grid of spheres with different roughness and metallic values on each axis:</p>


<p>Usually the metallic values is either 0 or 1, but it is useful in PBR rendering to consider intermediate values to smoothly interpolate between metals and non-metals. Take this rusted metal material for example:</p>


<h2>To be continued...</h2>

<p>Physically based rendering is a very vast topic and there is a lot more to cover.</p>
<p>In the chapter about the physics of light, I omitted the quantum explanation of light's behaviour using probability amplitudes. We didn't talk about the double slit experiment or the wave-particle duality. I may cover this in the future when I learn more about it, for now I'll leave you with this quote from Richard Feynman's QED book:
</p><blockquote>The theory of quantum electrodynamics describes Nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And it agrees fully with experiment. So I hope you accept Nature as She is — absurd.</blockquote>


<p>We didn't talk about polarization and assumed all our light sources are unpolarized, this isn't very important for general rendering but can be useful for <a href="https://mitsuba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/src/rendering/polarized_rendering.html">research</a>.</p>

<p>We focused on surface rendering, in the future I will cover volume rendering, subsurface scattering, effects like optical dispersion, thin-film interference/iridescence...etc</p>

<p>There are a lot more implementation specific details. Whether we are implementing PBR in raytracing or rasterization, we need to use optimization techniques to make the rendering faster while still being accurate. Examples that come to mind are prefiltred envmaps and importance sampling (or efficient sampling in general).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Context</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">This practical walkthrough, designed as a short tutorial, was created upon joining AdaCore as a Field Engineer. In this new role, I’ll be working directly with customers to help them succeed with Ada. Although I was first introduced to the language nearly two decades ago, this new position inspired me to revisit its fundamentals, and I used the excellent <a href="https://learn.adacore.com/">https://learn.adacore.com</a> portal as a quick refresher.</p><p dir="ltr">While that platform takes a concept-based approach, I chose to complement it with a project-based method by developing a small, end-to-end Ada program that generates animated rosettas in the form of SVG files. These are technically hypotrochoid curves, producing patterns that many will recognize from the classic <em>Spirograph™ </em>toy.</p><p dir="ltr">In this walkthrough, we’ll show that Ada can be fun and easy to learn. Although the language is famous for <a href="https://www.adacore.com/about-ada">safety-critical systems</a>, we will use it as a modern, general-purpose programming language and try out some new features from Ada 2022 along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's dive in!</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>A brief note on Ada</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">This section leans a bit more into background context, with a slightly encyclopedic flavor that's especially useful for readers new to Ada. If you're already familiar with Ada’s history and principles, feel free to joyfully skip ahead to the next section!</p><p dir="ltr">Ada was created in the late 1970s after a call from the U.S. Department of Defense to unify its fragmented software landscape. The winning proposal became Ada, a language that's been literally battle-tested (!) and built on a deeply thought-out design that continues to evolve today.</p><p dir="ltr">While Ada is absolutely a general-purpose programming language, it has carved out a strong niche in fields where software correctness and reliability are mission-critical:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Embedded and real-time systems</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Aerospace and defense</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Rail, automotive, and aviation</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Any system where failure is not just a bug, but a risk</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Its strict compile-time checks, safety features, and clear structure make it particularly appealing when you need your software to be dependable from day one and still maintainable ten years later.</p><p dir="ltr">Ada's design is grounded in a strong and principled philosophy:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Readability over conciseness</strong>: Ada favors clarity. It avoids symbols and abbreviations in favor of full keywords, making the language more accessible and less error-prone.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Strong and explicit typing</strong>: It is extremely easy to declare new types in Ada, with precise constraints, which makes it much harder to accidentally misuse data. While some functional languages share this strong typing discipline, Ada stands out by requiring the programmer to be very explicit. It uses little to no type inference.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Explicit is better than implicit</strong>: Unlike many modern languages that prioritize convenience, Ada leans heavily toward precision. Most types must be explicitly named and matched.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Defined semantics and minimal undefined behavior</strong>: Ada offers a level of predictability and safety unmatched in many languages. This makes it a strong choice not only for safety-critical systems, but also for codebases where long-term maintenance, verifiability, and correctness are essential.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Compiler as a partner</strong>: Ada compilers are strict by design, not to frustrate, but to help the programmer write clearer, more correct code. This philosophy encourages the developer to communicate intent clearly, both to the compiler and to future readers.</p></li></ul><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>How the program works</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Sometimes the best way to figure out how something works is to start at the end. Let's do that!<br>In this tutorial, we'll walk through how the program produces its final output — a rosetta SVG file — and use that as a way to explore how Ada's structure, type system, and tooling come together.<br>This is a simple command-line program that generates an SVG file. You run it like this:</p><p dir="ltr">./bin/rosetta</p><p dir="ltr">The idea was to create something visual: learning is more fun when there's an immediate, satisfying result and generating rosettas fits that goal perfectly.</p><p dir="ltr"><br>Why SVG? Because it's a lightweight and portable vector format that you can view in any modern browser. I wanted to avoid relying on a graphical library, which would have added extra weight and gone beyond the scope of this approach. And while XML isn't the most pleasant format to write by hand, generating it from code is straightforward and gives a surprisingly clean result.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tooling &amp; setup</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">To build and run the project, I used Alire, the Ada package manager. It plays a similar role in the Ada ecosystem as Cargo does for Rust or npm for JavaScript. It's well-documented, and while we won't dive deep into it here, it's a solid and accessible way to manage Ada projects. I encourage anyone curious to get it from <a href="https://alire.ada.dev/">https://alire.ada.dev</a>. Interestingly, "Alire" is also the French expression for "à lire" — which means "for reading." A fitting name for a tool that supports a language so focused on clarity and readability!</p><p dir="ltr">Once Alire is set up, the natural next step is choosing where to write the code. You have two excellent options for your development environment. For a dedicated experience, you can download the latest release of <a href="https://github.com/AdaCore/gnatstudio/releases/">GNAT Studio</a> from its GitHub repository. If you prefer a more general-purpose editor, you can install the official <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AdaCore.ada">Ada &amp; SPARK for Visual Studio Code</a> extension from AdaCore.</p><p dir="ltr">As a new learner, I also kept <a href="https://learn.adacore.com/">https://learn.adacore.com</a> close at hand. It’s a particularly clear and comprehensive resource — and I especially appreciated being able to download the ebook version and read through it on my phone.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Entry point</strong></h2></div><pre><code>with Rosetta_Renderer;

procedure Main is
begin
   Rosetta_Renderer.Put_SVG_Rosettas;
end Main;</code></pre><div><p dir="ltr">There are several interesting things to notice right away:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">The <code>with </code>clause is not a preprocessor directive like in C or C++. It’s a compiled, checked reference to another package — a reliable and explicit way to express a dependency. This eliminates entire classes of bugs related to fragile <code>#include</code> chains, macro collisions, or dependency order issues.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">This <code>procedure</code> is not a <code>function</code>: it does not return a value. In Ada, procedures are used to perform actions (like printing or modifying state), and functions are used to compute and query values.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">The syntax is designed for readability. You’ll find <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> here instead of <var><code>{}</code></var> as in C/C++, reinforcing Ada’s philosophy that clarity matters more than brevity.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><code>Put_SVG_Rosettas</code> uses the idiomatic Pascal_Snake_Case naming style. This reflects a common Ada convention and avoids acronyms or compressed identifiers in favor of more descriptive names.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">The entry point is minimal but meaningful: it simply calls a procedure which generates the output we'll explore in the next sections.</p></li></ul><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Geometry and computation (package </strong><strong>Rosetta</strong><strong>)</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In Ada, a <strong>package </strong>is a modular unit that groups related types, procedures, and functions. Following the convention from GNAT (the Ada compiler, part of the GNU Compiler Collection, fondly known as GCC), each package has a <strong>specification file</strong> (with the<code> .ads</code> extension — short for <em>Ada Specification</em>) and an <strong>implementation file</strong> (with the <code>.adb</code> extension — short for <em>Ada Body</em>). This clear and enforced split means you always know where to find interface definitions versus their implementation.</p><p dir="ltr">The following code is the package specification for Rosetta. It defines the data types for the rosetta shapes and declares the public interface of operations available to manipulate them.</p></div><pre><code>with Ada.Strings.Text_Buffers;

package Rosetta is

   --  A mathematical description of a rosetta (specifically, a hypotrochoid).
   --  formed by tracing a point attached to a circle rolling inside another circle.
   type Hypotrochoid is record
      Outer_Radius : Float;     --  Radius of the fixed outer circle.
      Inner_Radius : Float;     --  Radius of the rolling inner circle.
      Pen_Offset   : Float;     --  From the center of the inner circle to the drawing point.
      Steps        : Positive;  --  Number of steps (points) used to approximate the curve.

   --  Computes the coordinates of the rosetta curve defined by Curve (a hypotrochoid).
   --  Returns a centered array of coordinates.
   function Compute_Points (Curve : Hypotrochoid) return Coordinate_Array;

end Rosetta;</code></pre><div><p dir="ltr">The <code>Rosetta</code> package is responsible for all the math and curve computation. It defines:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><code>Hypotrochoid</code>, type describing the geometry of the rosetta</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><code>Coordinate</code>, type representing points in 2D space</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><code>Coordinate_Array</code>, type holding a series of such points</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><code>Compute_Points</code>, function which calculates all the points of the curve based on the <code>Hypotrochoid</code> parameters and recenters them around the origin</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">This package is focused solely on computation. It doesn’t concern itself with how the result is rendered.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Fun fact for the curious: when the rolling circle rolls </em><strong><em>outside</em></strong><em> the fixed circle rather than inside, the resulting curve is called an epitrochoid.</em></p><p dir="ltr">In Ada, a <code>record</code> is similar to a <code>struct</code> in C or a class with only data members in other languages. It's a user-defined type composed of named components, making it ideal for modeling structured data.</p><p dir="ltr">Using a record for <code>Hypotrochoid</code> was particularly appropriate: it allows grouping all geometric parameters (outer radius, inner radius, pen offset, and steps) into a single, cohesive unit. This improves readability and maintainability. The compiler enforces correctness by ensuring all required values are present and of the expected type — reinforcing Ada’s philosophy of clarity and safety.</p><p dir="ltr">The type <code>Coordinate_Array</code> is an unconstrained array type that holds a range of <code>Coordinate</code> records. In this context, ‘unconstrained’ simply means that we don’t define the array’s size when we declare the type. Instead, the size is defined when we declare an object of that type. This gives us the flexibility to use this type for a variety of shapes.</p><p dir="ltr">You may also notice the use of <code>Natural range &lt;&gt;. Natural</code> is a predefined subtype of Integer that only allows non-negative values. And yes, I mean subtype: Ada’s powerful type system allows you to take an existing type and create a more specific, constrained version of it.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Highlights from the .adb file</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Here are a few notable aspects from the implementation (<code>rosetta.adb</code>) that illustrate Ada’s strengths for writing safe, clear, and structured code:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Declarative and modular design</strong>: Both <code>Generate_Point </code>and <code>Compute_Points</code> are pure functions that operate only on their inputs. Their behavior is fully deterministic and encapsulated.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Safe bounds and array handling</strong>: The <code>Points</code> array is statically bounded using <code>(0 .. Curve.Steps)</code>, and its access is strictly safe. The compiler ensures that any index outside this range would raise an error at runtime. This immediate error is a feature, not a bug. It stops silent memory corruption and security flaws by ensuring the program fails predictably and safely at the source of the problem.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Use of constants for robustness</strong>: Variables such as <code>Pi</code>, <code>R_Diff</code>, and Ratio are declared as constant, enforcing immutability. This helps ensure clarity of intent and prevents accidental reassignment, a common source of subtle bugs in more permissive languages. Ada encourages this explicit declaration style, promoting safer code.</p></li></ul></div><pre><code>with Ada.Numerics;

With the compiler switch <a href="https://docs.adacore.com/gnat_ugn-docs/html/gnat_ugn/gnat_ugn/building_executable_programs_with_gnat.html#style-checking">-gnaty</a>, you can enforce a comprehensive set of style rules, many of which are stricter than what you'd see in most languages.</p><p dir="ltr">This includes things like:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">No trailing whitespace at the end of lines</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">No consecutive blank lines</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Proper indentation and alignment of keywords and parameters</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">A space before “(“ when calling a procedure or function</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Consistent casing</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">At first, this can feel surprisingly strict. But once you get used to it, the benefits are clear: it helps enforce a consistent and clean coding style across a codebase. That in turn improves readability, reduces ambiguity, and leads to more maintainable programs.</p><p dir="ltr">Rather than leaving formatting up to personal taste or optional linter tools, Ada integrates this attention to detail into the compilation process itself. The result is not only more elegant: it's genuinely satisfying. And you can do even more with GNATcheck and GNATformat but it’s outside of the scope of this post.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Outputting to SVG (package </strong><strong><code>Rosetta_Renderer</code></strong><strong>)</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The Rosetta_Renderer package is responsible for producing the SVG output.

We're keeping it brief because its core is essentially the SVG plumbing required to draw and animate the curves, so we'll skip the fine details.

<p>Microsoft, the latest tech firm to agree to big software discounts for the US government, is digging even deeper into its bargain bin than the competition by offering a year of free Copilot access to government agencies willing to put up with its other problem products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/multibillion-dollar-gsa-onegov-agreement-with-microsoft-brings-steep-discounts-09022025" rel="nofollow">announced</a> its new deal with Microsoft on Tuesday, describing it as a "strategic partnership" that could save the federal government as much as $3.1 billion over the next year. The GSA didn't mention specific discount terms, but it said that services, including Microsoft 365, Azure cloud services, Dynamics 365, Entra ID Governance, and Microsoft Sentinel, will be cheaper than ever for feds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That, and Microsoft's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/18/microsoft_copilot_not_wanted/">next-gen Clippy</a>, also known as Copilot, is free to access for any agency with a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/government-plans-and-pricing" rel="nofollow">G5 contract</a> as part of the new deal, too. That free price undercuts Google's previously <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/21/google_govt_discount_ai/">cheapest-in-show</a> deal to inject Gemini into government agencies for just $0.47 for a year.</p>

    

<p>The GSA made this Microsoft deal as part of its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsa-unveils-onegov-strategy-04292025" rel="nofollow">OneGov</a> initiative, which seeks to centralize purchasing of products and services used across the government under a single contract. While the agency intends for OneGov to extend across the federal government, the first phase of the program focuses exclusively on IT contracts.&nbsp;</p>

        


        

<p>Though it only announced OneGov in April, the GSA has awarded contracts under the plan at a rapid pace, with Oracle the first firm to sign a deal in July. That agreement includes a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/08/gsa_oracle_deal/">75 percent discount</a> on its products to government agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The agency wrote many of the other OneGov contracts to get AI products into the hands of government agencies. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/06/google_openai_anthropic_us_gov_ai_deal/">OpenAI</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/12/gsa_inks_another_1dollar_onegov_deal/">Anthropic</a> both made deals with the GSA in August to provide a year of their services to agencies for $1 each, which Google undercut later last month.</p>

        

<p>Even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/13/boxs_ai_agent_us_gov/">Box made an AI discount deal</a> with the federal government, though it didn't disclose pricing. Outside of AI offerings, Amazon Web Services inked its own OneGov deal with the GSA to offer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/07/gsa_signs_1b_deal_with_aws/">discounted cloud services</a> through 2028.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the exception of AWS, all the other OneGov deals that have been announced so far have a very short shelf life, with most expirations at the end of 2026. Critics of the OneGov program have raised concerns that OneGov deals have set government agencies up for a new era of vendor lock-in not seen since the early cloud days, where one-year discounts leave agencies dependent on services that could suddenly become considerably more expensive by the end of next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nicholas Chaillan, former US Air Force and Space Force chief software officer and founder of AI firm Ask Sage, told <em>The Register</em> in a recent conversation that he's protested the OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google deals, accusing the GSA of undermining its own rules on fair and open competition for government-wide contracts.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>"Pricing this low is not about serving agencies – it's about forcing dependence on a single vendor, hiding future costs, and squeezing out fair competition," Chaillan told us in an email. "What looks cheap today will leave the government with higher costs, fewer options, and greater risk tomorrow."</p>
<p>Chillain told us that GSA hasn't made the OneGov contracts public so they could be scrutinized for any unfair elements. We've tried obtaining copies but the GSA hasn't acknowledged those requests. As with the other OneGov contracts, what happens to the discounts after the September 2026 end of the offering isn't clear.</p>
<p>The GSA's press release mentioned that discounted pricing will be available for "certain products" for up to 36 months, but the terms of those discounts or the specific products available weren't mentioned.&nbsp;Microsoft's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/09/02/accelerating-ai-adoption-for-the-us-government/">announcement</a> of its new OneGov deal said those extended discounts will save the government as much as $6 billion over three years.</p>
<p>The GSA didn't respond to questions for this story.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Microsoft gets rewarded for security failures – again</h3>
<p>Like other tech giants making OneGov deals, Microsoft will likely have to burn some capital to reap the monetary rewards from government agencies who grow dependent on its cheap or free software in the next year. Unlike those other tech giants making OneGov deals, however, Microsoft is yet again being rewarded by the US government with a pathway to profit after making a massive national security mistake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was mere days ago that we reported on the Pentagon's decision to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/29/pentagon_ends_microsofts_use_of/">formally bar</a> Microsoft from using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/28/microsoft_china_staffers_us_govt_cloud/">China-based engineers</a> to support sensitive cloud services deployed by the Defense Department, a practice Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called "mind-blowing" in a statement last week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there was last year's episodes that allowed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/03/cisa_microsoft_exchange_online_china_report/">Chinese</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/12/microsoft_cisa_order/">Russian</a> cyber spies to break into Exchange accounts used by high-level federal officials and steal a whole bunch of emails and other information. That incident, and plenty more before it, led former senior White House cyber policy director AJ Grotto to conclude that Microsoft was an honest-to-goodness <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/21/microsoft_national_security_risk/">national security threat</a>. None of that has mattered much, as the feds seem content to continue paying Microsoft for its services, despite wagging their finger at Redmond for "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/05/microsoft_government_contracts/">avoidable errors</a>."&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p>When it comes to government customers, using China-based support staff isn't Microsoft's only sin. The company had a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/21/massive_security_snafu_microsoft/">Sharepoint zero-day</a> that it only "partially" addressed with July security updates. Suspected state-backed hackers used that vuln to target an unspecified "major western government," per the company.</p>
<p>That, senior cybersecurity and counterterrorism advisor for the Clinton and Bush II administrations Roger Cressey <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/08/exwhite_house_cyber_and_counterterrorism/">told us</a> last month, is among the reasons he considers Microsoft to be a continual gift to America's foreign adversaries, as the Sharepoint issue is just "the latest episode of a decades-long process of Microsoft not taking security seriously."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The Chinese are so well prepared and positioned on Microsoft products that in the event of hostilities, we know for a fact that Chinese actors will target our critical infrastructure through Microsoft," Cressey told us in an interview last month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked what it had done to improve its security posture, Microsoft declined to answer any of our questions directly, instead pointing us to its press release about today's GSA deal, specifically its section on security.</p>
<p>Agencies are safe to adopt Microsoft software, the company said, because "these services have already achieved key FedRAMP security and compliance authorizations." FedRAMP is the government's security approval process for cloud software.</p>
<p>"Microsoft 365, Azure and our key AI services are authorized at FedRAMP High," the company statement says. "Microsoft 365 Copilot received provisional authorization from the US Department of Defense, with FedRAMP High expected soon."</p>
<p>That's not exactly reassuring considering Microsoft's products have <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/MSO365MT">variously</a> been <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/FR1824057433">authorized</a> for government use <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/F1209051525">for</a> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/F1603087869">years</a>, well before many of its recent security failings that affected federal agencies. ®</p>
