<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">A Y Combinator startup named PearAI launched <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/CodeFryingPan/status/1840203597478539477">with an X post thread </a>and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18cHBU05zK0">YouTube video</a> on Saturday and created immediate controversy. And some of that is splashing onto YC itself.</p>

<p>PearAI offers an AI coding editor. The startup’s founder Duke Pan has openly said that it’s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/trypear/pearai-app">a cloned copy</a> of another AI editor called Continue, which was covered under the Apache open source license. But PearAI made a major misstep: PearAI originally slapped its own made-up closed license on it, called the Pear Enterprise License, which Pan admitted was written by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/ns123abc/status/1840481220188111076/photo/1">ChatGPT.</a></p>

	
	


<p>Changing a license like this is a big deal in the open source world. Not only are there legalities involved in violating a software license, but it defeats the whole purpose of open source, which is about community building, sharing, and contributing. In an apology PearAI’s Pan posted <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/CodeFryingPan/status/1840831339337302204">on Monday</a>, he said that the project has now been released under the same Apache open source license as the original project.</p>

<p>The launch thread went viral with thousands of comments by Sunday. Some were congratulatory, but others were vicious in pointing out the licensing and the fact that PearAI wasn’t so much a fork with new stuff added, but a replica with a new name. Pan admitted as much in his apology.</p>

<p>So many angry comments were made on Pan’s launch thread that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/dejavucoder/status/1840445397002543442?t=Tn--wZgbxhMe-db1Dmcxvg&amp;s=19"> X put a community note</a> on it that read: “Pear is a fork of Continue.dev, an open-source AI code editor. PearAI used Continue.dev’s code and mass-replaced all references to ‘Continue’ to ‘PearAI’ to mislead people into believing that they built this product on their own.”</p>

<p>This note wasn’t accurate, either. PearAI did say in some of its materials that the project was a clone (also known as a fork) of Continue as well as the original project that Continued used, VSCode. X subsequently removed that note.</p>

<p>Pan apologized for how hard it was to find that information, too. He said that one way he and his cofounder, Nang Ang, “screwed up, critically, was not being clear enough about this … doing so upon a fork of others’ work without many new features, and talking about it so publicly online, made it look like we were stealing the work of others as our own.”</p>


	
	


<p>On Sunday, Continue jumped in with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/continuedev/status/1840601490827989368">by posting</a> a subtle threat that it was “ecstatic to see the ecosystem that has formed around us. But open source can’t be taken for granted—it is a movement built on trust, and on respect for contributions, licenses, and intellectual property.”</p>

	
	


<p>Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan got involved, too. He defended PearAI with several <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1840490867280498873">tweets</a>. “Don’t understand why people are dragging a new project when literally it’s open source Apache license and that’s *the reason* why open source is awesome” one read. As you might imagine, people pointed out that it was changed to an Apache license after the uproar.</p>

<p>There were other reasons this project caught ire. Pan boasted how he “just quit my 270 000$ job at Coinbase” to do this startup, even though this was about as far from an original idea as a startup can get. In addition to Continue, another big competitor is Cursor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?query=AI%20code%20editor">YC has funded two other AI code editors already, Void and Melty</a>, as the mob was quick to point out. To which Tan <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1840490996528029942">replied on X</a>, “More choice is good, people building is good, if you don’t like it don’t use it.”</p>

<p>Others criticized YC for selecting PearAI into its cohort at all. Blogger Sven Schnieders <a rel="nofollow" href="https://unfashionable.blog/p/yc/">wrote</a> that PearAI is an example of the “the decline of YC” because it accepted a company that is “nothing more than a codebase copied from another YC-backed company.”</p>

<p>On <a rel="nofollow" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41701265">Hacker News,</a> the site for programmers owned by YC, a commenter wrote that the debacle “says more about YC than this particular founder (lots of these types nowadays): i.e. their process, their due diligence.” Another wrote, “Is it typical for VC to just throw money at projects without any sort of oversight/auditing of, oh jeez, IDK, Licensing/Legal issues?”</p>

	
	


<p>YC’s plans to double from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/13/y-combinator-expanding-to-four-cohorts-a-year-in-2025/#:~:text=Silicon%20Valley%20startup%20accelerator%20Y,Thursday%2C%20and%20TechCrunch%20confirmed%20today.">two cohorts a year to four</a> isn’t likely to ease this perception, or this risk. </p>

<p>The whole uproar probably says as much about how eager all VCs are to fund AI startups as it does about YC’s love of this particular ilk of them.</p>

<p>Tan could not be immediately reached for comment. PearAI did not have further comment.</p>

<h3>Press Release</h3>


<p>26 September 2024</p>




<p>Astronomers have published a gigantic infrared map of the Milky Way containing more than 1.5 billion objects ― the most detailed one ever made. Using the European Southern Observatory’s VISTA telescope, the team monitored the central regions of our Galaxy over more than 13 years. At 500 terabytes of data, this is the largest observational project ever carried out with an ESO telescope.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>We made so many discoveries, we have changed the view of our Galaxy forever,</em>” says Dante Minniti, an astrophysicist at Universidad Andrés Bello in Chile who led the overall project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This record-breaking map comprises 200 000 images taken by ESO’s <a href="http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/surveytelescopes/vista/">VISTA</a> ― the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy. Located at ESO’s <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/">Paranal Observatory</a> in Chile, the telescope’s main purpose is to map large areas of the sky. The team used VISTA’s infrared camera <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/surveytelescopes/vista/camera/">VIRCAM</a>, which can peer through the dust and gas that permeates our galaxy. It is therefore able to see the radiation from the Milky Way’s most hidden places, opening a unique window onto our galactic surroundings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This gigantic dataset <a href="#1">[1]</a> covers an area of the sky equivalent to 8600 full moons, and contains about 10 times more objects than <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1242a/">a previous map released by the same team</a> back in 2012. It includes newborn stars, which are often embedded in dusty cocoons, and globular clusters –– dense groups of millions of the oldest stars in the Milky Way. Observing infrared light means VISTA can also spot very cold objects, which glow at these wavelengths, like brown dwarfs (‘failed’ stars that do not have sustained nuclear fusion) or free-floating planets that don’t orbit a star.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The observations began in 2010 and ended in the first half of 2023, spanning a total of 420 nights. By observing each patch of the sky many times, the team was able to not only determine the locations of these objects, but also track how they move and whether their brightness changes. They charted stars whose luminosity changes periodically that can be used as cosmic rulers for measuring distances <a href="#2">[2]</a>. This has given us an accurate 3D view of the inner regions of the Milky Way, which were previously hidden by dust. The researchers also tracked hypervelocity stars — fast-moving stars catapulted from the central region of the Milky Way after a close encounter with the supermassive black hole lurking there.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new map contains data gathered as part of the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea (<a href="https://vvvsurvey.org/about/about-vvv/">VVV</a>) survey <a href="#3">[3]</a> and its companion project, the VVV eXtended (VVVX) survey. “<em>The project was a monumental effort, made possible because we were surrounded by a great team</em>,” says Roberto Saito, an astrophysicist at the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina in Brazil and lead author of the paper published today in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em> on the completion of the project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The VVV and VVVX surveys have already led to more than 300 scientific articles. With the surveys now complete, the scientific exploration of the gathered data will continue for decades to come. Meanwhile, ESO’s Paranal Observatory is being prepared for the future: VISTA will be updated with its new instrument <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/surveytelescopes/vista/4most/">4MOST</a> and ESO's Very Large Telescope (<a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/">VLT</a>) will receive its <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/vlt-instr/moons/">MOONS</a> instrument. Together, they will provide <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/technology/spectroscopy/">spectra</a> of millions of the objects surveyed here, with countless discoveries to be expected.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3><p dir="ltr"><a name="1"></a>[1] The dataset is too large to release as a single image, but the processed data and objects catalogue can be accessed in the <a href="https://archive.eso.org/scienceportal/home">ESO Science Portal</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a name="2"></a>[2] One way to measure the distance to a star is by comparing how bright it appears as seen from Earth to how intrinsically bright it is; but the latter is often unknown. Certain types of stars change their brightness periodically, and there is a very strong connection between how quickly they do this and how intrinsically luminous they are. Measuring these fluctuations allows astronomers to work out how luminous these stars are, and therefore how far away they lie.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a name="3"></a>[3] Vía Láctea is the Latin name for the Milky Way.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The European Southern Observatory (ESO) enables scientists worldwide to discover the secrets of the Universe for the benefit of all. We design, build and operate world-class observatories on the ground — which astronomers use to tackle exciting questions and spread the fascination of astronomy — and promote international collaboration for astronomy. Established as an intergovernmental organisation in 1962, today ESO is supported by 16 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), along with the host state of Chile and with Australia as a Strategic Partner. ESO’s headquarters and its visitor centre and planetarium, the ESO Supernova, are located close to Munich in Germany, while the Chilean Atacama Desert, a marvellous place with unique conditions to observe the sky, hosts our telescopes. ESO operates three observing sites: La Silla, Paranal and Chajnantor. At Paranal, ESO operates the Very Large Telescope and its Very Large Telescope Interferometer, as well as survey telescopes such as VISTA. Also at Paranal ESO will host and operate the Cherenkov Telescope Array South, the world’s largest and most sensitive gamma-ray observatory. Together with international partners, ESO operates ALMA on Chajnantor, a facility that observes the skies in the millimetre and submillimetre range. At Cerro Armazones, near Paranal, we are building “the world’s biggest eye on the sky” — ESO’s Extremely Large Telescope. From our offices in Santiago, Chile we support our operations in the country and engage with Chilean partners and society.&nbsp;</p>

This meme is so true.

How can the boxed price of a game (or software) be the same as its Steam or digital version?

When you buy a game digitally, it never truly belongs to you; services like Steam or PS Store only allow you to download and play it.

20 years later, you can plug in your Atari cartridge and play, but you can’t be sure that Steam won’t go bankrupt and deactivate its servers. (Nintendo recently closed its shops, including for the 3DS, PSP servers are shut down, etc.)

Right now, if you want to feel nostalgic and buy and play Need for Speed Underground 2, there's nowhere you can do that because it’s abandonware, a forgotten software.

Thousands of people are dumping and archiving games, shows, and movies, trying to keep them accessible with their own means, while companies and lobbies label them as criminals.

Neither side is innocent—piracy is not theft, but let's admit, it is unfair. (I’m excluding small indie developers here as they are both affordable and individual creators.) The companies, with their excessive pricing, instead of selling their products once, turn them into SaaS with lifetime monthly subscriptions. They sell games for $60 and then add microtransactions, turning them into service games. Due to their greed, when things go wrong, they protect themselves and secretly keep the rights to leave you at a loss.

The streaming platforms, for which you pay full price, don’t even let you choose the quality of the movie you want to watch. What you watch today might disappear from all platforms in two months.

Without the people who dump and archive these contents, the old series you love so much could disappear forever.

We pay dozens of lira for five streaming platforms per month, yet they still force us to watch from hdfilmcehennemi.

Look, no one pirates music anymore—first thanks to the iTunes revolution and then Spotify. Pirated music is almost gone (you can check torrent sites’ seed ratios in music versus games and movies categories).

The reason for this is simple: these applications make you feel like the money you pay is truly worth it. You can access almost the entire world archive with a search, and at a really affordable price.

Because of reasons like this, the piracy problem is still not solved. The people who do it are content with their situation. Are they doing the right thing? No. But the companies whining about this should look at themselves before blaming the users.

                                        <p>PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Dockworkers at ports from Maine to Texas began walking picket lines early Tuesday in a strike over wages and automation that <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-retailers-ports-holiday-d926e9cfb3f10efb50af89d3c96bdc3d">could reignite inflation and cause shortages</a></span> of goods if it goes on more than a few weeks.</p><p>The contract between the ports and about 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen’s Association expired at midnight, and even though progress was reported in talks on Monday, the workers went on strike. The strike affecting 36 ports is the first by the union since 1977. </p><p>Workers began picketing at the Port of Philadelphia shortly after midnight, walking in a circle at a rail crossing outside the port and chanting “No work without a fair contract.”</p><p>The union had message boards on the side of a truck reading: “Automation Hurts Families: ILA Stands For Job Protection.”</p><p>Local ILA president Boise Butler said workers want a fair contract that doesn’t allow automation of their jobs.</p>
    

<p>Shipping companies made billions during the pandemic by charging high prices, he said. “Now we want them to pay back. They’re going to pay back,” Butler said.</p><p>He said the union will strike for as long as it needs to get a fair deal, and it has leverage over the companies. </p>



<p>“This is not something that you start and you stop,” he said. “We’re not weak,” he added, pointing to the union’s importance to the nation’s economy</p><p>At Port Houston, at least 50 workers started picketing around midnight local time carrying signs saying “No Work Without a Fair Contract.” </p>
    
<p>The U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports, said Monday evening that both sides had moved off of their previous wage offers. But no deal was reached.</p><p>The union’s opening offer in the talks was for <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-pay-automation-ports-jobs-consumers-3aa66e0a05db25a49645fad404a5f000">a 77% pay raise</a></span> over the six-year life of the contract, with President Harold Daggett saying it’s necessary to make up for inflation and years of small raises. ILA members make a base salary of about $81,000 per year, but some can pull in over $200,000 annually with large amounts of overtime.</p>
    

<p>But Monday evening, the alliance said it had increased its offer to 50% raises over six years, and it pledged to keep limits on automation in place from the old contract. The union wants a complete ban on automation. It wasn’t clear just how far apart both sides are.</p><p>“We are hopeful that this could allow us to fully resume collective bargaining around the other outstanding issues in an effort to reach an agreement,” the alliance statement said.</p><p>In a statement early Tuesday, the union said it rejected the alliance’s latest proposal because it “fell far short of what ILA rank-and-file members are demanding in wages and protections against automation.” The two sides had not held formal negotiations since June.</p><p>“We are prepared to fight as long as necessary, to stay out on strike for whatever period of time it takes, to get the wages and protections against automation our ILA members deserve,” Daggett said in the statement. “They must now meet our demands for this strike to end.”</p><p>The alliance said its offer tripled employer contributions to retirement plans and strengthened health care options.</p>
    

<p>Supply chain experts say consumers won’t see an immediate impact from the strike because most retailers stocked up on goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items. </p><p>But if it goes more than a few weeks, a work stoppage would significantly snarl the nation’s supply chain, potentially leading to higher prices and delays in goods reaching households and businesses. </p><p>If drawn out, the strike will force businesses to pay shippers for delays and cause some goods to arrive late for peak holiday shopping season — potentially <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-ports-pay-consumers-automation-october-77289c12bf3c3eff5e42cb6372126576">impacting delivery of anything</a></span> from toys or artificial Christmas trees to cars, coffee and fruit.</p><p>The strike will likely have an almost immediate impact on supplies of perishable imports like bananas, for example. The ports affected by the strike handle 3.8 million metric tons of bananas each year, or 75% of the nation’s supply, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.</p><p>It also could snarl exports from East Coast ports and create traffic jams at ports on the West Coast, where workers are represented by a different union. Railroads say they can ramp up to carry more freight from the West Coast, but analysts say they can’t move enough to make up for the closed Eastern ports. </p>
    

<p>“If the strikes go ahead, they will cause enormous delays across the supply chain, a ripple effect which will no doubt roll into 2025 and cause chaos across the industry,” noted Jay Dhokia, founder of supply chain management and logistics firm Pro3PL. </p><p>J.P. Morgan estimated that a strike that shuts down East and Gulf coast ports could cost the economy $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion per day, with some of that recovered over time after normal operations resume.</p><p>The strike comes just weeks before the presidential election and could become a factor if there are shortages. Retailers, auto parts suppliers and produce importers had hoped for a settlement or that President Joe Biden would intervene and end the strike using the Taft-Hartley Act, which allows him to seek an 80-day cooling off period. </p>
    

<p>But during an exchange with reporters on Sunday, Biden, who has worked to court union votes for Democrats, said “no” when asked if he planned to intervene in the potential work stoppage.</p><p>A White House official said Monday that at Biden’s direction, the administration has been in regular communication with the ILA and the alliance to keep the negotiations moving forward. The president directed Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard to convene the alliance’s board members Monday afternoon and urge them to resolve the dispute fairly and quickly — in a way that accounts for the success of shipping companies in recent years and contributions of union workers.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Krisher in reported from Detroit.

The only network requests for the receiver are to Apple. Quoting from a January 2021 Project Zero blog post⁽¹⁾ on BlastDoor:</p><p><i>As an example, consider what happens when a user sends a link to a website over iMessage. In that case, the sending device will first render a preview of the webpage and collect some metadata about it (such as the title and page description), then pack those fields into an NSKeyedArchiver archive. This archive is then encrypted with a temporary key and uploaded to the iCloud servers. Finally, the link as well as the decryption key are sent to the receiver as part of the iMessage. In order to create a useful user notification about the incoming iMessage, this data has to be processed by the receiver on a 0-click code path. As that again involves a fair amount of complexity, it is also done inside BlastDoor: after receiving the BlastDoor reply from above and realizing that the message contains an attachment, imagent first instructs IMTransferAgent to download and decrypt the iCloud attachment.</i></p><p>⁽¹⁾ <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/a-look-at-imessage-in-ios-14.html" rel="nofollow">https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/a-look-at-ime...</a></p></div></td></tr>

I sincerely doubt that is even the case for the major providers such as Outlook or Gmail. And yeah, per comments downthread, my Android Messages app has "read/unread" and that's really the only thing that "opening a text" changes. There's no additional execution or activation like opening or executing a file.</p>

There's plenty of legal entities that still will call you. If you answer, be polite, play the dope a bit to get the necessary unfortunately, ask how they got the number, then request a manager (yes, they have one, they will tell you they don't. Be polite but insist). When you get the manager politely ask for the company details, then tell them to immediately remove you from their list. Their business can be shut down for violations so once they know you know, they take you seriously (FCC takes reports more seriously when more detailed). They'll probably hang up on you, this is okay. Report them anyways (do this legal or not. They can get their voip removed and whatever shell they're using. It's still annoying for them and they might remove you because you're not worth it)</p><p>Second, don't answer phone calls. It is a practice to call, listen for a voice, then log that number as active.</p><p>Text messages are more difficult. It depends on the service but you can probably text stop. The difficulty of blocking is that legit services will use the same number to text you verification codes (can we fucking kill sms 2FA‽)</p><p>You can also sign up for a relay service (I use Firefox, but use whatever). I do this for email and every website has a unique email. Things like + for Gmail don't work and are filtered. You can also do this for phone numbers but it's more expensive.</p><p>Fourth, aggressively unsubscribe, report to FCC, change settings on devices, and so on. Do this for your non-tech savvy friends and family. Get them to use services like signal that are privacy preserving, don't leak metadata, AND is easy enough Grandma can use. Install ublock origin into their browsers and some other privacy preserving stuff and edit settings. Get them to use Firefox instead of Chrome if you can.</p><p>You need to do this to others because they will leak your information (most of my information leak comes from my parents. I even get emails in their names...)</p><p>If you want to take a step further, get a scrubbing service like optery. There's a lot of shady shit so be careful who you pick.</p><p>Edit: you can do a similar thing for mail. There is a $5 processing fee. Sucks, but sadly it's junk mail that keeps the post office alive (do not put "return to sender" unless it's prepaid. You need to give a reason otherwise your postal worker is just being nice and throwing it away for you.

This doesn’t report the message to the government agencies but just your carrier, so they can hopefully punish the platforms sending spam.</p><p>Use a site like <a href="https://www.freecarrierlookup.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.freecarrierlookup.com/</a> to see which carrier or platform sent it, which is useful for the next step of reporting offenders.</p><p>Now report the incident at the FTC and FCC websites. Do this <i>every single time</i> so it eventually creates difficulties for the platforms enabling this. Mention the carrier or platform carrying the spam. Put in all the details correctly.</p><p><a href="https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/" rel="nofollow">https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/</a></p><p><a href="https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new" rel="nofollow">https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new</a></p><p>If it is an iMessage you should use the built in “report junk” feature.</p><p>You can also go to the website of the platform that carried the message to report things through their abuse reporting pages, but not all of them are diligent. Some are happy taking money from spammers to abuse you, and will make you keep reporting each phone number that spams you because they do nothing about it except block that one number from contacting you. They won’t fix the underlying root cause of why they have all these illegal abusers as customers.</p><p>My personal experience is that the vast majority of text spam comes from a few offending text messaging platforms - for example Sinch (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinch_AB" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinch_AB</a>) and Bandwidth (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_Inc" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_Inc</a>.) for example. These are potentially seemingly commercial platforms for spammers. Note that Sinch owns Mailgun and Mailjet too and has a long documented history of legal trouble due to spamming. Businesses should avoid using these platforms because their own reputation and delivery will be affected by being mixed with spammers.</p></div></td></tr>

          <h2>Boris Vallejo and the Pixel Art of the Demoscene</h2>
          <p>
            As an epic fantasy painter, Boris Vallejo had a great influence on 1980s and 90s fantasy book covers, computer game box art, and the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demoscene</a>. Through the decades, his works have been replicated by pixel artists. This article features fantasy art history, demoscene drama, and a lot of pixel art fun creating a Boris Vallejo imitation graphic using only four colors.
          </p>
          <p>October 2024</p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/axe-warrior-combo.jpg" alt="Left, the full painting by Boris Vallejo. Right, the line art version with only four colors."><br>
            <em>
              On the left, the original painting "Gillkarth's Odyssey" by Boris Vallejo. On the right, is my line art
              recreation using only four colors. I call it "Wrath of the Vallerian" (after Boris Vallejo).
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            Recently, I was going through the historical results of the <a href="https://www.demoparty.net/revision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revision</a> demoparty, as you do. I was looking
            for a subject to draw for a new pixel art piece. I had learned to appreciate the color limitations during
            the old-school graphics competition at <a href="https://www.demoparty.net/evoke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evoke</a>, where we could only use a predefined color palette. The
            first time I submitted an entry in 2022, I hated it. The second time, in 2023, I came to accept the
            limited color palette as a problem to solve. And by 2024, I actually started to enjoy the challenge.
          </p>
          <p>I wanted to create a new piece outside of competition and was looking for inspiration.</p>
          <p>
            In the
            <a href="https://2013.revision-party.net/history/2013.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results.txt</a>
            file of Revision 2013, I found an interesting phrase. Right above the list of results for the graphics
            competition, it said:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              "GRAPHICS COMPETITIONS HAVEN'T BEEN<br>
              THE SAME EVER SINCE PEOPLE STOPPED<br>
              RIPPING BORIS VALLEJO AND SORAYAMA"</em>
          </p>
          <h2 id="vallejo-01">Whatever Happened to Boris Vallejo?</h2>
          <p>
            I hadn't thought of Peruvian artist <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Vallejo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boris Vallejo</a> in ages. I remembered his slick fantasy artwork,
            featuring idealistically rendered warriors and princesses, muscular and scantily clad (but not indecent).
            If they weren't battling monsters, the figures wouldn't look out of place in a romance novel. Vallejo's
            paintings were always beautifully done, but they're a bit out of fashion these days.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/dragon-riders.jpg" alt="A group of scantily clad young women on the backs of dragons flying in the sky"><br>
            <em> Boris Vallejo, "Dragon Riders", 1982 </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Pixel artists copied his work in the late 1980s and 1990s. Vallejo's visual aesthetic was one that many
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demoscene</a> groups sought to replicate or pay homage to on the new 16-bit platforms like the Commodore
            Amiga, the Atari ST, and the PC with its wonderful VGA graphics.
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/john-carter.jpg" alt="John Carter and the Princess of Mars confronting a four-armed giant white ape"><br>
            <em>Boris Vallejo and Julie Bell, "John Carter of Mars", 2009</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            Vallejo's art was filled with heroic characters, often set in mythical or alien worlds, similar to the
            themes explored in many demoscene productions. Demos in the 1990s, especially on platforms like the Amiga,
            frequently featured surreal landscapes, epic narratives, and fantastical characters reminiscent of
            Vallejo's paintings.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a time when I loved Vallejo's art. It was a fascinating blend of imagination and breathtaking
            realism, with vivid portrayals of fantasy worlds populated by powerful, heroic figures and fantastical
            creatures. Vallejo's mastery of anatomy and attention to detail brought his subjects to life. I used to
            feel a true sense of awe and wonder when looking at his paintings. Back then, I felt that his work struck
            a balance between strength and beauty, craftsmanship and adventure.

            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            These days, I'm not so sure. I've grown older, and my tastes have changed. I still admire Vallejo's work,
            but now I find it a bit too slick, idealized, and repetitive. I've come to appreciate rougher, more
            abstract, and more experimental art styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked up Boris Vallejo, and by all accounts, he is in his 80s, alive and well. He collaborates with his artist wife <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julie
            Bell</a>, continues to produce and successfully sell their artwork online:
            <a href="https://www.borisjulie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">borisjulie.com</a>.</p>
          <p>Yet, while
            reminiscing about Vallejo's paintings, I realized I might have found a topic for a drawing.
          </p>

          <h2 id="vallejo-02">The Appropriation of Popular Art by Sceners</h2>

          <p>
            As of September 2024,
            <a href="https://demozoo.org/productions/tagged/boris-vallejo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 35 images</a>
            submitted by sceners on Demozoo are tagged with "boris-vallejo" though the tagging is probably not comprehensive. Given his significant influence on the demoscene,
            Boris Vallejo even has entries on both
            <a href="https://demozoo.org/sceners/91415/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demozoo.org</a> and
            <a href="http://janeway.exotica.org.uk/author.php?id=2112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">janeway.exotica.org</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/edge-of-tomorrow.jpg" alt="Boris Vallejo's cover of the book Edge of Tomorrow was used in the demo Hardwired by The Silents and Kefrens"><br>

            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            The other artist mentioned in the results.txt was the Japanese artist <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajime_Sorayama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hajime Sorayama</a>. He is best known
            for his hyper-realistic erotic robots and cyborgs. His work explores the fusion of man and machine, often
            focusing on eroticism, fetishism, and the beauty of artificial forms. Sorayama rose to international fame
            in the 1980s and has influenced various fields, from fine art to commercial design, including
            contributions to film, music, and fashion. For the young men in the demoscene, this was a perfect
            combination.

            Over the years, Boris Vallejo and his long-time collaborator Julie Bell had other intersections with
            computers in the 1990s. They painted box art for computer and video games such as the fantasy role-playing
            game <em>Dragon Wars</em>, the platform shooter <em>Turrican</em>, the side-scrolling fantasy beat-'em-up
            <em>Golden Axe</em>, and the delightful underwater adventure <em>Ecco the Dolphin</em>. Here is a
            <a href="https://vgdensetsu.net/2_BorisVallejo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of computer and video game box art credits by Boris Vallejo</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vallejo's influence on sceners was unquestionable. Below are more examples of Vallejo's artwork used in
            demoscene productions. Many of these artworks were digitized or scanned, which doesn't require any
            artistry. It's a cheap and easy way to get good graphics for a demo.

              has a number of obvious scans (left) of Vallejo's paintings, e.g. the harpy kissing a woman (right).
              Turtletronic could pull off this scan or capture because their slideshow uses Amiga's HAM mode that
              allows the nearly unrestricted use of all of the Amiga's 4,096 color.

            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/swipe2.jpg" alt="A copy of Vallejo's art by Archmage"><br>
            <em>
              I also believe that

              recreated the painting by Boris Vallejo (right) by hand-pixelling it in a painting program. The face of
              the woman in the center is angled differently and trees in the background look differnt.
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            Scanned paintings are quite controversial in the scene. In a blog post by a scener called <em>Danny</em>,
            who used to work for the computer game company Eidos Interactive, he does not like the practice of using scanned images of paintings and then declaring them as your own work. But he also does not find critics great who condemn sceners who copy paintings but delare that they are copies. He even
            wrote that it is the main reason he left the scene and would no longer submit any graphics for
            competitions. His post,
            <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/disint.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disintegration Of The Old Graphics Scene</a>, is worth reading. He wrote it in 1998, making it a reflection of that time period in the demoscene.
          </p>

            Some of <em>Danny's</em> arguments sound distressingly familiar nowadays in the context of AI-generated
            art. In his post, he wrote:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              "There are quite a number of artists (even some famous ones that get much respect) that have practiced
              so long on making a scanned image look hand drawn, that their lame efforts have become almost
              undetectable. There is almost no way of telling if the image is created through blood, sweat, and tears,
              or the powers of modern-day technology.
            </em>
          </p>

<p><em>Danny</em> does not outright condemn or defend copying. He just does not fully discount its value in a hobbyist community like the demoscene as long as it is clear that a work is a reproduction of another work. This is for me the culmination of his text:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
"My point is that everybody copies. Some do it to learn, others do it to grasp a bit of fame in a very challenging environment. It's not just the artists that copy, it's the whole bloody scene. And everyone that makes any form of art. Artists just get all the crap for it because it's easiest to spot."

            <em>The history of the Amiga demoscene is paved with Vallejo immitations.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            Some graphics based on Vallejo paintings were actually pixel painted by the sceners, as can be seen in
            this article in
            <a href="https://www.editions64k.fr/product/demoscene-the-amiga-years-vol-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demoscene: the Amiga Years. Volume 1 1984-1993</a>
            by Éditions64k. This requires artistry and dedication.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/suny.jpg" alt="Suny's Vallejo"><br>
            <em>The Éditions64K book features three pages about the process that Suny used to hand-pixel a recreation of a Vallejo painting on the Commodore Amiga.</em>
          </p>

<p>It is amazing how many demoscene pixel artists in the 1990s got their inspiration or motives from Boris Vallejo. <em>Suny</em> wrote in the Éditions64K book about the Amiga demoscene:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
"My main influence was Boris Vallejo who seems to have inspired a lot of artists at the time. I then got interested in design, photography, painting and animation."
</em>
</blockquote>

<p>Then <em>Suny</em> went on to close out his section of the Éditions64K book with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
"With time, I realized I was not a real artist. I had rached a very good technical level and could reproduce an existing image perfectly. However, this is not the definition of an artist, and I am not super creative. This is why I became a Technical Artist in the video game industry, and now I am working at Apple."
</em>
</blockquote>

<p>This started out somewhat discouraging, but then we see that his meticulous reproductions of Vallejo’s work and other pixel art helped him find his strengths and discover new professional roles.</p>

          <p>
            In a post on
            <a href="https://m.pouet.net/topic.php?which=9040&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pouet.net</a>,
            user <em>friol</em> asked what the point of re-drawing paintings by others actually is. He even
            specifically refered to sceners who copy Boris Vallejo's work:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              "Oh well... I knew the demoscene was ripping Boris Vallejo, but not that much (we are talking of at
              least of one hundred pictures). But while some pictures are... I would call them "re-elaborations",
              others are 1-1 copies.<p>
              
              What's the point of that?"
            </p></em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Another user, <em>gaspode</em> replied to <em>friol's</em> post:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              "That's the dark side of the scene, I think. I can not understand why obviously talented people copy
              pictures nearly 1:1. Even if they were re-drawn or re-pixeled or whatever, they are still copys for me
              (because the idea, colors and structure was stolen). Other people apparently don't have problems with
              that but for me everytime I discover such a thing my respect for the copying artist decreases and first
              of all I cannot enjoy their future artworks anymore, cause I always think they could have been copied."
            </em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This opinion is well-supported by many sceners. User <em>ok3anos</em> pointed out that there is another
            side to copying artwork as long as the original artist gets credited:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              "Well, consider this: In painting, masters have always been copied by the apprentices to let them learn
              the basis techniques.<br>
              It does not disturb me at all to see pixel artists copying Boris Vallejo or others to increase their
              pixel technique as long as the original artist is credited in a way or another.<br>
              Would be more annoying if some of the works were just simple scans reworked a bit (which I suspect
              some...)</em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            <em>ok3anos</em> reply can be interpreted as a defense of copying artwork as long as the scener remains
            honest. A link can be found in this thread on pouet that points to the
            <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-Copy site</a>. You can find a
            gallery of images created by sceners but copied from other artists. There are a lot of examples of swiped
            Vallejo art.
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/no-copy.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the No Copy website showing how a scener copied Vallejo's painting of a merman and a mermaid copulating"><br>
            <em>The <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-Copy</a> website. If we
              disregard for a moment that there are so many examples of swipes of Vallejo's merman and mermaid image,
              and look closely at this particular copy, then we can see that it looks like an actual painstaking
              recreation and not a scan (though this is only my personal feeling).</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            The first thing that strikes me, just looking at the swipes on the
            <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-Copy</a> site, is how often
            Vallejo's painting of the merman and the mermaid was copied. I never wanted to know what it looks like
            when merpeople have sex. The second thing that strikes me is that many of the graphics definitely look
            like full scans or collages of partial scans.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet, I think some of them are not scans but incredible reproductions. If my suspicion is true, I
            personally believe it takes a lot of craft to reproduce a painting as pixel art with the comparatively low
            resolution and limited color palette of a Commodore Amiga or a PC with VGA graphics. The most commonly
            used graphics mode for a regular Amiga was 320 x 256 with 32 colors (or 64 colors if extra halfbrite mode
            was used). The later AGA chipset in the Amiga 1200 and 4000 had a graphics mode comparable to the PC's VGA
            graphics. When the <a href="http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No-Copy</a> site
            was published in the second half of the 1990s, the most common VGA mode used for pixel graphics was 320 x
            200 with 256 colors, though some people used the higher resolution of 640 x 480, also with 256 colors. It
            takes patience and a lot of precision to copy Vallejo's art in a pixel paint program like
            <em>Deluxe Paint</em> or <em>Brilliance</em>.
          </p>

<p>My journey through Vallejo's influence on the demoscene brought me to the essay <a href="https://tarnkappe.info/jurassic-pack/an-original-picture-253480.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Original Picture</a> written in 2007 by <em>Lars <a href="https://demozoo.org/sceners/10963/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghandy</a> Sobiraj</em>, the main editor of the longest running Amiga diskmag <a href="https://demozoo.org/productions/tagged/jurassic-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jurassic Pack</a>. He is very critical of pixel artists and graphicians who copy art or photos. He not only condemns scans but even folks who hand pixel their graphics based on someone else's paintings. He mentions a traditional, analog technique in which a grid is overlaid on both the original image and the drawing surface. This allows the copying artist to focus on replicating one small part at a time. This method ensured accurate proportions and alignment, helping the artist recreate the image in precise detail. However, he does not consider this technique to be high art.</p>

<p>Lars Sobiraj writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
"The biggest shame with copied motives are the artists never telling others if it was copied or not. They just secretly hope not to be discovered by the scene police."
</em>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually support this statement. If you copy something, then make it clear that you are. This is the bile-filled finale of <em>Lars Sobiraj's</em> essay, like a curse upon copying artists (the spelling is unchanged from the original):</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
"Here is a last message from me: You took the express road for your success. But you are worthless peace of junk. No own fantasies, using grids, copying ideas. Damn lame. You will never develop yourself, and even if you get place #1 in the charts or by your scene friends, that is nothing compared to real life true graphicians based on the bigger world outside the scene.<p>
(b)lame yourself"
</p></em>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand the feeling of betrayal one might feel when confronted with artists who so obviously cheat. Yet I feel that this is also a bit too harsh.</p>

          <p>
            All that being said, I don't think copying Vallejo's art is reprehensible as long as you credit the
            original artist and learn something from the recreation, perhaps by altering it enough to make it
            distinct.
          </p>

<p>
Criticizing other artists for copying the works of Boris Vallejo becomes somewhat ironic when we consider Vallejo's own creative process. Vallejo often uses models and bodybuilders as references, photographing them in specific poses, and then using these images as a foundation for his paintings. In this way, imitation plays a significant role even in his artistic method.</p>

<p>However, what distinguishes Vallejo is his remarkable ability to synthesize and transform these real-life references into something new and beautiful through his extraordinary skill with paint and brush. His artistry lies not just in copying but in elevating these references into highly imaginative and dynamic works, blending realism with fantasy. This process shows that while imitation may be part of art, true creativity comes from how those references are interpreted and reimagined.

          <h2 id="vallejo-03">How I Learned Not To Worry And Love Color Limitations</h2>
 
          <p>
            I wanted to copy a Vallejo painting in my own style, using a super limited color palette. And, of course,
            I'd give credit to good ole Boris! But first, I need to wax poetic about the beauty of limited color
            palettes.
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://marincomics.com/img/vallejo/ochre-palette.jpg" alt="The four shades of ochre that I wanted to use for my recreation of a Vallejo painting"><br>
            <em>I chose to use only these four colors for my recreation of a Vallejo painting.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            I used to paint pixel art on an Atari ST, which was limited to 16 colors on screen at the same time from a
            palette of 512 available shades. I always found this limiting and frustrating, especially considering that
            the Atari ST's main competitor, the Commodore Amiga, could display 32 and even 64 colors from 4,096
            available shades.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then, I started participating in graphics competitions at demoparties, using ridiculously limited six- to
            eight-color palettes. That's when I discovered an interesting challenge.
          </p>

          <p>
            There's something exciting about working within a limited color palette. I found that the constraints
            forced me to focus more on composition, shapes, and contrast. I had to make the most of the few colors I
            had.
          </p>

          <p>
            It might be unfair to call the limited color palette required for the Evoke graphics compo "old school"
            (or "old skool," if you're too cool for "school"). There are no restrictions on resolution, meaning I can
            use much higher resolutions than any retro "old school" machine was capable of. The results can look quite
            modern, and the style can be deliberately atmospheric due to the limited color palette.
          </p>

          <p>
            So I decided to challenge myself by limiting a drawing to four colors. As a callback to the old days of
            the demoscene, I used a Boris Vallejo painting as my model. I chose Vallejo's "Gillkarth's Odyssey (The
            Axe Man)" from 1998. I used Procreate on my iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil. I absolutely adore Procreate.
            It is a phenomenally frictionless and intuitive painting tool.
          </p>

          <p>
            I ended up quite happy with my copy of it as line art. After a few dead ends in coloring, I was also
            pleased with how it turned out using only four colors.

                <em>Step 4</em>
              </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            There was one odd thing I only realized while making the drawing: I have no idea what the barbarian fellow
            in the center is swinging his axe at. It might be that he's trying to chop into the snake, which is
            actually facing away from him and minding its own business. Or maybe he's attacking the viewer of the
            image. It could even be that he's being influenced by the two demon-like creatures behind him to attack.
            In the original image, his eyes are red, as though he's possessed. To this day, I don't know what this
            person is up to.
          </p>

          <p>
            I actually only learned that he's <em>not</em> Conan after I had started the drawing. I asked on the
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConanTheBarbarian/comments/1fribzp/when_did_boris_vallejo_paint_this_picture_of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conan Reddit,</a>
            if anyone had more information about the painting, and I was quickly corrected. Reddit user <em>mattmirth</em> provided the real name of the paintin. And another user wrote: <em>"Every Boris Vallejo painting is Conan, he just doesn't know it. /s".</em> This comment got the most upvotes.
          </p>

          <p>
            I had a lot of fun drawing this piece. I learned a lot about working within color limitations and how to
            make the most of them. I also rekindled my appreciation for the art of Boris Vallejo. While I might not be
            a fan of his work anymore, I can see why he was so popular and influential. I understand why so many pixel
            artists copied his work.

<h2>borg 1.2.x/1.4.x to borg 2.0<a href="#borg-1-2-x-1-4-x-to-borg-2-0" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Compatibility notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>this is a major “breaking” release that is not compatible with existing repos.</p>
<p>We tried to put all the necessary “breaking” changes into this release, so we
hopefully do not need another breaking release in the near future. The changes
were necessary for improved security, improved speed and parallelism,
unblocking future improvements, getting rid of legacy crap and design
limitations, having less and simpler code to maintain.</p>
<p>You can use “borg transfer” to transfer archives from borg 1.2/1.4 repos to
a new borg 2.0 repo, but it will need some time and space.</p>
<p>Before using “borg transfer”, you must have upgraded to borg &gt;= 1.2.6 (or
another borg version that was patched to fix CVE-2023-CVE-2023-36811) and
you must have followed the upgrade instructions at top of the change log
relating to manifest and archive TAMs (borg2 just requires these TAMs now).</p>
</li>
<li><p>command line syntax was changed, scripts and wrappers will need changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you will usually either export BORG_REPO=&lt;MYREPO&gt; into your environment or
call borg like: “borg -r &lt;MYREPO&gt; &lt;COMMAND&gt;”.
in the docs, we usually omit “-r …” for brevity.</p></li>
<li><p>the scp-style REPO syntax was removed, please use <a href="ssh://">ssh://</a>…, #6697</p></li>
<li><p><a href="ssh://">ssh://</a> URLs: removed support for /~otheruser/, #6855.
If you used this, just replace it by: <a href="ssh://user@host:port/home/otheruser/">ssh://user@host:port/home/otheruser/</a></p></li>
<li><p>-P / --prefix option was removed, please use the similar -a / --match-archives.</p></li>
<li><p>archive names don’t need to be unique anymore. to the contrary:
it is now strongly recommended to use the identical name for borg create
within the same series of archives to make borg work more efficiently.
the name now identifies a series of archive, to identify a single archive
please use aid:&lt;archive-hash-prefix&gt;, e.g.: borg delete aid:d34db33f</p></li>
<li><p>the archive id is always given separately from the repository
(differently than with borg 1.x you must not give repo::archive).</p></li>
<li><p>the series name or archive id is either given as a positional parameter,
like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>borg create documents ~/Documents</p></li>
<li><p>borg diff aid:deadbeef aid:d34db33f</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>or, if the command makes sense for an arbitrary amount of archives, archives
can be selected using a glob pattern, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>borg delete -a ‘sh:myarchive-2024-??-??’</p></li>
<li><p>borg recreate -a ‘sh:myarchive-2024-??-??’</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>some borg 1.x commands that supported working on a repo AND on an archive
were split into 2 commands, some others were renamed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>borg 2 repo commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>borg repo-create  # was: borg init</p></li>
<li><p>borg repo-list</p></li>
<li><p>borg repo-info</p></li>
<li><p>borg repo-delete</p></li>
<li><p>borg repo-compress</p></li>
<li><p>borg repo-space</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>borg 2 archive commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>borg create NAME …</p></li>
<li><p>borg list ID</p></li>
<li><p>borg extract ID …</p></li>
<li><p>borg diff ID1 ID2</p></li>
<li><p>borg rename ID NEWNAME</p></li>
<li><p>borg info ID</p></li>
<li><p>borg delete ID</p></li>
<li><p>borg recreate ID …</p></li>
<li><p>borg mount -a ID mountpoint …</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details, please consult the docs or --help option output.</p>
</li>
<li><p>create/recreate/import-tar --timestamp: defaults to local timezone
now (was: UTC)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>some deprecated options were removed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>removed --remote-ratelimit (use --upload-ratelimit)</p></li>
<li><p>removed --numeric-owner (use --numeric-ids)</p></li>
<li><p>removed --nobsdflags (use --noflags)</p></li>
<li><p>removed --noatime (default now, see also --atime)</p></li>
<li><p>removed --save-space option (does not change behaviour)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>removed --bypass-lock option</p></li>
<li><p>removed borg config command (only worked locally anyway)</p></li>
<li><p>using --list together with --progress is now disallowed (except with --log-json), #7219</p></li>
<li><p>the --glob-archives option was renamed to --match-archives (the short option
name -a is unchanged) and extended to support different pattern styles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>id: for identical string match (this is the new default!)</p></li>
<li><p>sh: for shell pattern / globbing match (this was used by --glob-archives)</p></li>
<li><p>re: for regular expression match</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So you might need to edit your scripts like e.g.:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>borg</span> <span>1.</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>--</span><span>glob</span><span>-</span><span>archives</span> <span>'myserver-2024-*'</span>
<span>borg</span> <span>2.0</span><span>:</span> <span>--</span><span>match</span><span>-</span><span>archives</span> <span>'sh:myserver-2024-*'</span>
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>use platformdirs 3.x.x instead of home-grown code. Due to that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>XDG_*_HOME is not honoured on macOS and on Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>BORG_BASE_DIR can still be used to enforce some base dir + .config/ or .cache/.</p></li>
<li><p>the default macOS config and cache dir will now be in ~/Library/Application Support/borg/.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>create: different included/excluded status chars, #7321</p>
<ul>
<li><p>dry-run: now uses “+” (was: “-”) and “-” (was: “x”) for included/excluded status</p></li>
<li><p>non-dry-run: now uses “-” (was: “x”) for excluded files</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Option --filter=… might need an update, if you filter for the status chars
that were changed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>borg is now more strict and disallows giving some options multiple times -
if that makes no sense. Highlander options, see #6269. That might make scripts
fail now that somehow “worked” before (but maybe didn’t work as intended due to
the contradicting options).</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="version-2-0-0b11-2024-09-26">
<h2>Version 2.0.0b11 (2024-09-26)<a href="#version-2-0-0b11-2024-09-26" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Please note:</p>
<p>Beta releases are only for testing on NEW repos - do not use for production.</p>
<p>For upgrade and compatibility hints, please also read the section “Upgrade Notes”
above.</p>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Support rclone:// URLs for borg repositories.</p>
<p>This enables 70+ cloud storage products, including Amazon S3, Backblaze B2,
Ceph, Dropbox, ftp(s), Google Cloud Storage, Google Drive, Microsoft Azure,
Microsoft OneDrive, OpenStack Swift, pCloud, Seafile, sftp, SMB / CIFS and
WebDAV!</p>
<p>See <a href="https://rclone.org/">https://rclone.org/</a> for more details.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Parallel operations in same repo from same client (same user/machine).</p></li>
<li><p>Archive series feature, #7930.</p>
<p>TL;DR: a NAME now identifies a series of identically named archives,
to identify a specific single archive, use aid:&lt;archive hash&gt;.</p>
<p>in borg 1.x, we used to put a timestamp into the archive name, because borg1
required unique archive names.</p>
<p>borg2 does not require unique archive names, but it encourages you to even
use a identical archive names within the same SERIES of archives, e.g. you
could backup user files to archives named “user-files” and system files to
archives named “system-files”.
that makes matching (e.g. for prune, for the files cache, …) much simpler
and borg now KNOWS which archives belong to the same series (because they all
have the same name).</p>
</li>
<li><p>info/delete/prune: allow positional NAME argument, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>borg prune --keep-daily 30 &lt;seriesname&gt;</p></li>
<li><p>borg delete aid:&lt;archive hash&gt;</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>create: also archive inode number, #8362</p>
<p>Borg can use this when using archive series to rebuild the local files cache
from the previous archive (of the same series) in the repository.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove superfluous repository.list() call. for high latency repos
(like sftp, cloud), this improves performance of borg check and compact.</p></li>
<li><p>repository.list: refresh lock more frequently</p></li>
<li><p>misc. commands fixed for non-unique archive names</p></li>
<li><p>remote: allow get_manifest method</p></li>
<li><p>files cache: fix rare race condition with data loss potential, #3536</p></li>
<li><p>storelocking: misc. fixes / cleanups</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cache the chunks index in the repository, #8397.
Improves high latency repo performance for most commands compared to b10.</p></li>
<li><p>repo-compress: faster by using chunks index rather than repository.list().</p></li>
<li><p>Files cache entries now have both ctime AND mtime.</p></li>
<li><p>Borg updates the ctime and mtime of known and “unchanged” files, #4915.</p></li>
<li><p>Rebuild files cache from previous archive in same series, #8385.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce RAM usage by splitting the files cache by archive series, #5658.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove AdHocCache, remove BORG_CACHE_IMPL (we only have one implementation).</p></li>
<li><p>Docs: user@ and :port are optional in sftp and ssh URLs.</p></li>
<li><p>CI: re-enable windows build after fixing it.</p></li>
<li><p>Upgrade pyinstaller to 6.10.0.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase IDS_PER_CHUNK, #6945.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.0b10 (2024-09-09)<a href="#version-2-0-0b10-2024-09-09" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>borgstore based repository, file:, ssh: and sftp: for now, more possible.</p></li>
<li><p>repository stores objects separately now, not using segment files.
this has more fs overhead, but needs much less I/O because no segment
files compaction is required anymore. also, no repository index is
needed anymore because we can directly find the objects by their ID.</p></li>
<li><p>locking: new borgstore based repository locking with automatic stale
lock removal (if lock does not get refreshed, if lock owner process is dead).</p></li>
<li><p>simultaneous repository access for many borg commands except check/compact.
the cache lock for adhocwithfiles is still exclusive though, so use
BORG_CACHE_IMPL=adhoc if you want to try that out using only 1 machine
and 1 user (that implementation doesn’t use a cache lock). When using
multiple client machines or users, it also works with the default cache.</p></li>
<li><p>delete/prune: much quicker now and can be undone.</p></li>
<li><p>check --repair --undelete-archives: bring archives back from the dead.</p></li>
<li><p>repo-space: manage reserved space in repository (avoid dead-end situation if
repository filesystem runs full).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bugs/issues fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a lot! all linked from PR #8332.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>repository: remove transactions, solved differently and much simpler now
(convergence and write order primarily).</p></li>
<li><p>repository: replaced precise reference counting with “object exists in repo?”
and “garbage collection of unused objects”.</p></li>
<li><p>cache: remove transactions, remove chunks cache.
removed LocalCache, BORG_CACHE_IMPL=local, solving all related issues.
as in beta 9, adhowwithfiles is the default implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>compact: needs the borg key now (run it clientside), -v gives nice stats.</p></li>
<li><p>transfer: archive transfers from borg 1.x need the --from-borg1 option</p></li>
<li><p>check: reimplemented / bigger changes.</p></li>
<li><p>code: got rid of a metric ton of not needed complexity.
when borg does not need to read borg 1.x repos/archives anymore, after
users have transferred their archives, even much more can be removed.</p></li>
<li><p>docs: updated / removed outdated stuff</p></li>
<li><p>renamed r* commands to repo-*</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.0b9 (2024-07-20)<a href="#version-2-0-0b9-2024-07-20" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>add BORG_CACHE_IMPL, default is “adhocwithfiles” to test the new cache
implementation, featuring an adhoc non-persistent chunks cache and a
persistent files cache. See the docs for other values.</p>
<p>Requires to run “borg check --repair --archives-only” to delete orphaned
chunks before running “borg compact” to free space! These orphans are
expected due to the simplified refcounting with the AdHocFilesCache.</p>
</li>
<li><p>make BORG_EXIT_CODES=”modern” the default, #8110</p></li>
<li><p>add BORG_USE_CHUNKS_ARCHIVE env var, #8280</p></li>
<li><p>automatically rebuild cache on exception, #5213</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fix Ctrl-C / SIGINT behaviour for pyinstaller-made binaries, #8155</p></li>
<li><p>delete: fix error handling with Ctrl-C</p></li>
<li><p>rcompress: fix error handling with Ctrl-C</p></li>
<li><p>delete: fix error handling when no archive is specified, #8256</p></li>

<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>create: add the slashdot hack, update docs, #4685</p></li>
<li><p>BORG_EXIT_CODES=modern: optional more specific return codes (for errors and warnings).</p>
<p>The default value of this new environment variable is “legacy”, which should result in
a behaviour similar to borg 1.2 and older (only using rc 0, 1 and 2).
“modern” exit codes are much more specific (see the internals/frontends docs).</p>
</li>
<li><p>implement “borg version” (shows client and server version), #7829</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>docs: CVE-2023-36811 upgrade steps: consider checkpoint archives, #7802</p></li>
<li><p>check/compact: fix spurious reappearance of orphan chunks since borg 1.2, #6687 -
this consists of 2 fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>for existing chunks: check --repair: recreate shadow index, #7897 #6687</p></li>
<li><p>for newly created chunks: update shadow index when doing a double-put, #7896 #5661</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have experienced issue #6687, you may want to run borg check --repair
after upgrading to borg 1.2.7 to recreate the shadow index and get rid of the
issue for existing chunks.</p>

<h2>Version 2.0.0a3 (2022-07-04)<a href="#version-2-0-0a3-2022-07-04" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>check repo version, accept old repos only for --other-repo (e.g. rcreate/transfer).
v2 is the default repo version for borg 2.0. v1 repos must only be used in a
read-only way, e.g. for --other-repo=V1_REPO with borg init and borg transfer!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>transfer: --upgrader=NoOp is the default.
This is to support general-purpose transfer of archives between related borg2
repos.</p></li>
<li><p>transfer: --upgrader=From12To20 must be used to transfer (and convert) archives
from borg 1.2 repos to borg 2.0 repos.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>removed some deprecated options</p></li>
<li><p>removed -P (aka --prefix) option, #6806. The option -a (aka --glob-archives)
can be used for same purpose and is more powerful, e.g.: -a ‘PREFIX*’</p></li>
<li><p>rcreate: always use argon2 kdf for new repos, #6820</p></li>
<li><p>rcreate: remove legacy encryption modes for new repos, #6490</p></li>

<h2>Version 2.0.0a2 (2022-06-26)<a href="#version-2-0-0a2-2022-06-26" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>split repo and archive name into separate args, #948</p>
<ul>
<li><p>use -r or --repo or BORG_REPO env var to give the repository</p></li>
<li><p>use --other-repo or BORG_OTHER_REPO to give another repo (e.g. borg transfer)</p></li>
<li><p>use positional argument for archive name or <cite>-a ARCH_GLOB</cite></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>remove support for scp-style repo specification, use <a href="ssh://">ssh://</a>…</p></li>
<li><p>simplify stats output: repo ops -&gt; repo stats, archive ops -&gt; archive stats</p></li>
<li><p>repository index: add payload size (==csize) and flags to NSIndex entries</p></li>
<li><p>repository index: set/query flags, iteration over flagged items (NSIndex)</p></li>
<li><p>repository: sync write file in get_fd</p></li>
<li><p>stats: deduplicated size now, was deduplicated compressed size in borg 1.x</p></li>
<li><p>remove csize support at most places in the code (chunks index, stats, get_size,
Item.chunks)</p></li>
<li><p>replace problematic/ugly hardlink_master approach of borg 1.x by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>symmetric hlid (all hardlinks pointing to same inode have same hlid)</p></li>
<li><p>all archived hardlinked regular files have a chunks list</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>borg rcreate --other-repo=OTHER_REPO: reuse key material from OTHER_REPO, #6554.
This is useful if you want to use borg transfer to transfer archives from an
existing borg 1.1/1.2 repo. If the chunker secret and the id key and algorithm
stay the same, the deduplication will also work between past and future backups.</p></li>
<li><p>borg transfer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>efficiently copy archives from a borg 1.1/1.2 repo to a new repo.
uses deduplication and does not decompress/recompress file content data.</p></li>
<li><p>does some cleanups / fixes / conversions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>disallow None value for .user/group/chunks/chunks_healthy</p></li>
<li><p>cleanup msgpack related str/bytes mess, use new msgpack spec, #968</p></li>
<li><p>obfuscation: fix byte order for size, #6701</p></li>
<li><p>compression: use the 2 bytes for type and level, #6698</p></li>
<li><p>use version 2 for new archives</p></li>
<li><p>convert timestamps int/bigint -&gt; msgpack.Timestamp, see #2323</p></li>
<li><p>all hardlinks have chunks, maybe chunks_healthy, hlid</p></li>
<li><p>remove the zlib type bytes hack</p></li>
<li><p>make sure items with chunks have precomputed size</p></li>
<li><p>removes the csize element from the tuples in the Item.chunks list</p></li>
<li><p>clean item of attic 0.13 ‘acl’ bug remnants</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>crypto: see 1.3.0a1 log entry</p></li>
<li><p>removed “borg upgrade” command (not needed any more)</p></li>
<li><p>compact: removed --cleanup-commits option</p></li>
<li><p>docs: fixed quickstart and usage docs with new cli command syntax</p></li>
<li><p>docs: removed the parts talking about potential AES-CTR mode issues

<h2>Version 1.3.0a1 (2022-04-15)<a href="#version-1-3-0a1-2022-04-15" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Although this was released as 1.3.0a1, it can be also seen as 2.0.0a1 as it was
later decided to do breaking changes and thus the major release number had to
be increased (thus, there will not be a 1.3.0 release, but 2.0.0).</p>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>init: new --encryption=(repokey|keyfile)-[blake2-](aes-ocb|chacha20-poly1305)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>New, better, faster crypto (see encryption-aead diagram in the docs), #6463.</p></li>
<li><p>New AEAD cipher suites: AES-OCB and CHACHA20-POLY1305.</p></li>
<li><p>Session keys are derived via HKDF from random session id and master key.</p></li>
<li><p>Nonces/MessageIVs are counters starting from 0 for each session.</p></li>
<li><p>AAD: chunk id, key type, messageIV, sessionID are now authenticated also.</p></li>
<li><p>Solves the potential AES-CTR mode counter management issues of the legacy crypto.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>init: --key-algorithm=argon2 (new default KDF, older pbkdf2 also still available)</p>
<p>borg key change-passphrase / change-location keeps the key algorithm unchanged.</p>
</li>
<li><p>key change-algorithm: to upgrade existing keys to argon2 or downgrade to pbkdf2.</p>
<p>We recommend you to upgrade unless you have to keep the key compatible with older versions of borg.</p>
</li>
<li><p>key change-location: usable for repokey &lt;-&gt; keyfile location change</p></li>
<li><p>benchmark cpu: display benchmarks of cpu bound stuff</p></li>
<li><p>export-tar: new --tar-format=PAX (default: GNU)</p></li>
<li><p>import-tar/export-tar: can use PAX format for ctime and atime support</p></li>
<li><p>import-tar/export-tar: --tar-format=BORG: roundtrip ALL item metadata, #5830</p></li>
<li><p>repository: create and use version 2 repos only for now</p></li>
<li><p>repository: implement PUT2: header crc32, overall xxh64, #1704</p></li>

<li><p>simplify libs setup, #6482</p></li>
<li><p>unbundle most bundled 3rd party code, use libs, #6316</p></li>

   <p>A tiny town in North Carolina that’s just been devastated by hurricane Helene could end up severely disrupting the global supply chain for microchips and solar panels.</p>   <p>Nestled in the Appalachian mountains, the community of Spruce Pine, population 2,194, is known for its hiking, local artists and as America’s sole source of high-purity quartz. Helene dumped more than 2 feet of rain on the town, destroying roads, shops and cutting power and water.</p>   <p>But its reach will likely be felt far beyond the small community.</p>   <p>Semiconductors are the brains of every computer-chip-enabled device, and solar panels are a key part of the global push to combat climate change. To make both semiconductors and solar panels, companies need crucibles and other equipment that both can withstand extraordinarily high heat and be kept absolutely clean. One material fits the bill: quartz. Pure quartz.</p>   
   <p>Quartz that comes, overwhelmingly, from Spruce Pine.</p>   <p>“As far as we know, there’s only a few places in the world that have ultra-high-quality quartz,” according to Ed Conway, author of <em>Material World: The Six Raw Materials That Shape Modern Civilization. </em>Russia and Brazil also supply high-quality quartz, he says, but<em> </em>“Spruce Pine has far and away the [largest amount] and highest quality.”</p>   <p>Conway says without super-pure quartz for the crucibles, which can often be used only a single time, it would be impossible to produce most semiconductors.</p>   <p>“Purity really does matter,” he says. “You're talking about a process to create the silicon wafers that later become silicon chips, where one single atom being in the wrong place” could derail production.</p>   <p>Companies have been pursuing artificial substitutes, but so far, those alternatives can't satisfy the world’s demand for this pure quartz.</p>   <p>According to an annual report from TECHCET, a market research firm, quartz equipment is a $2.12 billion industry <a href="https://techcet.com/semiconductor-quartz-equipment-components-forecast/"><u>and growing</u></a>.</p>   <p>What's unfolding in Spruce Pine isn't just a local emergency. Like many climate disasters, it has economic costs that could ripple around the world.<br></p>   <h3>Helene devastates town</h3>   <p>Spruce Pine received <a href="https://climate.ncsu.edu/blog/2024/09/rapid-reaction-historic-flooding-follows-helene-in-western-nc/"><u>24.12 inches of rain from Helene</u></a>, according to the National Weather Service. The massive inundation caused the North Toe River to flood, devastating the downtown area, according to Spencer Bost, the executive director of <a href="https://www.discoversprucepinenc.com/"><u>Downtown Spruce Pine</u></a>, the local business development association.</p>   
   <p>“It’s flooded up to the awnings, about 10 feet,” he says of the downtown’s lower street. “Lower street was destroyed.”</p>   <p>The town’s grocery store was also heavily damaged in the flooding. Power, water and cellular service are all down, Bost says. Fallen trees and washed-out roads have left the community isolated from the outside.</p>   <p>“We were there for about three days before we got enough chainsaws together to cut a path out of our neighborhood,” Bost says. He and his fiancée spent nine hours working their way to Greenville, N.C., where they’ve temporarily sought shelter.</p>   <p>The conditions at the mines that produce the quartz remain unclear. “We are in a phase of assessing the situation, and it is far too early to comment on the impact to high-purity quartz production,” Mary Kristin Haugen of the <a href="https://www.thequartzcorp.com/">Quartz Corporation</a> told NPR in a statement.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-25638">

   <p>A second major supplier, <a href="https://www.sibelco.com/en">Sibelco</a>, based in Antwerp, Belgium, told NPR its operations had also been disrupted since Sept. 26. "We are working closely with our local team to safely restart operations as soon as we can and are actively coordinating with local authorities and other partners to manage the situation," the company said in an e-mailed statement.</p>   <p>Images verified by NPR show that even if the mines are intact, getting quartz out of the region may be a challenge. The main CSX rail line in and out of Spruce Pine runs along the North Toe River and has been heavily damaged. The rail line was the primary shipping point for quartz from the mines.<br></p>   <h3>Fallout will depend on how long disruption lasts</h3>   <p>Conway says he believes chipmakers have stocks of ultra-pure quartz that would prevent a short-term supply chain disruption from hobbling production, but he adds that if Spruce Pine remains cut off from the rest of the world for long, it could have a big impact.</p>   
   <p>Previous disruptions to superconductor supply chains, from earthquakes to fires, have sent ripple effects across the many industries that rely on chips for their products and operations. A 2008 fire at a quartz refinery in Spruce Pine <a href="https://www.globalriskintel.com/insights/connecting-sand-mining-and-high-tech-industry"><u>impacted the market</u></a>.</p>   <p>Likewise, solar expert Johannes Bernreuter, head of Bernreuter Research says that if a disruption went on for “more than a few weeks,” it would “pose a serious problem for the production” of silicon ingots needed in the photovoltaic, or PV, industry.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/06/1013266774/how-did-china-become-the-worlds-dominant-polysilicon-producer"><u>China is the major producer of solar panels</u></a>, and it relies heavily on imports of high-quality quartz from Spruce Pine, he says.</p>   <p>Lita Shon-Roy, the president and CEO of market research firm TECHCET, has been tracking the supply chain for semiconductors for two decades. She says it’s amazing that the industry hasn’t been more concerned about the vulnerability created from relying on this one region of North Carolina for a crucial material.</p>   <p>“Every time I’ve asked in the last two decades, the question always comes back, ‘Well, where else are we supposed to get it?’ “ she says.</p>   <p>The United States and China are in a global competition to secure access to raw materials for semiconductors and green technology. Frantic searches are underway for new deposits and new methods, across a range of minerals.</p>   <p>But when it comes to pure quartz?</p>   <p>“I haven’t heard of any viable sources yet to replace what’s in North Carolina,” Shon-Roy says.</p>   <p><em>NPR's Michael Copley contributed to this report.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/TCcDaGLiCnr7Ks2UgWuSxzndIqI=/400x0/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-ChatGPT.jpg?lossy" srcset="https://images.macrumors.com/t/TCcDaGLiCnr7Ks2UgWuSxzndIqI=/400x0/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-ChatGPT.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/G5kpWmOYMm6YRLimQ-1nwt8205A=/800x0/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-ChatGPT.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/itGwY1Pztpi8Q6lHbms2pZHfaUw=/1600x0/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-ChatGPT.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/qYFkvKDN0oid7zg8LRNHUk8G6_0=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale()/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-ChatGPT.jpg 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 697px" alt="iOS 18 ChatGPT" width="1825" height="1027"><br>Apple had been in discussions to participate in a funding round for OpenAI that is expected to raise approximately $6.5 billion. However, Apple recently dropped out of the talks for reasons that remain unclear. The funding round is set to close this week.</p>
<p>The development comes just a month after <em>WSJ</em> reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/29/apple-reportedly-in-talks-to-invest-in-openai/">considering an investment in OpenAI</a> as part of a fundraising effort that could value the AI company at over $100 billion. The high valuation reflects the intense competition in the artificial intelligence sector that OpenAI helped ignite with ChatGPT's launch in late 2022.</p>
<p>While Apple has stepped away, other major tech companies remain involved. Microsoft, which has already invested $13 billion in OpenAI, is expected to contribute about $1 billion to this latest round. Nvidia is also reportedly in talks to participate.</p>
<p>The news of Apple's withdrawal may surprise some, given the company's recent moves in the AI space. Apple previously announced plans to integrate ChatGPT into Siri on iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia later this year. This integration will allow Siri to display ChatGPT responses directly with user permission. However, recent reports of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/open-ai-division-for-profit-da26c24b">turmoil within OpenAI's ranks</a> as it pursues a for-profit structure, may have factored into Apple's decision not to pursue the investment.</p>
<p>That said, Apple's planned ChatGPT integration for its platforms is still expected to proceed before the end of the year. The company has said that iPhone, iPad, and Mac users will be able to use ChatGPT for free without creating an account, while ChatGPT Plus subscribers will be able to access paid features on Apple devices.</p>

<h2>GnuCash 5.9 Released</h2>

<p>The GnuCash development team announces GnuCash 5.9, the tenth release in the stable 5.x series.</p>

<h4>Between 5.8 and 5.9, the following bugfixes were accomplished:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=724745">Bug 724745 - Added new transaction during reconcile, didn't show up in reconcile window.</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=797045">Bug 797045 - Improve error reporting for bad credentials with MySQL backend ("bad or corrupt data" =&gt; "access denied")</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=798568">Bug 798568 - Transaction Copy/Paste problem</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799308">Bug 799308 - sqlite backend: Example Python script prints error when creating new file.</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799370">Bug 799370 - Transaction Journal view cursor placement after commit to transaction change.</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799384">Bug 799384 - Reconciled date cannot be parsed.</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799389">Bug 799389 - Crash when removing an account</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799391">Bug 799391 - Transaction Cut/Paste doesn't move the transaction to the target account</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799395">Bug 799395 - relative date offset quarters occasionally wrong</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799399">Bug 799399 - Windows Keypad decimal locale error</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799416">Bug 799416 - Post invoice: post to account dropdown listbox too small</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799419">Bug 799419 - Intermittent quote price issue</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>The following fixes and improvements were not associated with bug reports:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Add YH Finance (FINANCEAPI) API Key to Quotes infrastructure with a preference in the Online Quotes page and add financeapi to known sources. </li>
    <li>Move copied_class and copied_leader_guid<p>Move static copied_class and static copied_leader_guid to be part of the copied_item structure. This makes it more evident that calling clear_copied_item needs to be called before copied_item is used. </p></li>
    <li>[gnc-datetime] improve CSV date parser with ICU and Boost.
        <ol><li> Add dateformat "Locale" with ICU; uses current locale for date    parsing. ICU's locale date parser may parse "3 May 2023" or    "2024年9月13日" (LC_TIME=zh_TW.utf8) and maybe others.</li>
            <li>Augment d-m-y m-d-y and y-m-d with boost UK/US/ISO parsers. This allows    CSV import of dates with months as words as "30 Sep 2023" or    "May 4, 1978" or "2023-Dec-25". Note boost parser cannot recognise    2-digit years, therefore "30 Sep 24" is invalid.</li>
        </ol></li>
    <li>Csv Import - improve assisant's introduction page</li>
    <li>Correctly handle uncommitted edits when opening a file from history.</li>
    <li>Don't use gnc_difftime and deprecate it because it casts time64 to doubles </li>
    <li>[gnc-pricedb.h] remove unused gnc_pricedb_substitute_commodity</li>
    <li>[gnc-pricedb.h] remove unused gnc_pricedb_lookup_at_time64</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/gnucash/">Help translate GnuCash on Weblate</a></p><h4>German AQBanking Users:</h4>
<p>The AQBanking author is still working to get his updated PIN/TAN code finalized so the Flatpak, macOS, and Windows bundles of this release contain the last stable version, 6.5.4.

<h2>GnuCash 5.6 Released</h2>

<p>The GnuCash development team announces GnuCash 5.6, the seventh release in the stable 5.x series.</p>

<h4>Between 5.5 and 5.6, the following bugfixes were accomplished:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=798946">Bug 798946 - start/end of current/last quarter have off-by-one error</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799093">Bug 799093 - Cannot reconcile since v5.4</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799179">Bug 799179 - SLR won't allow change from "Reminder" to any other state</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799210">Bug 799210 - Bad encoding of accented chars in account names in "Import CSV" wizard</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799213">Bug 799213 - SIGSEGV caused by revising an auto completed transaction</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799222">Bug 799222 - Crash when changing the parent of an account that has had two or more levels of sub-accounts auto-created using the register in the current session.</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799224">Bug 799224 - Import of QIF gets Bug detected during duplicates (partial fix</a>: If the new-splits object is null, it means the new account tree from the current import has no splits. Therefore the (apply min|max dates) will fail. Omitting the date query is a simple fix to prevent crashing.  This is a partial fix because the crash is likely a symptom of another bug which causes the new account-tree to be empty. </li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799225">Bug 799225 - QIF Importer Crashes Silently after "Start Import" Button</a>: Don't allow a QIF investment transaction without an action (buy/sell/etc) </li>
    <li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799246">Bug 799246 - import matcher will rename incorrect splits</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>The following fixes and improvements were not associated with bug reports:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Numeric parsing and string handling improvements in the Engine and XML backend.</li>
    <li>[gnc-dense-cal.c] sx popup: show date in preference (cf.locale) format because the date format preference is user-facing and customisable. it's jarring if the preference is dd/mm/yyyy and the display shows mm/dd/yyyy in accordance to the locale. </li>
    <li>Correct misleading description about creating Scheduled Transaction.</li>
    <li>Date parsing efficiency improvements.</li>
    <li>Update minumum Python version to 3.8, made necessary by updating the C API in the Python bindings.</li>

    <li>Allow sorting of the transaction column in the Since Last Run dialog by schedule name or occurrence date.  To sort by schedule name, a schedule name is first selected and then the column header is pressed to change order.  To sort by occurrence date, a date is selected and then the column header is pressed to change order based on the date of the first occurrence.  A tool tip has been added to indicate the sort order being used. </li>

Reference <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/24126">Cmake Issue 24126</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/24878">Cmake Issue 24878</a>, and <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/merge_requests/8287">CMake merge request 8287</a>. Note that this requires CMake 3.20 or later; users of older versions will still get the newest installed Python version.</li>
    <li>CI: Run distcheck on one workflow to catch quickly instances where someone adds a file but forgets to update the distribution. </li>
    <li>Primarily of interest to developers: We've added a new CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, Asan, with two options -DLEAKS and -DODR, both of which default to OFF. This creates a non-optimized, with-symbols build with the Address Sanitizer hooks compiled in. While the primary motivation is a CI run to ensure that there aren't any memory allocation errors revealed in the test suite, this is also a useful build to use when debugging a segfault crash, many of which are caused by use-after-free errors. When building on non-Apple platforms -DLEAKS=ON will add leak detection, dumping a stack trace for the allocation of any leaked heap or free-store allocations. Similarly and on non-Apple platforms only -DODR=ON will log violations of the C++ one definition rule.</li>
    <li>Also of interest to developers: A new cmake option -DCOVERAGE. When on and in a non-optimized build this will instrument the program and libraries to count usage for every source line. The option also adds three targets, lcov-initialize, lcov-collect, and lcov-generate-html. The primary motivation is to assess the completeness of tests in CI, see <a href="https://gnucash.github.io/Coverage-HTML">Coverage-HTML</a> for the latest results.</li>

<h4>The following fixes and improvements were not associated with bug reports:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>[import-main-matcher.cpp] After clicking/toggling A/U+C/C checkbox, reselect the row because it'll be much faster to use keyboard navigation -- use up/down/left/right to target desired checkbox, hit &lt;down&gt; &lt;space&gt; repeatedly to repeat the same action over several consecutive rows. </li>
    <li>Implement support for !Type:Prices records in the QIF importer.</li>
    <li> Modernize construction of GObjects using G_DECLARE_DERIVABLE, G_DECLARE_FINAL, etc.</li>

    <li>Improve online quote retrieval error reporting.</li>
    <li>Test loading and saving XML files with and without compression</li>
    <li>[import-main-matcher] always defer_bal_computation during import to speed up both importing new transactions, and destroying existing ones. </li>
    <li>GncGtkListUIItem::set_option_from_ui_item: Iterate over selected items Instead of all possible items. </li>
    <li>Convert gnc-ofx-import.c, import-parse.c, import-utilities.c, import-format-dialog.c, import-account-matcher.c, import-commodity-matcher.c, import-settings.c, import-pending-matches.c, import-match-picker.c, import-main-matcher.c, and gnc-pricedb.c to .cpp</li>
    <li>By default, filter out online_wiggle in test-gnc-quotes. Running ./bin/test-gnc-quotes from the command line will still include online_wiggle </li>

    <li>Include timezone in price-quote date diagnostic messages.</li>

<h2>GnuCash 5.3 Released</h2>

<p>The GnuCash development team announces GnuCash 5.3, the fourth release in the stable 5.x series. This is a snap release to fix the bug listed below.</p>

<h4>Between 5.2 and 5.3, the following bugfixes were accomplished:</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugs.gnucash.org/show_bug.cgi?id=798967">Bug 798967 - Cannot Save to Any Path After Upgrading to 5.2 Fix inverted if statement condition for save success flag</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>The following fixes and improvements were not associated with bug reports:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Some memory cleanup by Chris Lam.</li>
    <li>Missing from the 5.2 release notes is that Chris streamlined the
        transaction scrubbing so that each transaction gets scrubbed
        only once. This improves--in some cases substantially--the time
        to load and to run Check and Repair.</li>
</ul>
<p>New and Updated Translations: Dutch, French, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese</p>

</ul>

<h4>The following fixes and improvements were not associated with bug reports:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The type-ahead selection of transaction descriptions has been substantially overhauled based on extensive user feedback. Matches are now only on the beginning of words and are now sorted by age since last use. This both substantially reduces the number of matches and prioritizes the most recently used as being the most likely candidates for re-use. To help distinguish cases of long descriptions where the match would be outside the popup's viewport the viewport is automatically scrolled horizontally so that the end of the left-most (right-most in rtl languages) matches is centered in the view. Completion can be aborted with the &lt;escape&gt; key or a new <em>Don't autocomplete</em> selection that's the first entry in the popup.</li>
    <li>Fix lockup on Windows in type-ahead selection of transaction descriptions.</li>
    <li>More budget-module sign fixes and improvements.</li>
    <li>Lots of memory-leak fixes, GLib modernization, and code cleanup by Richard Cohen, Simon Arlott, &amp; Chris Lam.</li>
    <li>bugfix xaccTransGetTxnType: avoid returning TXN_TYPE_LINK incorrectly: A TXN_TYPE_PAYMENT will have non-APAR splits; a TXN_TYPE_LINK will not have non-APAR splits. This bug manifests as a regular TXN_TYPE_PAYMENT transaction being later voided being incorrectly changed to TXN_TYPE_LINK.</li>
    <li>Including brokerage fees in Money Out calculation (if not ignoring them) in advanced-portfolio.scm report and updating the "advanced" tests to reflect selling fees being included into the money out value</li>
    <li>[stock-txn-asst] Don't use the initial value in amount edit widgets unless they're valid. Otherwise the invalid value will log an error that will prevent later valid input from working. </li>
    <li>BUGFIX: Actions &gt; Online Actions &gt; Show log Window does not open when it is first clicked.</li>
    <li>cmake: check gdk only when building GUI</li>
    <li>Get the tooltip working on "Online Banking Setup"</li>

<h4>The following fixes and improvements were not associated with bug reports:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Add filters to the File&gt;Open dialog in File mode to show only files with GnuCash extensions, only those matching GnuCash's backup file pattern, or any extension.</li>
    <li>Select the first result in the Customer/Vendor search box. This allows faster keyboard navigation -- Find Customer, input search string, press ENTER, use up/down to select desired object, press ENTER to open object. </li>
    <li>Improve foreign currency handling in budget report</li>
    <li>Improve handling of the blank transaction when the register is sorted in reverse:
        <ul>
            <li>Change the preference option 'Future transactions after blank transaction'</li>
            <li>Change tooltip for 'Blank Transaction' in register to mention moving to the blank transaction. </li>
            <li>Show the blank transaction at top of register</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>Prevent infinite recursion from gnucash_item_edit_focus_out when using an input method.</li>
    <li>Create obsolete features list with first member book_currency.Obsolete features set in the book will be removed from the book's KVP and ignored. </li>
    <li>Restore existence, but not implementation, of GNC_FEATURE_BOOK_CURRENCY.<p>At least one user has managed to get it set on their book so even though it was supposed to be unimplemented it got through somehow. Restoring it allows books with it set to load. </p></li>
    <li>Offer to force edit non-identical fields when multiple matches are selected in the import matcher window. Previously only identical Desc/Notes/Memo were unlocked for editing.</li>
    <li>Guard against there being no namespaces in the new security dialog</li>
    <li>Fix Finance::Quote use on Win32 by dealing with Win32 \r\n newlines on return from finance-quote-wrapper.</li>
    <li>Fix some menu labels that were not marked for translation</li>
    <li>Fix category in CSV export with simple layout.<p>If Trading accounts is enabled, and the transaction is a transfer between two accounts of differing commodities, the CSV simple-layout export would incorrectly show "--Split Transaction--" as the category. </p></li>
    <li>When configuring Guile use pkg-config before searching for binaries.</li>

<h3>About the Program</h3>

<p>GnuCash is a free, open source accounting program released under
    the GNU General Public License (GPL) and available for GNU/Linux,
    *BSD, Solaris, MacOS, and Microsoft Windows.  Programming on GnuCash
    began in 1997, and its first stable release was in 1998.</p>
  </div> <div>
<h2>GnuCash 5.0 Released</h2>

<p>The GnuCash development team announces GnuCash 5.0</p>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li> A new Stock Transaction Assistant to guide you through entering most investment transactions for stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. You can access it from <em>Actions&gt;Stock Assistant</em> when the focus tab is the Accounts page or a Stock or Fund account register.</li>
    <li> A new Investment Lots report showing a graph of capital gains and losses in a period by investment lot. Note that if you don't use the View Lots dialog to manage capital gains and losses this report won't have anything to show you. Use <em>Reports&gt;Assets &amp; Liabilities&gt;Investment Lots</em> to see the report.</li>
    <li>The Online Quotes facility has been completely rewritten and the old <kbd>gnc-fq-check</kbd>, <kbd>gnc-fq-dump</kbd>, and <kbd>gnc-fq-helper</kbd> programs have been replaced with <kbd>finance-quote-wrapper</kbd>. The functions performed by those programs may now be accomplished by passing commands to <kbd>gnucash-cli -Q</kbd>, see <kbd>gnucash-cli --help</kbd> for specifics. The perl module requirements have changed with the rewrite: The new version doesn't need <code>Date::Manip</code> but needs <code>JSON::Parse</code> instead. <kbd>gnc-fq-update</kbd> has been, er, updated to reflect that.</li>
    <li>A new tab on the New/Edit Account dialog called <em>More Properties</em> includes entries to set a high and low limit on an account. That's coupled to a new column that's available on the Accounts Page, <em>Balance Limit</em>. If you set a high or low limit and the account balance falls above or below the respective limit an indicator will be shown in the Balance Limit column.</li>
    <li>The description field quickfill in the register now displays a drop-down list of possible completions instead of just one inline completion.</li>
    <li>File import menu items for the MT940, MT942, and DTAUS formats is replaced with a single <em>Import from AQBanking</em> that supports importing any file format supported by AQBanking, including the frequently requested CAMT. (Note that some CAMT profiles are under the XML format.) </li>
    <li>The import matcher now permits editing descriptions, notes, and memo fields in the matcher window before creating the transactions. Right-click and select from the context menu.</li>
    <li>The report generated by the Print Invoice button on the Edit Invoice tab can now be configured as a book option at the bottom of the Business tab; this permits selecting a saved configuration of one of the standard invoice reports. Another option enables a delay, during which a dialog box will appear enabling the user to select a different report. Note: When saving a configuration make sure that the invoice number is <em>not set</em> or you'll get that particular invoice instead of the one that you pressed the button for.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Significant Code Changes</h3>

<h4>Deprecations (will be removed in GnuCash 6.0)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>_ (the alias for gettext. Use G_ instead</li>
    <li>gnc:make-account-list-limited-option</li>
    <li>gnc:make-account-list-option</li>
    <li>gnc:make-account-sel-limited-option</li>

    <li>gnc:make-radiobutton-option</li>
    <li>gnc:make-simple-boolean-option</li>
    <li>gnc:make-string-option</li>
    <li>gnc:make-taxtable-option</li>
    <li>gnc:make-text-option</li>
    <li>gnc:option-set-default-value</li>
    <li>gnc:option-set-value</li>
    <li>gnc:option-setter</li>
    <li>gnc:option-value</li>
    <li>gnc:register-option</li>
    <li>The invoice option to gnc:register-report-create-internal</li>
</ul>

<h4>Report and Book Options</h4>
<ul><li>This major change will affect everyone who has written custom reports in Guile Scheme.</li>
    <li>The report and book options code has been completely rewritten in C++ with SWIG providing Guile Scheme access for reports. The new design requires directly registering options with for example <code>gnc-optiondb-register-string-option</code> instead of calling <code>gnc:make-string-option</code> to create an option followed by <code>gnc:register-option</code> to insert it in the report's options.</li>
    <li>Value access is also changed: Instead of retrieving an option and then querying or setting its value with <code>gnc:option-value</code> one will query the optiondb with <code>gnc-option-value</code>, the arguments to which are the optiondb, the section, and the option name.</li>
<li>Supporting the new options backend the options dialog code in gnc-dialog-options, gnc-business-options, and the new gnc-option-gtk-ui have also been rewritten in C++.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Online Price Retrieval</h4>
<ul>
<li>As noted under New Features the interface to Finance::Quote has been completely rewritten in C++ with much of the behavior previously coded in external perl scripts moved into GnuCash proper. This permits much better access to Finance::Quotes's facilities and in particular should provide much richer error reporting.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Stability Improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are hundreds of small changes to prevent memory leaks, reduce unnecessary memory allocations, and fix compiler and static analyzer warnings.</li>
<li>Use of deprecated API in C/C++ is now an error (with 3 exceptions), including for the minimum required version of GLib and Gtk.</li>
<li>Extensive changes to the CSV importer, resolving most known bugs.</li>
<li>Remove all unused variables and made an unused variable a compile error.</li>
<li>Move all extern "C" declarations into the respective header files and remove extern "C" wrappers around #include statements.</li>
<li>Separate the scheme financial functions into a separate module so that all other scheme code can be banished from libgnucash to bindings.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Modernization</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The menus and toolbars now use the GAction and GActionGroup actuation functions, replacing the deprecated GtkAction and GtkActionGroup APIs.</li>
    <li>The experimental Register2 implementation is removed, as is the never-used Jalali calendar code and partly-written option code for creating a book currency.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">WebRTC peer to peer calls for everyone. See it live in action at
<a href="https://peercalls.com/" rel="nofollow">peercalls.com</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The server has been completely rewriten in Go and all the original
functionality works. An optional implementation of a Selective Forwarding Unit
(SFU) is available to make Peer Calls consume less bandwith for user video
uploads. This wouldn't haven been possible without the awesome
<a href="https://github.com/pion/webrtc">pion/webrtc</a> library.</p>
<p dir="auto">The config file format is still YAML, but is different than what was in v3. The
v3 source code is available in <code>version-3</code> branch.  Version 4 will no longer be
published on NPM since the server is no longer written in NodeJS.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What's New in v4</h2><a id="user-content-whats-new-in-v4" aria-label="Permalink: What's New in v4" href="#whats-new-in-v4"></a></p>
<ul>
<li> Core rewritten in Golang.</li>
<li> Selective Forwarding Unit. Can be enabled using <code>NETWORK_TYPE=sfu</code> environment variable. The <a href="https://peercalls.com/" rel="nofollow">peercalls.com</a> instance has this enabled.</li>
<li> Ability to change video and audio devices without reconnecting.</li>
<li> Improved toolbar layout. Can be toggled by clicking or tapping.</li>
<li> Multiple videos are now shown in a full-size grid and each can be minimized.</li>
<li> Video cropping can be turned off.</li>
<li> Improved file sending. Users are now able to send files larger than 64 or 256 KB (depends on the browser).</li>
<li> Device names are correctly populated in the dropdown list.</li>
<li> Improved desktop sharing.</li>
<li> Copy invite link to clipboard. Will show as share icon on devices that support it.</li>
<li> Fix: Toolbar icons render correctly on iOS 12 devices.</li>
<li> Fix: Video autoplays.</li>
<li> Fix: Toolbar is no longer visible until call is joined</li>
<li> Fix: Add warning when using an unsupported browser</li>
<li> Fix: Add warning when JavaScript is disabled</li>

<ul>
<li> Support dynamic adding and removing of streams</li>
<li> Support RTCP packet Picture Loss Indicator (PLI)</li>
<li> Support RTCP packet Receiver Estimated Maximum Bitrate (REMB)</li>

<p dir="auto">The UDP port range can be defined for opening epheremal ports. These ports will
be used for generating UDP host ICE candidates. It is recommended to enable
these UDP ports when ICE TCP is enabled, because the priority of TCP host
candidates will be higher than srflx/prflx candidates, as such TCP will be used
even though UDP connectivity might be possible.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ICE TCP</h2><a id="user-content-ice-tcp" aria-label="Permalink: ICE TCP" href="#ice-tcp"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Peer Calls supports ICE over TCP as described in RFC6544. Currently only
passive ICE candidates are supported. This means that users whose ISPs or
corporate firewalls block UDP packets can use TCP to connect to the SFU. In
most scenarios, this removes the need to use a TURN server, but this
functionality is currently experimental and is not enabled by default.</p>
<p dir="auto">Add the <code>tcp4</code> and <code>tcp6</code> to your <code>PEERCALLS_NETWORK_SFU_PROTOCOLS</code> to enable
support for ICE TCP:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Rats can’t vomit. This may be a function of their anatomy—their stomachs are “not well structured for moving contents towards the esophagus” is how one study delicately put it—or it may have something to do with their brain circuitry, or it may be a combination of the two. Whatever the cause, the result is that rats, contrary to their popular (or unpopular) image, are fussy eaters. Even as they pick through the trash, they’re hesitant to try new foods. This makes poisoning them complicated; quite often—and quite literally—they won’t take the bait.</p><p>In 1942, a Johns Hopkins biologist named Curt Richter discovered a new poison that rats apparently couldn’t taste. His breakthrough caught the attention of the United States Office of Scientific Research and Development, the Second World War equivalent of <em>DARPA</em>. The agency, among its many worries, feared that the Axis powers were at work on biological weapons that would use rats as vectors. (In fact, the Japanese did try to spread plague during the war, with some success.) The O.S.R.D. had the poison—alpha-naphthyl thiourea, or <em>ANTU</em> for short—tested in the back alleys of Baltimore. The city was so pleased with the resulting carnage that it appointed Richter to lead a new rodent-control office, based in City Hall. By 1946, <em>ANTU</em>-laced corn had been spread over more than fifty-five hundred blocks and, according to Richter, “well over a million rats” had been killed.</p><p>By that point, however, <em>ANTU</em> was starting to lose its efficacy. Apparently, rats were learning to associate adulterated corn with unpleasant consequences and becoming bait-shy. New measures, it was realized, would be needed, and an even more ambitious research effort was born—the Rodent Ecology Project.</p><p>The project was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, which tapped another Johns Hopkins professor, David&nbsp;E. Davis, to lead it. Davis thought that the best way to control rats was to understand their habits. He set about studying how Baltimore’s rats spent their days, or, really, nights, since the animals in question—Norway rats, which actually come from Asia—are nocturnal. He and his assistants trapped rats on the streets and marked them, usually by clipping off some of their toes. They released the digit-poor rodents back onto the streets, then tried to recapture them. In dry weather, they put out food infused with blue dye and tracked the tinted droppings that resulted.</p><p>These labor-intensive routines revealed that rats live in small groups of about fifteen individuals. They tend to stick close to home, and they don’t like to cross roads. Davis’s team also found that rat numbers were remarkably stable. About ten groups, or a hundred and fifty individuals, lived on an average block. If some of the rats on a block were killed, either by <em>ANTU</em> or by predators, the population quickly rebounded, levelling off again at about a hundred and fifty rats.</p><p>Such stability was hard to explain. Clearly, the rats’ numbers were not limited by resources, as there was always more garbage to be plundered. So why didn’t some blocks have a whole lot more rodent residents? One of Davis’s assistants, a young ecologist named John&nbsp;B. Calhoun, suggested an experiment. What if additional rats were introduced on a street? Would the population increase? Calhoun trapped more than a hundred rats, marked them, and released them on one particular block. When he and his colleagues tried to recapture the imported rats, they couldn’t find any. Meanwhile, it seemed, the block’s original rat population had declined. As one account of the experiment put it, “It looked like the most effective rat killer was more rats.”</p><p>Both Richter and Davis eventually moved on from the study of street rats to pursue other projects. But Calhoun was hooked. He would spend the rest of his life investigating what controlled rats’ numbers, with results that many experts interpreted as ominous for humanity.</p><p>Two new books take up the subject of Calhoun and his rats. The authors of the first, <a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Rat-City-Overcrowding-Derangement-Universes/dp/1685890997/ref=sr_1_1?crid=N402F7LJYTHJ&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.OTSmOpGDG5LdAf49ock6qg.C291zTodwOCCIDEbCaxplM90yND3hiaRPZyEW8rHGs4&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=%E2%80%9CRat%20City:%20Overcrowding%20and%20Urban%20Derangement%20in%20the%20Rodent%20Universes%20of%20John%20B.%20Calhoun%E2%80%9D&amp;qid=1727705831&amp;sprefix=rat%20city%20overcrowding%20and%20urban%20derangement%20in%20the%20rodent%20universes%20of%20john%20b.%20calhoun%20,aps,137&amp;sr=8-1" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Rat-City-Overcrowding-Derangement-Universes/dp/1685890997/ref=sr_1_1?crid=N402F7LJYTHJ&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.OTSmOpGDG5LdAf49ock6qg.C291zTodwOCCIDEbCaxplM90yND3hiaRPZyEW8rHGs4&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=%E2%80%9CRat%20City:%20Overcrowding%20and%20Urban%20Derangement%20in%20the%20Rodent%20Universes%20of%20John%20B.%20Calhoun%E2%80%9D&amp;qid=1727705831&amp;sprefix=rat%20city%20overcrowding%20and%20urban%20derangement%20in%20the%20rodent%20universes%20of%20john%20b.%20calhoun%20,aps,137&amp;sr=8-1&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Rat-City-Overcrowding-Derangement-Universes/dp/1685890997/ref=sr_1_1?crid=N402F7LJYTHJ&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.OTSmOpGDG5LdAf49ock6qg.C291zTodwOCCIDEbCaxplM90yND3hiaRPZyEW8rHGs4&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=%E2%80%9CRat%20City:%20Overcrowding%20and%20Urban%20Derangement%20in%20the%20Rodent%20Universes%20of%20John%20B.%20Calhoun%E2%80%9D&amp;qid=1727705831&amp;sprefix=rat%20city%20overcrowding%20and%20urban%20derangement%20in%20the%20rodent%20universes%20of%20john%20b.%20calhoun%20,aps,137&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“Rat City: Overcrowding and Urban Derangement in the Rodent Universes of John&nbsp;B.

Both books cast Calhoun as a visionary. Both also portray him as eccentric to the point of crankdom.</p><p>Calhoun, who went by the nickname Jack, was born in 1917 in rural Tennessee. His father was a school administrator and his mother a teacher. As a child, he was passionately interested in nature, particularly in birds. In 1933, his father lost his job, a development that might have prevented Calhoun from attending college, had ornithology not intervened. One day that summer, while visiting the University of Virginia, Calhoun ran into a dean who happened to be an avid birder. After just a few minutes of conversation, the dean offered him a scholarship to U.V.A. In 1943, Calhoun completed a Ph.D. at Northwestern University; a few years after that, he landed the position with the Rodent Ecology Project.</p><p>Calhoun’s translocation experiment convinced him that there was still a lot to learn about the social lives of rats. But, he decided, he could no longer work on the streets of Baltimore; there were too many variables he couldn’t control. Nor did it make sense to work with lab rats; their lives were too artificial. What he needed, Calhoun thought, was an urban setting only he had access to. With the blessing of the Rodent Ecology Project, he constructed a simulacrum of a city block on an empty lot in Towson, Maryland, about ten miles north of Baltimore. (Though it was smaller than an actual block, the setup replicated the typical layout of Baltimore’s back yards and alleyways.) To keep the rats in and predators out, he erected an elaborate series of fences around his SimCity, and, to monitor the goings on there, he built himself a little observation tower. He placed ten wild rats—five males and five females—inside the fences, and then, for two years, he watched.</p><p>The Towson experiment produced reams and reams of data. Every six weeks, Calhoun would conduct a census of the enclosure’s population by capturing every rat. (Individual rats were marked with metal ear tags.) Sometimes, before releasing the rats, he would anesthetize them so that he could record their size, their weight, and the number of their wounds. He tried to register every birth in the enclosure, and every death. In the process of all this, Ramsden and Adams write, Calhoun came to know “more about the behavior of the Norway rat than anyone else alive.”</p><p>The Towson rats were supplied with essentially limitless food, and for a while they took advantage of this by increasing their numbers. At the end of a year, ten rats had become thirty. By the eighteen-month point, there were a hundred and fifty in the enclosure. Then the population abruptly levelled off. For the last six months of the experiment, it never rose above a hundred and eighty.</p><p>Having observed the rats so closely, Calhoun now had a pretty good idea of what was limiting growth. The rats had divided themselves into eleven clans. Four had burrows conveniently located at the center of the enclosure, near where Calhoun had placed the food bins. In these privileged clans, a few dominant male rats mated with (and protected) a larger number of females. Although the high-status mothers successfully raised many pups, this wasn’t enough to offset the losses in a population that was aging and, increasingly, brawling.</p><p>The rats from the <em>banlieues</em>, for their part, lived under constant stress. When they attempted to get to the food bins, the fat rats in the middle tried—often successfully—to repulse them. Along the edges of the enclosure, packs of low-ranking males roamed from burrow to burrow, harassing the females. The outer-burrow females were so exhausted that they rarely conceived, and, when they did give birth, they often abandoned their pups.</p><p>Calhoun published his results in a two-hundred-and-eighty-eight-page monograph, “The Ecology and Sociology of Norway Rats.” As Ramsden and Adams point out, the use of the word “sociology” in the title was daring, as this term is normally reserved for the study of humans. Toward the end of the volume, Calhoun made explicit his intention. “Animal subjects,” he wrote, “may be of value in elucidating some of the social problems which confront man today.”</p><p>Calhoun’s Rodent Ecology Project contract ended in 1949. It took him almost a decade to get another major rat study up and running, but, when he did, it was an extravaganza. The new experiment was financed by the National Institute of Mental Health, which had just been created. At a cost of a hundred thousand dollars—more than a million dollars in today’s money—Calhoun had a ten-foot-tall rat enclosure constructed in a barn in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The enclosure was divided into six rooms, each of which was further divided into four cells. This time around, Calhoun planned to control the enclosure’s population himself, by removing pups when there were more than eighty rats per room.</p><p>The experiment got under way in January, 1958. For the first few months, the rats seemed content in their apartment-like dwellings. But then, once again, things took a dystopic turn. Calhoun had laid out the rooms asymmetrically. The two cells in the center each had two entrances; those on the ends had just one. Dominant males assumed control of the easier-to-defend cells and allowed only a select group of females to enter them. This forced the other rats into the central cells, where order gradually broke down. Dispensing with the courtship rituals that usually precede mating, mid-cell male rats took to simply trying to mount females, or even other males. Aggression increased; at times, Calhoun wrote, “it was impossible to enter a room without observing fresh blood splattered about.” Central-cell females basically gave up on mothering. They built inadequate nests or none at all. When disturbed, they would start to move their babies, only to then abandon them. The pup mortality rate in the crowded cells rose to as high as ninety-six per cent. Calhoun came up with a new term to describe the process he had witnessed. The rats, he said, had fallen into a “behavioral sink.”</p><p>With the barn experiment, Calhoun again cast his work as a form of sociology. In an article he published in <em>Scientific American</em>, in 1962, he observed that research like his could, “in time,” offer insights into “analogous problems confronting the human species.” He didn’t specify what the analogous problems were, but he didn’t have to. In the early nineteen-sixties, fears of overpopulation and urban decay were rampant. At about the time Calhoun wrote his article, a group of researchers at the University of Illinois decided to calculate what would happen if the number of people on the globe continued to increase along the trajectory it had followed for the previous two millennia. The researchers concluded, with a mathematical version of tongue-in-cheek, that the population would approach infinity on November 13, 2026. In the meantime, the planet would become so crowded that there would be no room to move. “Our great-great-grandchildren will not starve to death,” they wrote in <em>Science</em>. “They will be squeezed to death.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

We design them the same way engineers built engines, cars, and airplanes:&nbsp; from first principles. Our mission is to create best-in-class, intelligent, and efficient systems at every scale – systems designed to process large amounts of sequential multimodal data, to enable advanced reasoning, and to achieve reliable decision-making.</p><p>Today, we introduce the first generation of Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs). LFMs are large neural networks built with computational units deeply rooted in the theory of dynamical systems, signal processing, and numerical linear algebra. This unique blend allows us to leverage decades of theoretical advances in these fields in our quest to enable intelligence at every scale.

This is particularly true for long inputs, where the KV cache in transformer-based LLMs grows linearly with sequence length. By efficiently compressing inputs, LFMs can process longer sequences on the same hardware. For example, compared to other 3B-class models, LFMs maintain a minimal memory footprint.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6557a2b6957fcb7aeb0efcf0/66f9a9b9624c365c96251a0c_desktop%20graph.png" loading="lazy" width="854" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 900px" alt="Fig. 2.

This was confirmed by the RULER benchmark, where a length is considered “effective” when its corresponding score is higher than 85.6 [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06654" target="_blank">Hsieh et al. 2024 - RULER</a>].

For developers, it unlocks new applications, including document analysis and summarization, more meaningful interactions with context-aware chatbots, and improved Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) performance.</p><p>Our goal is to keep scaling LFMs across model size, train/test time compute, and context length. Beyond our language LFMs, we have designed models for various data modalities, domains, and applications that we plan to release in the next months.</p></div><h3>Advancing the Pareto Frontier of Large AI Models</h3><p>To achieve these results, we optimized our pre- and post-training pipelines and infrastructure to ensure our models excel across five criteria:</p><div><div data-hover="false" data-delay="0"><nav><p>Breadth and depth of information across various domains and tasks at any given size. We achieve this using a comprehensive pre-training set, advances in model architectures, new pre-training/mid-training/post-training strategies. This allows LFMs to be competitive with larger models on knowledge-based tasks.</p></nav></div><div data-hover="false" data-delay="0"><nav><p>The ability to break down a problem and apply logical and rigorous thinking.

We specifically trained LFMs to maximize recall performance and in-context learning capabilities across the entire input range.</p></nav></div><div data-hover="false" data-delay="0"><nav><p>Memory usage of transformer-based models explodes for long inputs, which makes them ill-suited for edge deployment. LFMs have near-constant inference time and memory complexity – as the input context length grows, it does not significantly affect generation speed or increase the amount of memory required.</p></nav></div><div data-hover="false" data-delay="0"><nav><p>Training GPT-like foundation models demands significant computational resources. LFMs are efficient for training on long-context data.</p></nav></div></div></div><div id="reimagining-model-architectures"><h2>Reimagining Model Architectures</h2><div><p>Building on <a href="https://www.liquid.ai/blog/liquid-neural-networks-research" target="_blank">a long line of research</a> in designing expressive and efficient learning systems, we have developed a new design space for foundation models, focusing on different modalities and hardware requirements. Our goal is to explore ways to build foundation models beyond Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs).</p><p>With LFMs, we put into practice new principles and methods guiding model design, developed by our team over the past months.</p></div><div><div data-hover="false" data-delay="0"><div><p>LFMs are composed of structured operators.</p></div><nav><p>Our models are derived from a set of computational units – the building blocks of an architecture – belonging to a new <em>design space</em>.

Featurization refers to the process of converting input data (e.g., text, audio, images, video) into a structured set of features or vectors that are used to modulate computation inside the model in an adaptive manner. For example, audio and time series data generally requires <em>less</em> featurization in operators due to lower information density, compared to language and multi-modal data. The other key dimension is the computational complexity of the operators. Being able to traverse and complete the design space of structured adaptive operators allows us maximize performance with controlled computational requirements.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6557a2b6957fcb7aeb0efcf0/66eb44838e25f89817c56644_figure-wrapper%20(2).avif" loading="lazy" width="894" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 900px" alt="Fig. 5.

There’s a demo video at <a href="https://vid.inkeep.com/cx-copilot">https://vid.inkeep.com/cx-copilot</a> or you can try the live sandbox with example tickets at <a href="https://try.inkeep.com/cx-copilot">https://try.inkeep.com/cx-copilot</a>.</p><p>Why? Most AI support tools today are focused on trying to have AI answer customer questions before they even reach support teams (‘deflection’). We’d focused on that too. However, we heard from many of our customers that while they care about deflection, they care even more about providing high-quality, fast human support when users need it. Some teams don’t even want customer-facing AI at all and just want AI tools to help their team be more efficient. We created Keep with these scenarios in mind.</p><p>Keep does a few neat things we haven’t seen elsewhere:</p><p>1. Provides intelligent suggestions: if Keep is confident, it’ll create a draft answer and tell you the sources it used. If the ticket is long, it’ll summarize the conversation so far and outline the remaining to-dos. All automatic and contextual to the ticket.</p><p>2. Is fully conversational: ask for clarifications, revise draft answers, and iterate as needed.</p><p>3. Uses ‘Generative UI’: suggestions are rendered as glanceable, interactive UI components. For example, a draft answer has buttons like “Shorten” &amp; “Concise” that prompt the AI to revise the answer. UI components are interweaved within normal text.</p><p>4. Turns tickets into FAQs: can generate an FAQ from a closed ticket and lets you iterate on it and save it when done.</p><p>5. Leverages many content types: uses your docs, help center, previous support tickets, Slack threads, etc.</p><p>We were inspired by tools like Cursor, Claude Artifacts, and v0. These experiences go beyond plain-text conversations by interweaving interactive code blocks or UI previews into their answers. This makes answers digestible and intuitive (and fun) to iterate on.</p><p>Some technical details, for those interested: We use the Vercel AI SDK to optimistically stream the React components by using our Chat APIs, which are powered by Claude Sonnet 3.5 and our RAG service. Our APIs follow the OpenAI chat completion format so are generally compatible with any LLM tooling. Our `inkeep-qa` API generates draft answers and the `inkeep-context` API generates structured outputs and tool calls (docs: <a href="https://go.inkeep.com/ai-api">https://go.inkeep.com/ai-api</a>). For an example of how these APIs are used, check out our Intelligent Support Form example (demo: <a href="https://try.inkeep.com/ai-form">https://try.inkeep.com/ai-form</a>, repo: <a href="https://quickstart.inkeep.com/ai-form">https://quickstart.inkeep.com/ai-form</a>).</p><p>If you want to try Inkeep on your product's content, just fill out the form in our landing page. You’ll get a demo in your inbox powered by your public content — NO “call us”, “book a demo”, or “schedule a meeting” required. Note: we do check that your email domain matches your content to prevent spam.</p><p>Curious to hear about your experiences when working with customer/support questions and any ideas on how else the copilot could be useful for those scenarios.</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td></td></tr>  </tbody></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>Y Combinator is arguably the most successful early-stage VC fund or accelerator ever. The issue, however, is that they never truly grasped the factors behind their success, which is why YC's peak is already behind them—it’s likely all downhill from here.</p><p>In particular, Sam Altman didn’t grasp what truly made YC successful. He did what he does best: being ambitious and scaling it up! To him, this seemed obvious—there were plenty of companies eager to join YC, and since predicting which ones would succeed was unreliable, why not just accept more? Even if it meant a few more failures, everyone knows VC is a power law game—one extra winner compensates for many flops. Plus, more companies naturally mean more management fees and carry!</p><p>What he failed to grasp (or didn’t care about, since the effects take a long time to unfold) is that reputation and prestige are everything. Take Harvard, for instance: the reason they don’t accept a higher percentage of applicants isn’t because they can’t scale—they have the resources to build more facilities or could even switch to remote like YC—but because they choose not to. Harvard knows its success lies in exclusivity. If everyone could get in, no one would care. People don’t attend Harvard for the lectures, which are all on YouTube anyway, but because being accepted there is a status symbol. Harvard thrives on its reputation and prestige—or simply, its brand.</p><p>Founders want to raise money from the top VCs—e.g. Sequoia or a16z—for the same reason. Sure, these firms offer some of the best support to their portfolio companies, much like Harvard offers top-tier lectures, but that's not the main draw. The real reason to raise from elite VCs is the prestige and legitimacy it confers on your startup. It signals to prospective employees, customers, and future investors that your company is the real deal. Naturally, this signal weakens the easier it becomes to secure funding from these VCs.</p><p>If the main appeal of joining YC isn’t the mentorship but the prestige of being able to write "YC W22" in your Twitter bio and on your company’s landing page, then they've got a problem because you can't scale that arbitrarily. What Sam initiated, and what YC continues to do, is trade their reputation capital for real capital (i.e., more money). However, they’ll soon realize that once their reputation capital is exhausted, rebuilding it will be nearly impossible. Put simply, once YC becomes uncool – which might have already happened – you can’t make it cool again.</p><p>We’re already witnessing the decline of YC in the current batch. For instance, one of the many "AI code editors" YC funded, <a href="https://x.com/CodeFryingPan/status/1840203597478539477?ref=unfashionable.blog">PearAI</a>, is simply a clone of another YC-backed, open-source AI code editor called <a href="https://www.continue.dev/?ref=unfashionable.blog">Continue</a>. Unsurprisingly, the PearAI team doesn’t appear <a href="https://x.com/that_anokha_boy/status/1840476530536780072?ref=unfashionable.blog">super competent</a>. People on Twitter were quick to <a href="https://x.com/RhysSullivan/status/1840461449371812289?ref=unfashionable.blog">mock the project</a>, and as a reaction, Garry Tan (CEO of YC) retweeted a <a href="https://x.com/amaldorai/status/1840476104592900571?ref=unfashionable.blog" rel="noreferrer">post</a> defending it.</p><figure><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/ekvtmdn/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-30-at-10.36.21.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1098" height="364"></figure><p>This is a telling defense. While he is likely correct about the legality of copying Continue's code, that completely misses the point. The issue isn't that PearAI did something illegal—it's that they got funded by YC with nothing more than a codebase copied from another YC-backed company. This shows that (1) YC is willing to fund just about anything, (2) they’re not doing any real due diligence, and (3) they don't particularly care about their existing portfolio companies. If PearAI can secure funding, it means anyone can, and the YC brand loses much of its prestige.</p><p>YC is no longer an exclusive club where membership signals legitimacy—it’s becoming a broad index of tech startups. This decline will continue until cool, innovative companies no longer see any reason to apply.</p>
