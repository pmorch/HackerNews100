										<p>The recent introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs has been generating headlines and buzz in pockets of the industry. However, Vanguard does not have plans to create a Vanguard bitcoin ETF or other crypto-related products. Additionally, such products from other issuers will not be offered on our brokerage platform. In this Q&amp;A, two Vanguard leaders—Janel Jackson, global head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker &amp; Index Relations, and Andrew Kadjeski, head of Brokerage &amp; Investments—discuss why.</p>

                    <p><b>Jackson:</b> No, given the current state of crypto as an asset class, Vanguard does not have plans to launch its own bitcoin ETF or any crypto-related products. When deciding what investment products to offer, we consider a range of factors, including whether we believe they have <i>enduring</i> investment merit and meet our clients’ needs. While the discussion about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, has increased recently, we do not currently believe that there is an appropriate role for them to play in long-term portfolios. <sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>

                    <p>We do have a lot of interest in blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies. We believe its application to a number of other uses besides crypto will make capital markets more efficient, and we’ve been actively involved in research to use blockchain technology.&nbsp;<br>

                <h5><p>Why is Vanguard not offering crypto-related products on its brokerage platform?<sup>1</sup></p>
</h5>
            </div>
        

        <div>
                    	<p><a name="OLE_LINK10" id="OLE_LINK10"></a><b>Kadjeski:</b> Investors have a lot of choices these days when it comes to where to save for their retirement, invest for their kids’ education, and hold their emergency savings. Investors who come directly to Vanguard do so because they know we put their interests first<a name="OLE_LINK6" id="OLE_LINK6"></a>—and that is reflected in what products and services we <i>do</i> and <i>don’t</i> have on the shelf.</p>
<p>The easy step for us would have been just to allow full access to crypto-related products. But as a firm and a brokerage platform, we’re purposely structured to meet the needs of our investor-owners, most of whom are long-term, buy-and-hold investors.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><b>Jackson:</b> In Vanguard’s view, crypto is more of a speculation than an investment. This is at the root of our decision to not offer crypto products, whether our own or others. With equities, you own a share of a company that produces goods or services, and many also pay dividends. With bonds, you get a stream of interest payments. Commodities are real assets that meet consumption needs, have inflation-hedging properties, and can play a <a href="https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/inflation-fighting-power-of-commodities.html" target="_self">role in certain portfolios</a>. While crypto has been classified as a commodity, it’s an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio.</p>
<p>Morningstar recently published a perceptive article pointing out that even a modest 5% allocation to bitcoin in an otherwise traditional balanced portfolio can drastically raise its risk profile.<sup>3</sup> This is driven, in large part, by bitcoin’s extreme volatility.</p>
<p><b>Kadjeski:</b> Over just the past three years, the price of bitcoin has increased by as much as 150% and declined by as much as 77%. Double-digit percent price drops are routine among cryptocurrencies. Remember that you need a 100% return just to make up for a 50% decline. And the more volatile an asset, the more tempting it is to trade. At Vanguard, our products and services are designed with the goal to help investors save more, trade less, and take a long-term approach—not chase trends and churn their portfolios.</p>

                <h5><p>Has Vanguard made similar decisions in the past?</p>
</h5>
            </div>
        

        <div>
                    	<p><b>Jackson:</b> There have been several investment trends in the past—the internet funds in the late 1990s for example—that Vanguard could have capitalized on. But we always ask ourselves, “Does this meet our investors’ long-term needs?” In hindsight, in nearly all cases, I believe we made the right call, ultimately benefiting our clients.<b></b></p>
<p><b>Kadjeski:</b> The same line of thinking applies to our brokerage platform. In 2019, we decided to remove access to leveraged and inverse funds and ETFs. These products are often misunderstood and misused by investors and can magnify losses. Similarly, in 2022, we stopped offering most over-the-counter stocks, which are prone to high risk, low liquidity, and potential fraud.</p>
<p><b>Jackson:</b> We understand that our decision on crypto is not popular among some investors, but many know that we’re being consistent with our philosophy and past practice.<sup>4 </sup>Our mission statement to give investors the best chance for investment success isn’t just a saying for us. It’s built into our DNA and we’re staying true to our mission by making this decision.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Date: 2025-01-26 <br>
Git: <a href="https://gitlab.com/mort96/blog/blob/published/content/00000-home/00016-wayland-input-latency.md">https://gitlab.com/mort96/blog/blob/published/content/00000-home/00016-wayland-input-latency.md</a></p>
<p>Yesterday, I read this blog post:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/generic-internet-user/e8eec46ce159571032115f6fb064523c">Wayland Cursor Lag: Just give me a break already...</a>,
where a Linux user discusses their frustration with input latency under Wayland.
They detailed their own subjective experience of the problem,
but failed to produce hard evidence.</p>
<p>Even though I'm a very happy user of wayland overall,
I share the blog post's author's subjective impression that there's more
cursor lag under Wayland than under X11.
In my opinion, their experiment was limited by their phone camera's 90 FPS,
which really doesn't feel like it's enough to get conclusive numbers
when we're talking about differences which are probably on the order of
single screen refresh cycles.</p>
<p>So I thought: hey, I have a phone with a 240 FPS camera mode,
I bet that's enough to get some conclusive results!</p>
<p>Spoilers: I was right.</p>
<h2>Experimental design</h2>
<p>I simply pointed my phone's camera at the screen and desk using my left hand,
made sure to get the mouse cursor, the mouse and my right hand in frame,
and recorded myself repeatedly flicking the mouse with my finger.
I recorded myself flicking it 16 times under Wayland,
logged out of the GNOME Wayland session and into a GNOME X11 session,
then did the same there.</p>
<p>I then converted the two resulting video files into a series of JPEGs
using ffmpeg (<code>ffmpeg -i &lt;input file&gt; %04d.jpg</code>),
and counted from the first frame where I could see the mouse move
until the first frame where I could clearly see that the cursor had moved.</p>
<p>I elected to include the start and end frame;
so if I saw the mouse move in frame 1045,
then I saw the cursor move in frame 1047,
I would count that as 3 frames.</p>
<p>Here's an example which depicts a latency of 3 frames (requires JavaScript):</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-before-1.jpg" alt="before 1"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's a frame from before the mouse has begun moving.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-before-2.jpg" alt="before 2"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mouse still hasn't moved.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-moved-1.jpg" alt="mouse moving"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, the mouse has just about started moving,
so I consider this "frame 1".
The cursor hasn't moved yet.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-moved-2.jpg" alt="still moving"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mouse moves a bit further, but the cursor still hasn't moved.
This is "frame 2".</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-cursor.jpg" alt="cursor moved"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the frame where the cursor starts moving.
This is "frame 3", so I would note down this sequence
as taking 3 frames.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hardware details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distro: Fedora Workstation 41</li>
<li>GNOME version: 47</li>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X</li>
<li>GPU: AMD Radeon RX 7900XT</li>
<li>Monitor: Gigabyte M32U (4k IPS @ 144.99, no DPI scaling)</li>
<li>Mouse: Logitech G502 Lightspeed</li>
<li>Camera: iPhone 15 Pro, slo-mo 240 FPS</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>The main limitations of this experiment are:</p>
<ul>
<li>240 FPS still isn't <em>that</em> much. With my 144Hz screen, I have less than
two camera frames per screen refresh. This introduces some random variance.</li>
<li>Pixels don't switch instantly, so there are ambiguous frames where the cursor
is <em>barely</em> starting to become visible in its new location.
I decided to count the cursor as "having moved" when there is a clearly visible
cursor in a new location on the screen, even if the pixels haven't fully lit up.</li>
<li>For some reason, the video recording from my phone contains some duplicate frames.
I don't know why this happens. I decided to interpret these duplicate frames
as a representation of a frame's worth of time passing, so I counted them as normal.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these factors introduce some uncertainty in the results.
However, they <em>should</em> affect Wayland and X11 equally, so with enough data,
it should all even out.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Another caveat I should clearly point out is that there are
many other Wayland compositors out there than GNOME's, and I have not tested them.
For that matter, there are other GPU drivers out there than AMD's.
Other compositors and other GPU drivers may show different results.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here's the data I captured:</p>

<p>Wayland, on average, has roughly 6.5ms more cursor latency than X11 on my system.
I don't have the statistics expertise necessary to properly analyze
whether this difference is statistically significant or not,
but to my untrained eye, it looks like there's a clear and consistent difference.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the difference is very close to 1 full screen refresh.
I don't know whether or not that's a coincidence.</p>
<p>Here are the numbers in chart form:</p>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-chart.svg" alt="Latency chart"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In my mind, these results are conclusive proof that there <em>is</em> a difference
in input latency between X11 and Wayland, at least with my hardware,
and that the difference is large enough that it's plausible for some people to notice.</p>
<p>Further testing on more varied hardware and refresh rates is necessary
to get a clear picture of how wide-spread the problem is and how large it is.
It's likely that the magnitude of the difference varies based on factors
such as which compositor is used and what the refresh rate of the screen is.</p>
<p>I probably won't undertake that further testing,
because this is all very time intensive work.
My goal was only to see if I could conclusively measure <em>some</em> difference.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I want to add a note here about what this testing does <em>not</em> show.
It does not show that there's higher input latency <em>in general</em>
in Wayland compared to X11 in a way which affects, for example, games.
It is possible that this added latency is entirely cursor-specific
and that Wayland and X11 exhibit the exact same input latency
in graphical applications and games.
It is my understanding that the cursor is handled very differently from
normal graphical applications.
Further testing would be necessary to show whether Wayland has more input latency
<em>in games</em> than X11.</p>

Because...</p><!----><h2>No one wants to pay for AI</h2><p>There's a ton of potential in AI, and it has some solid use cases today, for tasks like <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-write-code-what-it-does-well-and-what-it-doesnt/">writing code</a> and finding patterns in large databases.</p><p>But in the places where Microsoft 365 Family and Personal subscribers are likely to see AI, the edges are still very, very rough. If you ask Copilot in Word to write something for you, the results will be about what you'd expect from an enthusiastic summer intern. You might fare better if you ask Copilot to turn a folder full of photos into a PowerPoint presentation. But is that task really such a challenge?</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-ai-for-coding-in-2025-and-what-not-to-use/">The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)</a></strong></p><p>To top that off, there are similarly rough edges in the way the Copilot features are implemented. For example, I have both work and family subscriptions to Microsoft 365. This combination normally works very well; I can sign in with one account, attach resources like OneDrive from both accounts, and work with almost no friction.</p><p>But good luck doing the same with Copilot features. In that configuration, I consistently get error messages telling me, "As a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscriber, you'll be able to use Copilot when you're signed with your Microsoft work or school account (<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-launches-entra-a-new-identity-and-access-family-of-products/">Entra ID</a>) and Microsoft personal account. However, that ability is not yet available."</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="m365-copilot-error" width="740" height="994.2798353909466" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>If you pay for a personal and work subscription to Microsoft 365, you'll pay the higher price but won't get the new features.</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let me see if I understand this: I'm paying Microsoft for not one but two subscriptions, and they raised the price of one of those subscriptions while not allowing me to use its signature feature. That seems like a lousy way to reward your best customers.</p><h2>The announcement was bungled, too</h2><p>I pay annually for my Microsoft 365 Family subscription. The price went up more than a week ago, but I haven't received an email telling me about it. As the account manager, I should see that notice before I see the new price in my dashboard.</p><p>Instead, I learned about the new price thanks to a pop-up message on my Android phone.</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="price-change-for-microsoft-365" width="740" height="1178.5185185185185" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>This po-up on my phone is the only notice I've received about a price change.&nbsp;</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>That notice tells me I have a monthly plan. No, I have an annual plan that will renew in a month or two. It says I can cancel billing in my Play Store settings. No, I can't. I bought this subscription using the web browser on my Windows PC, and when I tap the Subscriptions button in the Android app it opens a web browser and takes me to my Microsoft account page, where I have to tap the Manage button to find the cancel option.</p><p>It could be worse, I suppose. Just ask the French and Spanish subscribers who got a similar pop-up message telling them their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Office365/comments/1i75h77/microsoft_365_from_10_to_1300_a_month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">price had gone from €10 a month to €13,000</a>. (Those pesky decimals.)</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/microsoft-is-changing-the-way-you-sign-in-and-it-could-be-a-security-nightmare/">Microsoft is changing the way you sign in - and it could be a security nightmare</a></strong></p><p>Oh, and I've lost count of the number of people who were baffled and angry that Microsoft had forcibly installed the Copilot app on their devices. It was just a rebranding of the old Microsoft 365 app with the new name and logo, but in my case it was days later before I received yet another pop-up message telling me about the change.</p><h2>Well, surely you can just turn it off. Right?</h2><p>The smartest thing Microsoft could have done was to make this initial release of Copilot an opt-in feature for a few months. They could have said, "We're excited to let everyone try this! Just click OK here!"</p><p>Instead, they turned the feature on for everyone and gave Word users a well-hidden checkbox that reads Enable Copilot. The feature is on by default, so you have to clear the checkbox to make it go away.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-office-support-in-windows-10-ends-in-october-too-what-that-really-means/">Microsoft Office support in Windows 10 ends in October too - what that really means</a></strong></p><p>As for the other Office apps? "Uh, we'll get around to giving you a button to turn it off next month. Maybe."</p><p>Seriously, the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-turn-off-copilot-in-microsoft-365-family-and-personal-subscriptions-bc7e530b-152d-4123-8e78-edc06f8b85f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">support page that explains where you can find that box in Word</a>&nbsp;says, "We're working on adding the Enable Copilot checkbox to Excel, OneNote, and PowerPoint on Windows devices and to Excel and PowerPoint on Mac devices. That is tentatively scheduled to happen in February 2025." Until the Enable Copilot button is available, you can't disable Copilot.</p><p>Meanwhile, maybe think twice about using the option to disable all of the connected features in your Office apps. As&nbsp;<a href="https://laurenhough.substack.com/p/there-are-some-swear-words-in-this" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one writer pointed out</a>&nbsp;(with multiple swear words and some threats aimed in the general direction of One Microsoft Way), doing so can have unintended consequences, like making it appear as though all your files in OneDrive have suddenly disappeared.</p><h2>How long will the Classic option last?</h2><p>If you try to cancel Microsoft 365 to avoid the price increase (or just to say no to the AI features), Microsoft's subscription  management page offers the option to downgrade to a Classic plan, which turns out to be exactly what you signed up for not that long ago, minus the price increase.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-top-10-brands-exploited-in-phishing-attacks-and-how-to-protect-yourself/">The top 10 brands exploited in phishing attacks - and how to protect yourself</a></strong></p><p>That's purely a retention play, of course. New subscribers can't sign up for this plan, and I expect that it will be discontinued in a year or two.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why is Microsoft doing this?</h2><p>I have yet to see a single person praising the implementation of Copilot in Microsoft 365 or telling Satya Nadella they've gotten their money's worth out of this unexpected upgrade.</p><p>So, why do it at all? I can think of 3 billion reasons. I could plug the numbers into Excel and tell you about it, but let's have Copilot explain instead.</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="microsoft-copilot-dows-math" width="1280" height="1176.167832167832" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>Microsoft Copilot understands how the subscription business model works.</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>Microsoft is halfway through its 2026 fiscal year. It's almost like someone was given instructions at the end of the calendar year to bump up that revenue line for the Office Consumer division.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-i-easily-added-ai-to-my-favorite-microsoft-office-alternative/">How I easily added AI to my favorite Microsoft Office alternative</a></strong></p><p>Here's the funny thing: The price increase is so big that there will still be a huge positive impact even if 10% of Microsoft 365 Personal and Family customers cancel rather than pay the extra monthly fee. Copilot walked me through the math and concluded, "So, even with 10% of your customers canceling their subscriptions, you would still generate an additional $1.714 billion annually due to the price hike. How do you feel about this adjustment?"</p><p>I feel like I understand why all those complaints are going to go unheard.</p><div id="pinbox-684151ed-848f-4f0d-a5f9-d91e36c294b3"><h4>More Microsoft</h4> <!---->  </div></div></div>]]></description>

<img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" alt="Two caricatures of top-hatted millionaires whose bodies are bulging money-sacks. Their heads have been replaced with potatoes. The potatoes' eyes have been replaced with the hostile red eye of HAL 9000 from Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey.' They stand in a potato field filled with stoop laborers. The sky is a 'code waterfall' as seen in the credit sequences of the Wachowskis' 'Matrix' movies." src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/big-potato.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1"></p>
<h2>It's not a crime if we do it with an app (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/25/potatotrac/#carbo-loading">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>The core regulatory proposition of the tech industry is "it's not a crime if we do it with an app." It's not an unlicensed taxi if we do it with an app. It's not an illegal hotel room if we do it with an app. It's not an unregistered security if we do it with an app. It's not wage theft if we do it with an app.</p>
<p>Inflation is one of the most politically salient factors of this decade, and so much of inflation can be attributed to a crime, done with an app, with impunity for the criminals. The entire food supply has been sewn up by cartels of 2-5 giant companies, and they colluded to raise prices, and bragged about it, and got away with it, because neoclassical economists insist that it's impossible for this kind of price fixing to occur in an "efficient market."</p>
<p>Some of these cartels are well-known, like the Coke/Pepsi duopoly. Pepsi's bosses boasted to their shareholders about "Pepsi pricing power," and how they were able to raise prices over the inflationary increases caused by covid and the Russian invasion of Ukraine:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power">https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power</a></p>
<p>You might know that pretty much every packaged good in your grocery store is made by one of two companies, Unilever and Procter and Gamble. Both CEOs boasted to their investors about their above-inflation price increases:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering">https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering</a></p>
<p>But other cartels are harder to spot. It may seem like your grocer's eggs department is filled with many different companies' products. In reality, a single company, Cal-Maine Foods, owns practically every brand of eggs in the case: Farmhouse Eggs, Sunups, Sunny Meadow, Egg-Land’s Best and Land O’ Lakes. They made record profits after the pandemic and through bird flu, a fact that CFO Max Bowman attributed to "significantly higher selling prices" and "our ability to adapt to inflationary market pressures":</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/23/cant-make-an-omelet/#keep-calm-and-crack-on">https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/23/cant-make-an-omelet/#keep-calm-and-crack-on</a></p>
<p>But Cal-Maine is comparatively transparent. The other food cartels – especially those that serve the restaurant sector – are harder to spot. In <em>The Lever</em>, Katya Schwenk describes how four companies – Lamb Weston, JR Simplot, McCain Foods and Cavendish Farms – have captured the frozen potato market and all that comes with it (fries, tater tots, etc):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.levernews.com/the-rise-of-big-potato/">https://www.levernews.com/the-rise-of-big-potato/</a></p>
<p>These companies have been hiking prices for years, but <em>really</em> started to turn the screws during the post-covid inflationary period. One of Schwenk's sources is Josh Saltzman, owner of the DC sports bar Ivy and Coney. Ten years ago, Saltzman charged $3 for fries; now it's $6 – and Saltzman's margins have declined. Saltzman has a limited number of suppliers, and they all get their potatoes from Big Potato, and they bundle those potato orders with their other supplies, making it effectively impossible for Saltzman to buy his potatoes from anyone else.</p>
<p>Big Potato controls <em>97%</em> of the frozen potato market, and any sector that large and concentrated is going to be pretty cozy. The execs at these companies all meet at industry associations, lobbying bodies, and as they job-hop between companies in the cartel. But they don't have to rely on personal connections to rig the price of potatoes: they do it through a third-party data-broker called Potatotrac. Each cartel member sends all their commercially sensitive data – supply costs, pricing, sales figures – to Potatotrac, and then Potatotrac uses that data to give "advice" to the cartel members about "optimal pricing."</p>
<p>This is just price-fixing, with an app. The fact that they don't sit around a table and openly discuss pricing doesn't keep this from being price-fixing. What's more, they <em>admit it</em>. A director at McCain said that "higher ups" forbade anyone in the company from competing on price. A Lamb Weston exec described the arrangement as everyone "behaving themselves," chortling that they'd "never seen margins this high in the history of the potato industry." Lamb Weston's CEO attributed a 111% increase in net income to "pricing actions."</p>
<p>Lamb Weston's execs understand that they're driving small restaurants out of business, and that the real beneficiaries are big chains that can pass the price increases onto their customers, like "Chili’s and the Texas Roadhouses and Cheesecake Factory":</p>
<p><a href="https://app.tegus.co/guest/document/view/67Hf3DiMGQ944SkfpRhLfNeiqekjA67sm2dxTCYtjoggUaJXk2chDg9wxMnZ">https://app.tegus.co/guest/document/view/67Hf3DiMGQ944SkfpRhLfNeiqekjA67sm2dxTCYtjoggUaJXk2chDg9wxMnZ</a></p>
<p>This is by no means unique to the potato industry. A data-broker called Agri Stats works with America's largest meat-packers to rig the price of meat – packers send Agri Stats the same kind of data that Big Potato sends to Potatotrac, and Agri Stats sends back the same "recommendations" that allow them to raise meat prices across the board, in lockstep:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/04/dont-let-your-meat-loaf/#meaty-beaty-big-and-bouncy">https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/04/dont-let-your-meat-loaf/#meaty-beaty-big-and-bouncy</a></p>
<p>Lots of food categories are as inbred as meat and potatoes: "four firms controlled nearly 80 percent of the almond milk market, for instance. Three companies controlled 83 percent of the canned tuna market, and four companies controlled more than 86 percent of the microwave popcorn market."</p>
<p>The "price fixing is legal if we do it with an app" gambit is not just about food, either. Apps like Realpage let big corporate landlords – who've bought up a sizable fraction of all the available homes in America – collude to raise rents:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/27/ai-conspiracies/#epistemological-collapse">https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/27/ai-conspiracies/#epistemological-collapse</a></p>
<p>And private equity companies have rolled up all the <em>fire truck</em> companies, hiking the price of trucks, creating backlogs and bottlenecks for parts and service, and starving the nation's municipalities (including Los Angeles) of fire-fighting equipment:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/did-a-private-equity-fire-truck-roll">https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/did-a-private-equity-fire-truck-roll</a></p>
<p>This kind of price-fixing was central to the enforcement actions of the Biden administration's trustbusters at the FTC, and their investigations and actions inspired state AGs and private parties to bring their own antitrust suits. The question is, will Trump's enforcers continue this agenda? And will Trump's judges – steeped in Heritage Foundation economics that insists that monopolies are "efficient" – find in their favor if they do?</p>
<p>Inflation has lots of causes, it's true. But when an industry is consolidated enough to take advantage of a data brokerage or just engage in tacit collusion, <em>any</em> source of inflation – war, disease, weather – allows whole sectors to raise prices together, and keep them high, long after the shock has passed.</p>

<p><span>On the last full day of his country’s existence, South Vietnamese air force Maj. Buang-Ly stole a tiny two-seat airplane. He helped his wife and their five children<b>, </b>ages 14 months to 6 years, into the backseat and storage area before climbing into the pilot’s seat. They took off and headed out to sea while enemy ground fire zipped past them. </span></p>

Two years earlier, the 1973 Paris peace agreement had theoretically ended the war, but after American combat forces left the country, the North Vietnamese took the opportunity to press their new strategic advantage. The long war between North and South Vietnam paused only briefly before ferocious fighting resumed.</span></p>



<p>In early 1975, the North Vietnamese Army seized key bases in the Central Highlands, and, by the end of March, had captured areas along the coast. The remaining American advisers and many South Vietnamese families began frenzied evacuations on American military aircraft and civilian transport planes.</p>



<p>Those large, fixed-wing aircraft flew thousands of people to hastily constructed camps in the Philippines, Guam and Wake Island. The last plane out of Da Nang, a civilian Boeing 727 on March 29, was unable to retract its landing gear in flight because at least seven of the 290 passengers had climbed into its wheel wells. Soon North Vietnamese forces were shelling Saigon.</p>

<p><b>Buang and his family were stationed on Con Son Island</b><strong>,</strong> about 50 miles off the southern coast and home to one of the last bases still under South Vietnamese control. Used mainly as a prison camp, the island also had a small airfield. When Buang and his wife learned that North Vietnamese forces were closing in, they loaded as many of their possessions as possible into the plane and got airborne—with no plan for what to do next.</p>



<p><span>Their tiny aircraft, an O-1 Bird Dog, was a modified Cessna 170, a light, single-engine tail dragger with fixed landing gear. Ruggedly built and highly maneuverable, Bird Dogs flew over South Vietnam’s terrain during the war, spotting enemy targets and then marking them with white phosphorous rockets to guide U.S. artillery shelling and airstrikes. The planes could take off and land on a dime, but their range was limited to just over 500 miles when fully fueled—and Buang’s fuel tank was not. </span></p>



<p><span>As Buang coaxed the overloaded plane airborne, he faced enormous challenges. The Bird Dog was not designed to operate over water. It lacked sophisticated navigation equipment, life vests and the ability to safely ditch in an emergency. Buang had never seen, much less landed on, an aircraft carrier—and to make matters worse, this Bird Dog had no working radio because Buang had not been able to bring a headset. Still, he knew that his family was more likely to find safety out at sea, where the U.S. Navy was in control, than on the land now controlled by communist forces under Gen. Van Tien Dung.</span></p>



<p><span>After flying for a half-hour, Buang spotted a gaggle of helicopters in the distance heading east. At the time he had no idea they were loaded with friendly evacuees, but it seemed like a good idea to follow them. “I was searching for a safe place,” Buang later recalled. “It made me think there was something out there they could depend on.”</span></p>



<p><span><b>On April 19, 10 days before the Buang family </b>departed Con Son Island, the aircraft carrier USS <em>Midway</em> had received orders to leave Naval Station Subic Bay in the Philippines and make best speed toward Saigon to help evacuate the roughly 5,000 Americans remaining there, including diplomats, CIA agents, contractors and a handful of Marines. <em>Midway</em> and the rest of the 7th Fleet would also evacuate as many friendly Vietnamese as possible. </span></p>



<p><span>The old ship had been in service since September 1945 and was just starting a pier side repair period. Its engineering plant, which had been taken offline for maintenance, needed to be hastily restored to operation, and the ship got underway with fewer sailors than normal. At Subic Bay, <em>Midway</em> offloaded half of the fixed-wing jets in its combat air wing. When the ship reached the South China Sea, it received 10 large <a href="https://www.historynet.com/hh-53-super-jolly-green-giant.htm">Sikorsky H-53</a> helicopters—two U.S. Air Force HH-53s from the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron and eight CH-53s from the Air Force’s 21st Special Operations Squadron. Each of these choppers could comfortably transport 55 passengers at a time. </span></p>



<p><span>The mission, dubbed Operation Frequent Wind, would employ an ad-hoc fleet of helicopters and several elements of the 7th Fleet—an impressive array of combat vehicles—to conduct a massive humanitarian operation, transporting and caring for thousands of refugees. During transit, the carrier’s crew got busy training for the work ahead.</span></p>

<p>Throughout the war, most air operations from carriers like <em>Midway</em> had been combat sorties: bombing, intelligence gathering and combat air patrol. Noncombat logistics operations normally took up only a small slice of a day’s action on the flight deck. The logistics crews usually transferred a few dozen passengers a day, maybe brought onboard a new jet engine or other supplies, and shipped mail via plane or helicopter.</p>



<p>Typically, a junior air transfer officer leading a crew of about a dozen sailors could easily handle the load. But for Operation Frequent Wind, the entire ship and its crew were devoted to the effort. The carrier’s senior enlisted sailors led the rest of the crew in drills designed to account for every imaginable problem.</p>



<p><span>On the morning of April 29, former South Vietnamese Prime Minister and Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, accompanied by Lt. Gen. Ngo Quang Truong, requested permission to land on the <em>Midway</em>, after making a one-hour, 15-minute helicopter flight from the mainland. Their arrival signaled to the carrier’s officers that Operation Frequent Wind had begun. About 11 a.m. that morning Secretary of State Henry Kissinger finally gave American diplomats the order to evacuate. An American radio station broadcast the secret signal: “The temperature in Saigon is 105 degrees and rising,” followed by Tennessee Ernie Ford’s “White Christmas”</span><span>—</span><span>because the DJ couldn’t find the more well-known Bing Crosby version. The signal told evacuees in Saigon to move to pre-assigned extraction locations, board buses there and head to the airport. </span></p>



<p><span><b>As the official evacuation commenced</b><strong>,</strong> many resourceful Vietnamese commandeered whatever aircraft they could to fly to safety. “At least 74 planes of the South Vietnamese Air Force, including about 30 F-5 fighters, streamed into the U Taphao air base in southern Thailand from South Vietnam without warning,” </span><span><em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> reported the next day. “The pilots and passengers—about 2,000 people—requested asylum,” and more planes kept arriving. Thai officials declared their intention to return the aircraft to South Vietnam, which soon became impossible as the South was absorbed into a unified Vietnam under Hanoi’s communist leadership.</span></p>



<p><span>More choppers began arriving on <em>Midway</em>’s flight deck. The ship’s contingent of Marines and the sergeant at arms searched the new arrivals for contraband and weapons, confiscating pistols and wads of worthless South Vietnamese cash that they threw over the side. Then they helped passengers into the ship’s command structure on the starboard side, known as “the island,” where crew members gave them food and basic medical care. All but 80 or so of the most dire cases were transferred by helicopter to other ships to be distributed across the whole fleet, a process that went on well into the next day. </span></p>



<p><span>Young, tough sailors who were used to handling bombs, chains and fuel lines amid the roar of jet engines now devoted themselves to caring for bewildered parents, frightened children, the elderly and the sick. The flight deck was choked with choppers and lines of men and women carrying suitcases and children. The hangar bay below decks ran out of room for more aircraft as efforts to aid hundreds of refugees continued there.</span></p>



<p><span>The <em>Midway</em> was commanded by Capt. Lawrence Chambers, the first African-American carrier captain and just the second to graduate from the U.S. Naval Academy when he earned his degree in 1952. Chambers had reported aboard the carrier in January 1975 and been in command for only a few weeks. In a television interview 35 years later, he recalled the scene as he watched from his chair on the bridge, just above the action: “A flight deck is a hazardous operation under normal conditions. And when you see little kids and mothers holding little babies, and airplanes, helicopters are taking off and landing, you just kind of hold your breath.” </span></p>



<p>Weather conditions were not ideal, observed the ship’s air boss, Cmdr. Vern Jumper, from his perch five stories above the flight deck in the Primary Flight Control room<b>. </b>Jumper was responsible for all aspects of flight operations, including any aircraft flying near the ship, all the action on the flight deck, and the work happening down in the hangar bay. He noted rain falling from a 500-foot cloud ceiling, 15 knots (17 mph) of wind over the deck and 5 miles visibility. But the seas remained relatively calm, which meant the deck, though sometimes slick with water, wasn’t pitching.</p>



<p><span>Air traffic controllers inside the ship and landing signals crew on deck used whatever means necessary to keep helicopters in order as they approached. Communication went smoothly with the 10 H-53 helicopters that were part of the operation. They would land, unload, refuel and make repeated trips to Saigon. By mid-afternoon, an additional 45 <a href="https://www.historynet.com/arsenal-uh-1-iroquois-huey-helicopter.htm">UH-1 Iroquois</a> “Huey” helicopters had arrived from the mainland. Most had no ability to communicate with the ship via radio. “We were using hand signals to the pilots to control where they landed on the flight deck,” Jumper recalled 35 years later. Sailors and aircrews also communicated via signal flags and colored signal lamps—red, don’t land; green, OK to land. </span></p>



<p>Every pilot managed his fuel and waited patiently for his turn. At one point, Jumper and his assistant, Cmdr. Pete Theodorelos, counted 26 helicopters circling the carrier while sailors assisted waves of arriving passengers. As soon as a chopper’s rotors stopped twirling, sailors pushed it away from the action, using small rectangular tractors or brute manpower. By packing the incoming aircraft close together, they were able to recover them all. None had to ditch next to the carrier, but the flight deck soon filled to capacity.</p>

<p><b>Toward the end of that wild afternoon</b>, spotters on the carrier saw a tiny two-seat Cessna come into view. Through binoculars they counted at least four people in the plane, which had South Vietnamese markings. The Bird Dog began circling overhead with its landing lights switched on. Periodically the pilot rocked the plane’s wings. A Vietnamese translator was rushed to Primary Flight Control to join Jumper and Theodorelos in the ship’s tower, but attempts to radio the plane were met with static. From the bridge Chambers quickly consulted task force commander Adm. William Harris, who was at his battle station below deck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The admiral ordered me to tell the Bird Dog to ditch,” Chambers later recalled. A helicopter could be dispatched to drop swimmers in the water and rescue the occupants. Other pilots flying choppers near the rest of the 7th Fleet were putting their aircraft into the sea. They hovered to drop passengers onto the fleet’s smaller ships, including destroyers and supply craft. When all passengers had safely left a chopper, the pilot would maneuver away and steer the machine on a course to safely ditch into open water. At the last moment he would jump clear of the rotors and drop into the sea, then swim toward the nearest vessel.</p>



<p><span>However, the fixed-wing Bird Dog couldn’t hover to drop off its passengers, and its fixed landing gear would cause the plane to flip onto its back as soon as the wheels touched the water. Only a well-trained crew member, properly strapped in, would get out alive. If the plane was ditched, the rest of its occupants had almost no chance. </span></p>



<p>“My judgment told me, if I didn’t give him a chance to land that he was going to crash it on the deck,” Chambers said.</p>



<p>As the Bird Dog circled, the pilot dropped three paper notes from the plane, but they blew over the side before the ship’s crew could snatch them. On the next pass he stuffed a fourth note into his pistol’s leather holster to weigh it down, and sailors rushed to grab the little package after it hit the deck. They read a scribbled message written on a crumpled chart of South Vietnam: Can you mouve [sic] these Helicopter to the other side, I can land on your runway, I can fly 1 hour more, we have enough time to mouve. Please rescue me. Major Buang wife and 5 child.</p>



<p>The message was quickly relayed to the bridge where Chambers was discussing the situation with Jumper over the phone. Ignoring pressure from the admiral, Chambers decided to do whatever was necessary to let the Bird Dog land, even if that meant throwing millions of dollars worth of equipment over the side and possibly being relieved of his command.</p>



<p>“Vern,” Chambers said into the phone, “give me a ready deck.” Jumper called for all available crewmen and volunteers to help prepare the angled flight deck for the Cessna. Meanwhile, with six boilers offline for maintenance, Chambers ordered his chief engineer to transfer the ship’s electric load to the emergency diesel engines and make steam for 25 knots (29 mph).</p>

<p>The captain turned his ship into the wind to prepare for a fixed-wing landing. Fire crews readied their hoses and donned fire-retardant suits. Since the Bird Dog had no tail hook, sailors removed the four landing cables that normally spanned the runway. Other crew members leaned in together to heave three Hueys and one Chinook over the side. When their skids went over the flight deck’s edge, the empty choppers nosed up, twisted, then fell backward into the sea with big splashes.</p>



<p><span>Immediately, five more airborne Huey pilots took advantage of the cleared runway to land and disembark their passengers. Assuming he would be court martialed, Chambers ordered those helicopters thrown overboard as well. He later told interviewers that since he expected to be deposed by prosecutors, he turned away from the action to avoid seeing exactly how many were pushed into the sea. In the same interview Jumper also claimed not to know how many helicopters went overboard. </span></p>



<p><span>The old ship rattled and groaned as its speed increased. Jumper gave the green lamp signal to land. Buang made two practice passes over the ship to get a feel for the approach while translators—in English and Vietnamese—tried to warn him about the dangerous downdrafts that naturally occur behind the ship’s fantail. With no response, the crew could only watch, hoping that he would carry enough power to fly through that turbulence.</span></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="640" src="https://www.historynet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Buang-family-960_640.jpg" alt="South Vietnamese Major Buang and his family are escorted by a Marine Security Guard across the deck of the USS Midway in one of the most dramatic moments during operation Frequent Wind.

<p><span>Buang lowered the Bird Dog’s flaps and approached in a shallow descent at a speed of 60 knots (69 mph). With the ship providing an estimated 40 knots (46 mph) of headwind to aid the landing, the light plane slowly caught up. It seemed to flutter for a moment just above the deck, then bounced once in the landing area and rolled to a smooth stop in the middle of the runway.</span></p>



<p><span>Dozens of sailors ran toward the plane to grab it in case the aircraft’s momentum was enough to send it over the side, but the Bird Dog stayed where it had stopped. A hodgepodge of&nbsp;</span><span>squadron crew and ship’s company weighed the plane down with their bodies while Buang and his wife, carrying their youngest child, climbed out of the cockpit. He pulled forward the seat and out tumbled the other four children. Cheers rang out and sailors clapped while the family walked into the ship’s island. </span></p>



<p><span><b>Altogether, 71 American helicopters</b> flew a total of 662 sorties from Saigon to the 7th<span>&nbsp;</span>Fleet’s ships, rescuing more than 7,800 people. The 10 Air Force H-53s flew four round trips from the Midway to Saigon, evacuating more than 1,400 personnel from the start of the operation on the morning of April 29 until its end at 9 a.m. on April 30. Three hours later, South Vietnamese Gen. Duong Van Minh surrendered Saigon to North Vietnamese Col. Bui Tin, effectively ending the war—as well as the nation of South Vietnam.</span></p>



<p><span>The Bird Dog Buang-Ly flew that day now hangs at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida. Chambers kept his job as the aircraft carrier’s captain and was later promoted to rear admiral; he retired in 1984. Nobody was prosecuted for the estimated $10 million loss of the helicopters that Chambers ordered overboard. The Midway’s crew collected money to help ease the transition for the Buang family, who became seven of the estimated 130,000 refugees from the Vietnam War to eventually resettle in the United States. All seven are now naturalized American citizens. </span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/23/ai_developer_devin_poor_reviews/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/23/ai_developer_devin_poor_reviews/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42826022">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A service described as "the first AI software engineer" appears to be rather bad at its job, based on a recent evaluation.</p>
<p>The auto-coder is called “Devin” and was <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cognition.ai/blog/introducing-devin">introduced</a> in March 2024. The bot’s creator, an outfit called Cognition AI, has made claims such as “Devin can build and deploy apps end to end," and "can autonomously find and fix bugs in codebases." The tool <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cognition.ai/blog/devin-generally-available">reached general availability</a> in December 2024, starting at $500 per month.</p>
<p>"Devin is an autonomous AI software engineer that can write, run and test code, helping software engineers work on personal tasks or their team projects," Cognition's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.devin.ai/get-started/devin-intro">documentation</a> declares. It "can review PRs, support code migrations, respond to on-call issues, build web applications, and even perform personal assistant tasks like ordering your lunch on DoorDash so you can stay locked in on your codebase."</p>

    

<p>The service uses Slack as its main interface for commands, which are sent to its computing environment, a Docker container that hosts a terminal, browser, code editor, and planner. The AI agent supports API integration with external services. This allows it, for example, to send email messages on a user's behalf via SendGrid.</p>

        


        

<p>Devin is a "<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cognition.ai/blog/evaluating-coding-agents">compound AI system</a>," meaning it relies on multiple underlying AI models, a set that has included OpenAI's GPT-4o and can be expected to evolve over time.</p>
<p>In theory, you should be able to ask it to undertake tasks like migrating code to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a>, a Jupyter Notebook development platform, and expect it to do so successfully. But that may be asking too much.</p>

        

<p>Early assessments of Devin have found problems. Cognition AI posted a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTS2Hz96HYQ">promo video</a> that supposedly showed the AI coder autonomously completing projects on the freelancer-for-hire platform Upwork. Software developer <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/carlbrown">Carl Brown</a> analyzed that vid and debunked it on his <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNmgmwEtoWE">Internet of Bugs YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>The software agent was also called out by another YouTube code pundit for allegedly including <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=927W6zzvV-c">critical security issues</a>.</p>
<p>Now, three data scientists affiliated with <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://answer.ai/">Answer.AI</a>, an AI research and development lab founded by Jeremy Howard and Eric Ries, have <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://devin.ai/">tested Devin</a> and found it completed just three out of 20 tasks successfully.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/22/datacenter_emissions_not_accurate/">Analysts say real datacenter emissions are a dirty secret</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/22/business_value_genai_elusive/">Business value from GenAI remains elusive despite IT spending boom</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/22/google_deepmind_ai_drugs/">Google DeepMind CEO says 2025's the year we start popping pills AI helped invent</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/22/openai_stargate_ai_datacenter_company/">OpenAI to blow through $500B on AI infrastructure for itself with help from pals</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2025-01-08-devin.html#what-is-devin">analysis</a> conducted earlier this month by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://hamel.dev/">Hamel Husain</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://isaac-flath.github.io/website/blog.html">Isaac Flath</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://johnowhitaker.dev/">Johno Whitaker</a>, Devin started well, successfully pulling data from a Notion database into Google Sheets. The AI agent also managed to create a planet tracker for checking claims about the historical positions of Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
<p>But as the three researchers continued their testing, they encountered problems.</p>

        

<p>"Tasks that seemed straightforward often took days rather than hours, with Devin getting stuck in technical dead-ends or producing overly complex, unusable solutions," the researchers explain in their report. "Even more concerning was Devin’s tendency to press forward with tasks that weren’t actually possible."</p>
<p>As an example, they cited how Devin, when asked to deploy multiple applications to the infrastructure deployment platform <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://railway.com/">Railway</a>, failed to understand this wasn't supported and spent more than a day trying approaches that didn't work and hallucinating non-existent features.</p>
<p>Of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2025-01-08-devin.html#appendix-tasks-attempted-with-devin">20 tasks presented to Devin</a>, the AI software engineer completed just three of them satisfactorily – the two cited above and a third challenge to research how to build a Discord bot in Python. Three other tasks produced inconclusive results, and 14 projects were outright failures.</p>
<p>The researchers said that Devin provided a polished user experience that was impressive when it worked.</p>
<p>"But that’s the problem – it rarely worked," they wrote.</p>
<p>"More concerning was our inability to predict which tasks would succeed. Even tasks similar to our early wins would fail in complex, time-consuming ways. The autonomous nature that seemed promising became a liability – Devin would spend days pursuing impossible solutions rather than recognizing fundamental blockers."</p>
<p>Cognition AI did not respond to a request for comment. ®</p>

  <p>
    <span>“</span> 
     One of those terrible ideas that I am so glad someone tried
    <span>”</span>
  </p>

  <p>- Some guy on reddit</p> 

</div>

<h2 id="but-why">But… Why?</h2>

<p>TL;DR Well, the Steam Deck didn’t fit in my backpack…</p>

<p>The Steam Deck has been a game changer for travel, but I found myself leaving it behind more often than not, as it wouldn’t fit in my backpack, took up a huge amount of carry-on space, and was a hassle to bring down from the overhead compartment when I wanted to use it.
When I did use the Deck, it was either plugged in to AR Glasses (<a href="https://amzn.to/3CpmMgW">XReal Air 2 Pro</a>) or plugged in to a TV. So, I got to thinking: it could be so much smaller and lighter without the build in controller and screen, but that would be ridiculous, right? …right?</p>

<h2 id="️-disclaimer">⚠️ Disclaimer</h2>
<p>“I am not a smart man”</p>

<p>This project was not approved or endorsed in any way by Valve and is generally a very bad idea. I’m honestly surprised it worked and have no idea how long the modified console will survive. The following is provided “as is” and without any expressed or implied warranty. If you choose to attempt this do so at your own risk. Be warned that are likely to “brick” (as in destroy, but pun intended) your console and you might get hurt in the process (lithium batteries and power tools are dangerous, among other things).</p>

<p>This is not a guide, more of a “how I did it”. If there’s enough interest, I might expand this to a more step-by-step style write-up. Until then, feel free to reach out via the <a href="https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick/issues">issues page</a> page or on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Crastinator_Pro/s/F3Rk6jFndK">reddit</a> if you have any questions.

<p>First of all – huge shoutout to iFixIt for their great <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Steam_Deck">Steam Deck Repair Guides</a> as well as to Valve for supporting the DIY repair and mod community!</p>

<p>This mod was performed on a <a href="https://amzn.to/40MP0f7">1TB OLED Steam Deck</a>, there are some differences between the OLED and LCD models.</p>

<p>The first hurdle on this ridiculous road was figuring out if the Steam Deck would even boot without any peripherals or a screen attached. Working off the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+Battery+Replacement/149070">battery replacement</a> and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+Motherboard+Replacement/148928">motherboard replacement</a> tutorials was able disconnect everything from the motherboard other than the fan – success!
In this state the Deck will boot output display over USB and accept peripherals via an external dock.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick/blob/main/images/poc.jpg?raw=true" alt="POC: Deck running with bare motherboard"></p>

<h2 id="internals">Internals</h2>

<p>This initial teardown also revealed a useful aluminum(?) frame, unfortunately, you’ll have to remove the screen [link] to remove it from the shell. This shell had some unnecessary “wings” so of course they had to be removed with a rotary tool. With the excess metal removed, I had the perfect internal frame for the Brick.</p>

<p>Note that some of the fan and motherboard cover screws are outer-shell screws which must be added back so everything is properly held in place.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick/blob/main/images/frame.jpg?raw=true" alt="Internal frame">

<img src="https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick/blob/main/images/removed_metal.jpg?raw=true" alt="removed material"></p>

<p>I probably should have removed or masked out the fan before grinding away the metal…</p>

<h2 id="case">Case</h2>

<p>Using my limited CAD abilities, I designed a rudimentary shell for the Brick. The shell has two pegs to align the board and you can add a dollop of PLA with a 3d printing pen to further secure the board to the case. There’s a cutout in the case to accommodate the original power button, and the air intake is sized to accept the metal grill from the original back shell.</p>

<p>I printed out the case in Overture Polycarbonate Pro (PC) [link] which <em>should</em> be  heat-resistant enough not to melt while the deck attempts to run Cyberpunk 2077. Color accents were added in PLA with a 3D printing pen.</p>

<h2 id="result">Result</h2>

<p><img src="https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick/blob/main/images/IMG_3315.jpg?raw=true" alt="Result and setup"></p>

<p>And there it is, in all its glory: the Steam Brick!
About a 3rd of the size of the Deck, and about 4 times smaller than the Deck’s OEM case. As a bonus, it’s also 24% lighter!</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Why remove the screen? It wouldn’t have made the build larger!</strong></p>

<p>Keeping the screen would have significantly complicated the build, as you’d need something to keep in in place. More importantly – the brick was built to be tossed in a bag as-is. No case, no screen protector, just throw it in a backpack or suitcase and don’t worry about it!</p>

<p><strong>Why did you do this again?</strong></p>

<p>Because I was so preoccupied with whether or not I could that I didn’t stop to think if I should.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>The build includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>4x 3M heat set inserts</li>
  <li>4x 20mm 3M screws</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="known-issue">Known Issue</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Accessing the BIOS is currently impossible as it requires holding down the ‘+’ button while powering up, and that button isn’t included in the build. Haven’t found a workaround yet.</li>
  <li>It’s difficult to tell if the Brick is on or not – as the Deck’s indicator light doesn’t indicate on/off status</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the story of how Apple made a mistake in the ROM of the Macintosh Classic II that probably should have prevented it from booting, but instead, miraculously, its Motorola MC68030 CPU accidentally prevented a crash and saved the day by executing an undefined instruction.</p>



<p>I’ve been playing around with <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MAME</a> a lot lately. If you haven’t heard of MAME, it’s an emulator that is known best for its support of many arcade games. It’s so much more than that, though! It is also arguably the most complete emulator of 68000-based Mac models, thanks in large part to <a href="https://rbelmont.mameworld.info/" data-type="link" data-id="https://rbelmont.mameworld.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arbee</a>‘s incredible efforts. I will admit that I’ve used MAME to play a game or two of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles:_Turtles_in_Time" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles:_Turtles_in_Time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time</a>, but my main use for it is Mac emulation.</p>



<p>Here’s how this adventure begins. I had been <a href="https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commit/178e9fee20c508ca3c1125c2f211c43c8c848f6e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fixing some issues in MAME with the command + power key combination that invokes the debugger</a>, and decided to see if the keystroke also worked on the Classic II. Even though this Mac model has a physical interrupt button on the side, it also has an “Egret” 68HC05 microcontroller for handling the keyboard and mouse (among other things) that should be able to detect the keypress and signal a non-maskable interrupt to the main CPU. I believe the Egret disables this keystroke by default, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacsBug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MacsBug</a> contains code that sends the command to enable it.</p>



<p>I didn’t get very far while testing the command+power shortcut in MAME’s emulated Classic II, because I observed something very odd. It booted up totally fine in 24-bit addressing mode, but I could not get it to boot at all if I enabled 32-bit addressing, which I needed in order for MacsBug to load. It would just pop up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_startup#Sad_Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sad Mac</a>, complete with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_startup#Chimes_of_Death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chimes of Death</a>. On this machine, the death chime is a few notes from the Twilight Zone theme song.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-29.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="514" height="416" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-29.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-29.png 514w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-29-300x243.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px"></a></figure>



<p>If you’re not familiar with Apple’s whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS_memory_management#32-bit_clean" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS_memory_management#32-bit_clean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">24-bit versus 32-bit addressing saga</a>, I’ll briefly summarize it for you here. The original Motorola 68000 processor only had 24 address lines even though it used 32 bits internally for addresses. Apple took those eight extra otherwise unused bits and repurposed them for storing flags as a way to save on RAM, which was scarce at the time. When newer machines/processors came out that supported a full 32-bit address space, the upper byte couldn’t be used for flags anymore. Because of that discrepancy, old software would have been incompatible, so newer machines had two modes: 24-bit mode for compatibility with older software, and 32-bit mode for being able to use all of your RAM.</p>



<p>So why was the Classic II failing to boot in 32-bit mode in MAME? What was broken? Arbee also reproduced the issue, so at least I knew I wasn’t losing my mind. I assumed it was a random bug in MAME, so I started looking deeper into it to try to understand what needed to be fixed.</p>



<p>According to <a href="http://absurdengineering.org/library/MASTER%20Tech%20Info%20Library/Hardware%20Troubleshooting%20&amp;%20Service%20Issues/TIL07748%20-%20Macintosh%20-%20Sad%20Mac%20Error%20Code%20Meaning%20(11-95).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an old Apple Tech Info Library article</a>, 0000000F means an exception occurred and 00000001 means the exception was a bus error. A bus error on 68k Macs typically means that something tried to access an invalid address, like if you try to read from or write to an expansion card when there isn’t one installed.</p>



<p>What was the invalid address being accessed? I decided to step through the code using MAME’s amazing debugger to understand what was leading to the crash. Comprehending what’s going on in the ROM with no context at all can be tricky, but luckily, Apple included symbol maps for a bunch of Mac ROMs with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Programmer%27s_Workshop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Macintosh Programmer’s Workshop (MPW)</a>. MPW was Apple’s development environment.</p>



<p>Tracing backwards from the actual Sad Mac screen would be difficult, because there is a ton of code involved in setting up and displaying the screen. To make it easier on myself, I decided I would set a breakpoint on the bus error handler and then look backwards from there. The 68030’s vector table starts at the very beginning of the address space, and the bus error vector is at 0x00000008. With the Sad Mac error still on the screen, here’s what memory looked like at that location:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-26.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" width="571" height="193" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-26.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-26.png 571w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-26-300x101.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px"></a></figure>



<p>This meant the bus error handler was at 0x40A026F0, which is also known as <em>GenExcps</em> in the ROM map. I performed a hard reset of the emulated machine, set a breakpoint on that address, and then waited until it hit the breakpoint. It looks like <em>GenExcps</em> is a big list of BSR instructions that all jump to 0x40A026A0, which is common error handling code identified in the ROM map as <em>ToDeepShit</em>. Nice name, Apple!</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-32.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" width="795" height="393" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-32.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-32.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-32-300x148.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-32-768x380.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>Anyway, since MAME hit my breakpoint, this meant Apple’s technote was correct about it being a bus error. I was able to use the MAME debugger’s <em>history</em> command to show a backtrace of instructions that led to this point. The end of the history output is displayed in the bottom pane of the screenshot below:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-33.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="393" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-33.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-33.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-33-300x148.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-33-768x380.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>If we walk upwards, we can see that the instruction that caused the bus error was at 0x40A43B9C:</p>





<p>I opened up this section of code in IDA, which I still find myself using with 68k Mac stuff because I’m used to it. It was pretty clearly part of the routine that starts at 0x40A43B40, which is helpfully labeled in the ROM map as <em>InstallSoundIntHandler</em>. Let’s look at the whole function in more depth.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-3.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="756" height="107" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-3.png 756w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-3-300x42.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px"></a></figure>



<p>The first thing it does is immediately jump to <em>V8SndIntPatch1</em>. This appears to be something that was patched into this ROM for handling sound initialization for the V8. For some added context, the Classic II isn’t powered by an eight-cylinder gasoline engine; V8 is the name of the custom chip that Apple first used in the Macintosh LC. From the LC hardware developer note:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="512" height="141" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-4.png" alt="A new custom VLSI (very large scale integration) chip, the V8 gate array, is the heart of the hardware design. It integrates the timing, address decode, video generation, clock generation, sound control, and GLU (general logic unit) functions that were provided by individual chips in earlier Macintosh computers." srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-4.png 512w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-4-300x83.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></figure>



<p>Why are we talking about the LC here? Well, the reason is because the Classic II is architecturally based more on the LC than the original Macintosh Classic. Here’s an explanation from the corresponding developer note for the Classic II:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="607" height="354" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-5.png" alt="Although the physical appearance of the Macintosh Classic II computer is very similar to that of the Macintosh Classic, the electrical design of the Macintosh Classic II is based as much as possible on the Macintosh LC architecture. Figure 1-1 is an overall block diagram of the Macintosh Classic II. Notice that the number of components has been significantly reduced through the use of custom integrated circuits. The following are the major changes in the Macintosh Classic II design:

The Macintosh Classic II uses an MC68030 processor rather than the MC68020 used by the Macintosh LC.
A new custom VLSI (very large-scale integration) chip, the EAGLE gate array, is the heart of the hardware design. It integrates the timing, memory mapping, video generation, clock generation, sound control, and glue functions that were provided by individual chips in the earlier Macintosh computers." srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-5.png 607w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-5-300x175.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px"></figure>



<p>The text description of the EAGLE gate array is very similar to that of the V8, so it should come as no surprise that the chips themselves are very similar too. MAME handles them both in the same source file. The point I’m trying to make here is that it makes sense that the Classic II’s ROM has code referring to the V8. With that info out of the way, let’s look at <em>V8SndIntPatch1</em>:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-6.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="763" height="240" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-6.png 763w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-6-300x94.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px"></a></figure>



<p>This chunk of code is calling the Gestalt trap, which is how you determine various info about the Mac. In particular, it’s using the gestaltHardwareAttr selector, which is defined as ‘hdwr’ in Apple’s public header files.</p>



<p>If bit 3 (gestaltHasASC) isn’t set in the response, it bails and returns. Otherwise, it jumps to <em>V8SndIntPatch1Rtn</em> at 0x40A43B4A, which you can see in the history trace in the MAME debugger screenshot from earlier. I went pretty deep into the hardware tables for the Classic II and can confirm that gestaltHasASC is definitely set on the Classic II. After all, the EAGLE contains a stripped-down equivalent of the Apple Sound Chip (ASC).</p>



<p>Now, let’s take a look at <em>V8SndIntPatch1Rtn</em>:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-7.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="1024" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-7-640x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-7-640x1024.png 640w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-7-188x300.png 188w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-7.png 722w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></figure>



<p>Phew! This is a decent amount of code. It’s not that complicated though. I’ll explain the important stuff. You can see the instruction that leads to the Sad Mac at 0x40A43B9C. If you start at the top, what’s happening is it’s loading a byte from RAM at 0xCB3 into register D0:</p>


<div><pre title="">moveq #$0,d0
move.b (byte_CB3).w,d0
</pre></div>


<p>If you know where to look out there, you can discover that this global variable is called BoxFlag and contains a value identifying which machine you have. If I step through this code in MAME, I can see that D0 ends up loaded with the value 0x11 = 17, which is correct for the Classic II.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-34.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="406" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-34.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-34.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-34-300x153.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-34-768x392.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>Continuing further through the code, some other stuff happens, and then at 0x40A43B6C the value in D0 ends up being doubled (so it turns into 0x22). Immediately after this, it is used as an offset in a jump instruction. Here’s IDA’s syntax for the jump, because it’s more intuitive than what MAME displays:</p>


<div><pre title="">add.w d0,d0
jmp loc_40A43B72(pc,d0.w)

<p>Since D0 ends up as 0x22 after being doubled, we jump to 0x40A43B72 + 0x22 = 0x40A43B94, and here’s what that code looks like in MAME’s debugger when we reach it:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="393" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35-300x148.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35-768x380.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>Stepping further through the code, you can see we eventually reach the instruction that causes a Sad Mac. Let’s see what all the registers look like before it’s executed:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-36.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="393" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-36.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-36.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-36-300x148.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-36-768x380.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>Hmm, that’s odd. This crashing instruction writes the value 0x90 to an offset 0x1C00 bytes past the address stored in A1. A1 is set to 0xFFFF8FBA, so the address where the write occurs at is 0xFFFF8FBA + 0x1C00 = 0xFFFFABBA. This is a totally invalid address on the Classic II! No wonder we get a Sad Mac. As expected, as soon as we step into this instruction, instead of reaching the RTS instruction just below it, we end up in the code path for displaying a Sad Mac error at 0x40A026F0. This is definitely where everything craps out.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-37.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="393" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-37.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-37.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-37-300x148.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-37-768x380.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>Okay, so now I had a pretty good idea of what was happening in MAME. A1 had a junk value, so the ROM code was writing to an invalid address. FFFFABBA dabba doo! I decided to investigate further to understand how A1 came to be loaded with a bad address. And that’s when I discovered something really bizarre.</p>



<p>Let’s take a closer look at one of the earlier screenshots, after we used the value of D0 (BoxFlag) to jump to the correct chunk of code for the Classic II:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="393" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35-300x148.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35-768x380.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>I thought about this some more, and eventually realized that something absolutely crazy happened here. We were supposed to be jumping into a table of BRA.S instructions, one for each possible BoxFlag value. That’s why we added D0 to itself before using it as a jump offset — each BRA.S instruction is two bytes long, so the index into the table needed to be doubled to turn it into a byte offset. Why didn’t we end up pointing at a BRA.S instruction? And where did this CAS.W instruction come from?</p>



<p>If you look closely at the table of branches below the JMP instruction at 0x40A43B6E, there are only 16 entries in the table, corresponding to BoxFlags 0 through 15. The Classic II is BoxFlag 17!</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-38.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="389" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-38.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-38.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-38-300x147.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-38-768x376.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>As I said earlier, the calculated offset we jump to is 0x40A43B94, which is not even supposed to be the start of an instruction. It’s smack dab in the middle of the MOVEA.L instruction at 0x40A43B92, which is the instruction that loads A1 with a real address that this code can use for enabling the sound interrupt.</p>



<p>When we jump to 0x40A43B94, we aren’t running intended code anymore. The CPU gets out of sync with the path that the code was designed to follow. 0x0CEC was supposed to be the second half of the MOVEA.L instruction — the address in RAM to load from — but instead, it is being treated as the start of a new instruction.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-13.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="796" height="101" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-13.png 796w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-13-300x38.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-13-768x97.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px"></a></figure>



<p>The CPU doesn’t get back in sync right away. We execute this mystery CAS (compare and swap) instruction, and then an unintended “MOVE.B D0, D4” instruction, before finally reaching a real MOVE.B instruction at 0x40A43B9C — the instruction that crashes. That is the point where the CPU has returned to running code that Apple actually wanted it to run. But unfortunately, A1 contains an invalid address because the code that was supposed to fill it out wasn’t reached, so of course everything crashes when we try to write to A1 + 0x1C00. It all makes sense.</p>



<p>Going back further, A1 gets loaded with the “junk” value of 0xFFFF8FBA as part of the initial jump to InstallSoundIntHandler. So, of course, it’s not really junk. It’s being used as an offset for a jump instruction:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-39.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="394" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-39.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-39.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-39-300x149.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-39-768x381.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>IDA’s disassembly is a little more readable. That value of 0xFFFF8FBA loaded into A1 represents how much you have to add to the program counter in order to reach <em>InstallSoundIntHandler</em> from where you currently are. Interpreting it as signed, it’s a negative number because that function is further back in the ROM code.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-17.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="761" height="59" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-17.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-17.png 761w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-17-300x23.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px"></a></figure>



<p>Overall, I felt that I totally understood what was happening. I’m probably repeating myself, but I just want it to sink in one more time: The problematic value in A1 gets loaded as part of a big relative jump to this section of ROM, and an out-of-bounds table access is jumping past code that is supposed to load A1 with an actual address of a peripheral to configure for sound interrupts. So A1 still contains that negative offset for the jump instead of a real address. Finally, it ends up being used as an address in a write operation, and boom, Sad Mac.</p>



<p>If you’ve followed along with me thus far, I’m sure there are some burning questions on your mind. This explains how MAME fails, but not why. Why was this happening? Also, why didn’t this same failure occur on actual hardware? Obviously, the Classic II wasn’t recalled because of an inability to use 32-bit addressing. There’s no way that happened. It would have been all over tech news. Not to mention the fact that the people actually working on the ROM code would have quickly noticed it while they were testing. It’s kind of a glaring issue.</p>



<p>So what gives? Was MAME doing something wrong here that didn’t match hardware? This code couldn’t have really been reached on hardware, right? I have the answer to these questions, but as a forewarning, the situation is way more complicated than I expected it to be.</p>



<p>I started out by trying to understand what the CAS instruction reached after the out-of-bounds jump was doing. Here are the bytes:</p>



<pre>0C EC 08 A9 00 04</pre>



<p>I quickly noticed that if I changed my disassembly in IDA so that it thought the code was supposed to start there, it refused to disassemble the instruction at all:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-18.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="585" height="106" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-18.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-18.png 585w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-18-300x54.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px"></a></figure>



<p>When I tried to convert it to code starting at 0x40A43B94, it said:</p>



<pre>Command "MakeCode" failed</pre>



<p>GNU objdump also failed to disassemble it, and then got right back in sync with the intended code:</p>



<pre>40a43b94:	0cec           	.short 0x0cec<br>40a43b96:	08a9 0004 1800 	bclr #4,%a1@(6144)<br>40a43b9c:	137c 0090 1c00 	moveb #-112,%a1@(7168)<br>40a43ba2:	4e75           	rts</pre>



<p>The fact that two well-known disassemblers balked at this instruction piqued my curiosity. I decided to use MacsBug on my Macintosh IIci, which also has a 68030 processor, to put all that code into RAM at a random location and see what MacsBug thought about it. Since I was going through all this effort, I also arranged all the other registers to be identical to what I was seeing on MAME. It wasn’t a perfect match with what I was seeing in MAME, though; I had to leave the program counter pointing into RAM instead of ROM.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugbefore3.jpg" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="306" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugbefore3.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugbefore3.jpg 800w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugbefore3-300x115.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugbefore3-768x294.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></figure>



<p>Interesting — MacsBug also said it was a CAS.W instruction, but it interpreted it slightly differently. It said it was CAS.W D1,D2,$0004(A4).</p>



<p>Of course, I couldn’t resist stepping through the code in MacsBug to see what it would do on a real 68030 processor:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugafter3.jpg" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="302" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugafter3.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugafter3.jpg 800w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugafter3-300x113.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugafter3-768x290.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></figure>



<p>Wait…what? If you compare the register display on the left side of the screen in the first picture with the same display in the second picture, something incredibly strange has happened. Even though MacsBug and MAME both don’t mention A1 in their interpretations of this CAS instruction at all, the value of A1 has changed! It started out as 0xFFFF8FBA, and ended up as 0xFC6B8. It seems to have turned into a value similar to what’s in A5 through A7 — a valid RAM address.</p>



<p>Further tinkering with MacsBug and different register values revealed that the new value of A1 depended on the original value of A1, A7, and the program counter. I couldn’t figure out exactly what it was doing, but it was definitely majorly changing A1’s value.</p>



<p>At this point, I felt like I was onto something. The MAME-emulated Classic II was crashing because A1 didn’t change, so it still contained an invalid address. On hardware, this weird instruction, which several disassemblers refused to touch, and wasn’t even intended to be jumped to because it starts in the middle of an actual valid instruction, was changing A1 to a new value that was a good address. Was this crazy instruction accidentally fixing A1 and thus hiding a bug from Apple’s ROM developers in the early 1990s?</p>



<p>This was about the time that Arbee suggested I <a href="https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/classic-ii-possible-rom-bug-weird-68030-instruction.49071/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start sharing my research on the 68kmla forums</a> and the <a href="https://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=124008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bannister.org forums</a> to see if some of the incredible folks who know way more than me about the 68k instruction set might be able to chime in. I also asked around on IRC in #mac68k on Libera.</p>



<p>The consensus was that this is not a valid CAS instruction, and that MacsBug’s interpretation of the registers being D1 and D2 is correct. Let’s look at what the <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/M68000PRM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Motorola M68000 Family Programmer’s Reference Manual</a> says about the encoding of the CAS instruction:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-20.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="672" height="652" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-20.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-20.png 672w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-20-300x291.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px"></a></figure>



<p>Comparing this with the 3 words of the instruction (0x0CEC 0x08A9 0x0004) and filling in the fields, we can see the following:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BadInstruction-1.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="651" height="105" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BadInstruction-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BadInstruction-1.png 651w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BadInstruction-1-300x48.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px"></a></figure>



<p>The first word appears to be a valid CAS instruction. The second word, though, has a few bits that are 1 even though the instruction format specifically says they are supposed to be 0. I’ve marked them in red. Also, the Du and Dc fields match what MacsBug says, as opposed to how MAME interpreted it.</p>



<p>The third word, 0x0004, is the d16 value mentioned in the MODE field. It’s the $0004 offset from A4. So according to Motorola’s reference manual, this instruction is:</p>





<p>…except it has three bits that are 1 in places where they are supposed to be 0. So it’s not a valid instruction at all. At least, it’s not documented.</p>



<p>Side note: I think MAME’s debugger is also decoding normal CAS instructions incorrectly; if I change it to 0x0CEC 0x0081 0x0004 instead, which is the correct way to write this instruction without the three bad “1” bits, it still thinks Du is D0 instead of D2. But that’s beside the point — the instruction we’re dealing with in this story is completely messed up either way.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAS (compare-and-swap) instruction is an interesting one</a>. It’s used for accomplishing various atomic operations without requiring a lock. It is one of the few instructions in the 68000 family CPUs that perform a read-modify-write bus cycle. What this particular instruction is supposed to do is compare the word value in memory at A4 + 4 to the value of D1. If they are the same, then the value in D2 is written to memory at A4 + 4. Otherwise, the value in memory at A4 + 4 is loaded into D1.</p>



<p>It clearly still does some of this stuff, like the read-modify-write cycle involving A4 + 4. If I change A4 to point to an invalid address, MacsBug complains to me. For example, on my Mac IIci with the same test setup I showed earlier, if I set A4 to 0xFFFF0000 and rerun the bad instruction, MacsBug tells me this:</p>



<pre>Bus Error at 0004CB20<br>while reading word (read-modify-write) from FFFF0004 in Supervisor data space</pre>



<p>This definitely means that this instruction still performs the RMW cycle at A4 + 4. It doesn’t seem to do exactly what the CAS instruction is supposed to do though. Obviously, the normal CAS instruction wouldn’t mess with the value of A1. I ran more tests after changing A4 to point to RAM. If I store the value 0xFFFF at A4 + 4, and D1 is set to 0x1111 and D2 is set to 0x2222, then after executing the instruction, memory at A4 + 4 changes to 0x2222. But that doesn’t really make any sense, because it only should have written 0x2222 to memory if D1 was equal to 0xFFFF.</p>



<p>Let’s summarize what we’ve learned so far.</p>



<ul>
<li>The invalid code that the ROM accidentally jumps to (0x0CEC 0x08A9 0x0004) is sort of like “CAS D1,D2,$0004(A4)”, but not really, because some of the bits that are supposed to be 0 are actually set to 1.</li>



<li>On another 68030-based Mac, I’ve observed that this instruction ends up modifying the value stored in register A1.</li>



<li>MAME’s 68030 CPU emulator does not change A1 like this, because the instruction is undocumented and normal code would never use it.</li>



<li>The Sad Mac in MAME occurs a couple of instructions later because A1 is set to an invalid address, and code in ROM tries to write a byte to A1 + 0x1C00.</li>
</ul>



<p>I was starting to believe something that sounded almost too crazy to be true: Apple had an out-of-bounds jump bug in the Classic II’s ROM that should have caused a Sad Mac during boot, but they had no idea the bug was there because the 68030 was accidentally fixing the value of A1 by executing an undocumented instruction. How could I prove that my theory was correct?</p>



<p>By buying a Classic II and hacking the ROM in order to see exactly what is happening on hardware, of course!</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ClassicII.jpg" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ClassicII-768x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ClassicII-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ClassicII-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ClassicII.jpg 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a></figure>



<p>This Classic II was manufactured in 1991, so it’s about 34 years old at this point. Computers this old usually need to be repaired if nobody has already fixed them. As I mentioned in a <a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2024/11/the-capacitor-that-apple-soldered-incorrectly-at-the-factory/" data-type="post" data-id="9225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous post about the LC III capacitor polarization mistake</a>, the surface mount capacitors in old Macs leak out corrosive goo over time. This machine was no exception. I didn’t even try powering it up. I immediately opened it up and removed what I believe was the original Sonnenschein 1/2 AA lithium battery with a March 1991 date code. The battery had not leaked at all, luckily! That’s another unfortunate thing that happens in a lot of old Macs that have been sitting around for decades — severe battery damage.</p>

<p>I don’t want to go into excruciating detail about the repair and make this post even longer to read, but if you’re interested in hearing more about that process, I <a href="https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/classic-ii-possible-rom-bug-weird-68030-instruction.49071/page-3#post-552591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a few updates about the repair in my 68kmla forum thread</a>. I did accidentally short /RESET to ground while soldering in new capacitors, but I eventually got the logic board working. This was very similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8KXPXT4E1U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what happened to Adrian’s Digital Basement on his SE/30 board</a> a few months ago, but lucky for me, my accidental short didn’t involve 12 volts and fry a bunch of chips! Adrian’s channel is an excellent resource for vintage computer enthusiasts out there, if you’re not already subscribed.</p>



<p>The Classic II has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cathode-ray tube</a> for its screen, which scares the crap out of me, so I opted to use a different solution in order to run the logic board by itself without any dangerous voltages. Plus, the analog boards in these computers are known to be a huge pain to repair. This one had really bad capacitor leakage, so that’ll probably be a future repair project. The bottom line is I knew I’d be installing and removing ROM chips a bunch, so I wanted to run the logic board out in the open, for reasons of both safety and convenience. Special thanks to 68kmla forum member davewongillies for <a href="https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/running-a-macse-30-without-an-analog-board.38857/#post-522389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posting his similar setup with a Classic II logic board</a>, complete with Amazon links for a bunch of the parts. That Mini-Fit Jr. pin extractor tool on Amazon is absolute garbage though — I could never get it to work. I ended up using staples instead.</p>

<p>I got impatient while waiting for my RGBtoHDMI to arrive for converting the Classic II’s video signal into HDMI, and eventually discovered <a href="https://github.com/guruthree/mac-se-video-converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another solution created by GitHub user guruthree</a> involving a Raspberry Pi Pico that converts the signal to VGA. I made a few cables, tweaked the code until the timings and colors were correct, and ended up with this concoction to adapt between a CGA DE-9 video connector and VGA:</p>

<p>Although I would never do anything like this in a real production environment where reliability matters, I didn’t even use level shifters for the 5V signals coming from the Mac. Technically, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/04/05/rp2040-and-5v-logic-best-friends-this-fx9000p-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the RP2040 is “sort of” 5V tolerant</a>, even though it’s not documented in the datasheet. That, combined with the fact that I had a few Picos laying around that I didn’t care about destroying, gave me enough confidence to try it out.</p>



<p>Here’s the whole mess, all wired up together, along with an ATX power supply. I also swapped the original ROM chips out with some programmable SST29EE010 EEPROMs I had on hand. Interestingly, the factory chips from Apple were actually UV-erasable EPROMs, so I could have even used the original chips if I had a UV chip eraser.</p>

<p>I successfully booted from a SCSI drive using this setup, and could capture the video signal with one of my many video capture devices:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/welcome.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="717" height="481" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/welcome.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/welcome.png 717w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/welcome-300x201.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px"></a></figure>



<p>By the way, I think there’s something wrong with at least one column of pixels on the left side. I think it has something to do with the tweak I made to the code running on the RP2040 in order to make it sync up correctly with the Classic II’s video signal. I’m sure I could fix it if I played around more. The RGBtoHDMI, which arrived a few days later, does not have this problem.</p>



<p>Anyway, I knew I was in business. I threw together some 68030 assembly code to display the value of A1 on the screen, found an unused place in the ROM to put it, and then came up with three custom ROMs to try on the Classic II:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Custom ROM 1: </strong>Replace the instruction at 0x40A43B9C that results in a Sad Mac (the MOVE.B instruction) with a jump to my special code that draws A1 to the screen, so we can see what A1 is on hardware at that point. Also, this would verify whether this code even runs at all on hardware.</li>



<li><strong>Custom ROM 2: </strong>Replace the instruction at 0x40A43B94 (the CAS instruction) with the same jump to my special code. This would verify whether the out-of-bounds jump was really happening, and what the value of A1 was leading up to it.</li>



<li><strong>Custom ROM 3:</strong> Replace the instruction at 0x40A43B94 (the CAS instruction) with NOPs. This would ideally replicate exactly what I was seeing in MAME, proving that the bad CAS instruction was vital to the Classic II’s ability to boot.</li>
</ul>



<p>Let’s look at the results one by one. Here’s the result that was displayed when I ran Custom ROM 1:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-21.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="509" height="341" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-21.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-21.png 509w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-21-300x201.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px"></a></figure>



<p>This verified that the section of code I was looking at definitely ran on hardware. It also showed that A1 was set to a very interesting value when it reached the instruction that crashed on MAME. 0x40A4BBB2 is not really an address you would write to because it’s a ROM address, but it doesn’t cause a bus error if you attempt it.</p>



<p>Here is what I got when I ran Custom ROM 2:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-22.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="509" height="341" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-22.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-22.png 509w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-22-300x201.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px"></a></figure>



<p>The same A1 value that we saw in MAME! This proved two things. One, the out-of-bounds table jump was definitely happening — if it wasn’t, my custom A1 drawing code wouldn’t have ran at all, since the JMP to it was stored out of sync of the normal intended code flow just like the accidental CAS instruction. Second, it also proved, along with the first test, that the CAS instruction was indeed fixing A1 on hardware, just like I theorized.</p>



<p>Lastly, my test run of Custom ROM 3, which eliminated the CAS instruction from the situation altogether, gave me the final proof I needed:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-23.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="509" height="341" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-23.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-23.png 509w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-23-300x201.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px"></a></figure>



<p>A Sad Mac, just like I saw with MAME in 32-bit mode. I also discovered during this test that on hardware, the same Sad Mac happens in 24-bit mode too. So MAME is actually more tolerant than hardware of that invalid write in 24-bit mode.</p>



<p>These results motivated me to make a couple more hacked ROM images to run on hardware in order to glean the values of all of the CPU’s data and address registers immediately before and after the CAS instruction. The data register values are shown in the left column, address registers in the right column. Before:</p>

<p>And after:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-42.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="509" height="341" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-42.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-42.png 509w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-42-300x201.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px"></a></figure>



<p>Yep! Everything is the same except for A1, which has magically been transformed from FFFF8FBA to 40A4BBB2. The mystery instruction is definitely what was responsible for that.</p>



<p>One fun part about this test was being able to successfully verify that everything on hardware was exactly identical to what MAME did up to the bad instruction. The entire register state shown in the “before” picture is a perfect match to what MAME shows when booting in 32-bit mode prior to the bad CAS instruction. See for yourself:</p>

<p>If your brain is fried after reading all this, first of all I don’t blame you at all, and second, let me bring everything together to explain what this all means:</p>



<p><strong>I’ve discovered an undocumented MC68030 instruction that performs a read-modify-write bus cycle and also changes the value of the A1 register.</strong></p>



<p>This newly-discovered instruction turns out to be the glue that’s accidentally holding the Classic II together. Without this instruction modifying A1, the Classic II can’t boot. I’m confident that it was a mistake and not something intentional. A totally understandable mistake, at that. If the pesky 68030 hadn’t been hiding the bug from Apple’s ROM developers, there is no doubt they would have caught it before the Classic II shipped. It’s not like they did all of their development work in 24-bit mode!</p>



<p>I searched deeper and found the same chunk of code in the newer Macintosh IIvx ROM, and in that ROM they finally increased the size of the jump table. I confirmed that the case for the Classic II in that code does nothing at all. It just jumps directly to an RTS instruction. I wonder if the Apple ROM developer working on that chunk of code in the IIvx ROM scratched their head in confusion when they added new entries for a bunch of new models, including the Classic II, after the Classic II ROM had already been finalized and shipped. Who knows? I’m not sure how Apple handled all the different ROM variants back then.</p>



<p>Because of this new discovery, I think it’s very likely that there is not a 100% perfect Motorola MC68030 emulator or replica in existence right now. This might be the only case in existence where it matters though. What this means is I could write a small chunk of code that determines whether it’s running on a physical 68030 or an emulator, by simply using that instruction and looking at the resulting value of A1.</p>



<p>What can MAME do in order to work around this problem and allow the Classic II to boot? We don’t really know the exact details of what this instruction does. With some limited testing, I believe I’ve observed that the resulting value of A1 depends on the original A1 value, the value of A7, and the program counter. But I’m not sure. Maybe someone can make a program that tries out a bunch of different register values and memory contents, and attempt to deduce what exactly the instruction does so that it can be emulated accurately. Until someone decides that it’s worth trying to figure out, <a href="https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commit/56af26b77aa5d564cefad4ae2f435ee155b1409d#diff-2ed507da8835078a892501397a58bcd18e52779493b97e3c2d550c52dedce3e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MAME is patching this bug out of the ROM</a> in order to allow the Classic II to boot. As <a href="https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/classic-ii-possible-rom-bug-weird-68030-instruction.49071/page-2#post-551578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arbee pointed out</a>, we’re a little late to get Motorola/Freescale/NXP to issue an errata. Unless someone who worked on the 68030 happens to see this post and might have a clue about what’s going on here…</p>



<p>Here’s a screenshot of MAME with Arbee’s patch applied, now able to successfully emulate a Classic II with 32-bit addressing enabled. Yay!</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-44.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="514" height="416" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-44.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-44.png 514w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-44-300x243.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px"></a></figure>



<p>After all that, what’s the lesson we can learn from this story? I guess it’s that emulators can teach us new things about hardware that we never would have thought to look into! I bet this bug in the ROM would have gone undiscovered for all eternity if not for MAME providing emulation of the Classic II, which isn’t a particularly notable machine compared to more popular compact Macs like the SE/30 and Color Classic.</p>



<p>It also goes to show you how bugs can be lurking in the background in places where you might think everything is totally polished. I think it’s also a good example of how some bugs just aren’t that big of a deal. This bug fits that category pretty well. The machine worked fine and nobody noticed.</p>



<p>Oh, and as for the original reason I somehow managed to pull myself into this investigation in the first place: the command+power key combination does not work in MAME. Now that I have a real Classic II, I have been able to confirm that the keystroke does indeed work on hardware. It only works with MacsBug installed, which is likely due to what I said earlier about the Egret disabling it by default. Either way, it really should work in MAME when MacsBug is installed. I suppose that’s another MAME fix for me to work on!</p>

Being a SOTA base model, open source, and an all-around strange LLM, it seemed like a perfect candidate for this.</p><p>This is a catalog of the glitch tokens I've found in DeepSeek after a day or so of experimentation, along with some preliminary observations about their behavior.</p><p><span>Note: </span><em>I’ll be using “DeepSeek” as a generic term for V3 and r1.</em></p><p>I searched for these tokens by first extracting the vocabulary from DeepSeek-V3's tokenizer, and then automatically testing every one of them for unusual behavior.</p><p><span>Note: </span><em>For our purposes, r1 is effectively a layer on top of V3, and all anomalous tokens carry over. The distillations, on the other hand, are much more fundamentally similar to the pre-trains they're based on, so they will not be discussed.</em></p><p>The most obvious thing differentiating DeepSeek’s tokenizer from other’s is a substantial fraction of the training data being Chinese. This makes things much more difficult to work with — tokenizations are learned at the byte level, but UTF-8 Chinese characters are usually several bytes long. They end up split at inconsistent positions, cutting characters in half, and making most of it impossible to decode. Because of this, about half the vocabulary looked like the following:</p><pre><code><code>ä¸į æĸ¹ä¾¿
ä½ł æ²¡æľī
à¦¨ à¦¿
äººåĳĺ åľ¨</code></code></pre><p>To get rid of these, I pretty aggressively filtered out nonstandard characters, cutting the vocabulary size down from 128000 to 70698. I'm sure there's a lot worth exploring going on in those tokens, but I pretty quickly decided that I’d rather not stare at Chinese and broken Unicode for hours on end.</p><p><span>Next, I ran every single one of these tokens through DeepSeek's chat API twice, and automatically saved all of them that behaved unexpectedly.

Glitch tokens can be identified by the model’s inability to perform this task:</p><pre><code><code>System: Repeat the requested string and nothing else.
User: Repeat the following: "{token}"</code></code></pre><pre><code><code>System: Say the requested string, exactly as it is written, and nothing else.
User: Say the following: "{token}"</code></code></pre><p>After that, I had to sift through the massive set of tokens which were repeated by the model as something non-trivially different.</p><p>I first manually filtered out uninteresting samples (V3 adding escape backslashes, extra or removed spaces, refusals on slurs, etc), and then clustered them into some rough groupings based on their initial appearance. From there, I started exploring them individually.</p><p><span>Note: </span><em>When trying any of these out, pay close attention to whitespace — </em><span>'XXXX'</span><em> and </em><span>' XXXX'</span><em><span> are different tokens.

This immediately caught my eye, and was the first token I examined a bit closer.</p><pre><code><code>Prompt: Say Nameeee (And variations of that prompt)
Images: ↑, ��, 🗣️, ⟩⟩, MR, 🖉, ►▼</code></code></pre><p>When given context clues, ' Nameeee' is more likely to be read as a word. Sometimes the substitute makes sense contextually, other times it seems extremely arbitrary:</p><pre><code><code>Prompt: Who is John Nameeee?
Images: John McCain, John MP3, John Wikisource, John the Baptist, John †, John ██████
</code></code></pre><pre><code><code>Prompt: What's Nameeee plus Nameeee?
Images: ¼ plus ¼, [Math Processing Error] plus [Math Processing Error], one plus one</code></code></pre><p>The API needs to be used to send ' Nameeee' on its own (due to the whitespace), but when alone, it's identified as short broken ASCII sequences like '{{', or seemingly random choices like 'Mughal'.</p><p>r1 occasionally reads ' Nameeee' as special tokens such as '&lt;｜end▁of▁thinking｜&gt;', which results in the COT breaking and r1 entering a confused state. We'll see this kind of thing happen often.</p><p>As for the origin of this token, I have no idea yet. Determining the causes behind these glitches is a much more involved endeavor, and identifying them is only the first step.</p><p>There's another token, 'EDMFunc', which tends to behave similarly to ' Nameeee', and shares some of the same weird images (like '►▼'). Otherwise, it has a preference for words starting with "H" and Japanese names.</p><p>Interestingly, ' FullEDMFunc' is a separate anomalous token. Usually, the image only replaces the 'EDMFunc' substring, leaving 'Full' intact:</p><pre><code><code>Prompt: Say FullEDMFunc (And variations of that prompt)
Images: FullMesh, FullMoon, FullDisclosure, Fully Mapped Function, Full Machine Translation</code></code></pre><p><span>the </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.metadata.edm.edmfunction?view=netframework-4.8.1" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">EdmFunction class</a><span> class in the .NET framework is the only plausible source I've found so far.</span></p><p>' everydaycalculation' usually has images in the vibe-cluster of math education utilities, such as 'percentcalc', 'FractionCal', 'youtube', or 'VisualFractions'.</p><p>' numbersaplenty' seems to be in a similar cluster as ' everydaycalculation', sharing common images such as 'VisualFractions' or 'Numbermatics'. Interestingly, r1 often associates it with thousand-related ideas, like "millennia".</p><p>'SetSavedPoint', while sometimes read correctly, most often has images that occur in context of Unity, like 'SetValue' or 'SerializeField'.</p><p>' CategoryTreeLabel' will often end up as 'Categorize', but other times as non-English words such as 'Kaagapay' (Filipino) and 'καταλογείς' (Greek).</p><p>A few tokens exist in something of a middle ground, not being entirely unspeakable, but otherwise still leading to strange behavior and confusion. ' MentionsView' sometimes ends up as syntactically similar words like 'Mendeley' or 'Viewfinder', sometimes itself, and sometimes nothing at all. r1 often changes its mind about what the token is, repeatedly contradicting itself. ' mediefiler' and 'HasColumnType' also fall into this class.</p><p>When r1 is prompted with most of the above tokens on their own, it breaks in one of two modes.</p><ol><li><p>It'll hallucinate a

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>
There are over a hundred HTML elements. This page uses all of them.
        You're looking at &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; right now.
</p> <hgroup> <h2>HTML loves text. We can get some huge text with &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;.</h2> <h2>Or smaller with &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</h2> <h3>And so on...</h3> <h4>And so on...</h4> <h5>And so on...</h5> <h6>
And... nope that's it for headings. These are all in an &lt;hgroup&gt;&lt;/hgroup&gt; by the way.
</h6> </hgroup> <pre>      Some text is &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;-formatted. Just a different look.
    </pre> <ul>
We can make a list with &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; <li>and</li> <li>some</li> <li>&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;s</li> </ul> <ol>
Or a numbered list with &lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; <li>and</li> <li>some</li> <li>&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;s</li> </ol> <dl>
Or even a description list with &lt;dl&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;.
<dt>It</dt> <dt>holds</dt> <dt>description terms, &lt;dt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;</dt> <dd> and description definitions, &lt;dd&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;. </dd> </dl> <menu> &lt;menu&gt;&lt;/menu&gt; is also a list. But it's the same as &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;.
</menu> <blockquote> &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; indents text. How credible!
</blockquote> <q>&lt;q&gt;&lt;/q&gt; is block's little brother.</q> <figure>
Here's a &lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;... It usually contains some other media
        (like an image).
<img src="https://iamwillwang.com/_astro/figure.o8SCE8C_.png" alt="figure" width="363.3333333333333" height="32.666666666666664"> <figcaption>
and this &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt; can then describe said media.
</figcaption> </figure>
And we can take a break with &lt;hr /&gt;. <hr>
We <strong>can</strong>
get a lot <em>fancier</em> with text <mark>of course</mark> with elements like
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;mark&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;.
<p> <b>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; bolds</b> </p> <p> <i>&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; italicizes</i> </p> <p> <u>&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt; underlines</u> </p> <p> <small>&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is small </small> </p> <p> &lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; <sub>subscripts</sub> </p> <p> &lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; <sup>superscripts</sup> </p> <p> <s>&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt; is for marking text as accurate</s>... err never mind
</p> <p> <ins>&lt;ins&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; marks text as inserted</ins> </p> <p> <del>&lt;del&gt;&lt;/del&gt; marks text as deleted</del> </p> <p> <bdi> &lt;bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt; is for isolating text that may flow in a different direction
          than surrounding text: ex. محمد.
</bdi> </p> <p> &lt;bdo&gt;&lt;/bdo&gt; <bdo dir="rtl">
is for overriding the direction of text: ex. محمد.
</bdo> </p> <p>   
Ah, now there's some breathing room, thanks to &lt;br /&gt;.
</p><p> <cite>You can &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; this website as Every HTML Element.</cite> <code>And this whole thing is &lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,</code>
living on the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>.
</p> <data value="123">Ignore &lt;data&gt;&lt;/data&gt;. That's more for the machines.</data> <time datetime="2025-01-23">&lt;time&gt;&lt;/time&gt; too. It's 10:35 PM right now.</time> <p>  
That sense of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> might all be in your head. Well, actually it's
      in &lt;kbd&gt;.
</p><p> <dfn>This</dfn> is defined. And <var>this</var> is a &lt;var&gt;&lt;/var&gt;iable.
</p> <p>
How bout some hidden gems?
<ruby>
漢 <rp>(</rp><rt>かん</rt><rp>)</rp> </ruby> </p> <samp>Here's a taste of a &lt;samp&gt;&lt;/samp&gt;</samp> <p> <span>&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; doesn't do much alone. But who can?</span> </p> <p>
Here's an opportunity for a break &lt;wbr/&gt;.
<wbr>
The browser will decide when to take it.
</p> <hr>
All this text... where does it live? Well we're inside the &lt;main&gt;&lt;/main&gt; &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
of an &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; document. There's a &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; here with us
      too. The
&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; thinks about things like &lt;link&gt;s to other things, &lt;meta&gt;data, our &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;, and our &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;.
<header> <p>
A &lt;header&gt;&lt;/header&gt; is different than the head. It's for content.
</p> </header>  <section> <article> <p>
By this point, I think it's clear that HTML elements run the gamut
            from content to container to logic to edge case. Some elements we
            can see, others not so much. Some elements are meant to combine with
            others. Some elements are only meant for your browser to read. Some
            elements had good intentions but never picked up mainstream use.
</p>  </article> <nav>
If you're getting a bit lost, &lt;nav&gt;&lt;/nav&gt; can help you
<a href="#">find</a> <a href="#">the</a> <a href="#">way</a> </nav> <address>
Or maybe an &lt;address&gt;&lt;/address&gt; would be better?
</address> <br>
That concludes this section.
</section> <hr> <p>HTML is more than text.</p> <map name="map"> <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,300,100" href="#first" alt="area"> <area shape="rect" coords="300,0,600,100" href="#second" alt="area"> </map> <img src="https://iamwillwang.com/_astro/map.ZvQu5ZE9.png" alt="figure" usemap="#map" width="600"> <div> <p>
Sometimes it's more fun to listen than read. This is the sound of the
          website being made.

That concludes our journey! I lied a bit at the beginning. There are
        more elements than this: experimental ones, deprecated ones, web
        components, hydrogen, oxygen, and so on. Regardless, I hope this text
        got you a little hyper because, mark my words, you're speaking a new
        language now.

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Emotional support networks among men shrink by 50% between the ages of 30 and 90, reflecting an average decrease from two to one emotional support providers, according to research published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/pag0000843"><em>Psychology &amp; Aging</em></a>.</p><p>Research consistently shows that social networks tend to <a href="https://www.psypost.org/loneliness-follows-a-u-shaped-path-across-adulthood-study-finds/">shrink with age</a>. Emotional support, defined as providing comfort and understanding, is essential for well-being, particularly in older adults, where it predicts <a href="https://www.psypost.org/loneliness-linked-to-cognitive-decline-in-older-adults-study-finds/">better cognitive health</a>, emotional stability, and life expectancy. Past studies demonstrate that general social network contraction occurs globally and across genders. However, whether the decline extends to the most intimate forms of support is debated.</p><p>Motivated by frameworks like socioemotional selectivity theory, which proposes that older adults strategically prioritize close relationships, and theories emphasizing emotional independence with age, Kate Petrova and colleagues aimed to clarify how emotional support networks evolve and identify early predictors of their size.</p><p>This study utilized a unique longitudinal dataset drawn from a sample of 235 men who were originally recruited as Harvard University students between 1939 and 1942. These participants were followed for 71 years, with data collected at regular intervals to assess changes in their emotional support networks. Emotional support was defined as the number of people participants turned to for comfort and counsel during challenging times. Data collection involved seven waves of emotional support assessments conducted between 1951 and 2010.</p><p>Participants were asked open-ended questions about their emotional support providers, such as “Who do you turn to for emotional support?” or “With whom do you usually talk over personal problems?” The total number of support providers was calculated based on participants’ responses. However, generalized responses, such as “family” or “friends,” as well as mentions of non-human sources like pets, were excluded from formal analyses.</p><p>The study also examined early-life predictors of network size. Archival data from participants’ intake interviews in the late 1930s and early 1940s provided information about childhood family environments, including parental warmth and socioeconomic status (SES). Parental warmth was measured using coders’ ratings of the participants’ relationships with their mother and father, as well as the overall emotional climate of their home. Childhood SES was assessed using parental education and income levels. Life transitions, such as marriage and retirement, were also considered in the analysis, with data collected about participants’ marital and employment statuses throughout the study.</p><p>This comprehensive, longitudinal approach allowed the researchers to examine how emotional support networks changed over time and the factors that influenced these changes.</p><p>Petrova and colleagues found that emotional support networks declined significantly across the adult lifespan, with participants’ reported number of emotional support providers decreasing by approximately 50% between the ages of 30 and 90. At age 30, participants reported relying on an average of two support providers, which decreased to just one by age 90. This linear decline suggests that aging is accompanied by a reduction in the number of people individuals regularly turn to for emotional support. Interestingly, this decline was consistent across participants, indicating that the trajectory of network shrinkage was a shared experience within this cohort.</p><p>Results also highlighted the impact of specific life transitions on emotional support networks. Participants’ networks were smaller during periods when they were married, suggesting a consolidation of emotional reliance on their spouse. However, retirement did not appear to influence the number of emotional support providers.</p><p>The study also revealed that early-life experiences played a critical role in shaping network size. Participants who grew up in warmer family environments—characterized by supportive and nurturing relationships with parents—had larger emotional support networks in adulthood. In contrast, childhood SES, as measured by parental income and education, did not predict later-life network size.</p><p>These results emphasize the enduring influence of early family dynamics on socioemotional development, even as other life transitions occur throughout adulthood.</p><p>This research was limited by its all-male, predominantly White sample and its reliance on self-reported data. Additionally, the quality of emotional support and its impacts on well-being were not assessed.</p><p>The study, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/pag0000843">Emotional support across adulthood: A 60-year study of men’s social networks</a>,” was authored by Kate Petrova, Michael D. Nevarez, Robert J. Waldinger, and Marc S. Schulz.</p></div></div>]]></description>

In short, it meant DOGE would get more access to sensitive data than an advisory committee would likely have, while offering less transparency.</p><p>The USDS was created by former president Barack Obama to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-trump-musk-us-digital-service-doge/">untangle dysfunctional or failing technology across the federal government</a> in the wake of the disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. The Service’s mandate allows it the wide-ranging ability to enter any government agency and access its software or technical systems with the goal of helping to streamline or reform existing systems.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Under the executive order, DOGE teams, which “will typically include one DOGE Team Lead, one engineer, one human resources specialist, and one attorney” will be dispatched to various agencies. They will be granted “access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems,” ostensibly with the goal of streamlining data sharing across federal agencies.</p><p>A former USDS employee who spoke to WIRED who was granted anonymity to preserve their privacy called the repurposing of the Digital Service an “A+ bureaucratic jiujitsu move.” But, they say, they’re concerned that DOGE’s access to sensitive information could be used to do more than just streamline government operations.</p><p>“Is this technical talent going to be pointed toward using data from the federal government to track down opponents?” they ask. “To track down particular populations of interest to this administration for the purposes of either targeting them or singling them out or whatever it might end up being?”</p><hr><p><strong>Got a Tip?</strong></p><p><em>Are you a current or former employee with the US Digital Services or another government agency impacted by DOGE?

If you were looking to identify functions to cut, people to cut, having an HR director there and having a lawyer say ‘here's what we're allowed to do or not do’ would be one way that you would facilitate that,” says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, noting that DOGE’s potential access to federal employee data could put “them in some sort of crosshairs to be fired.”</p><p>When Musk took over Twitter, he brought in outside help from his <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/technology/elon-musk-twitter-control.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/technology/elon-musk-twitter-control.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/technology/elon-musk-twitter-control.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">close circle as well as his other companies</a> to transform the company, a <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-government-trump.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-government-trump.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-government-trump.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">move he appears to be repeating</a>.</p><p>Who exactly is going to be part of DOGE is a particularly thorny issue, because there are technically two DOGEs. One is the permanent organization, the revamped USDS—now the US DOGE Service. The other is a temporary organization, with a termination date of July 4, 2026. Creating this organization means the temporary DOGE can operate under a special set of rules. It can sequester employees from other parts of the government and can accept people <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/3161">who want to work for the government as volunteers</a>. Temporary organizations can also hire what are known as special government employees—experts in a given field who can bypass the rigors of the regular federal hiring processes. They’re also not subject to the same transparency requirements as other government employees.</p><p>In the best-case scenario, this would allow DOGE to move quickly to address issues and fast-track necessary talent, as well as build systems that make government services more seamless by facilitating the flow of information and data. But in the worst case, this could mean less transparency around the interests of people working on important government projects, while enabling possible surveillance.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“I think part of the reason they're wanting to use special government employees is because so long as they all work less than 60 days, the financial reporting requirements are less, which is going to be attractive to billionaires who have a lot of financial things they don't want to disclose,” says Nick Bednar, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota School of Law. “And with agency approval, these individuals are allowed to continue contracting with the federal government if they represent, say, a corporation that has a lot of contracts with the government.”</p><p>Musk alone has over <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">received billions of dollars</a> via contracts with the federal government through his company SpaceX.</p><p>“To me, [the temporary organization] suggests there's some sort of, there's some reason for that which probably has to do with skirting disclosure and conflicts of interest requirements,” claims Moynihan.</p><p>Noah Kunin, former infrastructure director at the US General Services Administration, tells WIRED that “the government has access to incredible amounts of sensitive or proprietary business information that [businesses] had to share with the government in order to get a contract or take some action.” And while not everyone gets to access this—it generally requires some form of clearance, and government employees are not supposed to share it—this kind of information could be particularly useful to someone like Musk or other members of the business community who might be brought into DOGE.</p><p>“You always have concerns whenever you have private sector individuals entering government for a temporary position,” says Bednar. “This is how regulatory capture occurs.”</p><p>Even with all these special maneuvers, DOGE will likely still face hurdles. Sharing data across government departments and systems is tricky, particularly when different laws govern different agencies and the information they collect. Similarly, sensitive data often requires some form of government authorization, which DOGE volunteers and employees might not be able to get.</p><p>“There are legal restrictions to sharing data between organizations, and those agreements take an enormous amount of effort to put into place,” the former USDS employee says. “There are tons of examples of obstacles to information sharing like that. So maybe this is more aspirational than it is possible.”</p><p>“DOGE has just sort of added this element of unpredictability to what happens next in government,” says Moynihan. “It could be a bipartisan effort to make government technology work better. It could be an oligarch extracting resources from the government. We just really don't know. We're all gazing at tea leaves right now.”</p><p><em>Updated 1/24/2024, 12:26 pm EST: This story has been updated to reflect the reasons why a source was granted anonymity.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></description>
