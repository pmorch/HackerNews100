 <p>Here’s a <a href="https://twitter.com/finmoorhouse/status/1744059290120245347">puzzle</a>:</p>
<p>Imagine you begin a journey in Seattle WA, facing exactly due east. Then start traveling forward, in a straight line along the Earth’s surface.</p>
<p>You will travel across North America, and onto the Atlantic Ocean. Eventually, you will hit another country.</p>
<p>The question is: <em>what is the first country you hit?</em></p>
<p>The image below shows your starting direction. The rest of this post discusses the answer, so here’s your opportunity to make a guess of your own.</p>

<p>And here is the path you take (<a href="https://images.finmoorhouse.com/writing/go-east/mercator-path.png">high res version</a>)<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>:</p>

<p>Forget about the Earth for a second, and just imagine you’re standing on a big sphere.</p>
<p>Point in <em>any</em> direction, and begin walking forward along the surface of the sphere, without changing direction. This, I think, is the fairest interpretation of ‘straight line’.</p>
<p>Of course, you’ll loop round and return to where you started.</p>
<figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/s48nwx1oeU-800.avif 800w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/s48nwx1oeU-1600.avif 1600w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/s48nwx1oeU-2000.avif 2000w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/s48nwx1oeU-800.jpeg 800w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/s48nwx1oeU-1600.jpeg 1600w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/s48nwx1oeU-2000.jpeg 2000w" sizes="100vw"><img alt="The most obvious interpretation of 'straight line'" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/s48nwx1oeU-800.jpeg" width="2000" height="1734"></picture><figcaption>The most obvious interpretation of 'straight line'</figcaption></figure>
<p>Notice also, just intuitively, how you’ll have walked the full circumference of the sphere: a ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle">great circle</a>’.</p>
<p>In order to trace out a smaller circle than that, you’d need to be constantly veering left or right.</p>
<p>In the original puzzle, you might have been imagining traveling a line of constant latitude — that is, <em>always</em> heading east.</p>
<p>But that is <em>not</em> a great circle, and so not a straight line: you’d need to be constantly turning left to maintain that path. Travelling laterally means changing direction with respect to the Earth’s surface.</p>
<figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/5rb5Vvf6Nn-800.avif 800w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/5rb5Vvf6Nn-1600.avif 1600w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/5rb5Vvf6Nn-2000.avif 2000w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/5rb5Vvf6Nn-800.jpeg 800w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/5rb5Vvf6Nn-1600.jpeg 1600w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/5rb5Vvf6Nn-2000.jpeg 2000w" sizes="100vw"><img alt="A line of constant latitude" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/5rb5Vvf6Nn-800.jpeg" width="2000" height="1508"></picture><figcaption>A line of constant latitude</figcaption></figure>
<p>To give an extreme example: imagine driving in a 10 meter radius around the North Pole. In order to always be traveling east — maintaining the same latitude — you’d need to be steering left the whole time.</p>
<p>Here’s a better perspective: looking at Seattle centered on a globe, any straight line from Seattle will look like a straight line to you.</p>
<p>So with north pointing directly up, the path you take is a straight line directly to the right.</p>

<p>Being a great circle, exactly half of the path you travel is in the Northern Hemisphere, and half in the Southern Hemisphere. It swoops under Africa to arrive at Australia somewhere near Perth<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>One way to see this would be to pin a string to Seattle on a globe, and stretch it taut over the globe. Every path from Seattle to wherever you stretch the string is a geodesic; being the shortest line on the surface of the globe to that point. Now stretch the string so that it emerges from Seattle going east: you’ll see it avoids land until Australia.</p>
<p>Of course, part of the trickiness here is that straight lines on the Earth are not straight lines on most 2D projections of the Earth (maps), and vice-versa.</p>
<p>That’s why the shortest flight path between two cities often looks unnecessarily curved on a map, such as the map you see on an airplane.</p>

<p>But there are some exceptions. Any straight line on a ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomonic_projection">gnomonic projection</a>’ (pictured) is an arc of a great circle (straight line) on a sphere. <a href="https://images.finmoorhouse.com/writing/go-east/gnomonic.png">Here’s a link</a> to a full-res version of the image below.</p>

<p>But how natural to think a straight line on a more familiar map is a straight line on the surface of the Earth! And so, how natural to answer “France” over “Australia”.</p>
<p>I love this puzzle. Great puzzles are crafted to evoke a flash of insight, after which the answer is both clear and surprising compared to the intuitive answer. This one fits the bill. Poor puzzles feel arbitrary or like cheap tricks; they are to good puzzles as Christmas cracker puns are to good jokes.</p>
<p>I first saw it on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marcbreathes?lang=en">Marc Ordower’s excellent TikTok page</a>, of all places. Check it out.</p>
<h3 id="appendix%3A-geodesics" tabindex="-1"><a href="#appendix%3A-geodesics">Appendix: geodesics</a></h3>
<p>To be pedantic, by ‘straight line’ here I really mean ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic">geodesic</a>’ — the generalisation of ‘straight line’ for curved surfaces and space as well as ‘flat’, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space">Euclidian</a> spaces.</p>
<p>A geodesic is just the shortest path between two points in a surface. If you’re placed on a surface and continually walk “forward”, by definition <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic#/media/File:Insect_on_a_torus_tracing_out_a_non-trivial_geodesic.gif">you will trace out a geodesic</a>.</p>
<p>Some people replying to my <a href="https://twitter.com/finmoorhouse/status/1744059290120245347">original tweet</a> pointed out that a straight line from the original point and direction would take you into space. This is true if we’re talking about a straight line in <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">E</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{E}^3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (3D Euclidian space). But in the original question, I say “start traveling forward, in a straight line <strong>along the Earth’s surface</strong>”. So I think it’s clear we’re talking about a straight line along a <em>surface</em>, which is not the same as 3D space. We’re talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesics_on_an_ellipsoid">geodesics on a sphere</a>.</p>
<p>But I admit that “straight line” is not exactly well-defined on curved surfaces. I’m saying “geodesic = straight line”, but someone pointed out to me a different interpretation: “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry)">straight line</a>” <em>is</em> well-defined for Euclidian spaces, including the Euclidian plane (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">E</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{E}^2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>). So we can say a geodesic (or any other path) is straight <em>just</em> when the <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/294650/when-are-geodesics-straight-lines">associated projective connection is flat</a>, in our case when the projection of the line on the globe onto <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">E</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{E}^2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> — that is, a 2D map — is straight. And that would mean that whether a path across Earth counts as ‘straight’ depends on the projection, and on popular projections (such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Mercator projection</a>), lateral paths <em>would</em> count, despite being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darboux_frame#Geodesic_curvature,_normal_curvature,_and_relative_torsion">intrinsically curved</a>.</p>
<p>So maybe half a point for “France” if that’s what went through your head. Still I think “just go straight forward and don’t change direction” is the more natural reading.</p>

<li id="fn2"><p>Does it matter that the Earth is not a perfect sphere? It does not.

And we're looking for talented and interested engineers to join us.</p><p>Prospective is a professional toolchain for analyzing and visualizing data on your local machine. It's a graphical tool that runs in a web browser and is able to slice and dice gigabytes of static or realtime data. It's built on the popular OSS framework Perspective <a href="https://github.com/finos/perspective">https://github.com/finos/perspective</a> . Prospective runs as WebAssembly in modern browsers, so it's fast, portable, and memory-efficient. It has its own in-memory data store, but can also plug into any database or streaming platform with a straightforward adapter API. Prospective integrates with existing data tools like Python and Jupyter, and all the dashboards created can be shared to ease collaboration. Our goal is to expand beyond financial services and become the standard toolchain for anyone whose job is to make sense and find patterns in large datasets.</p><p>Prospective offers a great opportunity to dig into complex software. On any given day we might be optimizing how the database executes queries in C++, implementing API features in Rust, writing new language bindings for our API, speeding up our Bazel build process, or implementing new charting or query features in our graphical UI. Prospective is engineered to be fast and stable. We write good tests, and once a bug is fixed it stays fixed.</p><p>Our team has a culture of mentorship and collaboration, and we work with each other knowing that every team member is always either teaching or learning. We pair-program regularly as a way to share our thinking and get feedback on our solutions. We hold each other to a high quality bar for performance and aesthetics, a constraint that we think creates a healthy environment for creative problem-solving.
Every day has a brief "stand up" in the morning and a "stand down" in the afternoon to share what we've learned and what we're stuck on. Every Friday afternoon we demo what we're building for each other, which we call "dogfooding". And we talk regularly to our users, both paid and open-source, to create product feedback loops to understand where the rough edges are and what folks find extremely valuable.</p><p>We'd love to chat with you if you have experience in WebAssembly, Python native extensions, C++, Rust or Jupyter.
But regardless of your experience, we're very intentionally looking for people who are interested, motivated, and passionate about deeply learning WebAssembly and pushing the boundaries of what a browser can do. We believe smart, passionate people will channel that energy into learning how the tech stack works; and we believe that aligning people's work with their interests correlates with long term business success.
We're currently looking for two additional engineers to join our five-person team. We're open to more-junior and more-senior engineers, and are committed to making a competitive offer based on experience and skill level.</p><p>Contact andrew@prospective.dev</p></div></td></tr>

With Covid I've come to realize I need to work in public more often.</p><p>So an ideal fit would be a small/medium company with hair on fire problems that need solving that I can talk about publicly.
What sort of problems do I like?</p><p>I worked with a Stuttgart based auto manufacturer to identify and predict when a part they had would fail. It turns out the answer will be familiar to west coast Canadians - The leaky condo crisis.</p><p>I worked with a well known cloud vendor to predict server failiures. Built a few test approaches (DL, anomoly detection, clustering, etc) and went with a simple efficient one that worked well. They got several minutes warning to load shift before a server failed.</p><p>A Taxi company in latam hired me to built a fleet maintenance system. It predicted and scheduled preventative maintenance to reduce wear and tear and avoid breakdowns. We also identified the leading cause of wear - leadfoot drivers. So we built a system that would identify aggressive driving.</p><p>Another example was a speculative sports highlights annotation system I built with a consultancy. It ingested sports video and identified predetermined highlights in baseball - diving catches in our case.</p><p>Who shouldn't contact me.</p><p>If your market is Ads or gambling I'm not interested. Sure there's lot of money, but I'd rather sleep at night. Thanks.</p><p>What I'm working on right now:</p><p>ML for metabolic flux anaylsis - Predicting how metabolic networks consume and produce metabolites. Particulalry useful for potentially starving cancers.</p><p>Low compute AI and connecting them to interpretable and defensible knowledge bases. I think these huge models that cost millions to train are the wrong path. I'll show things in public in time.</p></div></td></tr>

SWE interested in all things distributed. I was most recently a Senior SRE at a cybersecurity startup in the US. 
I work at the intersection of Operations, R&amp;D, and SWE so my work involves everything from arm-twisting [major cloud provider] into launching new (previously unavailable) Redis instances overnight to debugging unknown edge cases in production code. Working at a startup I’ve learnt to move fast while NOT breaking things(and quickly fixing things I do end up breaking!), and have worn various hats such as Cloud Security Engineer, SWE, SRE etc as the business evolved. I handled customers directly and owned parts of engineering and infrastructure. Experienced in backend, infrastructure engineering and cloud operations. 
I'm actively looking for my next adventure(mid to senior engineering roles), if this sounds like a good fit please don't hesitate to reach out!</p></div></td></tr>

The last 10 months or so I've worked as an Engineering Manager for a Solutions Engineering team working with a full stack of ad-analysis tools, client notification systems and process automation. Previous to managing the team I was a Solutions Engineer II for about a year. We work in the advertising technology space, primarily with Prebid and a popular browser extension for analysing advertising setups. I'm also involved in product design and development. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Corporate Finance and spent several years of in the construction industry before diving into programming, which had previously just been a hobby. I am also the creator of FinMesh, a financial data API wrapper for Python. Eager to learn and hungry to grow in the depth and breadth of my skills I'm looking for junior software developer positions. Something in fintech, constructions technology or advertising fits my background well but I'm open to all opportunities.</p></div></td></tr>

I am a full stack developer with preference for backend work nearing a decade of professional experience. I've built many greenfield projects and maintained legacy systems. Very comfortable up and down the stack. I've built myself GIS applications, video transcoding pipelines, automated linear TV channels, video streaming applications, license plate readers, offline-first web applications, web scrapers, a Foursquare-like and Netflix-like applications and more. I've personally built toys with computer vision, ML and AI tools as well but I am interested in more work one day around drones and GIS but I'm open for any challenge.</p><p>Because I had to explain to others recently, I am a US citizen, my past work took me to the south Pacific and then covid and my wife's visa processing took years so I just returned to the States.

I am an experienced engineering leader, product creator, and full stack engineer.  I have over a decade of broad experience with technologies, industries, and scales of operation, having founded multiple startups in the AI and Ad-Tech industries (including Augur which went through Techstars Boulder 2013 and was later acquired), worked at enterprises as notable as Microsoft and Salesforce, won over 15 hackathons, and regularly built new products for fun or freelance.  My engineering often involves machine learning, web scraping, and integrating many disparate systems.  Some of my more interesting personal projects include the OpenAI GPT3 .Net SDK, the AllThePeople.net social media data mining system, and a teleprompter for Google Glass.  Additionally, I am experienced at presenting at conferences and managing events in both professional and entertainment contexts.  I am based in San Francisco but value location flexibility.</p><p>A few years ago I took a break from the tech industry to start a 450-seat San Francisco live performance venue in the midst of a pandemic, which is now a thriving local business hosting sold-out events most days of the week.  Over the past year or so I've founded a couple AI startups (<a href="https://doppler.bot/" rel="nofollow">https://doppler.bot</a> and <a href="https://mindprint.ai/" rel="nofollow">https://mindprint.ai</a>) and numerous other projects (from domain name brainstorming to a productivity tool functionally identical to MS's recently announced recall feature), some of which are built on top of OpenAI and some of which are based on open source models.  At this point it's becoming clear the recent startups I founded are probably not going mainstream, so I'm exploring what might be next for me career-wise.</p><p>I would love for my next role to utilize my top-tier engineering skills, my customer-focused product expertise, and my experience managing and growing an organization.  I am open to technical co-founder roles, CTO positions, as well as entrepreneur-in-residence or new product-building opportunities within organizations of all sizes.</p><p>More info about me and my projects here: <a href="https://rogerpincombe.com/" rel="nofollow">https://rogerpincombe.com</a></p></div></td></tr>

I've also started a few projects of my own, three of which have been acquired. I'm looking to join a growing team Series A or larger. In person in NYC or remote. I'm a low-ego builder, always eager to learn something new, and figure out the best way to build great products.</p></div></td></tr>

I'm a senior full-stack developer with an aspiration for team/product lead or CTO-like position. For ~7 years I was co-founder and CTO of an ed-tech company called: amy.app . My co-founder and I scaled the company to about 25 employees. Before that I gained a PhD in Human Robot Interaction in NZ. Currently I'm exploring how LLMs, in particular vision, can be used to automate back office jobs. I'm very product/customer focused and pragmatic. I like to move super fast.
My dream environment is an early-stage/full-remote startup.</p><p>PS: I have a family, that means the main compensation via shares isn't an option for me. PPS: to demonstrate my speed: Here is an LLM project I fully(!) developed within 48h. It even got some traction on HN: <a href="https://www.line-items.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.line-items.com/</a></p></div></td></tr>

I've worked in multiple startups, but I currently work at Walmart Global Tech. I went through the HAX hardware accelerator in 2017, which fueled my passion for hardware communication with iOS. I love going to trade shows and standing at booths talking about my product. I have a knack for giving presentations to investors and general demoing. I also have a lot of knowledge with hardware manufacturing in Shenzhen (QA, sourcing, etc).</p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>I’ll get to the good and bad news of the week, but first I want to note the big story - Donald Trump’s conviction by a jury in New York - and a little story with big implications - the Federal Bureau of Investigation raiding a corporate landlord in cahoots with a nation-wide rent-fixing cartel that affects up to 16 million apartments.</p><p>Ok, so the big political economy news of the week was obviously Donald Trump’s conviction on the charge of falsifying business records, even as he is on track to become the Republican Presidential nominee. I don’t have anything to add here that you can’t access in any ordinary political trade magazine or news program, but it’s important to flag it since the election will have significant consequences on market power questions. In the round-up below, you’ll notice increase news about what Trump is saying he’ll do on monopoly issues.</p><p><span>In a far less-noticed law enforcement action, the FBI this week conducted a dawn raid of corporate landlord giant Cortland Management over what’s called algorithmic price-fixing. This corporate real estate management firm, based in Atlanta, rents out 85,000 units across thirteen states. But Cortland is allegedly part of a much bigger conspiracy orchestrated by a software and consulting firm named RealPage to increase rents nationwide by coordinating landlord pricing decisions and holding apartments off the market. How much bigger? Well, there’s a </span><a href="https://6398037.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6398037/0001%20-%202023-01-23%20Complaint.pdf" rel="">civil antitrust action</a><span> in Tennessee that’s been going on since 2023, where the argument is that RealPage has been working with at least 21 large landlords and institutional investors, encompassing 70% of multi-family apartment buildings and 16 million units nationwide, to systematically push up rents. And RealPage isn’t just some software company distorting rental markets, it’s also owned by Thoma Bravo, one of the biggest private equity firms in the U.S. So yeah, this scandal matters. (RealPage is also </span><a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/meet-realpages-revolving-door-lobbyists/" rel="">lobbying</a><span> up, which politically connected firms do…)</span></p><p>How does the cartel allegedly work? Well large corporate landlords, who would normally compete with one another for tenants via price or quality, have since 2016 stopped doing so. Instead, they all share “detailed real-time data regarding pricing, inventory, occupancy rates, and unit types that are or will be coming available to rent” every day with one another through RealPage’s revenue management system, which in turn sends back recommendations on pricing.</p><p>Landlords adopt RealPage recommendations on pricing 80-90% of the time, which explicitly drives up revenue by holding apartments off the market. As the architect of RealPage once explained, “[i]f you have idiots undervaluing, it costs the whole system.” It’s not just an information-sharing and price recommendation engine. RealPage has ‘pricing advisors’ that monitor landlords and encourage them to accept suggested pricing, it works to get employees at landlord companies fired who try to move rents lower, and it even threatens to drop clients who don’t accept its high price recommendations. This one’s a very clear conspiracy. Allegedly.</p><p><span>Cortland is located in Atlanta, where 81% of multifamily rental unit prices are </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.tnmd.94141/gov.uscourts.tnmd.94141.291.0.pdf" rel="">set</a><span> via software. And rent in that city has exploded, up 80% since 2016. What’s odd about this price increase is that vacancy rates have been inching up, and when there’s more supply, prices should come down. But they aren’t. What seems to have happened in the period between 2015-2017 is that a bunch of landlords started using RealPage pricing recommendations. Then in 2017, RealPage </span><a href="https://www.realpage.com/news/realpage-to-acquire-lease-rent-options/" rel="">bought</a><span> its main rival, Lease Rent Option, giving it perfect information into the supply and demand for apartment rentals. Here’s a map of Atlanta properties using RealPage’s software. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facf1562e-b420-47ac-b2cb-b91f80ade509_680x618.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facf1562e-b420-47ac-b2cb-b91f80ade509_680x618.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facf1562e-b420-47ac-b2cb-b91f80ade509_680x618.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facf1562e-b420-47ac-b2cb-b91f80ade509_680x618.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facf1562e-b420-47ac-b2cb-b91f80ade509_680x618.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facf1562e-b420-47ac-b2cb-b91f80ade509_680x618.jpeg" width="680" height="618" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/acf1562e-b420-47ac-b2cb-b91f80ade509_680x618.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:618,&quot;width&quot;:680,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facf1562e-b420-47ac-b2cb-b91f80ade509_680x618.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facf1562e-b420-47ac-b2cb-b91f80ade509_680x618.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facf1562e-b420-47ac-b2cb-b91f80ade509_680x618.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facf1562e-b420-47ac-b2cb-b91f80ade509_680x618.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The Department of Justice is clearly deep in an investigation of RealPage and its cartel. And this one looks criminal. It’s also fascinating that the FBI is involved.

								<p><em>TL;DR: The DuckDB team is <i>very happy</i> to announce that today we’re releasing DuckDB version 1.0.0, codename “Snow Duck” (anas nivis).</em></p>
							
							<p>To install the new version, please visit the <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/installation">installation guide</a>.
For the release notes, see the <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/tag/v1.0.0">release page</a>.</p>

<p>It has been almost six years since the first source code was written for the project back in 2018, and a <em>lot</em> has happened since: There are now over 300&nbsp;000 lines of C++ engine code, over 42&nbsp;000 commits and almost 4&nbsp;000 issues were opened and closed again. DuckDB has also gained significant popularity: the project has attracted tens of thousands of stars and followers on GitHub and social media platforms. Download counts are in the millions each month, and download traffic just for extensions is upwards of four terabytes <em>each day</em>. There are even <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/duckdb-in-action">books</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-DuckDB-practical-efficiently/dp/1803241004">being</a> <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/duckdb-up-and/9781098159689/">written</a> about DuckDB, and – most importantly – now even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDB">Wikipedia considers DuckDB notable</a>, albeit barely.</p>

<p>Of course, version numbers are somewhat arbitrary and “feely”, despite <a href="https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html">attempts</a> at making them more mechanical. We could have released DuckDB 1.0.0 back in 2018, or we could have waited ten more years. There is never a great moment, because software (with the exception of <a href="https://x.com/fermatslibrary/status/1740324503308169507">TeX</a>) is never “done”. Why choose today?</p>

<p>Data management systems – even purely analytical ones – are such core components of any application that there is always an implicit contract of trust between their developers and users. Users rely on databases to provide correct query results and to not lose their data. At the same time, system developers need to be aware of their responsibility of not breaking people’s applications willy-nilly. Intuitively, version 1.0.0 means something else for a data management system than it means for an egg timer app (no offense). From the very beginning, we were committed to making DuckDB a reliable base for people to build their applications on. This is also why the 1.0.0 release is named after the non-existent <em>snow duck (anas nivis),</em> harking back to Apple’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6/">Snow Leopard</a> release some years ago.</p>

<p>For us, one of the major blockers to releasing 1.0.0 was the storage format. DuckDB has its own custom-built data storage format. This format allows users to manage many (possibly very large) tables in a single file with full transactional semantics and state-of-the-art compression. Of course, designing a new file format is not without its challenges, and we had to make significant changes to the format over time. This led to the suboptimal situation that whenever a new DuckDB version was released, the files created with the old version did not work with the new DuckDB version and had to be manually upgraded. This problem was addressed in v0.10.0 back in February – where we introduced <a href="https://duckdb.org/2024/02/13/announcing-duckdb-0100#backward-compatibility">backward compatibility and limited forward compatibility for DuckDB’s storage format</a>. This feature has now been used in the wild for a while without serious issues – providing us with the confidence to offer a guarantee that DuckDB files created with DuckDB 1.0.0 will be compatible with future DuckDB versions.</p>
      <h2 id="stability">
        
        <a href="#stability">Stability</a>
        
      </h2>
    

<p>The core theme of the 1.0.0 release is stability. This contrasts it with previous releases where we have had blog posts talk about long lists of new features. Instead, the 1.0.0 release has very limited new features (a <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11677">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11918">might</a> <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11831">have</a> <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11835">snuck</a> in). Instead, our focus has been on stability.</p>

<p>We’ve observed the frankly staggering growth in the amount and breadth of use of DuckDB in the wild, and have not seen an increase in serious issues being reported. Meanwhile, there are thousands of test cases with millions of test queries being run every night. We run loads of microbenchmarks and standardized benchmark suites to spot performance regressions. DuckDB is constantly being tortured by various fuzzers that construct all manners of wild SQL queries to make sure we don’t miss weird corner cases. All told, this has built the necessary confidence in us to release a 1.0.0.</p>

<p>Another core aspect of stability with the 1.0.0 release is stability across versions. While <a href="https://xkcd.com/1172/">never breaking anyone’s workflow is likely impossible</a>, we plan to be much more careful with user-facing changes going forward. In particular, we plan to focus on providing stability for the SQL dialect, as well as the C API. While we do not guarantee that we will never change semantics in these layers in the future – we will try to provide ample warning when doing so, as well as providing workarounds that allow previously working code to keep on working.</p>
      <h2 id="looking-ahead">
        
        <a href="#looking-ahead">Looking ahead</a>
        
      </h2>
    

<p>Unlike many open-source projects, DuckDB also has a healthy long-term funding strategy. <a href="https://duckdblabs.com/">DuckDB Labs</a>, the company that employs DuckDB’s core contributors, has not had any outside investments, and as a result, the company is fully owned by the team. Labs’ business model is to provide consulting and support services for DuckDB, and we’re happy to report that this is going well. With the revenue from contracts, we fund long-term and strategic DuckDB development with a team of almost 20 people. At the same time, the intellectual property in the project is guarded by the independent <a href="https://duckdb.org/foundation/">DuckDB Foundation</a>. This non-profit foundation ensures that DuckDB will be around long-term under the MIT license.</p>

<p>Regarding long-term plans, there are, of course, many things on the roadmap still. One thing we’re very excited about is the ability to expand the extension environment around DuckDB. Extensions are plug-ins that can add new SQL-level functions, file formats, optimizers, etc. while keeping the DuckDB core mean and lean. There are already an impressive number of third-party extensions to DuckDB, and we’re working hard to streamline the process of building and distributing community-contributed extensions. We think DuckDB can become the basis for the next revolution in data through community extensions connected by a high-performance data fabric accessible through a unified SQL interface.</p>

<p>Of course, there will be issues found in today’s release. But rest assured, there will be a 1.0.1 release. There will be a 1.1.0. And there might also be a 2.0.0 at some point. We’re in this for the long run, all of us, together. We have the team and the structures and resources to do so.</p>

<p>First of all, we are very, very grateful to you all. Our massive and heartfelt thanks go to everyone who has contributed code, filed issues or engaged in discussions, promoted DuckDB in their environment, and, of course, all DuckDB users. We could not have done it without you!</p>

<p>We would also like to thank the <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/en/groups/database-architectures/">CWI Database Architectures group</a> for providing us with the environment and expertise to build DuckDB, the organizations that provided us with research grants early on, the excellent <a href="https://duckdblabs.com/#collaborators">customers of DuckDB Labs</a> that make it all work (especially the early ones), and the generous donors to the <a href="https://duckdb.org/foundation/">DuckDB Foundation</a>. We are particularly grateful to our long-standing Gold sponsors <a href="https://motherduck.com/">MotherDuck</a>, <a href="https://voltrondata.com/">Voltron Data</a> and <a href="https://posit.co/">Posit</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we would like to thank the <a href="https://duckdblabs.com/#about">excellent and amazing team at DuckDB Labs</a>.</p>

<p>So join us now in being nostalgic, teary-eyed and excited for what’s to come for DuckDB and celebrate the release of DuckDB 1.0.0 with us. We certainly will.</p>

<p>Mark and Hannes</p>

<p>PS: We are holding our next community event, <a href="https://duckdb.org/2024/08/15/duckcon5">DuckCon #5</a>, in Seattle on August 15, only a few short weeks from today. Attendance is free. Hope to see you there!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>For an exact calculation we need to address a few choices: (you can change them, the answer will not be tremendously affected)</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the receiver? Let's assume a 70 m dish, like this one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_Deep_Space_Communication_Complex#/media/File:DSS43.jpg" rel="noreferrer">[CDSCC]</a> in the Deep Space Network.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1" rel="noreferrer">[Voyager 1]</a> can transmit at <span>$2.3 {\rm GHz}$</span> or <span>$8.4 {\rm GHz}$</span>. Let's assume <span>$8.4 {\rm GHz}$</span>, for better beam forming (but probably it can only use the lowest frequency at the highest power, so this could be too optimistic).</li>
<li>Does "received" mean all photons hitting the antenna dish, or only those entering the electronic circuit of the first LNA? A similar question can be asked for the transmitter in the space craft. We'll ignore this here since losses related to illuminators or Cassegrain construction will not even be one order of magnitude, insignificant compared with the rest.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answers:</strong><br>
<strong>A)</strong> Voyager sends <span>$160$</span> bits/second with <span>$23{\rm W}$</span>. Using <span>$8.3 {\rm GHz}$</span> this is <span>$4 \cdot 10^{24}$</span> photons per second, or <span>$2.6 \cdot 10^{22}$</span> per bit, because for frequency <span>$f$</span> the energy per photon is only
<span>$$E_\phi=\hbar\, \omega=2\pi\hbar f=5.5\cdot10^{-24}{\rm J} \ \ 
\text{or} \ \ 5.5 \ \text{yJ (yoctojoule)}.$$</span></p>
<p><strong>B)</strong> The beam forming by Voyager's <span>$d=3.7{\rm m}$</span>  dish will direct them predominantly to Earth, with <span>$(\pi d/\lambda)^2$</span> antenna gain, but still, at the current  distance of <span>$R=23.5$</span> billion kilometers, this only results in <span>$3.4\cdot10^{-22}$</span>  Watt per square meter reaching Earth, so a receiver with a <span>$D=70{\rm m}$</span> dish will collect only <span>$1.3$</span> attowatt (<span>$1.3\cdot 10^{-18}{\rm W}$</span>), summarized by:
<span>$$
  P_{\rm received} = P_{\rm transmit}\ \Big(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda}\Big)^2 \ \frac1{4\pi R^2}\ \frac{\pi D^2}4
$$</span>
Dividing by <span>$E_\phi$</span> we see that this power then still corresponds to c. <span>$240000$</span> photons per second, or <span>$1500$</span> photons per bit. If we assume <span>$f=2.3{\rm GHz}$</span> this becomes <span>$415$</span> photons per bit. And if we introduce some realistic losses here and there perhaps only half of that.</p>
<p><strong>C)</strong> (Although not asked in the question) how many photons per bit are needed? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem#Statement_of_the_theorem" rel="noreferrer">[Shannon limit]</a> <span>$ C=B \, \log_2(1+{\large\frac{S}{N}})$</span>, relates bandwidth <span>$B$</span>, and <span>$S/N$</span> ratio to maximum channel capacity. It follows that with only thermal noise <span>$N=k\, T_{\rm noise}\,B$</span>, the required energy per bit is:
<span>$$ E_{\rm bit} = \frac S C = k\, T_{\rm noise} \ \frac{2^{\,C/B}-1}{C/B}
\ \Rightarrow \  \lim_{C\ll B}\ E_{\rm bit} = k\, T_{\rm noise} \log 2, 
$$</span>
where <span>$C\ll B$</span> is the so-called "ultimate" Shannon limit. With only the CMB <span>$(T_{\rm noise}\!=\!3{\rm K})$</span> we would then need <span>$41 {\rm yJ}$</span>, or <span>$41 \cdot 10^{-24}\,{\rm J}$</span>, per bit.
That's only <span>$7.5$</span> photons at <span>$8.3 {\rm GHz}$</span>. But additional atmospheric noise and circuit noise, even with a good cryogenic receiver, could easily raise <span>$T_{\rm noise}$</span> to about <span>$10{\rm K}$</span> and then we need <span>$25$</span> photons per bit at <span>$8.3 {\rm GHz}$</span>, and even <span>$91$</span> at <span>$2.3 {\rm GHz}$</span>. So clearly there is not much margin.</p>

            <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 09:42:36 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/27/why-rubys-timeout-is-dangerous-and-thread-dot-raise-is-terrifying/">https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/27/why-rubys-timeout-is-dangerous-and-thread-dot-raise-is-terrifying/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40560913">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>This is already documented in <a href="http://www.mikeperham.com/2015/05/08/timeout-rubys-most-dangerous-api/">Timeout: Ruby’s most dangerous API</a>. And normally I don’t like making blanket statements about language features. But I had a bad day at work because of this issue. So today, we’re talking about Timeout! :)</p>

<p>First! What is Timeout? Let’s say you have a bunch of code, that might be slow. A network request, a long computation, whatever.  Ruby’s <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.2/libdoc/timeout/rdoc/Timeout.html">timeout documentation</a> helpfully says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Timeout provides a way to auto-terminate a potentially long-running operation if it hasn’t finished in a fixed amount of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>require 'timeout'
status = Timeout::timeout(5) {
  # Something that should be interrupted if it takes more than 5 seconds...
}
</code></pre>

<p>AWESOME. This is so much easier than wrangling network socket options which might be set deep inside some client library. Seems great!</p>

<p>I tried using Timeout at work last week, and it resulted in an extremely difficult to track down bug. I felt awesome about tracking it down, and upset with myself about creating it in the first place. Let’s talk a little more about this (mis)feature.</p>

<h2 id="timeout-how-it-works-and-why-thread-raise-is-terrifying">Timeout: how it works (and why Thread.raise is terrifying)</h2>

<p>Its implementation originally seems kind of clever. You can read <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/lib/timeout.rb#L72">the code here</a>. It starts a new thread, which sets the original thread to <code>x</code>, sleeps for 5 seconds, then raises an exception on the main thread when it’s done, interrupting whatever it was doing.</p>

<pre><code>begin
  sleep sec
rescue =&gt; e
  x.raise e
else
  x.raise exception, message
end
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s look at the documentation on <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Thread.html#method-i-raise">Thread.raise</a>. It says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Raises an exception (see Kernel::raise) from thr. The caller does not have to be thr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where the implications get interesting, and terrifying. This means that an exception can get raised:</p>

<ul>
<li>during a network request (ok, as long as the surrounding code is prepared to catch <code>Timeout::Error</code>)</li>
<li>during the cleanup for the network request</li>
<li>during a <code>rescue</code> block</li>
<li>while creating an object to save to the database afterwards</li>
<li>in <strong>any</strong> of your code, regardless of whether it could have possibly raised an exception before</li>
</ul>

<p>Nobody writes code to defend against an exception being raised <strong>on literally any line</strong>. That’s not even possible. So <code>Thread.raise</code> is basically like a sneak attack on your code that could result in almost anything. It would probably be okay if it were pure-functional code that did not modify any state. But this is Ruby, so that’s unlikely :)</p>

<p>Timeout uses Thread.raise, so it is not safe to use.</p>

<h2 id="other-languages-and-thread-raise">Other languages and Thread.raise</h2>

<p>So, how do other languages approach this? Go doesn’t have exceptions, Javascript doesn’t have threads – let’s talk about Python, Java, and C#, and C++.</p>

<p><strong>Java</strong> has <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#stop%28java.lang.Throwable%29">java.lang.Thread.stop</a>, which does essentially the same thing. It was deprecated in Java 1.2, in 1998, disabled entirely in Java 8, and its documentation reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Deprecated.</strong> This method is inherently unsafe. See stop() for details. An additional danger of this method is that it may be used to generate exceptions that the target thread is unprepared to handle (including checked exceptions that the thread could not possibly throw, were it not for this method). For more information, see <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/concurrency/threadPrimitiveDeprecation.html">Why are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Python</strong> has <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/thread.html#thread.interrupt_main">thread.interrupt_main()</a>, which does the same thing as Ctrl+C-ing a program from your terminal. I’m not really sure what to say about this – certainly using <code>thread.interrupt_main()</code> also isn’t really a good idea, and it’s more limited in what it can do. I can’t find any reference to anybody considering using it for anything serious.</p>

<p><strong>C#</strong> has <code>Thread.Abort()</code> which throws a <code>ThreadAbortException</code> in the thread. Googling it finds me a series of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1559255/whats-wrong-with-using-thread-abort">StackOverflow discussions</a> &amp; forum posts about how it’s dangerous and should not be used, for the reasons we’ve learned about.</p>

<p><strong>C++</strong>: <code>std::thread</code>s <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread">are not interruptible</a>.</p>

<h2 id="not-just-an-implementation-issue">Not just an implementation issue</h2>

<p>This is not just an implementation issue in Ruby, and you can read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3ui1sw/why_rubys_timeout_is_dangerous_and_threadraise_is/cxfg98b">a great comment on Reddit illustrating this</a>. The whole premise of a general timeout method that will interrupt an arbitrary block of code like this is flawed. Here’s the API again:</p>

<pre><code>require 'timeout'
status = Timeout::timeout(5) {
  # Something that should be interrupted if it takes more than 5 seconds...
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is no way to safely interrupt an arbitrary block of code. <strong>Anything</strong> could be happening at the end of that 5 seconds.</p>

<p>However! All is not lost if we would like to interrupt our threads. Let’s turn to Java again! (you know all the times we say Ruby is more fun than Java? TODAY JAVA IS MORE FUN BECAUSE IT MAKES MORE SENSE.) Java has a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/interrupt.html">Thread.interrupt</a> method, which sends <code>InterruptedException</code> to a thread. But an InterruptedException is only allowed to be thrown at specific times, for instance during <code>Thread.sleep</code>. Otherwise the thread needs to explicitly call <code>Thread.interrupted()</code> to see if it’s supposed to stop.</p>

<h2 id="on-documentation">On documentation</h2>

<p>I don’t know. It’s possible that everybody knew that <code>Timeout</code> was a disaster except for me, and that I should have thought more carefully about what the implications of this <code>Thread.raise</code> were. But I’m thinking of making a pull request on the Ruby documentation with slightly stronger language than</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Timeout provides a way to auto-terminate a potentially long-running operation if it hasn’t finished in a fixed amount of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Raises an exception (see Kernel::raise) from thr. The caller does not have to be thr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Java approach (where they deprecated it with a strong warning and then disabled the method entirely) seems more like the right thing.</p>

<p>The highly controversial indiscriminate child sexual abuse regulation (so-called chat control) could still be endorsed by EU governments after all, as France could give up its previous veto. This is <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/law-enforcement/news/audio-communications-excluded-in-latest-draft-of-child-sexual-abuse-material-law/">reported by Euractiv</a> and confirmed by <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2024/interne-dokumente-frankreich-entscheidet-ueber-zukunft-der-chatkontrolle/">internal documents</a>. France considers the new “upload moderation” proposal in principle as a viable option.</p>



<p>According to the latest draft regulation dated 28 May (<a href="https://netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2024/05/2024-05-28_Council_Presidency_LEWP_CSAR_Compromise-texts_9093.pdf">Council document 9093/24</a>), which is presented as “upload moderation”, users of apps and services with chat functions are to be asked whether they accept the indiscriminate and error-prone scanning and possibly reporting of their privately shared images, photos and videos. Previously unknown images and videos are also to be scrutinised using “artificial intelligence” technology. If a user refuses the scanning, they would be blocked from sending or receiving images, photos, videos and links (Article 10). End-to-end encrypted services such as Whatsapp or Signal would have to implement the automated searches “prior to transmission” of a message (so-called client-side scanning, Article 10a). The initially proposed scanning of text messages for indications of grooming, which is hardly being used to date, is to be scrapped, as is the scanning of voice communication, which has never been done before. Probably as a concession to France, the chats of employees of security authorities and the military are also to be exempted from chat control.</p>



<p>During the last discussion on 24 May, the Council Legal Service made it clear that indiscriminate chat control scanning of non-suspects is still envisioned and remains a violation of fundamental rights. Nevertheless, most EU governments are determined to go ahead. EU governments plan to continue their discussions on June 4th.</p>



<p>“The Belgian proposal means that the essence of the EU Commission’s extreme and unprecedented initial chat control proposal would be implemented unchanged,” warns MEP and most prominent opponent of chat control Patrick Breyer (Pirate Party). “Using messenger services purely for texting is not an option in the 21st century. And removing excesses that aren’t being used in practice anyway is a sham.</p>



<p>Millions of private chats and private photos of innocent citizens are to be searched using unreliable technology and then leaked without the affected chat users being even remotely connected to child sexual abuse – this would destroy our digital privacy of correspondence. Our nude photos and family photos would end up with strangers in whose hands they do not belong and with whom they are not safe. Despite lip service being paid to encryption, client-side scanning would undermine previously secure end-to-end encryption in order to turn our smartphones into spies – this would destroy secure encryption.</p>



<p>I am alarmed that EU governments that have been critical so far are praising the repackaged plans, which threatens to overturn the previous blocking minority. If the EU governments really do go into the trilogue negotiations with this radical position of indiscriminate chat control scanning, experience shows that the Parliament risks gradually abandoning its initial position behind closed doors and agreeing to bad and dangerous compromises that put our online security at risk.</p>



<p>Now is the time to take to the barricades for privacy and secure encryption.”</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I’m sure I don’t need to explain why USB devices are useful. They’re all around us and our daily computers have plenty of USB ports. Even if they don’t, USB hubs can open up the possibility of more ports. This is where we plug in various devices that <strong>extend</strong> the capabilities of our machines. I’ll refer to these USB devices simply as <em>devices</em>, while referring to the machines we’re extending as <em>hosts</em>.</p>
<p>The goal of this article is to give you the simplest end-to-end journey to a working USB device. We’ll cover everything from the physical connection between the USB device and the host, and developing a super sample application that interacts with our USB device (from the host).</p>
<h2 id="what-is-usb">What is USB?</h2>
<p>Let’s cover first what exactly is USB, and for that, I’ll quote the first paragraph from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Universal Serial Bus (USB) is an industry standard that allows data exchange and delivery of power between many types of electronics. It specifies its architecture, in particular its physical interface, and communication protocols for data transfer and power delivery to and from hosts, such as personal computers, to and from peripheral devices, e.g. displays, keyboards, and mass storage devices, and to and from intermediate hubs, which multiply the number of a host’s ports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of this article will unpack this description piece by piece. To begin, though, we need to know first and foremost that USB is a <strong>serial</strong> bus. Bits go onto the bus one by one, in contrast to <strong>parallel</strong> buses. I don’t recall seeing a parallel bus for decades now. The last time I saw a parallel bus was to connect a hard disk to the motherboard with a ribbon cable. Those are outdated now, and modern buses are primarily serial. Again, this means bits go one by one, rather than in parallel. I won’t get into the details of this (mainly because I’m not an expert myself) — my understanding is that simply it’s really hard to make parallel transmission work efficiently in this context, so simple protocols end up in more elegant and faster devices. This mental model doesn’t capture nearly all the complexities, but still gives us enough to get started with USB: this is a way to exchange bits serially between the host and the device.</p>
<p>However, USB is more than just a spec on how to connect two devices and send bits back and forth. It also, per the quote above, captures some parts of the communication protocol. Let’s start unpacking, and we’ll focus on USB 2.0.</p>
<h2 id="usb-wires">USB wires</h2>
<p>You’ve likely seen different kinds of USB plugs and cables, but they all boil down to the same thing. Inside the connection are the wires to provide power from host to the device and to transfer the bits back and forth. Let’s focus on the typical USB 2.0 connection, these are the wires you’ll see inside:</p>
<ol>
<li>+5 V wire, this is where the device gets its power from, if powering from the host.</li>
<li><code>D-</code> and <code>D+</code> wires: I lump them together as one item here, since they jointly work to transfer <strong>1 bit</strong> (not 2!) as a differential pair. Much more info on that below.</li>
<li><code>GND</code> wire: unsurprisingly, this is ground.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some connections may have a few more pins, like the <code>ID</code> pin, but since this is the bare minimal writeup on USB, let’s skip that now. We’ll be working only with the 4 wires described above.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-usb-c">A note on USB-C</h3>
<p>USB-C is super common these days. What I wrote above for the USB wires still <em>somewhat</em> applies to USB-C, but it’s slightly different in that case. One of the main differences, obviously, is the fact that you can plug a USB-C device either way and things should work. At the core of it, there’s still a differential pair.</p>
<p>Let’s just focus on one very important thing here: if a device connects via USB-C, it still doesn’t mean anything when it comes to the speed, or even which USB version it is. It could still be a USB 2.0 device, or it could be a more modern USB 3.0 device.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, we won’t be discussing USB-C anymore here.</p>
<h3 id="data-over-a-differential-pair">Data over a differential pair</h3>
<p>If you’ve never seen differential pairs before, then having 2 wires somehow transmitting 1 bit may stump you. In the most basic computer architecture course, you learn that you only need one wire to signal a digital bit. The wire’s voltage (or should I say potential?), in relation to the ground (point of 0 volts) signals what is the value of the bit. If you’re playing with something like Raspberry Pi, you know that if you set a GPIO pin to logical 1, it gives you 3.3 V, 0 V otherwise.</p>
<p>And this is fine over something like super short distances, within a chip, or even within small traces on the PCB. However, we frequently have a need for longer distance wired connections. Your keyboard and mouse are at least a few feet away from your computer, for example.</p>
<p>This is where the differential pairs come in. Instead of having one wire at voltage <code>V</code>, in relation to <code>GND</code>, we now have <strong>two</strong> wires. One is still at voltage <code>V</code>, while the other one is the polar opposite at <code>-V</code>. When a differential pair comes out of one component into the other, what the other component considers is the voltage difference between these two wires. <code>V - (-V) = 2V</code>. There seems to be little benefit in this — we just got double the voltage we otherwise would, and that’s true in this model; however this model doesn’t paint the whole picture. We assumed our wires carry our voltage perfectly.</p>
<p>Let’s mark the voltages of these wires as <code>V+</code> and <code>V-</code>. If we use a more realistic model, <code>V+</code> isn’t simply equal to <code>V</code>, it’s equal to <code>V</code> plus some voltage noise, let’s mark it as <code>Vn</code>. Therefore <code>V+ = V + Vn</code>. Now, <code>V-</code> is similarly <code>V- = -V + Vn</code>. This time, when we calculate what the other device sees, it’s <code>V+ - V- = (V + Vn) - (-V + Vn) = 2V</code>. The voltage noise is gone! Now it’s a little clearer what the benefits of the differential pairs are.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a mega simplified view of things. For example, why do we treat the noise factor as the same for both wires here? For a more serious introduction to differential pairs, I’d recommend Zach Peterson’s videos on Altium YouTube channel, starting from this one:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7DF25ohH8v4?si=qgSulBtaZC22ksJk" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>
<p>Now it should be clearer why I lumped <code>D+</code> and <code>D-</code> wires above as one item: these two wires carry one bit at the time. It should also be clearer why they’re identified as <code>D</code>, and what is plus and what is minus.</p>
<h2 id="usb-on-a-pcb">USB on a PCB</h2>
<p><em>If you don’t intend to make your own hardware for a USB device and instead want to use some existing development board, you can skip this altogether, but I’d still recommend quickly scanning through it.</em></p>
<p>When you add a USB connector to your PCB from some library, you should see the pins that I listed above, and you can route accordingly. Your PCB may have a microcontroller, or a more complex SoC onboard, and you’ll definitely need to run the differential pair to the relevant two neighboring pins on the chip. For routing differential pairs, there are a couple of basic things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>First, the trace from the <code>D+</code> pin on your USB connector to the plus pin for the differential pair on your chip should be of same length as the other trace for the differential pair.</p>
<p>Second, these traces should be very close to each other. For a graphical example, please check out <a href="https://resources.altium.com/p/what-are-differential-pairs-and-differential-signals">this article</a>, the graphic at the top should quickly illustrate what I’m talking about (again, great article by Zach Peterson).</p>
<p>These two principles should explain a little bit why in our (still simplistic) calculation, we assumed that the noise in our voltage is the same. The two wires are running in almost identical context and that’s how the noise ends up cancelling.</p>
<p>Third, and this is potentially very important, we should have a certain impedance for the signals. The calculations here are very complex and many factors go in. I recommend watching the following video for an introduction here:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Itsrdc8tX7M?si=ODaZPMZtIUYz0vTq" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>
<p>tl;dr is that you’ll go to your fabricator’s website, put some parameters into the calculator, and it will calculate the missing parameters. For example, you’ll specify your target impedance for the differential pair running above a layer of ground plane, specify the distance between your differential pair lines, etc. and it will provide you with the trace width you should use in order to achieve that impedance.</p>
<p>I’ll link below to another great video by Zach Peterson about USB routing, but I think if you’re just getting started, the one above should be enough:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4LwnEaNvG8I?si=MZNTZHSWDQgg3mGz" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>
<h2 id="different-speeds-of-usb">Different speeds of USB</h2>
<p>We said initially we’re focusing on USB 2.0, but that still doesn’t fully tell us what’s the speed we’re reaching here. Even within the same USB version, we can have different speed levels. For example, you can run USB 2.0 at <em>full speed</em>, which is 12 Mbit/s, but you could also run it at <em>high speed</em>, which is 480 Mbit/s. The device and the host need to figure out what’s the speed they’ll be utilizing when they connect.</p>
<h3 id="a-quick-note-on-the-speeds-over-pcb">A quick note on the speeds over PCB</h3>
<p>Again, you can skip this if you aren’t making your own PCB, but it still makes sense to try to parse through this, it could be useful.</p>
<p>While there seem to be many requirements for correctly routing USB over the PCB, the hardware you’re connecting on both ends, the host and the chip in your device, can be fairly forgiving, especially if you’re not going for the high speed (and at full speed, 12 Mbit/s should be more than enough for a basic prototype).</p>
<p>One of the big things about reaching high speeds is hitting the right impedance. Lots of thought needs to go into this, but from my understanding, if you’re going for full speed, you can get away with a lot (and we will in our working example below!). The trace widths don’t matter all that much, especially if your traces are short from the USB connector to your chip.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-and-software-layers">Protocol and software layers</h2>
<p>I think so far we’ve covered a decent chunk of hardware, and we should discuss what about the protocol itself and how does software (on both sides) use USB.</p>
<p>I’ll go ahead and simply recommend watching this video:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lbmAn3b76rY?si=vZ_DfxFGssy8r5EJ" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>
<p>This video talks about USB from the Linux perspective, which is great, but we still haven’t covered Linux here. That said, the video also covers USB broadly, and is pretty well packed into ~45 minutes of content. For the purposes of this article, I’d recommend watching until the Linux example. There’s a lot of background on what the USB frames look like, how there are different endpoints involved and so on. There’s a great bit on configurations and how one device can fulfill multiple USB functionalities. I think if there is one thing to take away from that video, it’s to think about USB as a network of devices, and try to understand that. I won’t try to reproduce any of the details here, I highly recommend watching the video.</p>
<h3 id="usb-device-classes-and-how-hosts-use-them">USB device classes and how hosts use them</h3>
<p>Hosts obviously need drivers in order to abstract away the hardware and handle the interaction with their components. However, it would be unreasonable to expect that different kernels have drivers implemented for every single USB device. Instead, operating systems recognize different classes of devices.</p>
<p>Some classes are mass storage devices (probably the most common everyday use case), some are serial devices, and so on. Therefore, there is some level of uniformity across devices here. In our example below, we’ll build a sample device that’s simply a serial port from the host’s perspective.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-serial-port-device">Building a serial port device</h2>
<p>Our device will be very simple — we will have a USB-capable microcontroller that is powered by the host and serves the host by simply turning on an LED when requested. The host will see this device as a simple serial port device.</p>
<p>I see two main approaches in this kind of scenario: use a microcontroller or a Linux-ready SoC. In the latter case, the kernel itself can do a bulk of work and offer you a very clean Linux API for the functionality, but that is an overkill for this simple use case, and we’ll stick with the microcontroller. I’ll do a reflection on the state of software for this kind of a use case below.</p>
<h3 id="stm32-microcontroller-and-the-nucleo-board">STM32 microcontroller and the Nucleo board</h3>
<p>We’re opting for the first approach, which is using a USB-ready microcontroller and our development board of choice is <a href="https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f103rb.html">NUCLEO-F103RB</a>. In the US, it can be bought on something like Digikey for a little over $10.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo of NUCLEO-F103RB" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.st.com/bin/ecommerce/api/image.PF259875.en.feature-description-include-personalized-no-cpn-medium.jpg">
</p>
<p>When you look at this board, you can clearly see it consists of 2 pieces spliced together. The connection is almost like a perforation, and I’ve seen some videos on YouTube where people literally break this board in two along that connection by hand. I wouldn’t do it, though.</p>
<p>The smaller piece is the microcontroller programmer. This is where the USB connection with the computer also lies and that’s how you’ll be programming the board. Be careful though, that’s <strong>not the USB connection</strong> we’re looking for here, and this may stump you right now.</p>
<p>To be fully perfectly precise, there are 2 big chips on this Nucleo board. One lies on the programmer piece of the PCB, and the other one is the microcontroller you’re actually programming, and it lies on the bigger piece. The USB connection your computer establishes with the board is actually with the microcontroller on the programmer side. This programmer speaks the ST-LINK protocol, which to the best of my understanding, is just a protocol built on top of USB messaging. Your computer and the programmer MCU will exchange USB messages according to the ST-LINK protocol, and then that MCU will program your “main” MCU. How that happens on this board, I don’t know, nor should it matter for our experiment. It could happen over something like SPI, as far as we’re concerned, or maybe they could even have their own USB connection between themselves, who knows.</p>
<p>If you were to build your own PCB with an STM32 microcontroller, you could place one chip on the board, program it over USB and later use the same USB port for business logic between your device and the USB host. I’ll link to two videos from Phil’s Lab (fantastic materials) on building STM32-based PCBs, as well as how to do programming on these over USB. The first one is 20 minutes only, and absolutely worth your time.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-actual-usb-port">Setting up the actual USB port</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve established that the USB connection we have on the Nucleo board indeed isn’t connected to the chip that we’re actually programming, we need to figure out a way to get that USB port from the “main” chip to work.</p>
<p>In this exercise, once we program the chip, we’ll disconnect the ST-LINK programmer piece from the computer, and power our main chip from the “real” USB port instead. Below is how we do it, step by step. We’ll be using STM32CubeIDE to write the software, and then use STM32CubeProgrammer to drop that software onto the board, in order to keep things simple.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is identify which pins on the MCU are able to work as the USB port. We’re making a USB 2.0 device, keeping things simple, and this is what we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pin to supply 5 V power from the host device.</li>
<li><code>GND</code> pin.</li>
<li><code>D+</code> and <code>D-</code> pins that can handle the USB differential pair data.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>GND</code> is trivial, and so should be the 5 V power. The only detail regarding powering this board over the “proper” USB port is that you need to change the pins on jumper <code>JP5</code> in order to configure the board to accept “external 5 V” supply. Check the board documentation for more details, but this is really all I had to do. With that, we’ve taken care of 2 pins.</p>
<p>In your STM32CubeIDE app, you should configure (through the UI) <code>PA12</code> to act as <code>USB_DP</code> and <code>PA11</code> to act as <code>USB_DM</code> (+ and -, respectively, of course). The end result should look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo of the LED experiment" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://popovicu.com/assets/cubeide_usb_ports.png.webp" height="319" width="781">
</p>
<p>Now, one important thing to note is that the chip on this board will expect an <strong>external</strong> 1.5 kΩ resistor to be present in the circuit for the USB connection to work. To make this simple, I just bought a pack of 1.5 kΩ resistors from Amazon (not the cheapest solution, though). That resistor should be pulling up the pin <code>PA12</code> to 3.3 V, which you can also find on the Nucleo board. I used a breadboard to wire this up, so nothing fancy is required.</p>
<p>Now that we have identified these 4 pins on the board (plus the 3.3 V for pull-up) and flipped the power supply jumper, we’re ready to make the physical connection to the host. In my case, this is a MacBook Pro running Mac OS. To be able to connect my MacBook to these individual pins, I used a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QQQZ1DV?th=1">breakout cable from Amazon</a>. For this particular cable that I linked, I popped off the terminal blocks (it’s all modular) and instead got the USB pins exposed. There were 5 pins, but you can ignore the S pin for this exercise. After that, I used regular jumper wires to connect these pins to my Nucleo board, as well as the breadboard where I handled the pull-up for the <code>PA12</code> pin.</p>
<p>I’d like to quickly point back to all the previous notes about length matching with differential pairs, impedance control and so on — as you can see, we’re super relaxed here, and we will be able to achieve the 12 Mbit/s connection regardless. This is what I meant when I said that the devices can be pretty forgiving, at least at some speed.</p>
<p>We’re now wired up and ready to go!</p>
<h3 id="writing-the-software">Writing the software</h3>
<p>Once you set up the USB pins in CubeIDE, you’ll get some notifications about the clock set up — go for the option where CubeIDE takes care of it for you, it should be able to fix things up. There are a few things to set up for the software part of the USB left.</p>
<p>In <code>Pinout &amp; Configuration</code> section, you will see a sub-menu called <code>Middleware and Software Packs</code>. In there, you should see a <code>USB_DEVICE</code> option, so let’s open that.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo of the LED experiment" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://popovicu.com/assets/cubeide_usb_setup.png.webp" height="719" width="1886" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://popovicu.com/assets/cubeide_usb_setup.png.webp 1886w, https://popovicu.com/assets/cubeide_usb_setup@986w.webp 986w, https://popovicu.com/assets/cubeide_usb_setup@686w.webp 686w">
</p>
<p>What really matters for this exercise is to set up the mode of the device to:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Communication Device Class (Virtual Port Com)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This will ensure that your Nucleo board behaves as a serial port device (CDC) from the host perspective. Thus, your host will be able to set up the correct drivers in order to work with your custom device.</p>
<p>At this point, CubeIDE will also generate some C code in your program. In my <code>main.c</code> file, I see a line that says:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>MX_USB_DEVICE_Init</span><span>();</span></span></code></pre>
<p>For a more step-by-step guide on all this, if the above wasn’t enough, please take a look at this video:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZjnCOun1wU?si=i-Gr818H4iPckurV" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>
<p>We’ll do pretty much the same thing as in this video, in order to enable turning on of the LED (we’ll skip turning off in this exercise). The <code>CDC_Receive_FS</code> routine will have this snippet:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>/* USER CODE BEGIN 6 */</span></span>
<span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>Buf</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>] </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>'1'</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>	</span><span>HAL_GPIO_WritePin</span><span>(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_5, </span><span>1</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This call to the HAL layer will switch on the onboard LED, which is connected to pin 5 of port A.</p>
<h3 id="flashing-and-running">Flashing and running</h3>
<p>You can go ahead and build the ELF file and use the CubeProgrammer to drop the code bytes onto the board. Once that is done, you can unplug the programmer and wire the board as we described above, powering it from “external 5 V” supply.</p>
<p>Once your board powers on, you should be able to see it in whatever device manager your operating system has. Unless you’re running something extremely exotic, I would expect your operating system to be able to recognize the device. In the USB section of your device manager, you should see something like a “COM port”, or a “Serial port” or something along those lines.</p>
<p>If you want to be extra cool, you can go back to CubeIDE, head over to the <code>USB_DEVICE</code> menu for the middleware where we previously set up the CDC class for our microcontroller software, and take a look at the bottom section. There, you are able to change the values in the <code>Device Descriptor</code> section, and set up a custom name for your device. That would be reflected in your operating system’s device manager.</p>
<p>And for the fun part, you need to connect to your serial port and send byte ‘1’ to make the LED flip on. On my Mac OS, I can find my new device under the <code>/dev</code> filesystem tree. It’s listed on my machine as <code>/dev/tty.usbmodem497A0F6739561</code>. If you’re on Linux, you should get something similar. You may see it listed as <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> or something like that. I’ll use Minicom to talk to this serial device, but you can do pretty much anything here, as long as it works with the serial ports on your device. I run something like this:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>minicom --device /dev/tty.usbmodem497A0F6739561</span></span></code></pre>
<p>At this point, I can simply tap the number ‘1’ on my keyboard, and the green LED on the Nucleo board should go green.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We’ve basically built a USB serial port device from scratch, and it’s recognized (hopefully) by any mainstream operating system. There’s a bit of theory in the beginning regarding building the PCBs that can do this, and I hope that was helpful as well.</p>
<p>I mentioned that from the software perspective, high level, there are 2 approaches: use a microcontroller or with a more complex system, let something like Linux kernel handle the software on the device side. The first approach was simpler for this exercise, but I will highlight that I’m not a huge fan of how things are with STM32 here.</p>
<p>This is mostly from a software engineering perspective, and I feel more comfortable sharing my opinions here, given that my professional background is mostly in software engineering. For a start, I don’t like how we have to generate a ton of boilerplate with the IDE after clicking through the UI menus. I wish that we had a library that was more flexible and parameterized in code, so that we can have something like <code>InitUsbDevice(UsbClass.CDC)</code>, instead of going through the UIs to generate the code. There’s also <strong>a lot</strong> of boilerplate with STM32, and it’s very tightly coupled with the user code. In my view, this makes code reviews very difficult. Additionally, how exactly do we update all this boilerplate when a new version is out? This seems a bit like an afterthought with the CubeIDE, and it’s not unheard of in the embedded world. I’ve read some research that says that an overwhelming majority of the embedded devices never see a software update (this can make a lot of software engineers recoil as they read it). There are also other things that are tricky here, for example, what if one day we wanted to change our microcontroller for something different? We’re super tied into the STM32 world with this current set up.</p>
<p>There’s a reason why I mentioned Linux being able to act as a USB device — I believe that’s a much cleaner approach. The Linux APIs are much more solid and standardized. Things with Linux would be based on interactions with the pseudo-files and some system calls. The user space is very cleanly separated from the kernel space. Additionally, I think of Linux as <em>the HAL</em> layer. If our microcontroller could run Linux, we’d see a very nice view of all these devices and there wouldn’t be a need for wonky HAL libraries and so on.</p>
<p>That said, obviously, sometimes we want lightweight and cheap USB devices that are easy to produce. Linux SoCs are more heavyweight, obviously, and may be an overkill for a lot of use cases. I guess my main point here is that I wish there were more portable and less opinionated frameworks for building bare metal USB devices than what’s available out there. There are things that drive me away from some of them that may be widely accepted: things like frameworks dictating a particular build system that should be used, etc.</p>
<p>All this may or may not be a big deal for your project, it’s ultimately for you to decide. I hope I’ll have some time in the near future to play around with this other variation, using Linux itself as the way to implement software on the USB device side, but that’s for another day. For now, let’s enjoy starting up our first custom USB devices that can cleanly integrate with our standard everyday machines like our laptops.</p>
<p>As always, I hope this was useful.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>During AMD's Computex 2024 kick-off keynote, AMD's CEO, Dr. Lisa Su, officially unveiled and announced the company's next generation of Ryzen processors. Today marks the first unveiling of AMD's highly anticipated Zen 5 microarchitecture via the Ryzen 9000 series, which is set to bring several advancements over Zen 4 and the Ryzen 7000 series for desktop PCs, which will launch sometime in July 2024.</p>

<p>AMD has unveiled four new chip SKUs using its Zen 5 microarchitecture. The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor will be the new consumer flagship part, featuring 16 CPU cores and a speedy 5.7 GHz maximum boost frequency. The other SKUs include, 6, 8, and 12 core parts, giving users a varied combination of core and thread counts. All four of these initial chips will be X-series chips, meaning they will have an unlocked multipliers and higher TDPs/clockspeeds.</p>

<p>In regards to performance, AMD is touting an average (geomean) IPC increase in desktop workloads for Zen 5 of 16%. And with the new desktop Ryzen chips' turbo clockspeeds remaining largely identical to their Ryzen 7000 predecessors, this should translate into similar performance expectations for the new chips.</p>

<p>The AMD Ryzen 9000 series will also launch on the AM5 socket, which debuted with AMD's Ryzen 7000 series and marks AMD's commitment to socket/platform longevity. Along with the Ryzen 9000 series will come a pair of new high-performance chipsets: the X870E (Extreme) and the regular X870 chipsets. The fundamental features that vendors will integrate into their specific motherboards remain tight-lipped. Still, we do know that USB 4.0 ports are standard on the X870E/X870 boards, along with PCIe 5.0 for both PCIe graphics and NVMe storage, with higher AMD EXPO memory profile support expected than previous generations.</p>

<h2>AMD Ryzen 9000: Bringing Up to 16C/32T of Zen 5 to Desktop</h2>

<p>Zen 5 is AMD's latest advancement in Ryzen microarchitecture. While AMD hasn't disclosed many technical details, we know some of the brand-new features that Zen 5 will offer.</p>

<p>Looking at architectural differences between the last couple of generations (Zen 4 and Zen 3) and Zen 5, we know that AMD uses a new manufacturing process for its Ryzen 9000 desktop chips. While many have touted and speculated that Zen 5 for desktops will be built on one of TSMC's N3 (3 nm) nodes, some of our sources are saying that the Zen 5 CCD will be fabbed on TSMC N4 – though we are awaiting official confirmation about this (Update: And TSMC 4nm is now confirmed for the consumer Ryzen CCD). Furthermore, AMD's mobile counterpart offering, the Ryzen AI 300 series (Strix Point) has been confirmed for 4nm, and we've yet to see an AMD desktop CPU die produced on a more advanced node than its mobile counterpart.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2810%29.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2810%29.png"></a></p>

<p>While AMD is not offering a deep dive into the Zen 5 architecture at Computex, the company did touch upon a few of the major architectural improvements over Zen 4 that will be coming with the new CPU architecture. These start with an improved branch predictor, which is designed to offer better accuracy, efficiency, and reduced overall latency of instruction cycles. The Zen 5 architecture also boasts higher throughput with wider pipelines and SIMDs, allowing for faster data processing and equating to better overall performance in benchmarks such as CineBench and Blender and workloads leveraging the AVX-512 instruction set.</p>

<p>Additionally, Zen 5 introduces a deeper out-of-order instruction window size across its design, enabling more parallelism and better handling of multiple instructions within the pipeline simultaneously.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2811%29.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2811%29.png"></a></p>

<p>There are also a couple of points within the Zen 5 architecture where AMD has doubled up on resources or performance. L2 to L1 memory bandwidth is one such example, giving the cache hierarchy a big bandwidth boost that should allow for faster data transfers within the individual CPU cores. AMD also claims better AI performance in inferencing and AVX-512 workloads. Notably, AMD's AVX-512 support on Zen 4 was executed using a 256-bit SIMD over 2 cycles, so this may be a sign that AMD has expanded their AVX-512 SIMDs to a full 512-bits wide in the Zen 5 architecture. (Update: This has since been confirmed by AMD. Zen 5 now has a full 512-bit wide SIMD for processing AVX-512 instructions)</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2812%29.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2812%29.png"></a></p>

<p>These enhancements collectively aim to deliver significant performance gains over the previous Zen 4 microarchitecture, with AMD touting an average (geomean) 16% IPC uplift over Zen 4 in desktop workloads. It should be noted, however, that the top result in this benchmark collection is in the GeekBench 5.3 AES XTS benchmark, which leverages the VAES512 and VAES256 extensions of the AVX-512 instruction set. So AMD's AVX-512 SIMD changes greatly impact that benchmark in particular (though not exclusively).</p>

<p>Above is a render of a Ryzen 9000 series chip with two core complex dies (CCDs), which depicts the silicon's composition and layout. As with previous generations of Ryzen processors, there's a large central I/O die (IOD), through which all I/O and memory operations are routed. As for the CCDs, each die once again contains 8 CPU cores, with AMD equipping Ryzen chips with either 1 or 2 CCDs depending on the SKU. The new Zen 5 CCDs are being fabbed on one of TSMC's 4nm processes (AMD hasn't confirmed which flavor), which is a modest shrink from the N5 process used for Zen 4 CCDs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, although AMD hasn't confirmed that they're reusing the Ryzen 7000 series IOD here, all signs currently point to the Ryzen 9000 IOD being similar or identical to it. In particular, it is fabbed on the same TSMC N6 process, with the same 2 RDNA graphics CUs, and it offers the exact same off-chip I/O capabilities (though the latter is admittedly also dictated by the AM5 socket).</p>

<p>AMD's Ryzen 9000 chips will also feature similar memory support as their predecessors, with AMD sticking to DDR5. However, AMD does note that the incoming X870E and X870 motherboard chipsets will allow for faster EXPO memory profiles than seen on Zen 4. <s>As it stands, AMD hasn't disclosed the JEDEC memory specification of the four Ryzen 9000 SKUs that it announced today. However, we expect to find out more before the July 2024 launch of the Ryzen 9000 family.</s> And according to AMD's product pages posted since the keynote, the Ryzen 9000 family will top out at JEDEC DDR5-5600 speeds for in-warranty configurations.</p>

<p>The announcement of Zen 5 for desktop by AMD and the impending Ryzen 9000 offers four X-series SKUs at launch, allowing for overclocking and coming with unlocked CPU multipliers. The flagship SKU, the Ryzen 9 9950X, features 16 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.7 GHz, 80 MB of cache split between 64 MB for the L3 and 16 MB for the L2 (1 MB per core of L2) and a 170 W TDP. The Ryzen 9 9900X offers 12 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.6 GHz, 64 MB of L3 cache, and a 120 W TDP.</p>

<p>Moving down the Ryzen 9000 stack is the Ryzen 7 9700X, which comes with 8 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.5 GHz, 32 MB of L3 cache, and a 65W TDP. Finally, the entry-level SKU, the Ryzen 5 9600X, has just 6 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.4 GHz, 32 MB of L3 cache, and a 65 W TDP.</p>

<p>The next slide denotes the flagship Zen 5 chip. The Ryzen 9 9950X is up against Intel's current 14th Gen Core i9-14900K. In productivity and content creation tasks, the Ryzen 9 9950X shows a 7% improvement in Procyon Office, a 10% increase in Puget Photoshop, and a 21% uplift in Cinebench R24 nT. More notably, it exhibits a 55% performance boost in Handbrake and a 56% increase in Blender.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the gaming data shows marginal gains in some titles, although it highlights more significant uplifts in others. AMD's in-house testing shows that the Ryzen 9 9950X outperforms the Intel Core i9-14900K by 4% in Borderlands 3, 6% in Hitman 3, and 13% in Cyberpunk 2077. Further, it achieves a 16% improvement in F1 2023, a 17% gain in DOTA 2, and a 23% increase in Horizon Zero Dawn.</p>

<p>As we've mentioned, AMD is committed to extending its AM5 socket for longevity, at least much more than other vendors offer with their CPU launches and updates. As such, AMD's Ryzen 9000 series operates on the current AM5 platform. And while Ryzen 9000 is fully backwards compatible with existing 600 series boards, AMD has also readied two new 800 series motherboard chipsets for the launch of Zen 5 on desktops. The X870E (extreme) and X870 chipsets will be featured on numerous new motherboards at launch, and a big part of Computex this week will be the motherboard vendors (most of whom are local Taiwanese firms) showing off their new wares.</p>

<p>AMD has offered just a handful of details about their X870E and X870 chipsets. Of particular note, USB 4.0 support is going to be standard on all X870(E) motherboards, whereas it was optional on X670(E) series boards. X870(E) boards will also feature Wi-Fi 7 support (up from 6E on the 600 series), and at least one PCIe 5.0 NVMe slot continues to be mandatory. AMD also notes that motherboards based on both platforms "feature 44 total PCIe lanes," which would break down as 24 lanes from the CPU, and another 20 lanes coming from the chipset.</p>

<p>For the moment, different AMD resources are in conflict with each other about PCIe 5.0 – or, at least, aren't being very clear about it. According to <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/chipsets/am5.html#specs">AMD's AM5 chipset page</a>, both X870 and X870E feature PCie 5.0 for both the CPU NVMe lanes and CPU PEG lanes. However AMD's Compute press release states that X870E is "differentiated with 24 PCIe 5.0 lanes, with 16 lanes dedicated to graphics," implying that the vanilla X870 won't mandate PCIe 5.0 support. We're poking around AMD and the motherboard vendors to find out more.</p>

<p>Looking under the hood, AMD has confirmed that the new chipsets aren't based on new silicon. Instead, the company is using the same ASMedia-produced design as in the X670/B650 chipsets: the Promontory 21 controller. Given that the feature sets of the newer X870E/X870 motherboards are fundamentally similar to those of the X670E/X670 motherboards, aside from using newer external controllers such as Wi-Fi 7, there's apparently little need to change the chipset itself. Though given the lack of significant changes, it does raise the question of why AMD has skipped a generation in its nomenclature (700-series anyone?) and went straight to the 800-series chipset.</p>

<p>The AMD Ryzen 9000 series, including the flagship Ryzen 9 9950X (16C/32T), the Ryzen 9 9900X (12C/24T), the Ryzen 7 9700X (8C/16T), and the entry-level Ryzen 5 9600X (6C/12T) is expected to hit retail channels sometime in July 2024. At the time of writing, AMD is not providing pricing.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><div><p><em>“Our minds are hurt more often by overeating than by hunger.” </em></p><p><em>— Petrarch</em></p></div><p>We evolved to crave sugar because it was a scarce source of energy. But when we learned to produce it on an industrial scale, suddenly our love for sweet things became a liability. The same is now true of data. In an age of information overabundance, our curiosity, which once focused us, now distracts us. And it’s led to an epidemic of intellectual obesity that’s clogging our minds with malignant junk.</p><p><span>The analogy of information as sugar is not just rhetoric. A 2019 </span><a href="https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/how-information-is-like-snacks-money-and-drugs-to-your-brain/" rel="">study</a><span> by researchers at Berkeley found that information acts on the brain’s dopamine-producing reward system in the same way as food. Put simply, the brain treats information as a reward in itself; it doesn't matter whether the info is accurate or useful, the brain will still crave it and feel satisfied after consuming it (at least until it starts craving more).</span></p><p>For hundreds of millennia, this wasn't a problem, because on the plains of the savanna, information was as scarce and precious as sugar. But this all changed with the rise of industrial society and the web.</p><p>We now live in an attention economy, where people are trying to draw our interest by any means possible. Since low-quality information is just as effective at satisfying our information-cravings as high-quality information, the most efficient way to get attention in the digital age is by mass-producing low-quality “junk info”— a kind of fast food for thought. Like fast food, junk info is cheap to produce and satisfying to consume, but high in additives and low in nutrition. It's also potentially addictive and, if consumed excessively, highly dangerous.</p><p>Junk info is often false info, but it isn't junk because it's false. It's junk because it has no practical use; it doesn't make your life better, and it doesn't improve your understanding. Even lies can be nourishing; the works of Dostoevsky are fiction, yet can teach you more about humans than any psychology textbook. Meanwhile, most verified facts do nothing to improve your life or understanding, and are, to paraphrase Nietzsche, as useful as knowledge of the chemical composition of water to someone who is drowning.</p><p><span>Common types of junk info include gossip, trivia, clickbait, hackery, marketing, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churnalism" rel="">churnalism</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/the-opinion-pageant?s=w" rel="">babble</a><span>. But in fact, any information that you can't use is junk info. A typical example on social media would be a photo of a freshly cooked burger, captioned with “Look what I just made!” but posted without a recipe so you can't even recreate it. Such an image might make you briefly salivate, and possibly spur you to make a burger of your own, but it provides no discernible value to your life.</span></p><p>Most people don't think very hard about what they post on social media, and such people are naturally able to post at a faster rate than more careful minds, so trivialities (e.g. “feeling tired, might go to sleep, lol”) quickly saturate these platforms. But the junk info that spreads furthest of all is that which evokes strong emotions, and this hasn't gone unnoticed by those, such as journalists and commentators, who are most desperate for your attention.</p><p><span>The easiest strong emotion to evoke is outrage; it requires nothing more sophisticated than a simple story of oppression, tailored to the appropriate political tribe. And yet outrage, for all its cheapness, is highly addictive and highly contagious, making it the weapon of choice for anyone who wants to be noticed in the online cacophony. Even once-respected outlets like the </span><em>New York Times</em><span> now resort to “ragebait,” sensationalist stories calculated to infuriate both the newspaper's readers and its political opponents, ensuring maximum attention.</span></p><p><span>Market forces and social pressures have caused junk info to dominate the web because it's cheap, easy to produce, and good at stealing your attention. Its ubiquity means it's always within easy reach of netizens, and as a result, millions of people are now hooked on it. It's why they endlessly scroll their Twitter timelines or check their Instagram notifications, or repeatedly click refresh on the YouTube homepages, or keep renewing their subscriptions to the </span><em>Times</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>The vast majority of the online content you consume today won't improve your understanding of the world. In fact, it may just do the opposite; recent </span><a href="https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2022/program/content/68947" rel="">research</a><span> suggests that people browsing social media tend to experience “normative dissociation” in which they become less aware and less able to process information, to such an extent that they often can’t recall what they just read.</span></p><p>But despite being “empty calories,” junk info still tastes delicious. Since your dopamine pathways can't distinguish between useful and useless info, consuming junk info gives you the satisfaction of feeling like you're learning—it offers you the sensation of mental nourishment—even though all you're really doing is shoving virtual popcorn into your skull.</p><p><span>Eventually, the addiction to useless info leads to what I call “intellectual obesity.” Just as gorging on junk food bloats your body, so gorging on junk info bloats your mind, filling it with a cacophony of half-remembered gibberish that sidetracks your attention and confuses your senses. Unable to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant, you become concerned by trivialities and outraged by falsehoods. These concerns and outrages push you to consume even more, and all the time that you're consuming, you're prevented from doing anything else: learning, focusing, even </span><em>thinking</em><span>. The result is that your stream of consciousness becomes clogged; you develop atherosclerosis of the mind.</span></p><p>We now live in a state of constant distraction caused by an addiction to useless information, and this distraction is so overpowering it even distracts us from the fact we're being distracted. You'll probably read this article, briefly consider the damage junk info has done to you, and then return to aimlessly scrolling Twitter.</p><p>But before you do that, let's try to work out some kind of solution.</p><p>The most straightforward way to improve your information diet is to develop a habit for meta-awareness; to pay attention to what you're paying attention to. When you find yourself reaching unprompted for your phone, or hovering over the Twitter icon, invoke the “10-10-10 rule:” ask yourself, if I consume this info, how will I feel about it in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years? Doing this may help you realize that the brief sugar-rush offered by junk info is so transient and insignificant in the grand scheme of your life that it's simply not worth your time.</p><p>And if your cravings can't be beaten by mere reasoning, then consider rearranging your lifestyle so junk info is simply not an option. The way I beat intellectual obesity was by trying to become the best writer I can be. Writing requires you to filter out bad information because you have a duty to your readers to not be full of shit. Writing also forces you to periodically shut out information altogether so you can be alone with your thoughts. This regular confrontation with yourself helps you keep your bearings in a world constantly trying to lure you away from your brain.</p><p><span>Ultimately you'll have to determine the info-diet that works for you. But if you insist on endlessly consuming whatever the web serves you, know that this banquet culminates in a bitter dessert: at the end of your life, when you're weighing your regrets, you probably won’t say “Man, I wish I’d spent more time browsing the web.” On the contrary, you'll have no recollection of that tweet by a stranger telling you they prefer pasta to pizza, or that gif that amused you for five seconds, or that </span><em>Times</em><span> piece that made you mad for a whole minute. And when you notice the myriad holes that all this junk has left in your memory, then it’ll finally be clear that you weren’t consuming it as much as it was consuming you.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://formlabs.com/">Formlabs</a> has recently launched the fourth edition of their flagship SLA printer line, the <a href="https://formlabs.com/3d-printers/form-4/">Form 4</a>. Of course, I jumped on the chance to do a teardown of the printer; I’m grateful that I was able to do the same for the <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2013/formlabs-form-1-teardown/">Form 1</a>, <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2016/formlabs-form-2-teardown/">Form 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2020/formlabs-form-3-teardown/">Form 3</a> generations. In addition to learning a lot from the process of tearing down a single printer, I am also gaining a unique perspective on how a successful hardware startup matures into an established player in a cut-throat industry.</p>



<p><em>Financial interest disclosure: Formlabs provides me two printers for the teardown, with no contingencies on the contents or views expressed in this post. I am also a shareholder of Formlabs.</em></p>



<p><strong>A Bit of Background</strong></p>



<p>The past few years has seen a step-function in the competitiveness of products out of China, and SLA 3D printers have been no exception. The Form 4 sits at a pivotal moment for Formlabs, and has parallels to the larger geopolitical race for technological superiority. In general, Chinese products tend to start from a low price point with fewer features and less reliability, focusing on the value segment and iterating their way towards up-market opportunities; US products tend to start at a high price point, with an eye on building (or defending) a differentiated brand through quality, support, and features, and iterate their way down into value-oriented models. We now sit at a point where both the iterate-up and iterate-down approaches are directly competing for the same markets, setting the stage for the current trade war.</p>



<p>Being the first to gain momentum in a field also results in the dilemma of inertia. Deep financial and human capital investments into older technology often create a barrier to adopting newer technology. Mobile phone infrastructure is a poster child for the inertia of legacy: developing countries often have spectacular 5G service compared to the US, since they have no legacy infrastructure on the balance sheet to depreciate and can thus leapfrog their nations directly into mature, cost-reduced and modern mobile phone infrastructure.</p>



<p>In the case of 3D printers, Formlabs was founded in 2011, back when UV lasers were expensive, UV LEDs weren’t commercially viable, and full HD LCD screens (1080p) were just becoming mainstream. The most viable technology for directing light at the time was the galvanometer: a tiny mirror mounted on a motor that can adjust its angle with parts-per-thousands accuracy, tens of thousands of times a second. They invested in full custom galvanometer technology to create a consumer-priced SLA 3D printer – a technology that remained a gold standard for almost a decade, and powered three generations of Form printers.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/form1_2.png" alt="Form 1 and 2 light architecture"></figure></div>


<p>Above is the light path architecture of the Form 1 and Form 2 printers. Both used a laser plus a pair of galvanometers to direct light in a 2-D plane to cure a single layer of resin through raster scanning.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/form3.png" alt="Form 3 light architecture"></figure></div>


<p>The Form 3, introduced in 2019, pushed galvanometer technology to its limit. This used a laser and a single galvanometer to scan one axis, bounced off a curved mirror and into the resin tank, all in a self-contained module called a “light processing unit” (LPU). The second axis came from sliding the LPU along the rail, creating the possibility of parallel LPUs for higher throughput, and “unlimited” printing volume in the Y direction.</p>



<p>In the decade since Formlabs’ founding, LCD and LED technology have progressed to the point where full-frame LCD printing has become viable, with the first devices available in the range of 2015-2017. I got to play with my first LCD printer in 2019, around the time that the Form 3 was launched. The benefits of an LCD architecture were readily apparent, the biggest being build speed: an LCD printer can expose the entire build area in a single exposure, instead of having to trace a slice of the model with a single point-like laser beam. However, LCD technology still had a learning curve to climb, but manufacturers climbed it quickly, iterating rapidly and introducing new models much faster than I could keep up with.</p>



<p>Five years later and one pandemic in between, the Form 4 is being launched, with the light processing engine fully transitioned from galvanometer-and-laser to an LCD-and-LED platform. I’m not privy to the inside conversations at Formlabs about the change, but I imagine it wasn’t easy, because transitioning away from a decade of human capital investment into a technology platform can be a difficult HR challenge. The LPU was a truly innovative piece of technology, but apparently it couldn’t match the speed and cost of parallel light processing with an LCD. However, I do imagine that the LPU is still indispensable for high-intensity 3D printing technologies such as Selective Laser Sintering (SLS).</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/form4_arch.png" alt="Form 4 light architecture"></figure></div>


<p>Above is the architecture of the Form 4 – “look, ma, no moving parts!” – an entirely solid state design, capable of processing an entire layer of resin in a single go.</p>



<p>I’m definitely no expert in 3D printing technology – my primary exposure is through doing these teardowns – but from a first-principles perspective I can see many facial challenges around using LCDs as a light modulator for UV, such as reliability, uniformity, and build volume.</p>



<p>As their name implies, LCDs (liquid crystal displays) are built around cells filled with liquid crystal. Liquid crystals are organic molecules; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Cyano-4%27-pentylbiphenyl">5CB</a> is a textbook example of an LC compound.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/5cb.png" alt="5CB molecule, from Wikipedia"></figure></div>


<p>Above is the structure of 5CB, snagged from its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Cyano-4%27-pentylbiphenyl">Wikipedia page</a>; a few other LC molecules I looked up share a similar structure. I’m no organic chemist, but if you asked me “do you think a molecule like this might interact with intense ultraviolet light”, my answer is “definitely yes” – look at those aromatic rings!</p>



<p>A quick search seems to indicate that LCDs as printer elements can have a lifetime as short as a few hundred hours – which, given that the UV light is only on for a fraction of the time during a print cycle, probably translates to a few hundred prints. So, I imagine some conversations were had at Formlabs on how to either mitigate the lifetime issues or to make the machine serviceable so the LCD element can be swapped out.</p>



<p>Another challenge is the uniformity of the underlying LEDs. This challenge comes in two flavors. The first problem is that the LEDs themselves don’t project a uniform light cone – LEDs tend to have structural hot spots and artifacts from things such as bond wires that can create shadows; but diffusers and lenses incur optical losses which reduce the effective intensity of the light. The second is that the LEDs themselves have variance between devices and over time as they age, particularly high power devices that operate at elevated temperatures. This can be mitigated in part with smart digital controls, feedback loops, and cooling. This is helped by the fact that the light source is not on 100% of the time – in tests of the Form 4 it seems to be much less than 25% duty cycle, which gives ample time for heat dissipation.</p>



<p>Build volume is possibly a toss-up between galvo and LCD technologies. LCD resolutions can be made cheaply at extremely high resolutions today, so scaling up doesn’t necessarily mean coarser prints. However, you have to light up an even bigger area, and if your average build only uses a small fraction of the available volume, you’re wasting a lot of energy. On the other hand, with the Form 3’s LPU, energy efficiency scales with the volume of the part being printed: you only illuminate what you need to cure. And, the Form 3 can theoretically print an extremely wide build volume because the size in one dimension is limited only by the length of the rail for the LPU to sweep. One could conceivably 3D print the hood of a car with an LPU and a sufficiently wide resin tank! However, in practice, most 3D prints focus on smaller volumes – perhaps due to the circular reasoning of people simply don’t make 3D models for build volumes that aren’t available in volume production.</p>



<p>Despite the above challenges, Formlabs’ transition to LCD technology comes with the reward of greatly improved printing times. Prints that would have run overnight on the Form 3 now finish in just over an hour on the Form 4. Again, I’m not an expert in 3D printers so I don’t know how that speed compares against the state of the art today. Searching around a bit, there are some speed-focused printers that advertise some incredible peak build rates – but an hour and change to run the below test print is in net faster than my workflow can keep up with. At this speed, the sum of time I spend on 3D model prep plus print clean and finishing is more than the time it takes to run the print, so for a shop like mine where I’m both the engineer and the operator, it’s faster than I can keep up with.</p>

<p><strong>A Look around the Exterior of the Form 4</strong></p>



<p>Alright, let’s have a look at the printer!</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/unbox.jpg" alt="Unboxing the Form 4"></figure></div>


<p>The printer comes in a thoughtfully designed box, with ample padding and an opaque dust cover.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/dustcover.jpg" alt="Dust cover on the Form 4"></figure></div>


<p>I personally really appreciate the detail of the dust cover – as I only have the bandwidth to design a couple products a year, the device can go for months without use. This is much easier on the eyes and likely more effective at blocking stray light than the black plastic trash bags I use to cover my printers.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/first-impression.jpg" alt="First impression"></figure></div>


<p>The Form 4 builds on the design language of previous generation Form printers, with generous use of stamped aluminum, clean curves, and the iconic UV-blocking orange acrylic tank. I remember the first time I saw the orange tank and thought to myself, “that has to be really hard to manufacture…” I guess that process is now fully mature, as even the cheapest SLA printers incorporate that design touchstone.</p>



<p>A new feature that immediately leaps out to me is the camera. Apparently, this is for taking time lapses of builds. It increases the time to print (because the workpiece has to be brought up to a level for the camera to shoot, instead of just barely off the surface of the tank), but I suppose it could be useful for diagnostics or just appreciating the wonder of 3D printing. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get the feature to work with the beta software I had – it took the photos, but there’s something wrong with my Formlabs dashboard such that my Form 4 doesn’t show up there, and I can’t retrieve the time-lapse images.</p>



<p>Personally, I don’t allow any unattended, internet-connected cameras in my household – unused cameras are covered with tape, lids, or physically disabled if the former are not viable. I had to disclose the presence of the camera to my partner, which made her understandably uncomfortable. As a compromise, I re-positioned the printer so that it faces a wall, although I do have to wonder how many photos of me exist in my boxer shorts, checking in on a print late at night. At least the Form 4 is very up-front about the presence of the camera; one of the first things it does out of the box is ask you if you want to enable the camera, along with a preview of what’s in its field of view. It has an extremely wide angle lens, allowing it to capture most of the build volume in a single shot; but it also means it captures a surprisingly large portion of the room behind it as well.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/camera-enable.jpg" alt="I see you seeing me"></figure></div>


<p>Kind of a neat feature, but I think I’ll operate the Form 4 with tape over the camera unless I need to use the time-lapse feature for diagnostics. I don’t trust ‘soft switches’ for anything as potentially intrusive as a camera in my private spaces.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/back.jpg" alt="Backside of the Form 4"></figure>



<p>The backside of the Form 4 maintains a clean design, with another 3D printed access panel.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/plug.jpg" alt="Detail of service plug"></figure>



<p>Above is a detail of the service plug on the back panel – you can see the tell-tale nubs on the inner surface of 3D printing. Formlabs is walking the walk by using their own printers to fabricate parts for their shipping products.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/butt.jpg" alt="Form 4’s butt"></figure>



<p>The bottom of the printer reveals a fan and a massive heatsink underneath. This assembly keeps the light source cool during operation. The construction of the bottom side is notably lighter-duty than the Form 3. I’m guessing the all solid-state design of the Form 4 resulted in a physically lighter device with reduced mechanical stiffness requirements.</p>



<figure><a href="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/imager-top.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/imager-top_sm.jpg" alt="Imager surface"></a></figure>



<p>Inside the printer’s cover, we get our first look at the pointy end of the stick – the imager surface. Unlike its predecessors, we’re no longer staring into a cavity filled with intricate mechanical parts. Instead we’re greeted with a textured LCD panel, along with some intriguing sensors and mounting features surrounding it. A side effect of no longer having to support an open-frame design is that the optical cavity within the printer is semi-sealed, with a HEPA-filtered centrifugal fan applying positive pressure to the cavity while cooling the optics. This should improve reliability in dusty environments, or urban centers where fine soot from internal combustion engines somehow finds their way onto every optical surface.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/allen-keys.jpg" alt="A hidden toolkit"></figure>



<p>One minor detail I personally appreciate is the set of allen keys that come with the printer, hidden inside a nifty 3D printed holder. I’m a fan of products that ship with screwdrivers (or screwdriver-oids); it’s one of the feature points of the <a href="https://precursor.dev/">Precursor</a> hardware password manager that I currently market.</p>



<p>The Allen key holder is just one of many details that make the Form 4 far easier to repair than the Form 3. I recall the Form 3 being quite difficult to take apart; while it used gorgeous body panels with compound splines, the situation rapidly deteriorated from “just poking around” to “this thing is never going back together again”. The Form 4’s body panels are quite easy to remove, and more importantly, to re-install.</p>



<p><strong>A Deep Dive into the Light Path</strong></p>



<p>Pulling off the right body panel reveals the motherboard. Four screws and the panel is off – super nice experience for repair!</p>

<p>And below, a close-up of the main board (click for a larger version):</p>



<figure><a href="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/mobo-large.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/mobo-large_sm.jpg" alt="Mainboard view"></a></figure>



<p>A few things come out at me on first glance.</p>



<p>First up, the Raspberry Pi 4 compute module. From a scrappy little “$35 computer” put out by a charity originally for the educational market, Raspberry Pi has taken over the world of single board computers, socket by socket. Thanks to the financial backing it had from government grants and donations as well as tax-free status as a charity, it was able to kickstart an unusually low-margin hardware business model into a profitable and sustainable (and soon to be publicly traded!) organization with economies of scale filling its sails. It also benefits from awesome software support due to the synergy of its charitable activities fostering a cozy relationship with the open source community. Being able to purchase modules like the Raspberry Pi CM with all the hard bits like high-speed DDR memory routing, emissions certification, and a Linux distro frees staff resources in other hardware companies (like Formlabs and my own) to focus on other aspects of products.</p>



<p>The next thing that attracted my attention is the full-on HDMI cable protruding from the mainboard. My first thought was to try and plug a regular monitor into that port and see what happens – turns out that works pretty much exactly as you’d expect:</p>



<figure><a href="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/lcd-image.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/lcd-image_sm.jpg" alt="Image of a layer on a 4K monitor"></a></figure>



<p>In the image above, the white splotches correspond to the areas being cured for the print – in this case, the base material for the supports for several parts in progress.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/layer-2.png" alt="Layer as seen in Preform"></figure>



<p>Above is a view of the layer being printed, as seen in the Preform software.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/more-layers.jpg" alt="Context of the print"></figure>



<p>And above is a screenshot showing some context of the print itself.</p>



<p>The main trick is to boot the Form 4 with the original LCD plugged in (it needs to read the correct EDID from the panel to ensure it’s there, otherwise you get an error message), and then swap out the cable to an external monitor. I didn’t let the build run for too long for fear of damaging the printer, but for the couple layers I looked at there were some interesting flashes and blips. They might hint at some image processing tricks being played, but for the most part what’s being sent to the LCD is the slice of the current model to be cured.</p>



<p>I also took the LCD panel out of the printer and plugged it into my laptop and dumped its EDID. Here are the parameters that it reports:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/edid.png" alt="EDID"></figure>



<p>I was a little surprised that it’s not a 4K display, but actually, we have to remember that each “color pixel” is actually three monochrome elements – so it probably has 2520 elements vertically, and 4032 elements horizontally. While resolutions can go higher than that, there are likely trade-offs on fill-factor (portion of a pixel that is available for light transmission versus reserved for switching circuitry) that are negatively impacted by trying to push resolution unnecessarily high.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/panel-partial-remove.jpg" alt="Partially removed LCD panel"></figure>



<p>The LCD panel itself is about as easy to repair as the side body panels; just 8 accessible screws, and it’s off.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/hdmi-retainer.jpg" alt="HDMI cable retaining clip"></figure>



<p>Another minor detail I really enjoyed on the LCD panel is the 3D-printed retaining clip for the HDMI cable. I think this was probably made out of nylon on one of Formlabs’ own <a href="https://formlabs.com/asia/3d-printers/fuse-1/">SLS printers</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/lcd-assy-backside.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/lcd-assy-backside_sm.jpg" alt="Backside of LCD assembly"></a></figure>



<p>Turn the LCD panel assembly over, and we see a few interesting details. First, the entire assembly is built into a robust aluminum frame. The frame itself has a couple of heating elements bonded to it, in the form of PCBs with serpentine traces. This creates an interesting conflict in engineering requirements:</p>



<ul>
<li>The resin in the tank needs to be brought to temperature for printing</li>



<li>The LCD needs to be kept cool for reliability</li>



<li>Both need to be in intimate contact with the resin</li>
</ul>



<p>Formlabs’ solution relies on the intimate contact with the resin to preferentially pull heat out of the heating elements, while avoiding overheating of the LCD panel, as shown below.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/imager-annotated.jpg" alt="Annotated view of the imager"></figure>



<p>The key bit that’s not obvious from the photo above is that the resin tank’s lower surface is a conformal film that presses down onto the imaging assembly’s surface, allowing heat to go from the heater elements almost directly into the resin. During the resin heating phase of the print, a mixer turns the resin over continuously, ensuring that conduction is the dominant mode of heat transfer into the resin (as opposed to a still resin pool relying on natural convection and diffusion). The resin is effectively a liquid heat sink for the heater elements.</p>



<p>Of course, aluminum is an excellent conductor of heat, so to prevent heat from preferentially flowing into the LCD, gaps are milled into the aluminum panel that go along the edges of the panel, save the corners which still touch for good alignment. Although the gaps are filled with epoxy, the thermal conduction from the heating elements into the LCD panel is presumably much lower than that into the resin tank itself, thus allowing heating elements situated mere millimeters away from an LCD panel to heat the resin, without overheating the LCD.</p>



<p>One interesting and slightly puzzling aspect of the LCD is the textured film applied to the top of the LCD assembly. According to the Formlabs website, this is a “release texture” which prevents a vacuum between the film and the LCD panel, thus reducing peel forces and improving print times. The physics of print release from the tank film is not at all obvious to me, but perhaps during release phase, the angle between the film and the print in progress plays a big role in how fast the film can be peeled off. LCDs are extremely flat and I can see that without such a texture, air bubbles could be trapped between the film and the LCD; or if no air bubbles were there, there could be a significant amount of electrostatic attraction between the LCD and the film that can lead to inconsistent release patterns.</p>



<p>That being said, the texture itself creates a bunch of small lenses that should impact print quality. Presumably, this is compensated in the image processing pipeline by pre-distorting the image such that the final projected image is perfect. I tried to look for signs of such compensation in the print layers when I hooked the internal HDMI cable to an external monitor, but didn’t see it – but also, I was looking at layers that already had some crazy geometry to it, so it’s hard to say for sure.</p>



<p>The LCD driver board itself is about what you’d expect: an HDMI to flat panel converter chip, plus an EDID ROM.</p>



<figure><a href="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/lcd-driver.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/lcd-driver_sm.jpg" alt="LCD driver board"></a></figure>



<p>As a side note, an LCD panel – a thing we think of typically as the finished product that we might buy from LG, Innolux, Sharp, CPT, etc. – is an assembly built from a liquid crystal cell (LC cell) and a backlight, along with various films and a handful of driver electronics. A lot of the smaller players who sell LCD panels are integrators who buy LC cells, backlights, and electronics from other specialty vendors. The cell itself consists of the glass sheets with the transparent ITO wires and TFT transistors, filled with LC material. This is the “hard part” to make, and only a few large factories have the scale to produce them at a competitive cost. The orange thing we’re looking at in the Form 4 is more precisely described as an LC cell plus some polarizing films and a specialized texture on top. Building a custom LC cell isn’t profitable unless you have millions of units per year volume, so Formlabs had to source the LC cells from a vendor specialized in this sort of thing.</p>



<p>Hold the panel up to a neutral light source (e.g., the sun), and we can see some interesting behaviors.</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/lcd-with-polarizer.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>The video above was taken by plugging the Form 4’s LCD into my laptop and typing “THIS IS A TEST” into a word processor (so it appears as black text on a white background on my laptop screen). The text itself looks wider than on my computer screen because the Formlabs panel is probably using square pixels for each of the R, G, and B channels. For their application, there is no need for color filters; it’s just monochrome, on or off.</p>



<p>I suspect the polarizing films are UV-optimized. I’m not an expert in optics, but from the little I’ve played with it, polarizing films have a limited bandwidth – I encountered this while trying to polarize IR light for <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2024/iris-infra-red-in-situ-project-updates/">IRIS</a>. I found that common, off-the-shelf polarizing films seemed ineffective at polarizing IR light. I also suspect that the liquid crystal material within the panel itself is tailored for UV light – the contrast ratio is surprisingly low in visible light, but perhaps it’s much better in UV.</p>



<p>I’m also a bit puzzled as to why rotating the polarizer doesn’t cause light to be entirely blocked in one of the directions; instead, the contrast inverts, and at 45 degrees there’s no contrast. When I try this in front of a conventional IPS LCD panel, one direction is totally dark, the other is normal. After puzzling over it a bit, the best explanation I can come up with is that this is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS_panel">IPS panel</a>, but only one of the two polarizing films have been applied to the panel. Thus an “off” state would rotate the incoming light’s polarization, and an “on” state would still polarize the light, but a direction 90 degrees from the “off” state.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/Diagram_LCD_IPS.jpg" alt="IPS LCD, from Wikipedia"></figure></div>


<p>Above is a diagram illustrating the function of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS_panel">IPS panel from Wikipedia</a>.</p>



<p>I could see maybe there is a benefit to removing the incoming light polarizer from the LCD, because this polarizer would have to absorb, by definition, 50% of the energy of the incident unpolarized light, converting that intense incoming light into heat that could degrade the panel.</p>



<p>However, I couldn’t find any evidence of a detached polarizer anywhere in the backlight path. Perhaps someone with a bit more experience in liquid crystal panels could illuminate this mystery for me in the comments below!</p>



<p>Speaking of the backlight path – let’s return to digging into the printer!</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/diffuser.jpg" alt="Intermediate diffuser"></figure>



<p>About an inch behind the LCD is a diffuser – a clear sheet of plastic with some sort of textured film on it. In the photo above, my hand is held at roughly the exit plane of the LED array, demonstrating the diffusive properties of the optical element. My crude tests couldn’t pick up any signs of polarization in the diffuser.</p>



<p>Beneath the diffuser is the light source. The light source itself is a sandwich consisting of a lens array with another laminated diffuser texture, a baffle, an aluminum-core PCB with LED emitters, and a heat sink. The heat sink forms a boundary between the inside and outside of the printer, with the outside surface bearing a single large fan.</p>



<p>Below is a view of the light source assembly as it comes out of the printer.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/light-source-assembly.jpg" alt="Light source assembly"></figure>



<p>Below is some detail of the lens array. Note the secondary diffuser texture film applied to the flat surface of the film.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/lens-detail.jpg" alt="Detail of the lens array"></figure>



<p>Below is a view of the baffle that is immediately below the lens array.</p>



<figure><a href="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/baffle.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/baffle_sm.jpg" alt="View of the baffle"></a></figure>



<p>I was a bit baffled by the presence of the baffle – intuitively, it should reduce the amount of light getting to the resin tank – but after mating the baffle to the lens assembly, it becomes a little more clear what its function might be:</p>



<figure><a href="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/baffle-assy.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/baffle-assy_sm.jpg" alt="View of the baffle"></a></figure>



<p>Here, we can see that the baffle is barely visible in between the lens elements. It seems that the baffle’s purpose might be to simply block sidelobe emissions from the underlying dome-lensed LED elements, thus improving light uniformity at the resin tank.</p>



<p>Beneath the baffle is the LED array, as shown below.</p>



<figure><a href="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/led-board-overview.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/led-board-overview_sm.jpg" alt="LED board overview"></a></figure>



<p>And here’s a closer look at the drive electronics:</p>



<figure><a href="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/led-board-drivers.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/led-board-drivers_sm.jpg" alt="LED driver electronics"></a></figure>



<p>There’s a few interesting aspects about the drive electronics, which I call out in the detail below.</p>



<figure><a href="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/led-board-detail.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/led-board-detail_sm.jpg" alt="LED driver electronics detail"></a></figure>



<p>The board is actually two boards stacked on top of each other. The lower board is an aluminum-core PCB. If you look at the countersunk mounting hole, as highlighted by the buff-colored circle, you can see the shiny inner aluminum core reflecting light.</p>



<p>If you’re not already familiar with metal-core PCBs, my friends at <a href="https://www.kingcredie.com/Ab_index_gci_58.html">King Credie have a nice description</a>. From their site:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://www.kingcredie.com/Ab_index_gci_58.html"><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/metal_core_xs.png" alt="Cross section of a metal core PCB"></a></figure></div>


<p>The most economical (and most common) metal-core stack-up is a sheet of aluminum that has a single-layer PCB bonded to it. This doesn’t have as good thermal performance as a copper-core board with direct thermal heat pads, but for most applications it’s good enough (and much, much cheaper).</p>



<p>However, because the aluminum board is single-layer, routing is a challenge. Again, referring to the detail photo of the board above, the green circle calls out a big, fat 0-ohm jumper – you’ll see many of them in the photo, actually. Because of this topological limitation, it’s typical to see conventional PCBs soldered onto a metal-core PCB to instantiate more complicated bits of circuitry. The cyan circle calls out one of the areas where the conventional PCB is soldered down to the metal-core PCB using edge-plated castellations. This arrangement works, but can be a little bit tricky due to differences in the thermal coefficient of expansion between aluminum and FR-4, leading to long-term reliability issues after many thermal cycles. As one can see from this image, a thick blob of solder is used to connect the two boards. The malleability of solder helps to absorb CTE mismatch-induced thermal stresses.</p>



<p>The light source itself uses the <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/products/max25608.html">MAX25608B</a>, a chip capable of individually dimming up to 12 high-current LEDs in series (incidentally, I recently made a post covering the <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2024/designing-the-light-source-for-iris/">theory behind this kind of lighting topology</a> for IRIS). This is not a cheap chip, given the Maxim brand and the AEC-Q100 automotive rating (although, the automotive rating means it can operate at up to 125 °C – a great feature for a chip mounted to a heat sink!), but I can think of a couple reasons why it might be worth the cost. One is that the individual dimming control could give Formlabs the ability to measure each LED in the factory and match brightness across the array, through a per-printer unique lookup table to dim the brightest outliers. Another is that Formlabs could simply turn off LEDs that are in “dark” regions of the exposure field, thus reducing wear and tear on the LCD panel. The PreForm software could track which regions of the LCD have been used the least, and automatically place prints in those zones to wear-level the LCD. Perhaps yet another reason is that the drivers are capable of detecting and reporting LED faults, which is helpful from a long-term customer support perspective.</p>



<p>To investigate the light uniformity a bit more, I defeated the tank-close sensors with permanent magnets, and inserted a sheet of white paper in between the resin tank and the LCD to capture the light exiting the printer just before it hits the resin.</p>



<p>However, a warning: don’t try this without eye protection, as the UV light put out by the printer can quickly damage your eyes. Fortunately, I happen to have a pair of these bad boys in my lab since I somewhat routinely play with lasers:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/eye-protection.jpg" alt="Eye protection"></figure>



<p>Proper eye safety goggles will have their protection bandwidths printed on them: keep in mind that regular sunglasses may not offer sufficient protection, especially in non-visible wavelengths!</p>



<p>With the resin tank thus exposed, I was able to tell the printer to “print a cleaning sheet” (basically a single-layer, full-frame print) and capture images that are indicative of the uniformity of the backlighting:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/uniformity1.jpg" alt="Uniformity test 1"></figure>



<p>Looks pretty good overall, but with a bit of exposure tweaking on the camera, we can see some subtle non-uniformities:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/uniformity2.jpg" alt="Uniformity test 2"></figure>



<p>The image above has some bubbles in the tank from the mixer stirring the resin. I let the tank sit overnight and captured this the next day:</p>



<figure><a href="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/uniformity3.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/uniformity3_sm.jpg" alt="Uniformity test 3"></a></figure>



<p>The uniformity of the LEDs changes slightly between the two runs, which is curious. I’m not sure what causes that. I note that the “cleaning pattern” doesn’t cause the fan to run, so possibly the LEDs are uncompensated in this special mode of operation.</p>



<p>The other thing I’d re-iterate is that without manually tweaking the exposure of the camera, the exposure looks pretty uniform: I cherry-picked a couple images so that we can see something more interesting than a solid bluish rectangle.</p>



<p><strong>Other Features of Note</strong></p>



<p>I spent a bit longer than I thought I would poking at the light path, so I’ll just briefly touch on a few other features I found noteworthy in the Form 4.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/foam-seal.jpg" alt="Foam seal detail"></figure>



<p>I appreciated the new foam seal on the bottom of the case lid. This isn’t present on the Form 3. I’m not sure exactly why they introduced it, but I have noticed that there is less smell from the printer as it’s running. For a small urban office like mine, the odor of the resin is a nuisance, so this quality of life improvement is appreciated.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/hepa-filter.jpg" alt="HEPA filter"></figure>



<p>I mentioned earlier in this post the replaceable HEPA filter cartridge on the intake of a blower that creates a positive pressure inside the optics path. Above is a photo of the filter. I was a little surprised at how loose-fitting the filter is; usually for a HEPA filter to be effective, you need a pretty tight fit, otherwise, particulates just go around the filter.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/camera.jpg" alt="Camera board"></figure>



<p>The small plastic protrusion that houses the camera board (shown above) also contains the resin level sensor (shown below).</p>



<figure><a href="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/resin-level-sensor.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/resin-level-sensor_sm.jpg" alt="Resin level sensor"></a></figure>



<p>The shape of the transducer on the sensor makes me think that it uses an ultrasonic time-of-flight mechanism to detect the level of the liquid. I’m impressed at the relative simplicity of the circuit – assuming I’m correct about my guess about the sensor, it seems that the STM32F303 microcontroller is directly driving the transducer, and the sole external analog circuit is presumably an LNA (low noise amplifier) for capturing the return echo.</p>



<p>The use of the STM32 also indicates that Formlabs probably hand-rolled the DSP pipeline for the ultrasound return signal processing. I would note that I did have a problem with the printer overfilling a tank with resin once during my evaluation. This could be due to inaccuracy in the sensor, but it could also be due to the fact that I keep the printer in a pretty warm location so the resin has a lower viscosity than usual, and thus it flows more quickly into the tank than their firmware expected. It could also be due to the effect of humidity and temperature on the speed of sound itself – poking around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound">speed of sound</a> page on Wikipedia indicates that humidity can affect sound speed by 0.1-0.6%, and 20C in temperature shifts things by 3% (I could find neither a humidity nor an air temperature sensor in the region of the ultrasonic device). This seems negligible, but the distance from the sensor to the tank is about 80mm and they are filling the tank to about 5mm depth +/- 1mm (?), so they need an absolute accuracy of around 2.5%. I suspect the electronics itself are more than capable of resolving the distance, as the time of flight from the transducer and back is on the order of 500 microseconds, but the environmental effects might be an uncompensated error factor.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the problem was quickly resolved by simply pouring some of the excess resin back into the cartridge.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/load-cell.jpg" alt="Load cell underneath the resin cartridge"></figure>



<p>Speaking of which, the Form 4 inherits the Form 3’s load-cell for measuring the weight of the resin cartridge, as well as the DC motor-driven pincer for squishing the dispenser head. The image above shows the blind-mating seat of the resin cartridge, with the load cell on the right, and the dispenser motor on the left.</p>



<figure><a href="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/rfid.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/rfid_sm.jpg" alt="RFID board"></a></figure>



<p>A pair of 13.56 MHz RFID/NFC readers utilizing the TRF7970 allow the Form 4 to track consumables. One is used to read the resin cartridge, and the other is used to read the resin tank.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/form4/standby-power.jpg" alt="Standby power of 26.7 watts"></figure></div>


<p>Finally, for completeness, here’s some power numbers of the Form 4. On standby, it consumes around 27 watts – just a hair more than the Form 3. During printing, I saw the power spike as high as 250 watts, with a bit over 100 watts on average viewed at the plug; I think the UV lights alone consume over 100 watts when they are full-on!</p>



<p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>



<p>Well, that’s a wrap for this teardown. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed tearing through the machine. I’m always impressed by the thoroughness of the Formlabs engineering team. I learn a lot from every teardown, and it’s a pleasure to see the new twists they put on old motifs.</p>



<p>While I wouldn’t characterize myself as a hardcore 3D printing enthusiast, I am an occasional user for prototyping mechanical parts and designs. For me, the dramatically faster print time of the Form 4 and reduced resin odor go a long way towards reducing the barrier to running a 3D print. I look forward to using the Form 4 more as I improve and tune my <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2024/a-2-axis-multihead-light-positioner/">IRIS machine</a>!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>This is a collection of random personal experiences. So if you don't
want to read everything, feel free to skip to the end for takeaways.</p>
<p>I write because I'd like to see more high-quality meetups. And maybe
my little bit of experience will help someone out.</p>
<h3 id="2015:-philadelphia">2015: Philadelphia</h3><p>I first tried to organize a meetup in Philly in 2015. I was
contracting at the time and I figured a meetup might be a good way to
source contracts or just meet interesting people. I created the
"Philadelphia Software in Business" (or some other similarly vaguely
named) group on Meetup.com.</p>
<p>I didn't have any network; the first companies I worked for were not
in Philly. But Meetup.com got me a few tens of people joining the
group.</p>
<p>My first challenge was finding a place to meet. I didn't know what I
was doing so I looked at restaurants, bars, and cafes for dedicated
event space. Needless to say, renting space was expensive on its
own. And there was always an additional required minimum dollar spent
per attendee.</p>
<p>I ultimately found a place near the Schuylkill River. Maybe it was a
community event space. Maybe I paid for it. I can't remember.</p>
<p>The first and only time I hosted an event for the group, I got a
surprising number of people for such a vague topic. There were maybe 6
of us. I was the youngest by far (I was 20), they were middle
age. Excel users and one visionary type.</p>
<p>There was no real point to the meetup and I didn't continue doing
it.</p>
<h3 id="2016---2017:-linode">2016 - 2017: Linode</h3><p>While I was at Linode, I organized "hack nights". I didn't ask for
anyone's approval before starting it. I just said I'd be ordering
pizza for anyone interested in staying after work to hack on
Linode-related projects. I was willing to pay for the pizza, in part
because I didn't want to risk being shut down by asking. But caker
paid for it each time.</p>
<p>I was nervous because people would show up and ask for pizza and not
want to hack. It was company-provided under the aspiration of doing
Linode-related work. Maybe I mentioned this or not. I can't
remember. I'm pretty sure they got their pizza.</p>
<p>Aside from myself, developers at Linode didn't really attend. The
folks who attended were support staff or folks from the technical
writing team who wanted more experience coding.</p>
<p>I ran this for maybe 3 to 5 Wednesdays before not continuing. It was
pretty fun! But staying after work for a few hours each Wednesday lost
its charm.</p>
<h4 id="book-club">Book Club</h4><p>Another time at Linode I started a book club. I was very torn about
attempting to make the book club open to anyone in the area or just to
Linode employees.</p>
<p>I knew I'd probably get more people to attend if I made it public. But
I wasn't sure if Linode would be cool with having external folks in
the office. Before they moved to the Old City office, visitors weren't
really a thing.</p>
<p>So I made it private to Linode. And I started with the most obvious
book for your average developer: Practical Common Lisp.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure I learned one big trick by this time though. When I
announced I'd be starting the book club I said something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey folks! I'm thinking of starting a book club. A book I have in
mind to start with is Practical Common Lisp. If I get at least one
other person to join in then I'll move forward!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ended up getting two folks: one developer and one support staff
member. We held the book club for 30 minutes once a week, covering one
chapter each week. I was the only one who read anything I think, but
the other two guys faithfully showed up for discussion.</p>
<p>I didn't ask for permission to do this either. And this time we met
during company time. I think it was 2-2:30PM.</p>
<p>It was fun. We finished the book. But Practical Common Lisp probably
wasn't a good choice. And I don't think I started a second book.</p>
<h3 id="2017---2020:-false-starts">2017 - 2020: False starts</h3><p>I moved to NYC and joined a small startup (~20 employees). Linode was
100+ employees.</p>
<p>We were in a WeWork so I considered starting a book club that was
public to the WeWork. I had learned by then the law of numbers: I
probably wouldn't get anyone from my company to join.</p>
<p>I considered putting up posters around the WeWork to advertise. But in
the end, I didn't end up going through with anything.</p>
<p>I did present at a few meetups in NYC during this time. But I didn't
organize anything.</p>
<p>And then the pandemic hit and everything disappeared.</p>
<h3 id="2021---2022:-virtual">2021 - 2022: Virtual</h3><p>In 2021 I started contracting again, thinking about starting a
company. I wanted a community to be at the center.</p>
<p>So I started a <a href="https://eatonphil.com/discord.html">Discord focused on software
internals</a>.</p>
<p>I had a bit more of a network at this point so I posted about the
Discord on Twitter and got 100 likes or something and slowly started
gaining folks in the Discord.</p>
<p>I knew it was going to do better if I was pretty active in it so I
made sure to post interesting blog posts at some regular
interval. About compilers or databases or something.</p>
<p>The Discord didn't turn out to help me out much in the
starting-a-company front. Or I didn't use it effectively for that.</p>
<p>I wanted more of an independent Discord of cool people who like to
learn about systems internals. And that's what I got.</p>
<p>This turned out to be ok though because I stopped working on that
company and the Discord is still around and I still get to hang out
with cool people.</p>
<p>This Discord is still around and hit 1,700 members recently. Among
other things, it has developers from many different database companies
in it these days. They hang out and help out the noobs like me learn
about database internals.</p>
<p>I culled inactive members recently, so today the total is around
1,100.</p>
<h4 id="hacker-nights">Hacker Nights</h4><p>During the pandemic I became frustrated that all the good meetups
disappeared so I decided to start an online one that would be somewhat
tied to the Discord and be about software internals.</p>
<p>I would find 2 or 3 people to present for 10-20 minutes each on
anything to do with software internals. We'd meet once a month at 8PM
NY time I think.</p>
<p>To get speakers I'd mostly DM people who I saw do interesting things
on Twitter or Hacker News. I was lucky to have <a href="https://www.philipotoole.com/">Philip
O'Toole</a> (author of rqlite), <a href="https://sirupsen.com/">Simon
Eskildsen</a> (author of the Napkin Math blog),
<a href="https://rsms.me/">Rasmus Andersson</a>, and many other excellent folks
speak.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2t91m2Rvccpg2q2o_8lfuTYUhoP3AMwq">videos of these talks on
YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>The events were organized on Meetup.com. The group grew quickly
and I'd have about 100 people RSVP to each event. 10-20 normally
showed up.</p>
<p>I'd post a Zoom link on Meetup.com. Sometimes Meetup.com crashed right
as the meetup started, so no one could get a link. That was fun.</p>
<p>On two different nights I had Zoom bombers show up and play crazy
music or impersonate other members of the call and act weirdly (Zoom
lets you change your name after you've joined the call).</p>
<p>I learned a little bit about how to administrate a Zoom meeting.</p>
<p>I ran Hacker Nights for 5 months. It was tiring to
find speakers, tiring to deal with Zoom bombers. It was thankless and
I wasn't really enjoying it.</p>
<p>I was proud though that I was offering a channel for developers to
learn about software internals of compilers, databases, etc. And it
was great to meet many interesting speakers and attendees.</p>
<h3 id="2023:-designing-data-intensive-applications">2023: Designing Data Intensive Applications</h3><p>A month ago I put out a call on Twitter for folks in NYC interested in
reading through the book Designing Data Intensive Applications.</p>
<p>I'd read the book before and while it was challenging, I knew it was
immensely useful to any developer who works with data or an API.</p>
<p>By this time I'd learned my second trick: not asking for public
responses.</p>
<p>I said something like:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey folks! I'm thinking of starting a book club meeting in Midtown
NYC reading through Designing Data Intensive Applications. DM me if
you'd be interested! If I get 2 other interested folks this will be on!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got maybe 40 DMs and 20 of them were based in NYC. Attendence thus
would have been higher if I made the book club virtual. But virtual
events take about as much effort as in-person events and somehow feel
less rewarding. So I went through with the NYC group.</p>
<p>I'm sure I could have gotten some company to provide us space, but
this would just mean more negotation for me and tedium for everyone
involved (bring your ID to be checked in, make sure you're registered,
etc.).</p>
<p>The group would meet every 2 weeks and cover 2 chapters at a
time. We'd meet for 30 minutes. To avoid needing to find a place to
meet, we'd meet in public at Bryant Park. (There turns out to be
plenty of available seating on Fridays at 9AM in Bryant Park. When it
rains we meet online.)</p>
<p>I wanted to keep the overhead minimal and the timeline slightly
aggressive. We'd be through the book in only 3 months. No crazy
commitment.</p>
<p>We've meet twice now and are 25% done the book. Attendance has been
around 7 to 9 people each time so far, or a little less than 50%.</p>
<p>They're almost all software developers, with one manager I think, who
work for a variety of large and small tech companies.</p>
<p>I'm loving it so far. And if it continues to go well, I'll probably
continue running in-person book clubs.</p>
<p>But it would only meet a few months a year, giving me a few month
breaks from running it.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways:-the-meh">Takeaways: The meh</h3><p>Organizing any event takes effort. Meetups are especially hard because
you need to find a place to run the meetup, you probably want to
provide food, and you need to find speakers.</p>
<p>Often you can find a single place to host the meetup, but you have to
constantly search for new speakers. Even one of the greatest meetups
in NYC, Papers We Love, seems to be struggling to find speakers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu/seminar2023/">CMU Database Group</a> and the
<a href="http://charap.co/category/reading-group/">Distributed Systems Reading
Group</a> seem to have the
right idea though. They only run sessions part of the year, and they
plan out all sessions in advance (including speakers).</p>
<p>However, they are both virtual. And I'm not so interested in running
virtual events anymore.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways:-the-good">Takeaways: The good</h3><p>For one, meetups are an awesome way to meet random people and expand
your network.</p>
<p>Two, they're educational. Even beyond the content you are meeting
about, there's the discussion alongside it you wouldn't get by
yourself. And you, as organizer, get to pick the topic.</p>
<p>These work out great for me. I love to meet people, and I love to
learn.</p>
<h4 id="tricks">Tricks</h4><p>Starting something new is embarassing because you're putting yourself
out there. Maybe no one in your network shares your interests (to the
degree or in the direction you do).</p>
<p>My tricks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most importantly: keep things low key! Don't stress people
out. Before learning and networking, the point of meetups is (or should
be) fun.</li>
<li>Saying you are "thinking about X" is a lightweight way to gauge
interest. As compared to just saying you're "starting X", which gives
you less room to back out if there turns out not to be interest.</li>
<li>Asking people to DM you with interest is less embarrassing than
asking for people to respond in public. Not everyone would want to
respond in public. If there's interest in private, you can share the
interest in public later on. But if you only ask for responses in
public and there are no responses, that can feel embarassing.</li>
<li>Indicating success criteria can help people understand how big
you're thinking of. I'm normally fine with doing something as small
as only two other people, so I say that. It's kind of like how
Kickstarters work with minimum funding levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>These ideas apply to corporate planning too. I think about them when
I'm sharing some new idea in company Slack as much as when I share on
Twitter.</p>
<p>A note on attendance rates: 10-20% actual attendance versus RSVP seems
normal. If you get a higher percentage of people actually attending
versus RSVP-ing you're doing pretty well!</p>
<p>One final idea is about paying for space or paying for food. Companies
with space and money for food are often willing to partner with folks
willing to do the work to run an event.</p>
<p>Running your own event in a company's space is advertising for
them. They get to be associated with cool tech. It's a chance for them
to pitch their open positions.</p>
<p>Obviously this happens often when you start a meetup hosted by your
own company. But you can also find other companies to host space.</p>
<p>The kind of people to find to make this happen are senior
developers or engineering managers, often on Twitter and sometimes on
LinkedIn.</p>
<p>I haven't done this myself yet because I'm not ready to commit to
running a meetup. But I see it happen. And it's the approach I'd take
if I were to run a real meetup again.</p>
<p>Though now that I've got some time off there are a few talks I'd like

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell published one of the most important papers ever produced. The paper was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society and was called: “A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field.” The paper might have been the most significant occurrence in the history of physical sciences, as it described the evolution of the electromagnetic field.</p><p>Why was such a description so important? Well, for one, we live in an electromagnetic world. Virtually every force we experience in everyday life (with the exception of gravity) is electromagnetic in origin. It was from Maxwell's equations that electromagnetic waves were predicted to exist. From this mathematical formulation, Maxwell determined that the speed of propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves was the same as the speed of light, and thus showed that EM waves and visible light were really the same thing. Using the equations, we could mathematically construct and deduce the behavior of light and other electromagnetic radiation!</p><p>The importance of Maxwell’s work wasn’t obvious immediately though. For more than 20 years, his work was largely ignored by the scientific community. Why?</p><p>Well … physicists and mathematicians had a hard time understanding it. The equations in their original format amounted to 20 equations, not the 4 elegant ones we have familiarity with today. Not only that, but they were incredibly complicated and difficult to grasp. Most physicists at the time were not equipped to deal with algebraic complexity of that extent. On the other hand, mathematicians also could not grasp what they meant; Maxwell used physical language to explain them, so it was not accessible to the mathematical community at large.</p><p>These weren’t the only reasons that the theory didn’t catch on. The predominant world view at the time relied on mechanics and the universe was seen as being moved by ‘wheels and gears’ beneath the fields which Maxwell’s theory relied on.</p><p>What exactly are fields?</p><p>Well, fields can be thought of as a function acting throughout space and time. The predominant thinking at the time tried to account for such fields through mechanical structures composed of ‘wheels’ and ‘vortices’ which carried the mechanical stresses that the these fields propagated. Of course, such thinking made it difficult to grasp the beauty and meaning of the equations. Maxwell’s theory only becomes simple and elegant once we start to think of the fields (mathematical functions) as being primary and the electromagnetic stresses and mechanical forces as being a consequence of such fields, and not vice-versa.</p><p>The idea that such fields were the primary constituents of the universe did not come easily to Maxwell’s contemporaries. Fields were an abstract concept: mathematical objects which had no physical analogue. His equations were partial differential equations which weren’t accessible to simple interpretation. It wasn’t until the arrival of Oliver Heaviside, who reformulated and simplified the equations, as well as the next generation of physicists (Hertz, Lorentz, and Einstein) that the revelation came through: the universe was not built using the laws of mechanics. It was built through the laws of mathematics and the field equations.</p><p>The goal of this guide is to give an intuitive concept of what Maxwell’s equations represent, as well as capture the beauty of the physical concepts they embody.</p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><em>To see the beauty of the Maxwell theory it is necessary to move away from mechanical models and into the abstract world of fields. To see the beauty of quantum mechanics it is necessary to move away from verbal descriptions and into the abstract world of geometry. Mathematics is the language that nature speaks. The language of mathematics makes the world of Maxwell fields and the world of quantum processes equally transparent.” </em></p><p><em>- </em><span>Freeman Dyson</span></p></blockquote><p>A field can be thought of as a function working across space / time.</p><p>It’s important to note that the concept of a field cannot be broken down into something which has a material or mechanical analogy. Sometimes, physicists think of a field as the aggregate effect of exchange or virtual particles which are governed by a quantum field theory, or the effect of the curvature of space time, but it’s important to note that these exchange particles and geometries themselves can also be thought of as mathematical abstractions. We can try to think of a field as some sort of substance, but in reality, there is no substance and there’s no everyday intuition we can use to grasp them other than the basic intuition of having a mathematical function spread out throughout space and time. In other words: the mathematics are the interface, and they define exactly what we can expect from a field. How this interface is implemented is not defined and it’s not something that human beings have been able to figure out.</p><p>It’s easy to get hung up on the notion or question of asking ‘is a field real or not?’ We humans grow up in a world with objects. Our brains are used to breaking down the world into divisible parts and constructing it based on the notion of having ‘things’ which can be inspected by the senses and which are denoted by nouns. These ‘things’ furthermore have mass and volume, and they have discrete boundaries.</p><p>The Greeks were the originators of this conception. They imagined that ‘things’ were built out of smaller things, like atoms and molecules. When the atomic theory came about, they expected the atoms themselves to have some sort of mass, shape and size, and to be a microcosm of more things. Let’s take sand as an example. To the careless eye, sand seems like a fluid, since quantities of it appear to freely merge and split, but on closer inspection, it’s just a bunch of tiny objects which can be described as individual ‘things’ interacting with each other.</p><p>The world of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory introduce a different conception of what things are though. It turns out that elementary particles can’t be thought of as individual ‘things’ which have a volume. In fact, if particles did have a volume, physics wouldn’t work! We would end up with "surfaces" of electrons behaving in an impossible manner and spinning faster than the speed of light.</p><p>Well then, you say, what if particles aren’t objects with a volume, but points in space?</p><p>It turns out that this notion isn’t easily prone to interpretation either! No one actually knows or understands what a ‘point mass’ is! It also has a bizarre implication: if indeed we did have volume-less point masses, we obtain something with an infinite density! In theory, the entire universe could be squeezed to a single point!</p><p>So how can we deal with this? Well, it turns out that all the properties that you associate with ‘stuff’ are actually explainable in terms of electromagnetic fields and masses (which general relativity describes as a component of a tensor field). It turns out that the ‘object oriented’ definition of the universe can be better understood in terms of continuous fields governed by mathematics rather than individual objects or atoms with individual properties.</p><p>There are 2 primary types of fields which we’ll discuss: scalar fields and vector fields. The reality is that we could also encounter other types of fields (such as tensor or spinor fields), but we’ll leave these out of the discussion for now to focus on the ones we’ll need to understand in order to get familiar with Maxwell’s equations.</p><p>So, what is a scalar/vector field?</p><p>Well, a scalar field takes a point in space as input and outputs a single numeric value, while a vector field outputs a vector with a magnitude and direction.</p><p>Below, we’ll show a few examples of fields and illustrate what they mean.</p><p>Let’s imagine that we’re climbing a mountain. As you climb, you notice that the higher you climb, the colder the air gets. We also notice the general heuristic property: the air gets colder at a typical rate of about 3 or 4 degrees Celsius for every kilometer that we climb.</p><p>Now, let’s pretend that we’re observing a large terrain map and we want to ask: what’s the temperature of air at point (x, y, z)?</p><p><span>We can do something very difficult and attempt to create a table which maps every point in space (over the terrain) to a definite temperature, or, we can do the simple thing: we define a function which transforms each point (input) to a definite scalar output which gives us a temperature according to our heuristic rules. We’ll denote this function as T(x,y,z), and we say that our function takes an input from a 3-dimensional real space R</span><sup>3</sup><span> (the x, y, and z coordinates) and outputs values in a 1-dimensional R space (the temperature).</span></p><p><span>That’s it! We described a very simple </span><strong>scalar field</strong><span>!</span></p><p>To get a better grasp of scalar fields, or the functions which describe them, we now describe the heat equation which actually models heat flow (a vector field) using a partial differential equation, but we won’t focus on the actual flow of heat here. Instead, we’ll focus on the changing temperature field to keep things simple.</p><p>Now, going back to partial differential equations: what are they? Well, they play a vital role in physics, especially when attempting to model problems which have an extraordinary amount of complexity. In mathematical terms: we call changing entities variables, and the rate of change of one variable with respect to another is called a derivative. Equations which express relationships between variables and their derivatives are called differential equations. Solving them involves showing how the variables within the equation are related without needing the derivatives themselves. These equations can have many solutions, and the solution of interest may often be determined by its boundary conditions, which can usually be found through the data and conditions which describe our system.</p><p>We don’t have time to discuss how to obtain the solutions to differential equations at this moment. Lots of great books and resources are already available online! Here, we simply want to gain an intuitive picture of how to read them, so that we’re familiar with how they can be used to model fields.</p><p>Let’s assume that we have a metal plate, and that we know how the temperature is distributed along every point on this 2-D plate:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png" width="1456" height="789" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:789,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:726223,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>In the example above, we can see that for each positional coordinate (x, y) on our metal sheet, we have a simple mapping to a temperature.

As we move across our time dimension, our function ‘smooths’ out so that our temperature is distributed evenly across our x-space. This is what the heat equation describes! In simple terms, our graph above shows how the heat flows and how the temperature changes with time!</p><p><span>We also note that the nature of our new field equation makes things more difficult to model than what we saw in our earlier temperature example. The reason for this is due to the fact that we’re not only using the positional coordinates to model the field, but also a time coordinate as well! This is what makes our differential equation above a </span><strong>partial </strong><span>differential equation rather than an ordinary one!</span></p><p>That is, in addition to taking the

function (or field) changes, we call them partial derivatives and we thus end up with a partial differential equation for our scalar temperature field!</span></p><p>Note also: we simplified our example to ignore the temperature field values present in our y dimension! Here, we’re showing a simplification of what would happen if we isolated our system and metal strip from the rest of our sheet. We did this so that we could get a good visual intuition of how to model a very simple field. If we wanted to get a more accurate real world picture, we would need to model the real heat equation which describes our scalar field evolution in terms 4-dimensional space defined as T (x, y, z, t)! In regards to our 2-dimensional metal sheet example, we would only need to define it in terms of T (x, y, t) – but you get the point! We simplified our case to show the principle in action. A real field equation may not be so simple!</p><p>Not all fields are scalar. Let’s assume that we decide that we want to model a velocity field created by a fluid. We can’t model the motion of a fluid using single numerical values. Instead of outputting a scalar, we create a function which outputs a vector with a direction and magnitude!</p><p>That is, for each point coordinate point in 3-space (x, y, z), our function outputs the direction and magnitude of the fluid displacement at that point, and we thus get a simple vector field modeling the fluid flow:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png" width="543" height="410.0715935334873" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:981,&quot;width&quot;:1299,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:543,&quot;bytes&quot;:261631,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>A vector field doesn’t have to represent fluid flow though!

So, if we know that the arrows seem to be directed toward this point, the fluid particles tend to aggregate around it, and we say that the fluid converges there, or that it has negative divergence. Instead, if the arrows seem to be pointing away from the point, then the fluid is "thinning out", the fluid particles tend to escape from it and we say that the fluid diverges from there and has positive divergence. If the fluid seems to do neither, then we say that the divergence there is approximately zero or zero.</p><p>We can phrase this in simpler terms: let’s draw a small circle centered at the point whose divergence we want to measure. If there are more arrows going out of the circle, then we have a source point and a positive divergence. If there are more arrows pointing inwards and into the circle, then we have a sink point and a negative divergence.</p><p>In the below example, we can see one point which acts like a 'source' (fluid flows out) and thus we can see that it has a positive divergence:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

On the other hand, if the arrows point in a clockwise direction, then the curl is negative. If the fluid or field has no rotation along our circle or point, we have a curl which is either zero or close to zero.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

bottom. If we were to place an imaginary paddle wheel near it, the force generated would cause it to spin in the clockwise direction, so in the above instance, we say that the region has a negative curl.</p><p>Although it may seem that the curl function is scalar, the reality is that in 3-dimensional space, when we take the curl, we get an output vector which characterizes the rotation around that point according to a certain right hand rule. As we mentioned previously, a great analogy which we can use comes in terms of an imaginary paddle wheel. Imagine if we were to place this wheel at the point at which we want to measure the curl. If our field around this point causes the paddle wheel to turn in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, then we obviously get our curl term: the faster the paddle wheel twists or moves at the point, then the stronger the magnitude of the curl.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png" width="378" height="305.0787401574803" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:410,&quot;width&quot;:508,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:378,&quot;bytes&quot;:21715,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>In the above example, we can see a demonstration of an imaginary paddle wheel at a point which has a positive curl and is surrounded by a field which pushes our wheel in a counterclockwise direction.</p><p>Now, if we were to extend this from 2-dimensions into 3, our curl function would simply output a vector which would show us in which direction to place our wheel such that we can maximize the work done by our field. We won’t go into too many details in illustrating the 3-dimensional concept though. For now, we’re going to focus on our simplified 2-dimensional case, which associates numbers and scalars rather than vectors. This is sufficient for what we need in order to finally get a clear conception on what we came here to understand: the meaning of Maxwell’s equations!</p><p>As we already discussed, vector fields that represent fluid flow that have an immediate physical interpretation: the vector at every point in space represents a direction of motion of a fluid element, and we can construct snapshots of the motion of this fluid by drawing vector images over certain regions of space, just like we did in the previous section.</p><p>Now, for a more general vector field, such as the electromagnetic field discussed below, we do not have that immediate physical interpretation of a flow field. There is no “flow” or fluid that’s really present along the direction of those fields! However, even though the vectors in electromagnetism do not represent fluid flow, we carry over many of the terms we use to describe fluid flow. For example, we will speak of the flux of the electric field through a surface. If we were talking about fluid flow, “flux” would have a well-defined physical meaning, in that the flux would be the amount of fluid flowing across a given surface per unit time.</p><p><span>Noting this, let’s finally dive into the equations and try to interpret exactly what they mean. Below, we present the equations in </span><strong>differential form</strong><span> – that is, we present them in terms of the curl and the divergence of the vector field:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0191710b-41da-4525-940d-c10148071c4f_1220x821.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0191710b-41da-4525-940d-c10148071c4f_1220x821.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0191710b-41da-4525-940d-c10148071c4f_1220x821.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0191710b-41da-4525-940d-c10148071c4f_1220x821.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0191710b-41da-4525-940d-c10148071c4f_1220x821.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0191710b-41da-4525-940d-c10148071c4f_1220x821.png" width="1220" height="821" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0191710b-41da-4525-940d-c10148071c4f_1220x821.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:821,&quot;width&quot;:1220,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:71257,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0191710b-41da-4525-940d-c10148071c4f_1220x821.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0191710b-41da-4525-940d-c10148071c4f_1220x821.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0191710b-41da-4525-940d-c10148071c4f_1220x821.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0191710b-41da-4525-940d-c10148071c4f_1220x821.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>After showing them in this form, we’ll then go on and present the same exact equations in </span><strong>integral </strong><span>form.

our fluid flow. The idea is exactly the same, except that instead of using vectors and vector magnitudes spread through every point in space, we use flux lines flowing from a source to a destination.</p><p>Let’s show an example by drawing flux lines and showing how they relate to our earlier examples. Faraday called these field lines “lines of force” and believed that they had an existence of their own, describing them as stretching across a vacuum.</p><p>To draw a flux line, start out at any point in space and move your pen/pencil a very short distance in the direction of the local vector field. After that short distance, stop and find the new direction of the local vector field at that point. Now, begin moving again in that new direction (the direction of the arrow at the point that is). Continue this process indefinitely. By following this methodology, you can construct a line in space that is tangent to the local vector field. If we do this for different starting points, we can draw a set of field lines that give a great representation of the properties of the vector field, as illustrated below:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png" width="391" height="403.14285714285717" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:498,&quot;width&quot;:483,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:391,&quot;bytes&quot;:48123,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>So how do we use the flux lines to determine the strength of the field?

Let’s take an arbitrary area located at an arbitrary distance d from our center. We can see that when our radius r = 3d, the area which our flux lines pass through is 9 times larger than the area that it passes through when r = d. When r = 4d, our flux density expands into an area which is 16 times larger (r</span><sup>2</sup><span> = 4</span><sup>2</sup><span> = 16), so our field strength is reduced by a factor of 16!

surrounding the field and passing through any closed surface is equal to the total charge contained within the surface. The total charge always equals to the number of point charge (or charges) which the surface envelops. We also notice the inverse square law in action once again: since our surface integral is always going to equal to the enclosed charge, as we travel away from our enveloping spherical shell, our charge / flux density will get weaker by a factor of 1 / r</span><sup>2</sup><span>. We can see that in the spherical example in the image above that the total charge passing through the surface area is going to equal to q</span><sub>enc</sub><span> / the electric permittivity of free space (ε</span><sub>0</sub><span>), which is equivalent to what we have in our equation in differential form.</span></p><p><span>But what is the electric permittivity of free space (ε</span><sub>0</sub><span>) though? We haven’t had a chance to discuss this term yet! To put things simply: the electric permittivity is a constant which allows us to describe how easily (or how difficult) it is for electric fields to pass through a medium (such as air, or water, or anything else for that matter). It’s called permittivity because of how much a given substance “permits” electric field lines to pass through them. So for certain substances, our electric field lines will pass through them easily, and for other ones, they won’t. This term encapsulates this permittivity. But what does this value for </span><strong>free space </strong><span>represent? The permittivity of free space has a special value and represents a the ability of a vacuum to let electric field lines to pass through. Its value is normally expressed as 1A</span><sup>2</sup><span>s</span><sup>4</sup><span>kg</span><sup>−1</sup><span>b</span><sup>−3</sup><span>.</span></p><p>Once again, we can say that our integral form is the same exact equivalent to our differential form. Whereas our differential form expresses the concept of having a charge modeled in terms of fluid flow and convergence and divergence (and that an electric field produces a charge which diverges from positive charges and converges towards negative charges), our integral form expresses the same idea, but in terms of capturing the field flow over an enclosed surface using integration. Here, we integrate the total surface area of a closed surface by summing small surface area elements (da) and adding them together to get the total charge / flux over that area, and we note that the total electric field encapsulated by this surface area will always equal to the total charges enclosed within that area.</p><p><span>And, that’s it! We’re now equipped and ready to tackle Gauss’s law for </span><strong>magnetic</strong><span> fields!</span></p><p>Gauss’s law for magnetic fields is very simple, and simply states that the divergence of a magnetic field is always 0:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

will always be zero! This is often interpreted as “there are no magnetic analogues to charges” (called magnetic monopoles). You may then ask: so how do we get magnetic fields? How do we get permanent magnets for example, and what is their ‘source’ if these fields never really have a ‘net’ divergence?</p><p><span>Well, in order to produce the magnetic field, we don’t need sources or sinks! We can produce one through variation, or the concept we touched upon earlier: the </span><strong>curl.</strong><span> We can model our magnetic field functions in space such that when we sum all of our enclosed surface areas, we always get 0, but the net curl or ‘rotation’ generated by the field results in an asymmetry in the distribution of the vectors and thus as having ‘circulating’ field lines of force which are capable of doing work. This ‘circular’ field throughout space is what produces magnets and the magnetic field, and we think of the magnetic field as being a by-product of a moving electric field or moving electric charges.</span></p><p>We can once again go back to our original question then and ask: so what are magnets? For the most part, in most materials, the electron ‘spins’ (a term we use to describe a set of properties, one of them being its magnetic field orientation) are oriented relatively evenly / randomly, which results in a net magnetic charge which is close to 0. On the other hand, in magnets, the electrons are oriented in such a way that a large majority are aligned in one ‘direction.’ Because of this asymmetry and alignment in the orientation, or as we mentioned earlier, the atomic spins within our material, we get a resulting net magnetic field and the equivalent of a circuit. This circuit in turn produces our magnetic field and results in a magnet!!</p><p>Let’s try to visualize the magnetic field, which is drawn and demoed below:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png" width="787" height="309" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:309,&quot;width&quot;:787,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:111821,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Gauss’s law for magnetic fields essentially states that the magnetic field has a divergence of 0, and that the total resultant ‘magnetic charge’ of any magnetic field will always equal to 0.

We can think of magnetic flux going through a surface as always being a two-way street: any outward flux going out of the surface will always be balanced by an inward flux going into it! The equal amounts of outward (positive) flux and inward (negative) flux will always cancel, and we’ll always end up with a net amount of magnetic flux which equals zero.</p><p><span>As a note, although we always use the example of having an enclosed spherical surface, the above principle applies to any closed surface which we may place within a field! It could be a cube, sphere, torus: any surface which magnetic flux lines penetrate will always be balanced and will always equate to zero!! The same principle and concept applies to electric fields, except that whichever enclosed surface we choose to use, we’ll always get a net electric flux which equates to the net amount of charge present </span><strong>within</strong><span> the surface!</span></p><p>Noting the above, we’re now ready to show the meaning of our last 2 equations, which describe the complementary nature of our two fields! The equations tell us that a time-varying magnetic field produces a spatially varying electric field, and vice versa.</p><p>Faraday’s law tells us that a changing magnetic field induces an electric field:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png" width="547" height="351.59538274605103" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:529,&quot;width&quot;:823,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:547,&quot;bytes&quot;:48623,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The above equation reads: "A circulating electric field is produced by a magnetic field</span><br><span>that changes with time.

We thus have a counter-balancing electric field which is generated any time we have a change in magnetic flux!</p><p>We must note once again that although the electric field induced through Faraday’s law has the same properties as our regular electric field, the resulting structure of this circulating field definitely differs from what we’re usually used to seeing when it comes to electric fields! We noted earlier that we could always think of the electric fields as originating from a source points (which we call positive charges) and as terminating at sink points (which we call negative charges). These charge-based fields always seem to have a source and sink (and thus, a non-zero divergence at those points)! In other words, in these instances, we could think of point charges as being the originators of the electric field. Now, with our new law, it seems that we have an induced field which doesn’t have an origin!</p><p>With Faraday’s law, we have induced electric fields which have field lines that loop back on themselves, with no points of origination or termination. Our induced field therefore has a divergence of zero! So, once again, we note that the resulting electric field is simply a circulating field which loops in around itself (thus, resulting in a net curl which opposes a magnetic field)! We can picture a simple 2-dimensional circulating electric field using the diagram below:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png" width="363" height="304.2439024390244" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:378,&quot;width&quot;:451,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:363,&quot;bytes&quot;:91631,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>We note that since these changing magnetic fields are capable of inducing electric fields with closed loops, they’re also capable of driving charged particles around continuous circuits.

The magnetic field, unlike the electric field, doesn’t have any ‘sources’ or ‘sinks,’ and there are no magnetic charges which can be used to produce them. All magnetic fields are therefore circulating fields: they always loop back upon themselves. We’ve already encountered circulating loops in our Faraday’s equation, which expressed a similar concept in relation to induced electric fields and which used a curl function to express this relationship. Here, we simply use the curl as an expression for the circulating magnetic field, and the equation states that this field is induced through one of </span><strong>two</strong><span> conditions:</span></p><p><span>1. </span><strong>An electric current</strong><span>: this is the first term expressed to the right of our equation, which we denoted as </span><strong>J</strong><span> and which denotes the electric current density</span><strong>.</strong></p><p>Prior to defining density though, we need to establish what an electric current is: an electric current is simply the rate of flow of electrical charge across some defined cross-sectional area. The “rate of flow” of charge represents the charge over time (charge/time). This calculation gives you the number of coulombs that go past a point in a second within an electrical circuit.</p><p>A lot of people like to associate currents with a flow of electrons present within a wire, but we must note that this view isn’t as simple as it seems: a current isn’t just a movement of charged particles, like electrons in a wire! "Electric charge" is not a "thing". It is a property of other things, like electrons and protons. In fact, we don’t need moving charges to produce an electrical current! We could have things which act like electric currents with no physical movement involved! We don’t have time to discuss the full extent of this. For now, we simply note that a current doesn’t necessarily equate to moving electrons!</p><p>Now, imagine that we have a current flowing into the page.

How is this possible? Well, we can actually model the magnetic field as being a product of relativity and relativistic effects produced from a changing electric field!</p><p>That’s right: with the proper choice of frames, a magnetic field can always be explained as a type of electrostatic attraction or repulsion made by relativistic effects of the electric field!</p><p>Let’s suppose that we have a current flowing through a wire. We place an electron next to the wire, and pretend that it’s moving in the same direction and velocity as the electrons within our wire. Using the right hand rule, we can find the direction of the wire’s magnetic field. That is, the rule will show us that the wire will attract our moving electron.</p><p>Let’s say that we were standing still and observing this.

We can picture the electromagnetic field as pointing directly away from the charge, with no effects of contractions taking place on our charge. On the other hand, if we take a look on the right, we imagine a moving particle. Here, our reference frame shows the particle moving to the right. The effect of this movement shows that its length is contracted in the direction of movement. The effect that this has on our moving field is such that the vertical component is stronger! Taking a look at our arrow (representing the electric field), we can easily see that this effect combines to make the field lines / arrows point directly away from the current location of our charge!</p><p>Let’s show another image which shows the relativistic transformation of our field as it moves to the right of our page:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png" width="217" height="311.3478260869565" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:363,&quot;width&quot;:253,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:217,&quot;bytes&quot;:11813,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Once again, we should be able to see that the vertical component of our field is compressed and thus stronger due to length contraction!</p><p>Let’s once again go back to our original example. From the electron’s reference frame, we can see that although we have no length contraction in terms of our negative charges, we do have length contraction in terms of our positive charges which are flowing to the left of our reference frame. Since this has an effect of compressing the length of our positive ions, the electrons within the wire can no longer fully cancel out the positive ion fields, leaving the wire with a net positive charge!

In Feynman’s own words:</p><blockquote><p><em>In Table 18–1 we have all that was known of fundamental classical physics, that is, the physics that was known by 1905. Here it all is, in one table. With these equations we can understand the complete realm of classical physics.</em></p><p><em>First we have the Maxwell equations—written in both the expanded form and the short mathematical form. Then there is the conservation of charge, which is even written in parentheses, because the moment we have the complete Maxwell equations, we can deduce from them the conservation of charge. So the table is even a little redundant. Next, we have written the force law, because having all the electric and magnetic fields doesn’t tell us anything until we know what they do to charges. Knowing E and B, however, we can find the force on an object with the charge q moving with velocity v. Finally, having the force doesn’t tell us anything until we know what happens when a force pushes on something; we need the law of motion, which is that the force is equal to the rate of change of the momentum. (Remember? We had that in Volume I.) We even include relativity effects by writing the momentum as:</em></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png" width="181" height="34" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:34,&quot;width&quot;:181,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2345,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em>If we really want to be complete, we should add one more law—Newton’s law of gravitation—so we put that at the end.</em></p><p><em>Therefore in one small table we have all the fundamental laws of classical physics—even with room to write them out in words and with some redundancy.
