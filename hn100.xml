<p>One year ago today, I went into surgery expecting that I’d lose half my tongue to a squamous cell carcinoma recurrence. The evening before, Bess and I got legally married;<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> it was a short, but charming, crash ceremony. I say “crash ceremony” because we wanted to marry before surgery, and on afternoon of May 24 I learned a spot had opened for the next day. It was only luck—if you could call any part of this story “lucky”—that Bess and I had picked up our marriage license a few days earlier, expecting to wed sometime before the planned surgery date of June 8 or 9. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The tumor itself has only been confirmed on May 11: I got a “hot” PET scan on April 26. Mayo Phoenix initially scheduled follow-up CT scans a few weeks later to figure out what was going on, but <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hinni-michael-l-m-d/bio-20053549">Dr. Hinni</a>, the ENT surgeon at Mayo who saved my life, did not like that delay (he dislikes any delay, a trait which has likely saved my life on several occasions) and ordered them stat, so on May 1 I went in to find out whether I was likely to live or die.</p>



<p>The CT scans were ambiguous. On May 8, I went in for a fine-needle biopsy done by interventional radiology. The fine-needle biopsy was also ambiguous. On May 9, I went in for a core biopsy, which found no cancer. I celebrated and told friends and family I was in the clear. I don’t remember if it was that day or the next that Tony Mendez, Dr. Hinni’s PA, called to say they weren’t convinced by the biopsy, and that, if I was up for it, Dr. Hinni would do a surgical biopsy on May 11. Dr. Hinni didn’t trust the biopsy results and didn’t like the ambiguity in the scans. His favorite radiologist—he said something like “she doesn’t miss”—couldn’t tell whether the images showed cancer or something else.</p>



<p>Yeah, I was up for it. The surgical biopsy removed all ambiguity: cancer. But the soonest a hemi-glossectomy could be scheduled was June 8 or 9. Throughout May, my conditioned worsened: headaches that were noticeable at the beginning of the month required oxycodone by the middle. The month-long gap between May 11 and June 8 seemed cavernous. Bess and I lurched into action to try and figure out what to do, because the only Mayo head and neck oncologist, a guy named Panayiotis Savvides, happened to be on vacation in Greece. We couldn’t get ahold of him, and Mayo, peculiarly, had no backup coverage. What happens to people who get sick while the head and neck oncologist is out of town? Eventually his PA tracked him down and got a prescription for an immunotherapy called pembrolizumab (Keytruda) to start on May 19.</p>



<p>But was that enough? We didn’t know and couldn’t ask about the rationale. Bess did some drive-by consultation from docs she knew online, some of whom recommended we look into chemo. We were lucky enough to meet with an oncologist named <a href="https://doctors.bannerhealth.com/provider/Fade+Mahmoud/673131">Dr. Mahmoud</a> at Banner-MD Anderson on May 18 or 19. He had a sense of urgency appropriate to cancer: he said that he’d admit me through the emergency room to start chemo and Keytruda right away, to possibly slow the tumor. The surgeons at Banner didn’t think clean margins were possible given the extent of the tumor, without first shrinking it. But Dr. Hinni thought clean margins were attainable, and chemo would delay surgery by weeks, possibly months, because of its effects on wound healing. If chemo didn’t work, the window for a possible cure would be closed. Would Keytruda have any effects on surgery? Dr. Hinni said no. The question of chemo first versus chemo later became moot as my condition worsened rapidly.</p>



<p>I wound up getting a Keytruda infusion on Monday, May 22. In my calendar, there is a “post-operative visit” on that day as well, so I must’ve seen Tony and/or Dr. Hinni. I was doing terribly, and one or both of them must’ve seen my deteriorating condition and deduced the obvious. The next day was my brother and sister’s birthday, which has no immediate bearing on this story, except to say that cancer has a way of ruining all sorts of things for both the patient and the people who love them. On May 24, Tony called: would I be up for hemi-glossectomy (removing half the tongue) on May 25? Dr. Hinni was leaving for vacation either that night or the next day (I think the next day).</p>



<p>When Tony asked, I felt a bizarre lurch in consciousness. But I said yes. What other answer was there? It must have taken an epic feat of coordination to make the surgery happen, because it required not only a full day from Dr. Hinni and Tony and many others, but another ENT named Dr. Nagle, who would form a “flap” of muscle out of tissue from my leg, to replace the lost half of my tongue. Two surgeons would be working on me, one up top, as it were, and the second down below.</p>



<p>I texted Bess, who was at work, right away, then family, then friends. My brother and sister drove out from L.A. My mom flew. Bess accelerated a plan to get blood drawn before the surgery and sent to a company called <a href="https://www.natera.com/">Natera</a>; they make tests that monitor circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). A Natera test can find cancer cells in the blood before a tumor is visible to imaging. We planned to monitor ctDNA to guide decisions around, for example, post-operative chemotherapy, which we’d planned to initiate in the hopes that it would kill off any microscopic errant tumor cells left behind.</p>



<p>May 24 turned into a complicated, hectic day. I don’t remember most of it. Whatever feelings I had, I stuffed down, because feelings are often not helpful in the face of difficult tasks that nonetheless must be completed. Picking up that marriage license a few days prior suddenly seemed fortuitous. In Arizona, it’s possible for anyone to become ordained to conduct marriages online, so Bess sent a text to our friend Smetana, asking if she’d like to do the honors, a role which she immediately and enthusiastically said yes to.<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>



<p>The night of May 24, I got dinner from <a href="http://www.fnbrestaurant.com/">FnB</a>, a restaurant down the street and one that we call “New-York good”—most restaurants in Arizona are not great, and one that would be worth eating at even in New York is special. FnB was a good choice for a last meal, even though I didn’t know it was my last meal and was also too sick to fully enjoy it. After, Smetana and her boyfriend Cody came over for a wedding ceremony in the dark. We stood in the courtyard of our apartment building next to the pool, in a corner under some fairy lights the apartment directly above us had hung off their balcony. Smetana wrote the ceremony with the aid of ChatGPT, and Bess <a href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/forever-is-short-long-time">wore her emergency wedding dress</a>, which I think she’s had since she was a teenager. Make of that what you will.</p>



<p>It wasn’t what we’d planned. We admittedly planned nothing. Who can, in the face of a fast-moving, aggressive cancer that upends plans like Godzilla upends cities? But if we had, I had a feeling it wouldn’t be what happened. Cancer has a way of crashing the party. Thus, our “crash” wedding.</p>



<p>There wasn’t much of an immediate celebration. I fell asleep early: exhaustion, oxycodone, and a day full of tension will do that. I don’t know how much Bess slept, since she’s prone to insomnia when stressed. The next morning I got up early and saw, briefly, my brother and sister, who much later told me that I looked like shit, or a walking corpse, or both—I don’t think either had realized how bad I’d gotten. I’m not sure I realized how bad I’d gotten. Bess and I drove to Mayo and checked in. I don’t remember the exact sequence of events, except that there was, of course, some kind of problem with the lab order for the Natera blood sample and Bess had to last-minute wrangle the test for me (it had to be done pre-op or not at all) with the help of an oncologist named Kat Price at Mayo Rochester, and her own sweet-talking of the lab techs. What I mostly remember is the fear I kept in check, and Bess waiting in the pre-op area with me, but eventually Bess having to depart and anesthesiology putting me under.</p>



<p>The old me died on the table. The new me is still being born, and may not wholly be born.</p>



<p>When I woke up sufficiently to form memories that night, I knew quickly that something was wrong. I couldn’t think properly, but I had a sense that things were not well. Early on, someone—a nurse, I assume—told me not to turn my head. Someone—I think Bess, though I’m not sure—said that the hemi-glossectomy turned into a total glossectomy. The tumor had spread too far, too fast, and had taken out both major blood vessels in the tongue, so the whole tongue had to come out. However bad that night was, many worse days followed. In some ways, the horror of that period is still with me. By July 21, less than two months later, another <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/22/i-am-dying-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-and-the-treatments-that-might-save-me-are-just-out-of-reach/">six to eight tumors had grown</a>. If I’d known how things would shake out, I likely would’ve pivoted to chemo and <a href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/please-be-dying-but-not-too-quickly">clinical trials</a> the moment the surgical biopsy came back. But I didn’t and couldn’t.</p>



<p>I can’t believe it’s been a calendar year, and not, say, fifteen. I’ve lived a lot of darkness. I feel like I’m only now, after a whole year, reaching towards recovery from the surgery, the chemo, the clinical-trial drugs, although the trial drug I’m currently on <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2024/05/09/the-recent-war-between-cancer-and-cancer-treatment-side-effects/">causes GI and nausea side effects</a>—and they appear to be worse for me than for most recipients. The exhaustion that comes with surgery is underrated and under-discussed. There are still moments when I forget what life is for me: the other day I looked at some of the first Rainer cherries of the summer, and wanted to buy them, then remembered I’d have to blend them, which defeats a lot of the point, and I almost cried in the grocery store.</p>



<p>The likelihood of me living to see another anniversary is low—probably under 20%—but not 0%. I know I’m supposed to feel joy and gratitude at still being corporeal, and sometimes I do, but often I don’t (though I am grateful to everyone who has helped me, and that includes <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-fight-against-cancer-with-jake-s">thousands of people</a>, ranging from strangers who donated $5 on Go Fund Me to oncologists who oversee clinical trials). Sadness dogs me. The struggles remain acute. I’m typing this at my desk, and in front of me is a cup on a bed of tissues in which I have to routinely spit. I don’t know exactly how many times a day I have to spit daily—dozens? more than a hundred?—but it’s a lot. And that’ll be how every day will be until the last. Yet I am working on finding meaningful, generative ways to live. Without those, what is there?</p>



<p><em>If you’ve gotten this far, </em><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-fight-against-cancer-with-jake-s"><em>consider the Go Fund Me</em></a><em> that’s funding ongoing care.</em></p>

<h3>May 26 2024</h3>

<p>This is a follow-up to my blog post <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/5/3.html">Updating from macOS Ventura to Sonoma silently enables iCloud Keychain</a>. In the addendum to that blog post, I discussed a workaround, which was to delete my WiFi password right before rebooting into the updater. In a trial run on my M1 Mac mini, the workaround was successful.</p>
<blockquote>Thankfully, iCloud Keychain remained disabled after I connected to WiFi again, and even after I rebooted, so this seems like a permanent solution!</blockquote>
<p>The success of the trial run gave me the confidence to update my main development machine, an M1 MacBook Pro, from Ventura to Sonoma. Unfortunately, for unknown reasons, I experienced a different result the second time. As before, the workaround did successfully prevent Sonoma from connecting to my WiFi network. And as before, I confirmed in System Settings that iCloud Keychain was still disabled after the Sonoma update. However, after I finally connected to my WiFi network again, I discovered to my horror that Sonoma <em>did</em> then silently enable iCloud Keychain. My workaround was ultimately futile.</p>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/5/4-images/1.png" width="582" height="391" alt="iCloud Passwords &amp; Keychain: Sync this Mac"></p>
<p>By the way, toggling off "Sync this Mac" caused System Settings to hang and eventually crash the preference pane, which also happened in one of my earlier trial runs. Has anybody inside Apple ever tested this scenario?</p>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/5/4-images/2.png" width="372" height="330" alt="Settings Error: Extension process Apple ID exited."></p>
<p>On my Mac mini already running Sonoma, I saw a new warning in System Settings, "Some iCloud Data Isn't Syncing".</p>
<blockquote>Your end-to-end encrypted data stored in iCloud can't be accessed on this device. It includes saved passwords and data from Health and Maps. Verify your account information to resume syncing.</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/5/4-images/3.png" width="369" height="104" alt="Some iCloud Data Isn't Syncing"></p>
<p>(It should be noted that I don't use Health or Apple Maps.)</p>
<p>Clicking the Resume Data Sync button made the warning go away and didn't enable iCloud Keychain on the Mac mini, but I don't know why I was getting the warning in the first place. I didn't see the same warning on my iPad, also signed into iCloud.</p>
<p>Another bit of Sonoma bugginess I experienced was a zombie keychain that could not be removed from the Keychain Access app.</p>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/5/4-images/4.png" width="455" height="347" alt="System Keychains: Ventura"></p>
<p>What happened was that after I noticed iCloud Keychain had been silently enabled on my MacBook Pro, I copied my login (non-system) keychain from one of my Ventura backups (of course I made redundant backups before updating to Sonoma), renamed it to "Ventura", and imported it into Keychain Access for the purpose of comparing the old and new login keychains, checking for data loss or other issues. Fortunately, I found no issues, so I deleted the imported Ventura keychain from Keychain Access. Nonetheless, the next time I launched Keychain Access, I found the above zombie keychain, misplaced under System Keychains, with all menu items disabled.</p>
<p>I was able to solve this problem by once again copying the old keychain file from backup and putting it in the same place on disk as before. Then the next time I launched Keychain Access, the Ventura keychain appeared enabled under the correct category of Custom Keychains instead of System Keychains, and on the second try I was able to delete the keychain permanently. But wow, none of my experience here inspires confidence in Apple's software quality, especially with regard to "security".</p>
<p>An unpleasant side effect of updating to Sonoma—as if there weren't enough unpleasant side effects already—is that logging into <a href="https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/">App Store Connect</a> now offers passkeys as the default rather than passwords, despite the fact that I don't have any passkeys saved and indeed cannot save any passkeys with iCloud Keychain disabled. So now there are extra steps to login, and Apple makes you login again every time Safari is relaunched, because as I've blogged about multiple times, <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/crappstoreconnect4.html">App Store Connect is the worst web site ever made</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/5/4-images/5.png" width="485" height="354" alt="App Store Connect: Passkey for this website"></p>
<p>I'm currently working on a solution to this problem. I have noticed that the passkey option goes away if I spoof the browser User-Agent as Chrome.</p>
<p>You (a Borg) might ask, why don't I just "go with the flow", adopt iCloud Keychain and passkeys? (Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated.) On principle, I should not have to upload my data to Apple if I don't want. Apple advertises itself as the "privacy" company, but uploading user data to Apple's servers without notice or consent is a gross violation of privacy. I've always managed my data myself, taking personal responsibility for protecting it and backing it up. I don't want or need Apple to insert itself into this process as a remote nanny. Paternalism makes my blood boil.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if I wanted to use iCloud Keychain, why in the world should I trust the sync system to work correctly when faced with Apple's demonstrably poor software quality? Something else I noticed after updating to Sonoma: although I've tried many times in the past to extinguish it, the text replacement <code>omw</code> has once again returned, almost like a cicada.</p>

<p>The outermost layer is peeled off. The reinforcement is broken.</p>
<p>For the first time in public, NRK can reveal what the Svalbard cable looked like after it was damaged on the night of 7 January 2022.</p>

<!-- // Reference Autonomous -->

<p>The tear enabled seawater to come into contact with a copper layer carrying electrical current in one of the two cables that together make up the Svalbard fiber. The current is used to amplify the fibre optic signals that flow through the 1300km long cables between the peninsula and the Norwegian mainland. Because of the breakage, the current went straight to ground, and the cable stopped working.</p>
<p>It has not been previously established <em>how</em> the cable was damaged. Now, the photos might provide some clues.</p>
<p>Initially, the police stated that they believed the damages were caused by human activity. Later on, the investigation was dropped, due to lack of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>The unique photos from the police investigation are now published for the first time.</strong></p>

<p>Several experts with extensive experience with submarine cables and installations have assessed the images for NRK. Their judgement is that the damage to the Svalbard fiber was due to the cables being crushed.</p>
<p>One of them is a manager in one of the larger companies in Norway that owns and operates communication cables on the seabed. He does not want to be identified, out of concern for the safety of his company's seabed cables.</p>
<p>«It looks like there is damage to the outer jacket of the cable. This can happen if an anchor or a trawl is dragged across it. What does not seem to be present in the pictures, is a clear break or sharp deformation of the reinforcement around the cable, which could happen if you get stuck on a cable with a trawl or an anchor».</p>
<p>Over the years, he has seen a number of cable incidents. He says it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the damage based on photos alone, but notes that there are no signs of it having been hooked by a dragged anchor, for instance.</p>

<p>«By that reasoning, one might say that the pictures show damage after scraping or pinching by an object that has passed over or along the cable. This could typically be a trawl door or something that is towed along the sea floor.»</p>
<p><strong>Police prosecutor Ronny Jørgensen confirms that the police's technical report also identifies «pinching damage» as a possible cause of the malfunction.</strong></p>

<h2>Heavy trawling in the area when the cable damage occured</h2>
<p>Periodically, there is significant rawling activity in the area where the cable was damaged. If a vessel happens to trawl across a section of the cable that is not sufficiently buried, it is conceivable that the <span data-content="<p>These are steel constructions that keep the trawl sack open. They regularly dig into the sea bed, because of their weight and how they are designed.</p> " data-term="trawl doors">trawl doors</span>, which weigh several tons, could pinch the cable against rocks or hard seabed.</p>
<p>The Svalbard fibre is buried deep into the bottom sediments, ideally up to two meters. However, if the seabed is too hard, it may lie much more shallow, potentially at risk from bottom trawl activity.</p>
<p>NRK has previously reported how <a href="https://www.nrk.no/nordland/xl/russiske-tralere-krysset-kabler-i-vesteralen-og-svalbard-for-brudd-1.16007084">a Russian trawler crossed the Svalbad cable more than 140 times</a>, and more than a dozen times before the damage occurred in January 2022. The shipowners have denied having anything to do with the damage.</p>
<p>The police questioned the crew was questioned by the police, and used underwater drones to film the seabed in the surrounding area. A recording shared with NRK shows deep tracks on the seabed that might originate from a trawler door.</p>

<h2>The vulnerability of seabed cables</h2>
<p>The critically important cable that connects Svalbard to the mainland is no thicker than a pinkie finger. A steel wire reinforcement is spun around it for protection. The outermost layer is a nylon yarn inserted with tar.</p>
<p>Cable damages occur many times each year, across the globe. This fiber link is one of many subsea cables worldwide that are crucial in their role to connect the world, but at the same time highly vulnerable.</p>
<p>Where it might be possible to re-route traffic to another cable in well-connected parts of the underwater world, the incident outside in the remote Arctic peninsula revealed the fragility of the cable.</p>
<p>It is critical for Svalbard's communication with the mainland, and a particularly important part of the Norwegian space infrastructure. The cable is also critical for Norway's international obligations, according to the Office of the Auditor General.</p>

<p>The damage to this cable is also one of the first well known incident in recent years where experts are drawing a possible connection to Russian hybrid warfare at sea.</p>
<h2>Compared to other cable damages</h2>
<p>Since that January night in February 2022, several other cable incidents have received significant international attention.</p>
<p>On October 8, 2023, both a communication cable and a gas pipeline running between Finland and Estonia were torn off.</p>

<p>The cable break was investigated by Estonian authorities. They have concluded that the cable was torn off by a dragging anchor.</p>
<p>«According to the main investigative version, the damage to the communications cables is connected to the vessel Newnew Polar Bear belonging to a Chinese company,» writes state attorney Triinu Olev in a statement to Estonian ERR and NRK.</p>
<p>He writes that a joint Estonian and Finnish investigation has been investigating whether the damage was an accident or an intentional act. NewNew Polar Bear is currently in China. The same vessel has also been linked to similar cable breaks between Estonia and Sweden, and between the Russian cities of St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad.</p>
<p>«We submitted a legal aid request to the Chinese authorities to gather evidence from the vessel and its crew. They have not provided a response as of yet,» he writes.</p>
<p>Many damages to cables also occur without it becoming known to the general public.</p>
<p>NRK has been in contact with several people involved with laying or repairing sea cables, in order to understand how the damage might occur.</p>
<p>An owner of a large cable company, who does not want attention that can identify the damage or damage sites, says that fishing is the biggest cause of their cable problems.</p>

<p>This is another instance of cable damage, occurring in 2017 and involving a Norwegian company. Experts consulted by NRK suggest that it is likely a trawl dragged the cable, causing damage to the outer layer, the armoring, and the inner tube where the actual fibers are located.</p>

<p>«The typical damage we see on our marine fiber cables, is mechanical stress due to hooks from fishing. This probably accounts for more than 80 per cent of all damages we have seen. Not all damages have been possible to determine, but damage from bottom trawling and scallop fishing are the most common,» the technical director writes to NRK.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the external damage to cables can be divided into three categories, explains Alaisdair Wilkie, chairman of the ACMA. The first is the influence of an external third party, such as anchors, trawls et cetera. The second category is natural impact, such as an earthquake, volcanic eruption or a tsunami. The third is wear and tear, or failure of the equipment itself.</p>

<p>«Anchor damage is very similar to trawl damage and it is really only the circumstances that tell us whether it was one or the other», writes Wilkie in an e-mail to NRK.</p>
<p>Most often, it is hard to tell if cables have been damaged by intention. An example to the contrary is from 2021, when a research cable outside Vesterålen bore clear signs of being cut.

<p>Executive Director Rune Jensen of Space Norway says the damage to the Svalbard cable shows how vulnerable fiber connections on the seabed are.</p>
<p>«There has been given greater attention to underwater infrastructure, in particular after the events that have taken place in our neighbouring regions. The Svalbard cable is also part of that picture. Not only in Norway, but also in Europe and on several other continents.»</p>

<p dir="auto">Open your <code>~/Downloads</code> directory. Or your Desktop. It's probably a mess...</p>

<p dir="auto">LlamaFS is a self-organizing file manager. It automatically renames and organizes your files based on their contents and well-known conventions (e.g., time). It supports many kinds of file, and even images (through Moondream) and audio (through Whisper).</p>
<p dir="auto">LlamaFS runs in two "modes" - as a batch job (batch mode), and an interactive daemon (watch mode).</p>
<p dir="auto">In batch mode, you</p>
<p dir="auto">In watch mode, LlamaFS starts a daemon that watches your directory. It intercepts all filesystem operations, updates i and uses your most recent edits in context to proactively learn and how, so you don't
learns predict how you rename file. e.g. if you create a folder for 2023 tax documents, and start moving 1-3 file in it, LlamaFS will automatically creates, and move the right!</p>
<p dir="auto">Uhh... Sending all my personal files to an API provider?! No thank you!</p>
<p dir="auto">it has a toggle for "incognito mode", allowing you route every request through Ollama instead of Groq. Since they use the same Llama 3 model, the perform identically.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How we built it</h2><a id="user-content-how-we-built-it" aria-label="Permalink: How we built it" href="#how-we-built-it"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We built LlamaFS on a Python backend, leveraging the Llama3 model through Groq for file content summarization and tree structuring. For local processing, we integrated Ollama running the same model to ensure privacy in incognito mode. The frontend is crafted with Electron, providing a sleek, user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the suggested file structures before finalizing changes.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>It's extremely fast!</strong> (for LLM standards)! Most file ops are processed in &lt;500ms in watch mode. This is because of our smart caching, that selectively rewrites sections of the index based on the minimum nessecary filesystem diff. And of course, Groq's super fast inference API. 😉</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>It's immediately useful</strong> - It's very low friction to use, and a problem almost everyone has. We started using it ourselves on this project (very Meta)</p>

The term "Internet" literally means "between networks." It operates as a packet-switched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mesh network</a>  with best-effort delivery, meaning there are no guarantees on whether a packet will be delivered or how long it will take. The reason why the internet appears to operate so smoothly (at least from a technical perspective) is the layers of abstraction that handle retries, ordering, deduplication, security and so many other things behind the scenes. Letting us developers just focus on the application layer (aka. Writing HTTP requests from San Francisco for $300K/year).</p><p id="block-bcd57619f52340a6b4a3740814acdb99">Each layer provides certain functionalities, which can be fulfilled by different&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protocols</a>.

Uses ports to address processes/services.</li><li id="block-e09a25aa99564ff5a94c57feddad8591"><strong>Security Layer</strong>: Ensures secure communication by providing encryption, authentication, and data integrity. Common protocols include TLS (Transport Layer Security) and its predecessor SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). This layer protects data in transit and verifies the identity of the communicating parties.</li><li id="block-0bd8b1ee0128440bb42d46446bdfadcf"><strong>Transport Layer</strong>: Manages host-to-host communications, providing channels for application data. Includes:</li><ul><li id="block-0cab7c49029940768e83bbcf46e8b76b"><strong>UDP</strong>: Unreliable, connectionless datagram service.</li><li id="block-d782767e32af4504879f5b72770ae1e5"><strong>TCP</strong>: Reliable, connection-oriented service with flow control and connection establishment.</li></ul><li id="block-4a45ee7a4b4e409fb0ad59acfd91bd96"><strong>Internet Layer</strong>: Exchanges datagrams across network boundaries, enabling internetworking and defining IP addresses and routing. Primary protocol: Internet Protocol (IP).</li><li id="block-2ad67991731e43f38cc59fd7d9ecac4c"><strong>Link Layer</strong>: Manages local network communications without routers. Defines local network topology and interfaces for transmitting datagrams to neighboring hosts.</li></ul><p id="block-860fc5693f23441a96124c617d542a6d">Specifically pay attention to the <strong>Security Layer</strong>, as that layer is the defining difference between an <strong> </strong>HTTP request (which we just covered) and an HTTPS request (<a href="https://devonperoutky.super.site/blog-posts/intro-to-llms-for-engineers-1">~86% of the current internet</a> and growing).</p><span id="9ae044f73fbd4f999ce8add94e367939"></span><h2 id="block-9ae044f73fbd4f999ce8add94e367939">HTTPS = HTTP + Encryption</h2><p id="block-cf2642a730224c2c8095a54d53a3e341"><strong>HTTPS is HTTP with encryption and verification</strong>. While there are multiple ways of securing HTTP communication over the internet, the current implementation everyone uses is <u>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</u><strong>. </strong></p><p id="block-30d821f3a0314b38964004bdd0ad1f80">TLS is how the client and server can verify each other identities and ensure all the payloads are encrypted in a way both parties will be able to decrypt them. The <strong><u>TLS handshake process</u></strong>, specifically, determines how the client and server will exchange encryption and verification keys. Once the keys have been exchanged, the client and server will communicate using HTTP as normal, and use the keys to encrypt and verify messages. </p><p id="block-73388ade2aae4b83b815a524bf1f480c">The flow of an HTTPS is the exact same as the HTTP request we covered previously, with the addition of a Security Layer in between the Application Layer and the Transport Layer (although typically TCP is used for the TLS handshake).

Because support for insecure cipher suites has been removed from TLS 1.3, the number of possible cipher suites is vastly reduced. The client hello also includes the parameters that will be used for calculating the premaster secret. Essentially, the client is assuming that it knows the server’s preferred key exchange method (which, due to the simplified list of cipher suites, it probably does). This cuts down the overall length of the handshake — one of the important differences between TLS 1.3 handshakes and TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 handshakes.</li><li id="block-4e0c35e5fe8d48efbea3d6ba668dda9b"><strong>Server generates master secret:</strong>&nbsp;At this point, the server has received the client random and the client's parameters and cipher suites.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The best description of my problem solving process is the Feynman algorithm,
which is sometimes presented as a joke where the hidden subtext is “be smart”, but
I disagree. The “algorithm” is a surprisingly lucid description of how thinking works in the
context of hard problems where the answer can’t simply be looked up or trivially
broken down, iterated upon in a bottom-up fashion, or approached with similar methods.</p><p>Feynman’s thinking algorithm is described like this:</p><ol><li>Write down the problem</li><li>Think real hard</li><li>Write down the solution</li></ol><p>(This algorithm may or may not have actually been used by Feynman, it’s as far as I can tell
Murray Gell-Mann’s account of Feynman’s approach.)</p><p>The trick is that there is no trick. This is how thinking works.
It appears that when you feed your brain related information, without further active involvement,
it starts to digest the information you’ve fed it.</p><p>Thinking is a background process. There’s no Sherlock Holmes-style string of brilliant deductions;
the brain is a connection-making machine. If you feed it data points, it will find ways of connecting
the dots.</p><p>So to solve a problem, you start by feeding your mind the relevant information in a fairly literal sense.
It’s a direct parallel to how you’d prompt a LLM. Just bring up all the things you think are relevant.</p><p>Imagine if you were to task someone else with solving the problem, imagine what they might have use of knowing,
really go over anything you think might be useful. It’s good to write that down in the simplest way possible.
It should be very clear to you what question you are attempting to answer. What is written on paper is not the
important thing, the act of assembling the question is the work!</p><p>To answer the question, what you do next is to remove yourself from further inputs.
As long as you keep feeding your brain with more data, the queries never resolve, and
eventually the stuff you fed it first will fall out of the context window and amount to nothing.</p><p>For this reason, it’s crucial to step away from the keyboard. Go for a walk, or sit down in a quiet place,
take a shower; whatever you choose to do, just keep thinking about the problem.</p><p>As you do this, all the background processing you kicked off earlier will begin to resolve.
Not immediately, it may take a while—hours, sometimes days—but as it does you get sudden
insights into the problem domain. You may or may not immediately find a solution to the problem,
but you’ll often at least find a deeper understanding.</p><p><em>The conclusions must be written down</em>. Not only because these insights are fleeting and
can be hard to recall, it also appears to act as a sort of feedback to the brain that the
information is important, that it’s on the right track, to keep going.</p><hr><p>The perhaps most inspired period of my life was sometime in 2021, before I’d moved
in with my girlfriend. What I’d inadvertently ended up doing was to arrange my life
into something very similar to the algorithm above.</p><p>I’d grind away and work on the search engine all week, filling my brain with all manner of information
related to the work I was doing, and then I’d go visit her over the weekend, not bringing a computer.</p><p>Without exception, by the time the weekend was over, I’d have several pages worth of new ideas written
down in a notebook that I’d implement over the following week, rinse and repeat.</p><hr><p>I keep coming back to the <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/05-minds-field/">gardening metaphor of thought</a>.</p><p>What you think today is the result of what you read yesterday. If you want to have relevant,
interesting, useful thoughts; use your reading as a template. It will not only model the topics
you are thinking about, but the very thoughts themselves. It’s as much pruning gossip and
irrelevant noise as it is planting the interesting and insightful and well thought-out.</p></div></div>]]></description>

          color of element, common in the human body, common in the earth's crust,
          magnetic metals, noble metals, radioactive, and rare or never found
          in nature. It does not overload kids with a lot of detailed numbers,
          like atomic weights and valence numbers.</p>
        <p>Note: <em>Elements in Pictures</em> and <em>Elements in Words</em> are
          a set. Either may stand alone, but they work best together.</p>

        <p>This textual periodic table is packed with even more information.
          In addition to the element's name, symbol, and atomic number, each
          element box contains a textual description of the element's physical
          properties and a list of several of its human uses and/or natural occurrences.
          The table is color-coded to show the chemical groups, and each group
          is described in a panel of the same color. Other info panels describe
          atomic structure, chemical bonding, and radioactivity. It does not
          overload kids with a lot of detailed numbers, but it does provide some
          simple rules-of-thumb about atomic weights and valence numbers.</p>

        <p>Print-your-own elements cards. Use these however you want. It's fun
          to simply lay them out to make the whole periodic table. You can use
          them as flash cards to help you memorize the facts on the front and
          back of each card. If you want to play it as a game, you can invent
          your own game rules.</p>
        <p>Print double-sided on card stock. Cut out cards with paper cutter
          or scissors. Nine cards per sheet. There's a card for every element,
          with a picture on the front and words on the back. Also included are
          key cards (symbol key and color key), info cards (atom info and bonding
          info), and group info cards. The zip file also includes a template
          for making a card box. It also includes printing instructions.</p>

          <p>Note that hydrogen is unique — it may be grouped with the
            alkali metals (like lithium) because it has one electron available
            to donate, grouped with the halogens (like fluorine) because gaining
            one electron will fill its valence shell, or it may be put in a group

They suddenly contacted us and asked us to either pay them $120k up front for one year of Enterprise within 24 hours or they would take down all of our domains. While this escalated up our business we had 3 sales calls with them, trying to figure out what was happening and how to reach a reasonable contract in a week. When we told them we were also in talks with Fastly, they suddenly "purged" all our domains, causing huge downtime in our core business, sleepless nights migrating away from CF, irreparable loss in customer trust and weeks of ongoing downtime in our internal systems.</em></p><p>I'm a SysOps engineer at a fairly large online casino. We have around 4 million monthly active users. We had been happy Cloudflare customers since 2018 on the "Business" plan which has some neat features and costs $250/month for "unlimited" traffic.</p><p>Now admittedly, $250 is probably fairly low for the amount of traffic we were pushing through Cloudflare.

We do have multiple domains that </span><em>mostly</em><span> act as mirrors to our main domain. We have these for a few reasons. One is that since we are a casino, we have different regulatory requirements we need to comply with in many countries. For example, many games are only available in some countries. Some countries we block completely. Then we have a few different domains that remove certain game groups or site features - for example our social features (chat, user tipping / interaction) or our sportsbook. Another is that we use them to target different global user groups and affiliates and track conversions long-term. This also means that if a country DNS-blocks our main domain, a secondary domain may still be available. This could arguably be seen as a violation of the Cloudflare TOS, as they wrote above.</span></p><p><span>In any case, </span><strong>we receive &gt;95% of our traffic through the main domain</strong><span> that’s been unchanged since our founding, and were happy to resolve this issue in whatever way, including by removing any affected secondary domains from Cloudflare.</span></p><p>We sent them info about our domains and tried to get more information from them about the issue and who from our team we should get involved, but they refused to give us anything apart from a date for a call.</p><p><span>So we scheduled another call, now with their "Trust and Safety" team. But it turns out, </span><strong>we were actually talking to Sales again</strong><span>.</span></p><p>They said they could offer us an amazing contract for $10k per month with all kinds of great features. We tried figuring out how exactly this was related to the TOS problem and how to resolve the situation. We asked them which domains were affected by their “rotation” concerns. They didn't give us an answer. We asked which of the Enterprise features we actually had to get.</p><p><span>They would not offer us anything apart from a full deal </span><strong>for $10k per month</strong><span>, which would magically resolve the issue. They were not interested in any other resolution.</span></p><p><span>They said we had 24h to sign their contract because they had to “get back to Trust &amp; Safety". We asked to pay monthly. They said we </span><em>need</em><span> to sign a yearly commitment and pay the full year up front. It felt like extortion. Pay us $120k until tomorrow or we destroy your business.</span></p><p>After the call, they sent us this:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg" width="1280" height="856" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:856,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:153184,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Note the email implies a monthly payment might be possible.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">DiscoGrad</h2><a id="user-content-discograd" aria-label="Permalink: DiscoGrad" href="#discograd"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Trying to do gradient descent using automatic differentiation over branchy programs?
Or to combine them with neural networks for end-to-end training?
Then this might be interesting to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a popular method to obtain the gradients of computer programs, which are extremely useful for adjusting program parameters using gradient descent to solve optimization, control, and inference problems. Unfortunately, AD alone often yields unhelpful (zero-valued and/or biased) gradients for programs involving both parameter-dependent branching control flow such as if-else statements and randomness, including various types of simulations.</p>
<p dir="auto">DiscoGrad automatically transforms C++ programs to a version that efficiently calculates smoothed gradients <em>across</em> branches. Smoothing via external perturbations is supported, but is not required if the target program itself involves randomness. DiscoGrad includes several gradient estimation backends as well as the possibility to integrate neural networks via Torch. The tool supports basic C++ constructs, but is still a research prototype.</p>
<p dir="auto">The repository includes a number of sample applications from domains such as transportation, crowd management, and epidemiology.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          

            <p>In some ways, learning to program a computer is similar to learning a new language. It requires learning new symbols and terms, which must be organized correctly to instruct the computer what to do. The computer code must also be clear enough that other programmers can read and understand it.</p>



<p>In spite of those similarities, MIT neuroscientists have found that reading computer code does not activate the regions of the brain that are involved in language processing. Instead, it activates a distributed network called the multiple demand network, which is also recruited for complex cognitive tasks such as solving math problems or crossword puzzles.</p>



<p>However, although reading computer code activates the multiple demand network, it appears to rely more on different parts of the network than math or logic problems do, suggesting that coding does not precisely replicate the cognitive demands of mathematics either.</p>



<p>“Understanding computer code seems to be its own thing. It’s not the same as language, and it’s not the same as math and logic,” says Anna Ivanova, an MIT graduate student and the lead author of the study.</p>



<p>Evelina Fedorenko, the Frederick A. and Carole J. Middleton Career Development Associate Professor of Neuroscience and a member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research, is the senior author of the paper, which appears today in <em>eLife</em>. Researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Tufts University were also involved in the study.</p>



<p><strong>Language and cognition</strong></p>



<p>A major focus of Fedorenko’s research is the relationship between language and other cognitive functions. In particular, she has been studying the question of whether other functions rely on the brain’s language network, which includes Broca’s area and other regions in the left hemisphere of the brain. In previous work, her lab has shown that music and math do not appear to activate this language network.</p>



<p>“Here, we were interested in exploring the relationship between language and computer programming, partially because computer programming is such a new invention that we know that there couldn’t be any hardwired mechanisms that make us good programmers,” Ivanova says.</p>



<p>There are two schools of thought regarding how the brain learns to code, she says. One holds that in order to be good at programming, you must be good at math. The other suggests that because of the parallels between coding and language, language skills might be more relevant. To shed light on this issue, the researchers set out to study whether brain activity patterns while reading computer code would overlap with language-related brain activity.</p>



<p>The two programming languages that the researchers focused on in this study are known for their readability — Python and ScratchJr, a visual programming language designed for children age 5 and older. The subjects in the study were all young adults proficient in the language they were being tested on. While the programmers lay in a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) scanner, the researchers showed them snippets of code and asked them to predict what action the code would produce.</p>



<p>The researchers saw little to no response to code in the language regions of the brain. Instead, they found that the coding task mainly activated the so-called multiple demand network. This network, whose activity is spread throughout the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain, is typically recruited for tasks that require holding many pieces of information in mind at once, and is responsible for our ability to perform a wide variety of mental tasks.</p>



<p>“It does pretty much anything that’s cognitively challenging, that makes you think hard,” Ivanova says.</p>



<p>Previous studies have shown that math and logic problems seem to rely mainly on the multiple demand regions in the left hemisphere, while tasks that involve spatial navigation activate the right hemisphere more than the left. Working with Marina Bers, a professor of child study and human development at Tufts University, the MIT team found that reading computer code appears to activate both the left and right sides of the multiple demand network, and ScratchJr activated the right side slightly more than the left.</p>



<p><strong>Effects of experience</strong></p>



<p>The researchers say that while they didn’t identify any regions that appear to be exclusively devoted to programming, such specialized brain activity might develop in people who have much more coding experience.</p>



<p>“It’s possible that if you take people who are professional programmers, who have spent 30 or 40 years coding in a particular language, you may start seeing some specialization, or some crystallization of parts of the multiple demand system,” Fedorenko says. “In people who are familiar with coding and can efficiently do these tasks, but have had relatively limited experience, it just doesn’t seem like you see any specialization yet.”</p>



<p>In a companion paper appearing in the same issue of <em>eLife</em>, a team of researchers from Johns Hopkins University also reported that solving code problems activates the multiple demand network rather than the language regions.</p>



<p>The findings suggest there isn’t a definitive answer to whether coding should be taught as a math-based skill or a language-based skill. In part, that’s because learning to program may draw on both language and multiple demand systems, even if — once learned — programming doesn’t rely on the language regions, the researchers say.</p>



<p>“There have been claims from both camps — it has to be together with math, it has to be together with language,” Ivanova says. “But it looks like computer science educators will have to develop their own approaches for teaching code most effectively.”</p>



<p>The research was funded by the National Science Foundation, the Department of the Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, and the McGovern Institute for Brain Research.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">introduction</h2>

<p>So, you want to reduce your screentime, maybe embrace some digital minimalism, but you don’t want to go full-on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/dumbphones">dumbphone</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps, like most people, you need a smartphone to fully engage with society (like with QR menus, the bane of the dumbphone life!).</p>

<p>Fortunately, you can tweak your current iPhone to dumb it down and transform it from a dopamine-driven-slot-machine, into something a bit more tepid. It’s a great way to temper your screen time without requiring a new (dumb)phone.</p>

<p><img src="https://dumbph.com/images/turn-iphone-into-dumb-phone/hero2.png" alt="An iPhone turned into a dumb phone with a few apps and settings"> <em>Follow along with this article to dumb-down your iPhone.</em></p>

<p>This article will show you how to dumb down your iPhone, with tweaks like <a href="#minimal-homescreen-launcher">using a minimal homescreen launcher</a>, <a href="#plain-wallpapers-that-hide-your-dock">choosing a plain wallpaper that hides your dock</a>, <a href="#grayscale-only-display">enabling grayscale mode</a> and <a href="#disable-notifications">disabling notifications</a>. And of course, the final boss — <a href="#bonus-delete-your-apps">deleting your apps</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The tweaks here might make your phone less appealing, but you’ll still have access to social media, emails, the internet, etc. Dumbing down your iPhone is a great way to dip your toes into a more digitally minimal lifestyle, but it’s not a replacement for a more limited device.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope you’re excited to get started! Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="minimal-homescreen-launcher">minimal homescreen launcher</h2>

<p>The first thing I recommend is a minimal homescreen launcher — it’s a full-screen widget you place on your homescreen which displays a plain list of selected apps (which you can customize).</p>

<p>I use the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dumbify/id6480082872">Dumbify</a> launcher and it works pretty well. There are a couple of similar launchers, like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blank-spaces-app/id1570856853">Blank Spaces</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/on-point-minimal-home-screen/id6476465213">on point</a>, but both have freemium models with expensive ‘premium’ upgrades. Dumbify costs $4.99 USD upfront, but has no in-app purchases; it’s what I use and it’s great.</p>

<p><img src="https://dumbph.com/images/turn-iphone-into-dumb-phone/homescreen.png" alt="A minimal homescreen for my dumbed-down iPhone"> <em>The homescreen on my dumbed-down iPhone, using Dumbify.</em></p>

<p>These homescreen launchers all behave the same — they show a plain list of app names, rather than colorful app icons, which are (hopefully!) less engaging and less likely to distract you.</p>

<p>The freemium apps can be a good way to play around and see if this is something you want to commit to, if you’re uncertain. Just be warned that they’re much more expensive to purchase vs. buying Dumbify once their trials run out.</p>

<h2 id="plain-wallpapers-that-hide-your-dock">plain wallpapers (that hide your dock)</h2>

<p>A simple, plain wallpaper is another way to simplify your phone. This was a tough one for me! I love displaying pretty photos on my lockscreen, but I decided to go all-in on dumbing down my iPhone.</p>

<p>Dumbify includes two wallpapers you can use which match the colors of the iOS dock, and I’ve included them below. By matching with the dock, you can remove all your apps from your dock for an extremely spartan homescreen (like in my screenshot above).</p>

<p>Just tap and hold these photos to save them, crop them to fit your phone screen, and set one as your wallpaper.</p>

<p>You should also make sure to disable automatic light/dark mode, since that adjusts the color of the dock. You can do that via <code>Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Appearance/Automatic</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tip: for a completely bare homescreen, you can also turn off the little “Search” badge on your homescreen under <code>Settings &gt; Home Screen &amp; App Library &gt; Search/Show On Home Screen</code></p>

  <p>Note: I’ve also written about <a href="https://dumbph.com/iphone-different-wallpapers-light-dark-mode">using different iPhone wallpapers for light and dark mode</a>, which is the finishing-touch on a great minimal homescreen setup.</p>

<h2 id="grayscale-only-display">grayscale-only display</h2>

<p>The first two suggestions in this article were neat, but not <em>that</em> drastic. This one is!</p>

<p>Using an Accessibility setting, you can completely gray-out your iPhone’s screen, which I’ve found has made a noticeable difference to how engaging it is. Doomscrolling on Instagram or TikTok is much less appealing without all the flashy colors!</p>

<p><img src="https://dumbph.com/images/turn-iphone-into-dumb-phone/hero1.png" alt="my dumbed-down iPhone with a grayscale screen filter"> <em>My iPhone with the grayscale filter enabled.</em></p>

<p>Under <code>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Accessability Shortcuts</code>, you can enable the <code>Color Filters</code> option. By default, this will let you enable grayscale mode by triple-clicking your iPhone’s power button. It also has the handy benefit of letting you switch back to color mode with another triple-click.</p>

<p>If you’d prefer to set this directly (maybe you use the shortcut already), you can do that in <code>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display &amp; Text Size &gt; Color Filters &gt; Grayscale</code>.</p>

<h2 id="disable-notifications">disable notifications</h2>

<p>I left this one until (nearly) last since I think it’s pretty obvious.</p>

<p>Disabling (most) of my notifications was one of the best things I ever did — it’s astounding how many nuisance notifications come through on a given day. Social media pings, random promotions, spam emails — constant interruptions for irrelevant things. Disabling them was cathartic and a huge relief (not surprising, since <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/history-of-notifications/#:~:text=More%20notably%2C%20Rosen%E2%80%99s%20research%20has%20consistently%20shown%20that%20notifications%20stress%20us%20out">notifications stress us out</a>).</p>

<p>I do allow a handful of notifications through — phone calls and text messages, as well as my banking apps. Everything else though? 🙅‍♂️</p>

<p>Apple fortunately makes it straightforward to manage your notifications via <code>Settings &gt; Notifications</code> — you can customize your notification preferences per-app, and if you’re on iOS 15 or later, you can also <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/108781#:~:text=your%20notifications%20appear.-,Schedule%20a%20notification%20summary,-With%20iOS%2015">schedule a notification summary</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-delete-your-apps">bonus: delete your apps</h2>

<p>The bonus tip, the elephant in the room - your apps. <strong>You can make all the tweaks to your iPhone that you like, adjust this-and-that, but if you keep your addictive apps around, what’s the point?</strong></p>

<p>Different people find different apps addictive — social media is, of course, a huge one, but the internet (ie: your browser app) can be just as addictive, as can YouTube, Slack and more. Sometimes even <a href="https://strava.com/">Strava</a> sucks me in!</p>

<p>Whatever apps you’re addicted to, just seeing their icons on your iPhone (or being able to search for them) can act as a <a href="https://www.weber.edu/academicpeercoaching/blog/forming-habits.html#:~:text=habits%20are%20created%20by%20putting%20together%20a%20cue%2C%20a%20routine%2C%20and%20a%20reward%2C%20and%20then%20cultivating%20a%20craving%20that%20drives%20the%20loop">cue, triggering a little dopamine-driven feedback loop</a> in your brain which sends you spiralling into another doomscrolling session. As effective as little tweaks can be, sometimes the best intervention to break a bad habit is going straight for the cue (the app, in this case).</p>

<p>There’s a handful of popular techniques you can try out — from going cold-turkey and just deleting all your addictive apps, to trying out social-media-free weekends, to using the native <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iphb0c7313c9/ios">iOS screen-time feature</a> or more advanced apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/opal-screen-time-for-focus/id1497465230">Opal</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jomo-screen-time-blocker/id1609960918">Jomo</a> to regulate your usage of them.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>

<p>If you’ve read this far, all the way to the end, then thank you.</p>

<p><strong>I have a challenge for you:</strong> Implement at least one of the things I’ve covered in this article. Even just doing a little “notification audit”, where you go through your notification settings and disable them for unnecessary apps, can help you reduce interruptions. Likewise, social-media-free weekends can be a great way to cut back on addictive apps without having to completely give them up.</p>

<p>I think it’s important to note though — dumbing down your iPhone is a <em>far cry</em> from a panacea for smartphone addiction. You can turn your iPhone into a ‘dumphone’ all you like, but unless you also delete some apps, you’ll still have access to all your vices — social media, games and more (even if they’re now grayscale). Even if you’re brutal and uninstall everything, you still have the app store and browser beckoning.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that these tweaks aren’t beneficial — I think they are; I think they’re a great set of tweaks to nudge you away from overuse and mindless scrolling — but don’t expect an overnight transformation. For that, you might need to take more drastic measures.</p>

I'm going to be looked at as a shoplifter when I've never stolen'."</p><p>Facewatch later wrote to Sara and acknowledged it had made an error. </p><p>Facewatch is used in numerous stores in the UK - including Budgens, Sports Direct and Costcutter - to identify shoplifters.</p><p>The company declined to comment on Sara's case to the BBC, but did say its technology helped to prevent crime and protect frontline workers. Home Bargains, too, declined to comment.</p><p>It's not just retailers who are turning to the technology. </p><p>On a humid day in Bethnal Green, in east London, we joined the police as they positioned a modified white van on the high street. </p><p>Cameras attached to its roof captured thousands of images of people's faces. </p><p>If they matched people on a police watchlist, officers would speak to them and potentially arrest them. </p><p>Unflattering references to the technology liken the process to a supermarket checkout - where your face becomes a bar code. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On the day we were filming, the Metropolitan Police said they made six arrests with the assistance of the tech. </p><p>That included two people who breached the terms of their sexual-harm prevention orders, a man wanted for grievous bodily harm and a person wanted for the assault of a police officer. </p><p>Lindsey Chiswick, director of intelligence for the Met, told the BBC the tech's speed was extremely helpful.</p><p>"It takes less than a second for the technology to create a biometric image of a person's face, assess it against the bespoke watchlist and automatically delete it when there is no match."</p><p>The BBC spoke to several people approached by the police who confirmed that they had been correctly identified by the system - 192 arrests have been made so far this year as a result of it.</p><p>But civil liberty groups are worried that its accuracy is yet to be fully established, and point to cases such as Shaun Thompson's.</p><p>Mr Thompson, who works for youth-advocacy group Streetfathers, didn't think much of it when he walked by a white van near London Bridge in February. </p><p>Within a few seconds, though, he was approached by police and told he was a wanted man. </p><p>"That's when I got a nudge on the shoulder, saying at that time I'm wanted".</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He was asked to give fingerprints and held for 20 minutes. He says he was let go only after handing over a copy of his passport. </p><p>But it was a case of mistaken identity. </p><p>"It felt intrusive… I was treated guilty until proven innocent," he says. </p><p>The BBC understands the mistake might have been due to a family resemblance. The Metropolitan Police declined to comment.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, has filmed the police on numerous facial-recognition deployments. She was there the night Shaun Thompson was picked up by police. </p><p>"My experience, observing live facial recognition for many years, [is that] most members of the public don't really know what live facial recognition is," she says.</p><p>She says that anyone's face who is scanned is effectively part of a digital police line-up. </p><p>"If they trigger a match alert, then the police will come in, possibly detain them and question them and ask them to prove their innocence."</p><p>The use of facial recognition by the police is ramping up.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2022 the Metropolitan Police used live facial recognition nine times. The following year the figure was 23.</p><p>Already in 2024 it has been used 67 times, so the direction of travel is clear. </p><p>Champions say that misidentifications are rare. </p><p>The Metropolitan Police say that around one in every 33,000 people who walk by its cameras is misidentified. </p><p>But the error count is much higher once an someone is actually flagged. One in 40 alerts so far this year has been a false positive. </p><p>Michael Birtwhistle, head of research at the Ada Lovelace Institute research group, believes the technology is so new that the laws have not yet caught up. </p><p>"I think it absolutely is a Wild West at the moment. That's what creates this legal uncertainty as to whether current uses are unlawful or not," he says. </p><p>In Bethnal Green, although some people the BBC spoke to were worried about the use of the tech, a majority were supportive - if it helped to tackle crime. </p><p>That leads to another question about the technology: will it help in the long run? </p><p>As people get more used to seeing white vans parked on busy high streets, will people who know they are wanted by police simply get wise to the cameras and avoid them? Will shoplifters hide their faces? </p><p>Ms Carlo says society needs to guard against facial recognition becoming normalised.</p><p>"Once the police can say this is OK, this is something that we can do routinely, why not put it into the fixed-camera networks?"</p><p>This is the dystopian future that civil-liberty campaigners are most afraid of - a China-style mass-surveillance state. </p><p>Advocates dismiss such dire predictions as overblown.</p><p>And it is also clear there are plenty among the public who are willing to put up with having their faces scanned - if it means safer streets. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In 2022, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War">Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine</a>, waging a genocidal war against my country. Ukraine is being hit by all types of weapons (except nuclear) daily. Home Assistant helps me stay safe and notifies me about incoming threats.</p>
<p>We hear the siren a few times a day. Life would completely stop if we went to the shelter every time the siren goes off. So, people adapt.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, we tend to differentiate the levels of danger. When the siren goes off, practically everyone starts checking their phones: "What is going on?"</p>
<p>We have <a href="https://alerts.in.ua/">various applications</a> and <a href="https://t.me/s/war_monitor">Telegram channels</a> for monitoring the type of danger, missile paths, and understanding whether we are in direct danger or can continue with our lives for another minute.</p>
<p>This is what war in the 21st century looks like: you can practically monitor a missile or a drone that is trying to kill you right from your phone. This is like a Black Mirror episode in real life. 😅</p>
<p>There are different kinds of air alarms with varying levels of danger:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MiG-31K take off</strong> – This can happen multiple times during the day. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan_MiG-31">MiG-31K</a> can carry a very dangerous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh-47M2_Kinzhal">Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic missile</a>. Although it happens rarely, you can't predict when the missile is attached and when it is not, so most people tolerate this level of danger.</li>
<li><strong>Suicide drones attack</strong> – Usually carried out by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HESA_Shahed_136">Iranian Shahed 136 drones</a>. Most of them get shot down, but they are still dangerous and scary. We call them "mopeds" or "lawn-mowers" because of the sound of their engine.</li>
<li><strong>Ballistic missile attack</strong> – This can happen multiple times a day. Ballistic missiles, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K720_Iskander">9K720 Iskander</a>, are extremely fast (2 km/s). You have only up to 10 minutes to hide somewhere. Usually, the fastest way is to hide behind two walls (corridor or a bathroom).</li>
<li><strong>Cruise missile attack</strong> – Cruise missiles, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalibr_(missile_family)">Kalibr</a>, are relatively slow and fly like a plane. Nevertheless, they can fly a long distance and easily reach any point in the country.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the most dangerous type of attack is a combined one. This means all of the above are raining down on Ukrainian cities simultaneously. These usually happen overnight at 4:00 in the morning. The drones and cruise missiles are used to exhaust air defenses, followed by ballistic and/or hypersonic strikes.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring-air-alerts">Monitoring Air Alerts<a href="#monitoring-air-alerts" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Home Assistant has a built-in <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ukraine_alarm/">Ukraine Alarm</a> integration. It monitors the nation-wide system of air alarms and toggles safety sensors in HA.</p>
<p>When there is any type of danger, I send a critical notification and announce the message on my smart speakers.</p>
<p>Of course, the air siren goes off on the streets, roaring across the city, so everyone hears the danger is approaching. But I made an automation to send a critical notification and speak at home speakers, so I certainly wake up to check what is going on.</p>

<h2 id="scraping-monitoring-channels">Scraping Monitoring Channels<a href="#scraping-monitoring-channels" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I already mentioned we have various Telegram channels for monitoring the situation during an attack. Those channels provide live updates on dangers, flight paths, and the type of attack.</p>
<p>So often I found myself constantly checking my phone to understand whether I am in direct danger or can sleep for a few hours. <em>I know it sounds crazy, and normal people would go straight to the nearby shelter, but this is life in Ukraine. You don't have to follow my reckless example. If you are in Ukraine, GO TO THE SHELTER!</em></p>
<p>I decided to automate it. Instead of reading these channels myself, I delegate this task to HA.</p>
<p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/danieldotnl/ha-multiscrape">HA Multiscrape</a> custom integration for that. You may ask, "why do you need a custom component when <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/scrape/">HA has a built-in scraping component</a>?" Yes, it does, but I need multiple sensors from a single scrape, and I need to work with lists of data. The built-in component has some limitations with that.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring-imminent-danger">Monitoring Imminent Danger<a href="#monitoring-imminent-danger" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cruise missiles are usually carried and launched by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-95">Tu-95 bombers</a>.</p>
<p>They fly to the missile launch sites for about 3 hours, launch their missiles, then it takes about 1-2 hours for missiles to fly to Kyiv. So there's some time to prepare a hideout (in my case, it's the bathroom), gather documents, and sleep for a few hours before the "show" begins.</p>

<p>Usually, it happens in the evening and means tonight will be a massive missile attack.</p>
<p>I have a sensor that checks the Telegram channels, scrapes the list of messages every 5 seconds, and checks if the latest message contains a specific set of words, like <em>"take off" <strong>and</strong> "plane" <strong>and</strong> "tu-95"</em>. It also stores the latest message as an attribute.</p>

<h2 id="direct-danger-alert">Direct Danger Alert<a href="#direct-danger-alert" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the most interesting sensor, which notifies me right when there's a direct threat to my location.</p>

<figcaption>Notification about direct danger</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When an attack happens at night, you need to decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you going to the shelter to get a sleepless night somewhere in a basement or in the subway?</li>
<li>Or are you going to stay in bed as long as possible to get some sleep, because you need to go to work tomorrow?</li>
</ul>
<p>Every normal person would go to the shelter. But when you live in these conditions for some time, you try to calculate the risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to get proper sleep to be able to work.</li>
<li>The air defenses are titans; they do their job excellently. Flying threats are getting shot down regularly.</li>
<li>In Kyiv, the risk of a direct hit or hit by debris is relatively tolerable: I guess like being hit by a car (this estimate is completely unscientific!).</li>
<li>If you are unlucky to catch a direct hit – you are dead anyway. There's very little chance to survive that.</li>
<li>If the missile/drone gets shot down nearby, the shockwave will blow your windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what do you do? It's up to you, but most of the time, I decide to sleep in bed. When things get hot, I hide in a bathroom so that when something blows up nearby, <a href="https://visitukraine.today/blog/990/list-of-things-to-put-in-an-emergency-suitcase-and-basic-rules-that-will-save-lives-during-missile-strikes">I will be behind two walls</a> from glass shards and shockwaves.</p>
<p>I have a sensor that watches for specific keywords like <em>"Kyiv"</em> or a neighborhood name, for <em>"warning" <strong>or</strong> "be in a safe place" <strong>or</strong> "fast target"</em>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>I feel like I used to spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with suspect
hard drives. I mean, like, back in high school. These days I almost never do,
or on the occasion that I have storage trouble, it's a drive that has
completely stopped responding at all and there's little to do besides replacing
it. One time I had two NVMe drives in two different machines do this to me the
same week. Bad luck or quantum phenomenon, who knows.</p>
<p>What accounts for the paucity of "HDD recovery" in my adult years? Well, for
one, no doubt HDD technology has improved over time and modern drives are
simply more reliable. The well-aged HDDs I have running without trouble in
multiple machines right now support this theory. But probably a bigger factor
is my buying habits: back in high school I was probably getting most of the
HDDs I used second-hand from the Free Geek thrift store. They were coming
pre-populated with problems for my convenience.</p>
<p>Besides, the whole storage industry has changed. What's probably more
surprising about my situation is how many "spinning rust" HDDs I still own.
Conventional magnetic storage only really makes sense in volume. These days I
would call an 8TB HDD a small one. The drives that get physical abuse, say in
laptops, are all solid state. And solid state drives... while there is no doubt
performance degradation over their lifetimes, failure modes tend to be
all-or-nothing.</p>
<p>I was thinking about all of this as I ruminated on one of the "holy grail"
tools of the late '00s: SpinRite, by Gibson Research Corporation.</p>
<p>The notion that HDDs aren't losing data like they used to is supported by the
dearth of data recovery tools on the modern shareware market. Well, maybe
that's more symptomatic of the complete hollowing out of the independent
software industry by the interests of capitalism, but let's try to dwell on the
positive. Some SEO-spam blog post titled "Best data recovery software of 2024"
still offers some classic software names like "UnDeleteMyFiles Pro," but some
items on the list are just backup tools, and options like Piriform Recuva and
the open-source PhotoRec still rank prominently... as they did when I was in
high school and my ongoing affection for Linkin Park was less embarrassing [1].</p>
<p>Back in The Day, freeware, shareware, and commercial (payware?) data recovery
software proliferated. It was advertised in the back of magazines, the sidebar
banner ads of websites, and even appeared in the electronics department of
Fred Meyer's. You also saw a lot of advertisements for services that could
perform more intensive methods, like swapping an HDD's controller for one from
another unit of the same model. These are all still around today, just a whole
lot less prominent. Have you ever seen an Instagram ad for UnDeleteMyFiles Pro?</p>
<p>First, we should talk a bit about the idea of data recovery in general. There
are essentially two distinct fields that we might call "data recovery":
consumers or business users trying to recover their Important Files (say,
accounting spreadsheets) from damaged or failed devices, and forensic analysts
trying to recover Important Files (say, the <em>other</em> accounting spreadsheets)
that have been deleted.</p>
<p>There is naturally some overlap between these two ventures. Consumers sometimes
accidentally delete their Important Files and want them back. Suspects sometimes
intentionally damage storage devices to complicate forensics. But the two
different fields use rather different techniques.</p>
<p>Let's start by examining forensics, both to set up contrast to consumer data
recovery and because I know a lot more about it. One of the quintessential
techniques of file system forensics is "file carving." A file carving tool
examines an arbitrary sequence of bytes (say, from a disk image) and looks for
the telltale signs of known file formats. For example, most common file formats
have a fixed prefix of some kind. ZIP files start with 0x504B0304, the
beginning of which is the ASCII "PK" for Phil Katz who designed the format.
Some formats also have a fixed trailer, but many more have structure that can
be used to infer the location of the end of the file. For example, in ZIP files
the main header structure, the "central directory," is actually a trailer found
at the end of the file.</p>
<p>If you can find the beginning and end of a file, and it's stored sequentially,
you've now got the whole file. When the file is fragmented in the byte stream
(commonly the case with disk images), the problem is a little tougher, but
still you can find a lot of value. A surprising number of files <em>are</em> stored
sequentially because they are small, some filetypes have internal structure
that can be used to infer related blocks and their order, and even finding a
single block of a file can be useful if it happens to contain a spreadsheet row
starting "facilitating payments to foreign officials" or, I don't know,
"Fiat@".</p>
<p>You end up doing this kind of thing a lot because of a detail of file systems
that all of my readers probably know. It's often articulated as something like
"when you delete a file, it's not deleted, just marked as having been deleted."
That's not exactly wrong but it's also an oversimplification in a way that
makes it more difficult to understand <em>why</em> that is the case. There's a whole
level of indirection due to block allocation, updating the bitmap on every file
delete is a relatively time-consuming process that offers little value, actually
overwriting blocks would be even more time consuming with even less value, etc.
Read Brian Carrier for the whole story.</p>
<p>Actually, screw Brian Carrier, I've written before about the adjacent topic of
<a href="https://computer.rip/2021-07-26-rip-those-bits-to-shreds.html">secure erasure of computer
media</a>.</p>
<p>My point is this: these forensic methods are performed on a fully functional
storage device (or more likely an image of one), where "recovery" is necessary
and possible because of the design of the file system. The storage device, as
hardware, is not all that involved. Well, that's <em>really</em> an
oversimplification, and points to an important consideration in modern data
recovery: storage devices have gotten tremendously more complex, and that's
especially true of SSDs.</p>
<p>Even HDDs tend to have their own thoughts and feelings. They can have a great
deal of internal logic dedicated to maintaining the disk surface, optimizing
performance, working around physical defects on the surface, caching,
encryption, etc. Pretty much all of this is proprietary to the manufacturer,
undocumented, and largely a mystery to the person performing recovery. Thinking
of the device as a "sequence of bytes" throws out a lot of what's really going
on, but it's a necessary compromise.</p>
<p>SSDs have gone even further. Flash storage is less durable than magnetic
storage but also more flexible. It requires new optimizations to maximize life
and facilitates optimizations for access time and speed. Some models of SSDs
vary from each other only by their software configuration (this has long been
suspected of some HDDs as well, but I have no particular insight into Western
Digital color coding). Even worse for the forensic analyst, the TRIM command
creates a whole new level of active management by the storage device: SSDs know
which blocks are in use, allowing them to constantly remap blocks on the fly.
It is impossible, without hardware reverse engineering techniques, to produce a
true image of an SSD. You are always working with a "view" of the SSD mediated
by its firmware.</p>
<p>So let's compare and contrast forensic analysis to consumer data recovery. The
problem for most consumers is sort of the opposite: they didn't delete the
file. If they could get the sequence of bytes off the storage device, they
could just access the file through the file system. The problem is that the
storage device is refusing to produce bytes at all, or it's producing the wrong
ones.</p>
<p>Techniques like file carving are not entirely irrelevant to consumer data
recovery because it's common for storage devices to fail only partially. There
are different ways of referring to the physical geometry of HDDs, and besides,
modern storage devices (HDDs and SSDs alike) abstract away their true geometry.
Different file systems also use different terminology for their own internal
system of mapping portions of the drive to logical objects.  So while you'll
find people say things like "bad cluster" and "bad sector," I'm just going to
talk about blocks. The block is the smallest elementary unit by which your file
system interacts with the device. The size of a block is typically 512B for
smaller devices and 4k for larger devices.</p>
<p>A common failure mode for storage devices (although, it seems, not so much
today) is the loss of a specific block: the platter is damaged, or some of the
flash silicon fails, and a specific spot just won't read any more. The storage
device can, and likely will, paper over this problem by moving the block to a
different area in the storage medium. But, in the process, the contents of the
block are probably lost. The new location just contains... whatever was there
before [2]. Sometimes the bad block is in the middle of a file, and that
sucks for that file. Sometimes the bad block is in the middle of a file system
structure like the allocation table, and that sucks for all of the files.</p>
<p>More complicated file systems tend to incorporate precautionary measures
against this kind of thing, so the blast radius is mostly limited to single
files. For example, NTFS keeps a second copy of the allocation table as a
backup. Journaling can also provide a second source of allocation data when
the table is damaged.</p>
<p>Simpler file systems, like the venerable FAT, don't have any of these tricks.
They are, after all, old and simple. But old age and simplicity gives FAT a
"lowest common denominator" status that sees it widely used on removable
devices. PhotoRec, while oriented towards the consumer data recovery
application, is actually a file carving tool. It's no coincidence that it's
called PhotoRec. Removable flash devices like SD cards have simple controllers
and host simple file systems. They are, as a result, some of the most
vulnerable devices to block failures that render intact files undiscoverable.</p>
<p>What about the cases where file <em>isn't</em> intact, though? Where the block
that has become damaged is part of the file that we want? What about cases
where a damaged head leaves an HDD unable to read an entire surface?</p>
<p>Well, the news isn't that great. Despite this being one of the most common
types of consumer storage failure for a decade or more, and despite the
enormous inventory of software that promises to help, your options are limited.
A <em>lot</em> of the techniques that software packages used in these situations lack
supporting research or are outright suspect. Let's start on solid ground,
though, with the most obvious and probably safest option.</p>
<p>One of the problems you quickly encounter when working with a damaged storage
device is the file system and operating system. File systems don't like damaged
storage devices, and operating systems don't like file systems that refuse to
give up a file they say exists. So you try to copy files off of the bad device
and onto a good one using your daily-driver file browser, and it hits a block
that won't read and gets stuck. Maybe it hangs almost indefinitely, maybe you
get an obscure error and the copy operation stops. Your software is working
against you.</p>
<p>One of the best options for data recovery from suspect devices is an
open-source tool called ddrescue. ddrescue is very simple and substantially
similar to dd. It has one critical trick up its sleeve: when reading a block
fails, ddrescue retries a limited number of times and then moves on. With that
little adaptation, you can recover all of the working blocks from a device and
so likely recover all of the files but a few.</p>
<p>Besides, just retrying a few times has value. Especially on magnetic devices,
the result of reading the surface can be influenced by small perturbances.  An
unreadable sector might be readable every once in a while. This doesn't seem to
happen as much with SSDs due to the dynamics of flash storage and preemptive
correction of weak or ambiguous values, but I'm sure it still happens every once
in a while.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, though, this method still means accepting the loss of
some data. Losing some data is better than losing all of it, but it might not
be good enough. Isn't there anything we can do?</p>
<p>HDDs used to be different. For one, they used to be bigger. But there's more to
it than that. Older hard drives used stepper motors to position the head stack,
and so head positioning was absolute but subject to some mechanical error.
Although this was rarely the case on the consumer market, early hard drives
were sometimes sold entirely uninitialized, without the timing marks the
controller used to determine sector positions. You had to use a special tool
to get the drive to write them [3]. It was common for older drives to come
with a report (often printed on the label) of known bad sectors to be kept
in mind when formatting.</p>
<p>We now live in a different era. Head stacks are positioned by a magnetic coil
based on servo feedback from the read head; mechanical error is virtually
absent and positioning is no longer absolute but relative to the cylinder being
read. Extensive low-level formatting is required but is handled completely
internally by the controller. Controllers passively detect bad blocks and
reallocate around them. Honestly, there's just not a lot you can do. There are
too many levels of abstraction between even the ATA interface and the actual
storage to do anything meaningful at the level of the magnetic surface. And all
of this was pretty much true in the late '00s, even before SSDs took over.</p>
<p>So what about SpinRite?</p>
<p>SpinRite dates back to 1987 and is apparently still under development by its
creator Steve Gibson. Gibson is an interesting figure, one of the "Tech
Personalities" that contemporary media no longer creates (insert comment about
decay in the interest of capitalism here). Think Robert Cringely or Leo Laporte,
with whom Gibson happens to cohost a podcast. In my mind, Gibson is perhaps
most notable for his work as an early security researcher, which had its misses
but also had its hits. Through the whole thing he's run Gibson Research
Corporation. GRC offers a variety of one-off web services, like a password
generator (generated, erm, server-side) and something that displays the TLS
fingerprint of a website you enter. There's a user-triggered port scanner called
ShieldsUp, which might be interesting were it not for the fact that its port
list seems limited to the Windows RPC mapper and some items of that type...
things that were major concerns in the early '00s but rarely a practical
problem today.</p>
<p>It's full of some gems. Consider the password generator...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What makes these perfect and safe?
Every one is completely random (maximum entropy) without any pattern, and the cryptographically-strong pseudo random number generator we use guarantees that no similar strings will ever be produced again.
Also, because this page will only allow itself to be displayed over a snoop-proof and proxy-proof high-security SSL connection, and it is marked as having expired back in 1999, this page which was custom generated just now for you will not be cached or visible to anyone else. 
...
The "Techie Details" section at the end describes exactly how these super-strong maximum-entropy passwords are generated (to satisfy the uber-geek inside you).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know I'm reading the Techie Details. They describe a straightforward
approach using AES in CBC mode, fed by a counter and its own output. It's
unremarkable except that just about any modern security professional would have
paroxysms at the fact that he seems to have implemented it himself.  Sure,
there are better methods (like AES CTR), but this is the kind of thing where
you shouldn't even really be using methods. "I read it from /dev/urandom" is a
far more reassuring explanation than a block diagram of cryptographic
primitives. /dev/urandom is a well-audited implementation, whatever is behind
your block diagram is not. Besides, it's server side!</p>
<p>My point is not so much to criticize Gibson's technical expertise, although I
certainly think you could, but to say that he doesn't seem to have updated his
website in some time. A lot of little details like references to WEP and the
fact that the PDFs are Corel Ventura output support this theory. By association,
I suspect that GRC's flagship product, SpinRite, doesn't get a lot of active
maintenance either.</p>
<p>Even back around 2007 when I first encountered SpinRite it was already a little
questionable, and I remember a rough internet consensus of "it likely doesn't
do anything but it probably doesn't hurt to try." A little research finds that
"is SpinRite snake oil?" threads date back to the Usenet era. It doesn't help
that Steve Gibson's writing is pervaded by a certain sort of... hucksterism.  A
sort of ceaseless self-promotion that internet users associate mostly with
travel influencers selling courses about how to make money as a travel
influencer.</p>
<p>But what does SpinRite even claim? After a charming disclaimer that GRC is
opposed to software patents but nonetheless involved in "extensive ongoing
patent acquisition" related to SpinRite, a document titled "SpinRite: What's
Under the Hood" gives some details. It's undated but has metadata pointing at
1998. That's rather vintage I see several reasons to think that there have been
few or no functional changes in SpinRite since that time.</p>
<p>SpinRite is a bootable tool based on FreeDOS. It originated as an interleaving
tool, which I won't really explain because it's quite irrelevant to modern
storage devices and really just a historic detail of SpinRite. It also
"introduc[ed] the concept of non-destructive low-level reformatting," which I
won't really explain because I don't know what it means, other than it seems to
fall into the broad category of no one really knowing what "low level
formatting" means. It's a particularly amusing example, because most modern
software vendors use "low level formatting" to refer explicitly to a
destructive process.</p>
<p>SpinRite "completely bypasses the system's motherboard BIOS software when used
on any standard hard disk system." I assume this means that SpinRite directly
issues ATA commands, which probably has some advantages, although the specific
ones the document calls out seem specious.</p>
<p>In reference to SpinRite's data recovery features, we read that "The DynaStat
system's statistical analysis capability frequently determines a sector's
correct data even when the data could never be read correctly from the mass
storage medium." This is what I remember as the key claim of SpinRite marketing
over a decade ago: that SpinRite would attempt rereading a block a very large
number of times and then determine on a bit-by-bit basis what the most likely
value is. It seems reasonable on the surface, but it wouldn't make much sense
with a drive with internal error correction. That's universal today but I'm not
sure how long that's been true, presumably in the late '90s this was a better
idea.</p>
<p>That's probably the high point of this document's credibility. Everything from
there gets more suspect. It claims that SpinRite has a proprietary system that
models the internal line coding used by "every existing proprietary" hard
drive, an unlikely claim in 1998 and an impossible one today without a massive
reverse engineering effort. Consider also "its second recovery strategy of
deliberately wiggling the drive's heads." It seems to achieve this by issuing
reads to cylinders on either side of the cylinder in question, but it's
questionable if that would even work in principle on a modern drive. You must
then consider the use of servo positioning on modern drives, which means that
the head will likely oscillate around the target cylinder before settling on it
anyway.</p>
<p>This gives the flavor of the central problem with SpinRite: it claims to
perform sophisticated analysis at a very low level of the drive's operation,
but it claims to do that with hard drives that intentionally abstract away
all of their low level details.</p>
<p>A lot of the document reads, to modern eyes, like pure flimflam, written by
someone who knew enough about HDDs to sound technical but not enough to really
understand the implications of what they were saying. The thing is, though,
this document is from '98 and the software was already a decade old at the
time! The document does note that SpinRite 3.0 was a complete rewrite, but I
suspect it was the last complete rewrite and probably carried a lot of its
functionality over from the first two versions.</p>
<p>I think that SpinRite probably does implement the functionality that it claims
and that those features <em>might</em> have been of some value in the late '80s and
much of the '90s. Then technology moved on and SpinRite became irrelevant.
Probably the only thing that SpinRite does of any value on a modern drive is
just rewriting the entire addressable area, which gives the controller an
opportunity to detect bad blocks and remap them. That should also happen in the
course of normal operation, though, and even tools dedicated to that purpose
(like the open-source badblocks) are becoming rather questionable in comparison
to the preemptive capabilities of modern HDDs. This type of bad-block-detecting
rewrite pass is probably only useful in pathological cases on older devices, but
it's also the only real claim of the vast majority of modern "hard drive repair"
software.</p>
<p>It seems a little mean-spirited to go after GRC for their old software, but
they continue to promote it at a cost of $89. The FAQ tells us that "SpinRite
is every bit as necessary today as it ever was — maybe even more so since
people store so much valuable personal 'media' data on today's massive drives."
I resent the implication of the scare-quoted "media," Mr. Gibson, but what I do
with my hard drives in my own home is none of your business.</p>
<p>The FAQ tells us "SpinRite is often credited with performing "true miracles" of
data recovery," but is oddly silent on the topic of SSDs. Some dedicated
Wikipedia editor rounded up a number of occasions on which Gibson said that
SpinRite was of limited or no use with SSDs, and yet the GRC website currently
includes the heading "Amazingly effective for SSDs!" There is no technical
explanation offered for how SpinRite's exceptionally platter-centric features
affect an SSD, nor mention of any new functionality targeting flash storage.
Instead, there's just anecdotal claims that SpinRite made SSDs faster and a
suggestion that the reader google a well-known behavior of flash storage for
which SSD controllers have considerable mitigations.</p>
<p>It is an odd detail of the GRC website that most of the new information about
the product is provided in the form of video. Specifically, videos excerpted
from recent episodes of Gibson and Laporte's podcast "Security Now." Security
Now is weekly, so I don't think that SpinRite promotional material makes up a
large portion of it, but it does seem conspicuous that Gibson uses the podcast
as a platform for 15 minute stories about how SpinRite worked miracles. These
segments, and their mentions of how SpinRite is a very powerful tool that one
shouldn't run on SSDs too often, absolutely reek of the promotional techniques
behind Orgone accumulators, Hulda Clark's "Zapper," and color therapy. It is,
it seems, quack medicine for the hard drive.</p>
<p>I don't think SpinRite started as a scam, but I sure think it ended as one.</p>
<p>A lot of this was already apparent back in the late '00s, and I can't honestly
say that bootleg copies of SpinRite every improved anything for me. So why did
I love it so much? The animations!</p>
<p>SpinRite's TUI was truly a work of art. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hm5LU2bslt0?t=105">Just watch it go!</a>.</p>
<p>[1] I recently bought the 20th anniversary vinyl box set of <em>Meteora</em>, which
emphasizes that (1) 20 years have passed and (2) I am still a loser.</p>
<p>[2] This kind of visible failure seems uncommon with SSDs, likely because SSD
controllers tend to read out the flash in a critical, suspicious way and take
preemptive action when the physical state is less than perfectly clear cut. In
a common type of engineering irony, the fact that flash storage is less
reliable than magnetic media requires aggressive management of the problem that
makes the overall system more reliable. Or at least that's what I tell myself
when another SSD has gone completely unresponsive.</p>
<p>[3] Honestly this doesn't seem to have been typical with any hard drives by the
microcomputer era, which makes perfect sense if you consider that these hard
drives were sold with bad sector lists and therefore must have been factory
tested. The whole "low level formatting" thing has been 70% a scam and 30%
confusion with the very different technical tradition of magnetic diskettes,
since probably 1990 at least.</p>
