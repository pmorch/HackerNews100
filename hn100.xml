<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>Welcome to BIG, a newsletter on the politics of monopoly power. If you’d like to sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so </span><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/subscribe" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></em></p><p>Normally on Sunday’s I do a round-up of monopoly-related news for paid subscribers. That’ll be at the end of this email. But today, I want to do a bit of a summary of the Google antitrust trial, since we’re investing so much into covering it. The key question is as follows. Google is a very powerful corporation worth around $2 trillion, it controls access to the internet, and it will roll out generative artificial intelligence for billions of people. And yet, the public hasn’t heard that much about a major trial where the firm and its executives are being asked how they secured that immense power. Why?  </p><p>There are several possibilities, but in my view, the most obvious reason is that the judge in the case, Amit Mehta, is effectively holding the contest in secret. Last week, according to our calculations, over half of the trial, including testimony from key witnesses, happened in closed session, unavailable to the public. Why? Here’s Mehta in a pre-trial hearing in August, explaining his thinking to Google’s attorneys.</p><p><em>“Look, I’m a trial judge. I am not anyone that understands the industry and the markets in the way that you do. And so I take seriously when companies are telling me that if this gets disclosed, it’s going to cause competitive harm. And I think it behooves me to be somewhat conservative in thinking about that issue, because, you know, I can’t see around every corner.”</em></p><p>In other words, Mehta is deferring to Google on the need for secrecy.</p><div id="youtube2-gRelVFm7iJE" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;gRelVFm7iJE&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gRelVFm7iJE?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>In 1998, the richest man in the world, Bill Gates, had to answer to the public in an antitrust trial. Gates had been a titan for almost two decades, gracing the cover of Time Magazine multiple times as a young genius. That all changed when he was deposed by government lawyers. “The Bill Gates on the courtroom screen,” reported </span><a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/11/biztech/articles/03soft.html" rel="">the New York Times</a><span>, “was evasive and uninformed, pedantic and taciturn, a world apart from his reputation as a brilliant business strategist, guiding every step in Microsoft Corp.'s rise to dominance in computing.” </span></p><p>For eight months, the Microsoft antitrust trial was front-page news, the drama of the trillion dollar personal computing revolution unveiled to the public. One result was that Microsoft, afraid of public exposure years later, refused to use its control over the browser to kill nascent rivals, in particular a young search company called Google. </p><p><span>Today, we should be in a similar moment, only this time with Google as the titan on trial. Google has engaged in behavior that’s almost identical to what Microsoft did in terms of coercion of rivals, and just as consequential in terms of shaping the future. And yet, the reporting and interest in this trial is minuscule compared to what we saw 25 years ago. Frankly, some days, our </span><a href="https://www.bigtechontrial.com/" rel="">Big Tech on Trial</a><span> reporting site is one of the few journalists in the court room, which is astonishing. This dynamic is especially odd because, unlike 1998, we are in an anti-monopoly moment, with political interest in corporate behavior far more elevated than it was in 1998.</span></p><p><span>What gives? There are a few reasons for this odd disconnect, but one reason is very simple - there was public access to the Microsoft trial in 1998. However today the judge, a guy named Amit Mehta, has effectively barred the public from seeing anything meaningful or interesting. In my </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-first-big-antitrust-trial-of" rel="">profile of the trial</a><span>, back in August, I focused on Mehta, because I knew the dynamics would be organized by his decision-making. And so it has been.</span></p><p><span>Let’s compare the two trials. For Microsoft, the judge ruled on </span><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/gates-depositions-open-to-public/" rel="">behalf of media organizations</a><span> that the deposition of Bill Gates would be unsealed, a deposition that was not meaningful for the trial, but also critically important to the historical record, and one you can watch online today. He also unsealed </span><a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/04/biztech/articles/09soft.html" rel="">over a hundred transcripts</a><span> of other depositions from industry players, including ones that weren’t used in the trial itself. This public record was critical to the reporting, and to public understanding of the industry.</span></p><p><span>But this Google trial? By far the most important moment was when Judge Mehta </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.685.0_1.pdf" rel="">denied a third-party motion</a><span> to broadcast a publicly accessible audio feed of the trial for fear that information Google wishes wouldn’t be disclosed become public. Indeed, Google lawyers have explicitly argued that the judge should avoid allowing documents to become public solely because it is “clickbait.” To put it differently, the search giant literally argues material should stay sealed merely because if that material is interesting. Imagine if Bill Gates, or say, a routine defendant in any case, could have availed himself of that innovative legal argument!</span></p><p>These arguments should be laughed out of court. And yet, Mehta takes them seriously, which has led to an almost-entirely private trial, deadeningly boring to the public because key documents have been deleted and the important or embarrassing moments are held in secret. </p><p>As a result of this monumental decision, the trial is now only available to people who can go to the court in D.C.  And yet, even if you can come to the courthouse, it’s hard to see the trial because huge portions are fully sealed. There is often no clear indication beforehand of how long the trial will be sealed for. And when court ends a sealed session and re-opens to the public, it often resumes within a couple minutes of opening the door to the courtroom. This means anyone who wants to watch the public portions of the trial just has to wait outside the courtroom to see when it re-opens. Moreover, even though you can watch the trial from the courtroom or a public overflow room, unless you are in the media room, electronic devices are not allowed.</p><p>It’s an eight week trial, but a chronicle of Friday’s court date is as good an example as any. Big Tech on Trial waited all day, with no information, as the lawyers debated something in what is known as a ‘closed session.’ This is a common occurrence. Most of the trial is happening behind closed doors, including procedural questions that should clearly be public. Indeed, Big Tech on Trial looked at the transcripts for the last week to estimate roughly how much of the trial was held in secret, based on how much they are redacted. </p><p>Easily half of the week’s courtroom days were sealed. Here’s a breakdown of how much of the trial was sealed on each day:</p><ul><li><p>Monday, Sept. 18: roughly half of the trial was sealed</p></li><li><p>Tuesday, Sept. 19: trial was fully open</p></li><li><p><span>Wednesday, Sept. 20 roughly three quarters of the trial was sealed. That morning, Bloomberg reporter Leah Nylen came to the courtroom with a First Amendment attorney hired by Bloomberg. But the attorney never got a chance to speak because the court unexpectedly </span><a href="https://www.bigtechontrial.com/p/what-is-it-like-to-compete-against" rel="">began in a closed session and the public was asked to leave the courtroom</a><span> (after Judge Mehta reportedly had a private meeting with the lead attorneys in his chambers).</span></p></li><li><p>Thursday, Sept. 21: roughly half of the trial was sealed</p></li><li><p>Friday, Sept. 22: the entirety of testimony was sealed. Court opened up only for a few minutes to deal with administrative matters at the very end of the day.</p></li></ul><p><span>And that means we heard little of the most important testimony, perhaps of the entire trial, from a man named John Giannandrea. Giannandrea is a senior executive at Apple who reports directly to Tim Cook and came to Apple from Google in 2018, where he was head of Search. The relationship between Apple and Google is the heart of the trial, and, in the year this man left from Apple to Google, the two firms went from aggressive </span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-web-search-technology-chief-returns-to-google?irclickid=zaGVWgzd3xyPWD-UXyyJiw2eUkFRgRVRRWdJ1s0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;utm_medium=cpa&amp;utm_campaign=10078-Skimbit+Ltd.&amp;utm_term=macrumors.com" rel="">competitors to gentle collaborators</a><span>. And yet, the public heard just </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-22/apple-ai-chief-posits-new-private-browser-search-at-google-trial" rel="">ten minutes of open-court testimony from Giannandrea</a><span>. Another Apple executive, Eddie Cue, will testify on Tuesday, so there’s a chance we’ll learn more about the relationship between Apple and Google.

On a separate post, I’ve put up </span><a href="https://www.bigtechontrial.com/p/secrecy-is-systemic" rel="">seven different</a><span> ways he’s doing that, from letting Google avoid disclosing documents based on false claims of attorney-client privilege to doing nothing even when Google executives used “history-off chats” to destroy conversations after 24 hours even after Google was on a litigation hold. The point is, Mehta is far more concerned that Google isn’t embarrassed, and almost wholly uninterested in public access.</span></p><p>The problem here isn’t just the judge or Google. The Department of Justice shouldn’t be let off the hook either. The trial team, which is generally doing a good job, seems mostly unconcerned with public access. They didn’t support a set of nonprofits who made a motion for a public audio feed, and they tend to litigate in closed session whenever Google seems uncomfortable, so as not to come close to offending the judge. Indeed, when the judge expressed a bit of frustration that exhibits were posted publicly, government lawyers immediately pulled down their website and said they would work with Google to make sure everyone was satisfied with the process. That’s the opposite of standing your ground.</p><p><span>Trials are </span><em>supposed</em><span> to be public, and the government should fight for them to be public. Public access and a public record in a trial, especially when the powerful are concerned, is a core part of what makes our legal system different from those in authoritarian regimes. Not vigorously challenging Google in its penchant for secrecy is inconsistent with their obligation to their client, which is the people of the United States. </span></p><p>And this isn’t costless. At this point, I am hearing from random commentators that the fix is in, and it’s hard not to disagree. Conspiracy theorists arguing how the corporations, judges, and the government are in collaboration could look at this trial and have a field day. That’s the price of secrecy, there’s just no way to uphold the legitimacy of a legal order when redactions are both unnecessary and routine.</p><p>Fortunately, this trial isn’t the last time Google will be on the stand. And despite Mehta’s caution, we are learning more about Google, just not nearly as much as we should. I didn’t know what to expect from this trial, but a blackout of information wasn’t on my radar. But I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised. After all, who knows more about the value of privacy than Google?</p><p><span>The monopoly round-up for paid subscribers is below.

                    <p>A team of scientists led by a Japanese pharmaceutical startup has been working on a drug to stimulate the growth of new teeth in what would be a world-first, aiming to put it on the market by around 2030.</p>
<p>Toregem Biopharma Co., funded by Kyoto University, is expected to begin clinical trials on healthy adults in around July 2024 to confirm the drug's safety, after the team succeeded in growing new teeth in mice in 2018.</p>
<p>Most people have "tooth buds" that have the potential to become a new tooth, in addition to baby and permanent teeth, although the buds usually do not develop and subsequently disappear.</p>

(Photo courtesy of Katsu Takahashi)(Photo use permitted only for the story concerned)(Kyodo)</em></p>
</div>
<p>The team created an antibody drug that inhibits the protein that suppresses the growth of teeth. The drug works on these buds and stimulates their growth.</p>
<p>In 2018, the team also administered the drug to ferrets, which have both baby and permanent teeth similar to humans, and new teeth grew.</p>
<p>The team plans to hold a clinical trial for the drug from 2025 for children between 2 to 6 years old with anodontia who are born without some or all permanent teeth. The children will be injected with one dose to induce their teeth growth.</p>
<p>There are also hopes to utilize the drug in the future for adults who have lost teeth due to cavities.</p>
<p>"Missing teeth in a child can affect the development of their jaw bone," said Katsu Takahashi, co-founder of Toregem Biopharma and head of dentistry and oral surgery at Kitano Hospital in Osaka.</p>
<p>"We hope the drug will serve as a key to solving those problems," he said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><span><span><span>Rates of new-onset type 2 diabetes climbed 62%—and type 1 diabetes increased 17%—among US youth after the COVID-19 pandemic began, especially in Black and Hispanic children, according to a </span></span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2809781"><span><span>study</span></span></a><span><span> published yesterday in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>For the study, Kaiser Permanente researchers tracked rates of type 1 and type 2 diabetes among health system members aged 0 to 19 years in southern California with no history of diabetes from January 2016 to December 2021. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>"Youth-onset diabetes is a serious chronic health condition, placing individuals at risk for early complications, comorbidities, and excess mortality, in particular among those who develop type 2 diabetes and those from racial and ethnic minority groups such as non-Hispanic Black individuals," the study authors wrote.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Kids aged 10 to 19 years especially affected</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>Over the study period, 1,200 youth were diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes, 1,100 diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and 63 patients with "other" diabetes. Type 1 diabetes rates climbed from 18.5 per 100,000 person-years in 2016 to 2019 to 22.4 per 100,000 person-years from 2020 to 2021. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Relative to 2016 to 2019, in 2020 to 2021, the incidence of new-onset type 1 diabetes was 17% higher (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.17). The incidence was higher among patients aged 10 to 19 years (IRR,1.17), boys (IRR, 1.18), and Hispanic patients (1.21). </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Rates of type 2 diabetes were 62% higher (IRR, 1.62) in 2020 to 2021 than in 2016 to 2019. The incidence of type 2 diabetes rose from 14.8 to 24.7 per 100,000 person-years over that time.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Rates were higher among patients aged 10 to 19 years (IRR, 1.63), girls (IRR, 1.44), boys (IRR, 1.83), Black patients (IRR, 1.95), Hispanic patients (IRR, 1.61), and other/unknown racial groups (IRR, 2.96). The incidence rate differences followed similar patterns for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Black, Hispanic patients had heavy diabetes burden</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>By quarter, rates of type 1 diabetes fluctuated seasonally but climbed among patients aged 10 to 19 years in Q1 of 2021. Among youth with type 2 diabetes, a spike in incidence occurred in Q3 and Q4 of 2020, especially among Black and Hispanic patients, which the researchers said suggests that they bore a disproportionate burden of type 2 diabetes.</span></span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><span><span>Diabetes risk factors may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic including limited physical activity, increased sedentary behaviors, sleep disturbances, and increased intake of processed foods.</span></span></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span><span><span>Sociodemographic factors, average body mass index, fasting and random glucose levels, and hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub>&nbsp;concentrations didn't change from 2016 to 2021. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The authors noted that research has shown that coronavirus-binding via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors damages islet cells in the pancreas and may lead to diabetes. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>"Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance have been noted in patients with COVID-19 infection without prior indicators of diabetes risk," they wrote. "Additionally, diabetes risk factors may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic including limited physical activity, increased sedentary behaviors, sleep disturbances, and increased intake of processed foods." </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The findings, they added, point to the need for future research on physiologic and behavioral risk factors for new-onset diabetes before and during the pandemic.</span></span></span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Postgres queue tech is a thing of beauty, but far from mainstream. Its relative obscurity is partially attributable to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a> of “scale”. The scalability cult has decreed that there are several queue technologies with greater “scalability” than Postgres, and for that reason alone, Postgres isn’t suitably scalable for anyone’s queueing needs. The cult of scalability would rather we build applications that scale beyond our wildest dreams than ones that solve real problems beyond our wildest dreams. Postgres’ operational simplicity be dammed; scale first, operate later.</p>
<p>Yet some intrepid technologists, such as those at <a href="https://webapp.io/blog/postgres-is-the-answer/">webapp.io</a> have risked excommunication – their product relies on Postgres queues for core functionality. Companies like webapp.io are an exception to the norm, recognizing that sometimes other principles outweigh “scalability”. When the cult of scalability fractures, the fractures are often small, but they congeal around new principles like operational simplicity, maintainability, understandability, and familiarity. Sometimes they congeal around new ideas like reusing old tech in <a href="https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/">novel ways</a>, or using Postgres for queues. You, too, should dare risking excommunication from the cult of scalability.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-postgres-queue-tech">What is Postgres queue tech?<a href="#what-is-postgres-queue-tech" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Postgres queue tech consists of two parts: announcing and listening for new jobs (pub/sub) and mutual exclusion (row locks). Both are provided out-of-the-box since Postgres 9.5, released in 2016.</p>
<p>By combining <code>NOTIFY</code> and <code>LISTEN</code>, Postgres makes adding pub/sub to any application trivial. In addition to pub/sub, Postgres also provides one-job-per-worker semantics with <code>FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>. Queries with this suffix acquire <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#LOCKING-ROWS">row locks</a> on matching records, and ignore any records for which locks are already held. Applied to <code>job</code> records, this feature enables simple queue processing queries, e.g. <code>SELECT * FROM jobs ORDER BY created_at FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT 1</code>.</p>
<p>Combined, these two features form the basis for resource-efficient queue processing. Importantly <code>SKIP LOCKED</code> provides an “inconsistent” view of one’s data. That inconsistency is exactly what is needed from a queue; jobs already being processed (i.e. row-locked) are invisible to other workers, offering distributed mutual exclusion. These locks pave the way for both periodic batch processing, and real-time job processing by <code>NOTIFY</code>ing <code>LISTEN</code>ers of new jobs.</p>
<p>Despite these Postgres features having many users, there are relatively few public advocates for combining them as a queue backend. For example, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20022572">this Hacker News comment</a> stated that using Postgres this way is “hacky” and the commenter received no pushback. I found the comment to be load of BS and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">straw man arguments</a>. This thinking seems to be “the prevailing wisdom” of the industry – if you want to talk about queue technology in public, it better not be a relational database. This industry of cargo cults has little appetite for pushing back on whatever wisdom is “prevailing”. I hope to disimbue anyone of the notion that Postgres is an inferior queue technology.</p>
<p>We’ll use “background jobs” as the pretext for this discussion since adding background job processing to applications is a common decision made by developers, which can have far-reaching implications for system maintenance burden. We can think of “background jobs” as any sort of potentially long-running task such as “generate a report and email it to a customer”, or “process an image and convert it to several other formats”. These sorts of use cases generally necessitate queues.</p>
<h2 id="the-background-job-landscape">The background job landscape<a href="#the-background-job-landscape" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Like all technology decisions, choosing how to process long-running tasks is a choice with many tradeoffs. In the past decade, the tech industry has seemingly come to a consensus that there are a few good tools for queuing long-running tasks for processing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> is a wonderful in-memory data store and “message broker”^ that is the backend for many popular background job libraries</li>
<li><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> A distributed “event streaming platform” maintained by the Apache Foundation</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> Allegedly the most widely deployed “message broker”^</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">Amazon SQS</a> An Amazon SaaS product for highly scalable queues</li>
</ul>
<p>My apologies if I’ve excluded your favorite(s); this is not meant to be exhaustive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>^ “Message broker” simply means that a queue system does other fancy stuff on top of being a queue, but for our discussion, let’s consider message brokers queues. There are multiple words and phrases that I consider effectively synonymous with “queue” and “queue processing”: “message broker(ing)”, “stream processing”, “streaming data”, etc. I’m aware that these mean specific things that are not exactly “queue” or “queue processing”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s important to pause here and discuss Redis’ significance in the world of “background jobs”. If you browse the <a href="https://github.com/topics/background-jobs">background jobs GitHub topic</a>, the top five most popular libraries are all backed by Redis:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a> (ruby)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/resque/resque">resque</a> (ruby)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rq/rq">rq</a> (python)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire">Hangfire</a> (C#)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hibiken/asynq">asynq</a> (go)</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s a reason for this; because Redis stores data in memory, both its insertion and retrieval speed are phenomenal. It also has a pub-sub API built in, and with native <code>list</code> and <code>set</code> data structure which, when combined, <a href="https://redis.com/glossary/redis-queue/">make for a fantastic queue</a>. Redis <em>scales</em>. For many developers, that scalability has made it the default choice, and defaults are profoundly powerful.</p>
<p>But before choosing Redis because it scales well, consider this quote from Ben Johnson’s <a href="https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/">I’m All-In on Server-Side SQLite</a>. It’s specifically talking about database scalability, but the statement holds for scaling all sorts of infrastructure, like queues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we think about new database architectures, we’re hypnotized by scaling limits. If it can’t handle petabytes, or at least terabytes, it’s not in the conversation. But most applications will never see a terabyte of data, even if they’re successful. We’re using jackhammers to drive finish nails.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an industry, we’ve become absolutely obsessed with “scale”. Seemingly at the expense of all else, like simplicity, ease of maintenance, and reducing developer cognitive load. We all want to believe that we’re building the next thing that will demand Google, Facebook, or Uber scale, but the fact is, we’re almost always – not. Our technology decisions should reflect that fact. We’re more likely building for relatively small scale, and should be optimizing our decisions around a completely different set of factors that have more to do with team composition than technological superiority.</p>
<p>When we’re starting projects and businesses, we should be optimizing for everything <em>but</em> scale at the outset. Of course, we don’t want to back ourselves into a corner with technology decisions, but we also don’t want to build Kubernetes clusters to serve marketing sites for products that are likely to fail for every reason <em>but</em> the fact that they don’t scale well. We should be thinking about what technologies we <em>know well</em>, what is <em>good enough</em>, and what is the <em>least toilsome</em> solution that meets user needs and our team’s skill sets. Be proud of choosing “good enough” over “the best”; sometimes “the best” is simply a more difficult path to inevitable failure. List in your head every product that failed because it couldn’t scale. There’s a much longer list of products that failed long before they needed to.</p>
<p>What hasn’t been said yet, is that Postgres <em>actually does scale well.</em> But Postgres is general-purpose software, and it’s not going to be “the best” at scaling for queue use cases. It’s going to perform pretty well for that use case, just like it performs pretty well doing everything that it does.</p>

<p>If you’re here and feel like you’ve seen enough of what I have to say, feel free to abandon this page and scroll through Dan McKinley’s <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">choose boring technology</a> slide deck. I’m confident that whether you finish this post or Dan’s slide deck, you’ll make similar decisions when it comes to your next queue technology choice. After all, Dan’s “Choose Boring Technology” talk was the inspiration for this post’s title.</p>
<hr>
<p>The most important question to ask when making technology decisions is: what technologies am I currently using and understand well?</p>
<p>The answer to this question informs the “cost” of choosing technologies for your software stack. Technologies already in use are, presumably, cheap. Assuming they’re well understood.</p>
<p>There’s a good chance that you’re already using a relational database, and if that relational database is Postgres, you should consider it for queues before any other software. If you’re not using Postgres, you should consider whatever is the most boring technology to you, before considering anything else.</p>

  </figure>


<p>Technologies not (yet) in use are more expensive.</p>

  </figure>


<p>In other words, boring technology is relative to what is already in use. Applications that are oriented around message-passing, like notification systems, might consider RabbitMQ boring technology. Caching applications might consider Redis boring technology. Applications with a large amount of relational data might consider Postgres boring technology. The maximally boring choice is likely the right one for you and your team.</p>
<p>If you’re not already using Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, or SQS, adopting any one of them <em>only</em> for background jobs is expensive. You’re adding a new system dependency to every development, test, and production environment, likely for the rest of the application’s life. A new set of skills is now required of every future Developer, DBA, and/or SRE role on the team. Now they need to know these new systems’ intricate failure modes and configuration knobs. Job candidates must be convinced that learning this new technology is a worthwhile time investment. DBAs/SREs need to know how to recover from operational failure, diagnose problems, and monitor performance. There’s a lot to know; and there’s a lot that nobody on the team realizes they need to know. These systems’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns">unknown unknowns</a> are a risk. Especially if these systems are a default choice for you, and you haven’t put a lot of though into <em>why</em> they’re your default choice.</p>
<p>This is not all to say that the most boring technology is a panacea – Postgres included. What one gives up for familiarity, known failure modes, and amortized “cost” might be paid for in performance, or some other vital principle. After all, pushing and popping from a Postgres queue is considerably slower than Redis. Using Postgres for queues may mean that instead of having a single relational database on a single server, applications now require an “application” database and a “queue” database. It may even mean an entirely separate database server for background jobs, so background jobs are independently scalable. It may mean databases need to be <code>VACUUM</code>ed more frequently, incurring a performance hit in the process. There are <em>many</em> implications that one should consider before adopting Postgres for queues, and they should be weighed against team and application needs so that an informed decision can be made. Postgres shouldn’t be a <em>default</em> choice. Similarly, neither should Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS, or any other distributed queue. Choosing boring technology should be one’s default choice.</p>
<p>Technology choices are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">tradeoffs all the way down</a>. I found that <a href="https://dagster.io/blog/skip-kafka-use-postgres-message-queue#how-we-measured">Dagster had a pragmatic approach</a> to adopting Postgres for their queues. When in doubt, consider the following an axiom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If and only if boring technology is provably unable to meet demands should alternatives be considered.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="build-with-escape-hatches">Build with escape hatches<a href="#build-with-escape-hatches" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Earlier I mentioned “not getting backed into a corner”. With respect to background jobs, that means application code for processing jobs should be queue-agnostic.</p>
<p>One day’s cutting edge tech is another day’s boring tech. As applications grow and success is achieved, new technologies tend to get bolted on to applications out of necessity. It’s common to add <a href="https://www.memcached.org/">memcached</a> or Redis as caching layers (but do consider Postgres <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html#SQL-CREATETABLE-UNLOGGED">unlogged tables</a> first!). That means these technologies become “boring” over time, reducing their cost, and changing the calculus for using them as queues.</p>
<p>Building with escape hatches is all about abstraction. Earlier I listed the top five most popular background job libraries on GitHub. Except for <a href="https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire">Hangfire</a>, none of those libraries provide an escape hatch to queue technologies other than Redis. That means switching queues requires rewriting application code because there’s no robust abstraction in front of the underlying queue.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be that way. Queue tech should be abstracted away, so users can choose the right queue for the job. I’m not a Hangfire (or C#) user, but Hangfire appears to have gotten the abstraction right.</p>
<p>It was with the preceding philosophy of choosing boring tech and building with escape hatches that I built Neoq (<a href="https://github.com/acaloiaro/neoq)">https://github.com/acaloiaro/neoq)</a>. Neoq queues can be in-memory, Postgres, or Redis (contributions for your favored boring tech welcome!). Users can switch between queues without changing any application code – simply initialize it with a different queue backend. Neoq is more abstraction than it is concrete implementation. While both the in-memory and Postgres implementations are first-party, the Redis implementation is <a href="https://github.com/hibiken/asynq">asynq</a>. It’s more about providing escape hatches than locking developers into a specific underlying queue technology.</p>
<p>I’d love to see more neoq-like libraries for languages other than Go. I think the lack of software libraries with escape hatches is what backs a lot of developers into a corner, forcing them to begin simple projects with a Redis dependency, long before Redis is warranted. Redis is fantastic, but it’s not always the right queue, or right amount of complexity for the job. The same goes for Kafka, RabbitMQ, and SQS.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-postgres-queue-tech">Choosing Postgres queue tech<a href="#choosing-postgres-queue-tech" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>I hope this post encourages others to risk excommunication from the cult of scale the next time they’re choosing queue technology. There are so many important principles that are not “scale” to consider when choosing technologies. Make boring technology your default choice, and choose Postgres if it bores you.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

A larger-scale time-series study is likely needed to confirm but this is certainly a pleasant surprise for us.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b603c8-8c64-44bf-a669-082aadc0046d_1296x912.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b603c8-8c64-44bf-a669-082aadc0046d_1296x912.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b603c8-8c64-44bf-a669-082aadc0046d_1296x912.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b603c8-8c64-44bf-a669-082aadc0046d_1296x912.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b603c8-8c64-44bf-a669-082aadc0046d_1296x912.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b603c8-8c64-44bf-a669-082aadc0046d_1296x912.png" width="1296" height="912" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d8b603c8-8c64-44bf-a669-082aadc0046d_1296x912.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:912,&quot;width&quot;:1296,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:202605,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b603c8-8c64-44bf-a669-082aadc0046d_1296x912.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b603c8-8c64-44bf-a669-082aadc0046d_1296x912.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b603c8-8c64-44bf-a669-082aadc0046d_1296x912.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b603c8-8c64-44bf-a669-082aadc0046d_1296x912.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Note that while we experimented on OpenAI models.

        <p>The nine nines. 99.9999999% of uptime. Whether the AXD301 actually deserves to be held up as a system of nine nines seems debatable. I am not particularly interested in that debate. Erlang has a strong record for reliability and a design intended to help you as a developer and operator achieve your nines. Maybe just five of them. Up to you really.</p>
<p>Previous episodes of this article series has unpacked <a href="https://underjord.io/unpacking-elixir-concurrency.html">Concurrency</a>, <a href="https://underjord.io/unpacking-elixir-realtime-latency.html">Real-time &amp; Latency</a> and <a href="https://underjord.io/unpacking-elixir-syntax.html">the syntax</a>. In this one we talk about how Elixir and Erlang achieve reliability.</p>
<p>There are agressive, defensive and rigorous practices you can adopt in a variety of ways to achieve reliability and resilience. Testing, profiling, specifications, design, observability, culture, operations and so on. This is not about most of those. This is about software abstractions that serve you in making your system more resilient and allow you to construct resilient designs.</p>
<p>Erlang implements the Actor model, the typical actor in Erlang and Elixir terminology is the GenServer. The generic server. It is a process that has some nice facilities for receiving calls (“synchronous” messages, expecting a response within a timeout) and casts (asynchronous messages, with no expectation of reply). A GenServer is a bunch of API wrapped around the basic Erlang process. A process can receive and send messages. A GenServer (also other related types, gen_event, gen_statem) implements capturing errors that occur and the subsequent exit and passing information about the problems to the parental process as a message.</p>
<p>So what is the parental process. Well it is usually a special type of Erlang process called a Supervisor. A Supervisor can run multiple child processes that implement the necessary API for being a child. The Supervisor then handle problems with the children falling over by applying a strategy.</p>
<p>The strategies are normally <code>one_for_one</code>, <code>one_for_all</code> and <code>one_for_rest</code>. One for one indicates that if a child crashes it, it and only it should be considered when restarting. Leave the others alone. One for all means that the supervisor should restart all children if one child fails. This is often useful if the children are sharing a workload in some important way where restarting one would cause trouble with the others. One for rest is kind of nuanced in that the Supervisor will restart any child defined in the starting order after the crashing one. This can be used to kill a supporting process if the main one dies for example.</p>
<p>So a Supervisor supervises a set of child processes. This set can be dynamic, growing and shrinking as the system operates. In Elixir that would be a DynamicSupervisor. If a single crash happens within a child it will apply the strategy. If the new child crashes immediately it will try again. If there are enough failures within a given threshold the Supervisor will consider itself failing at the job and crash.</p>
<p>This crashing is a feature, not a bug. By crashing it will propagate a signal to whatever Supervisor started this Supervisor that there is an issue. This Supervisor can in turn apply strategies to try and recover the Supervisor through the tried and true practice of turning it off and on again. Or via custom logic if you are feeling spicy.</p>
<p>How many restarts, how often, how intense it is allowed to get. That’s all configurable. You might be fine with the defaults but if you have something particular in mind you have a pretty solid set of knobs to twiddle.</p>
<p>By having Supervisors supervise Supervisors all the way back to the root Supervisor which sits on top of your particular Erlang application we have defined a supervision tree. The idea being that any issue out in a nice leaf node of a tree is probably addressable there and should not affect the rest of your nice stateful actor-packed system. But if it isn’t, it is probably addressable at a branch closer to the tree.</p>
<p>A typical use-case for a Supervisor is a connection pool. And it might be the case that if any of the connections crash that indicates a problem with the server and you know from experience that you might as well re-establish every connection in the pool. Cool. Your Supervisor should do <code>one_for_all</code>. While if a phone-call crashes you probably don’t want to dump out every call in the system just because one had a weird issue. <code>one_for_one</code> should do it.</p>
<p>This is where the Erlang “Let it Crash” idea comes from. It is a bit of a meme (often repeated, poorly examined, often misunderstood, sometimes with funny pictures). Fundamentally, if there is nothing useful your code can do on a failure, no mitigation, no meaningful fallback, then you might as well have it blow up and rely on the underlying tree to make whatever is most useful out of it. You should probably handle the usual suspects “oh, data is missing, let’s 404”. That is an expected failure mode. “oh, hard drive has imploded and disk can’t be read” is a very different error and a 500 Internal Server Error is probably fine.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ve seen an up-and-running Elixir application go down due to exhausting the Supervision tree with erroring out. I have seen it many times as a failure mode for a misconfigured deploy, typically missing an env variable, where starting the initial supervision tree fails.</p>
<p>Supervision is the fundamental building block in Erlang’s resilience story.</p>
<p>How is it used in Elixir? Not much. As in, we don’t typically need to think about it. Phoenix ships a practical and helpful Supervision tree. Ecto ships a good Supervision tree for your database connections and all that. These Supervision trees live a peaceful secretive life under the guise of library code and you get all the advantage with none of the work. And the moment you start coloring outside the lines and building your own GenServers the facilities are there for you.</p>
<p>With your regular generated Phoenix web application all you see is that your <code>application.ex</code> file contains a few entries for different purposes. These are the first branches of your supervision tree and all that you really see.</p>
<p>You get <code>MyApp.Repo</code> for your Ecto Repo which is the abstraction for all your database connectivity, hiding your connection pools and whatnot. You get <code>MyApp.Endpoint</code> which wraps up your HTTP server (Cowboy or Bandit) in Plug and Phoenix abstractions to respond. Under this you will build up a subtree with a variety of jobs. For HTTP requests you have processes that respond. I believe Cowboy uses a pool and Bandit spawns more ad-hoc. There are also the WebSockets and the specific Phoenix Channels or LiveView processes that belong to the state of your application. This all branches out from your Endpoint as it is all related to your web serving.</p>
<p>You can hear more about <a href="https://www.beamrad.io/53">how Bandit operates</a> on the BEAM Radio episode we did with Mat Trudel. We got into the process usage a decent bit there.</p>
<p>Separately you’ll have <code>MyApp.PubSub</code> which starts the Process Groups (pg2) or Redis adapter for doing cool PubSub stuff. This is not strictly web-related, so it has a separate sub-tree. Someone did a thinking.</p>
<p>I appreciate that Phoenix doesn’t try to hide this stuff from you any more than abstracting away the details. If you want to run your app without the web part you can quickly get to the idea of dropping the Endpoint from the list. You simply don’t start it. Same with the DB, just cut out the Repo. Likewise if you need multiple DBs or multiple web services. You can make more Repos and Endpoints. It is explicit. The code is right there. It uses the standard Erlang and Elixir way of starting things.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s a detour from resilience and reliability. Fundamentally you have these supervisors, strategies as a structure to contain the blast radius of errors. The places this approach falls down is if you build a native implemented function (NIF) in C or similar. A crash in that brings down the whole VM. This is why doing work in properly managed BEAM code is preferred in most cases and why you’ll often see attempts to re-implement things in Elixir/Erlang rather than just binding to an existing C library. Rust and Rustler, Zig and Zigler both offer NIF implementations with some additional safety. Of course they don’t entirely remove the risks of native code though.</p>
<p>Rustler uses <a href="https://medium.com/@jlouis666/erlang-dirty-scheduler-overhead-6e1219dcc7">dirty schedulers</a> and I expect Zigler does something similar or at least supports the old and the new options for building NIFs. So they should play nice-ish with Erlang scheduling. But fundamentally native code doesn’t quite offer the same safety or same behavior.</p>
<p>Beyond Supervision trees there are more aspects of Erlang that are resilient. Scheduling and pre-empting was intended to produce <a href="https://underjord.io/unpacking-elixir-realtime-latency.html">consistently low latencies</a> but it also protects you from heavy workloads bogging things down, it prevents infinitely looping bugs from slowing the system to a crawl and in general makes things resilient to things not being ideal all the time.</p>
<p>Another thing is the Erlang heart. That’s a module that can be used to detect the Erlang application itself going down and being able to start it again. An almost-supervisor for your entire application. The IoT <a href="https://nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> also uses a variant of this to help ensure a resilient device.</p>
<p>Having built in other web frameworks and languages this is all a bit foreign. It is more reminiscent of building a microservice architecture than building a single application. But it does occur at the application level. It gives you tools to think about bringing up your system, bringing down your system, handling failure in your system. Those concerns all exist in other languages but the control-mechanisms tend to be quite coarse. Erlang and Elixir helps you think about how you design your application.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="326" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/258671812?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=44BBDD" width="580" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></p>
<p>On March 3<sup>rd</sup>, during a large East Coast winter storm, I headed to the ocean to capture some wave action. My travels eventually took me to Great Island Commons in New Castle, NH where Whaleback Lighthouse is prominently featured 0.8 miles offshore. I was hoping to capture big waves crashing around the lighthouse, and Mother Nature didn’t disappoint.</p>
<p>Great Island Common is a wide open park where people come to picnic during the summer and to watch the ocean during the winter. After arriving, I set up my tripod and my Canon 5D Mark IV with Sigma 150-600mm lens on a tripod and positioned myself just to the right of a tree in order to help reduce the pummeling Northerly winds. As many of you know, it’s a challenge keeping 600mm stable in high winds, even on a tripod.</p>
<p>I set the camera up and then waited until I saw a wave starting to hit the lighthouse. I then kept firing until the splash ended, not knowing ahead of time the action of the wave. Most shots never panned out, but about three of them over the course of about 45 minutes were pretty decent.</p>
<p>Once back at home, I culled through the images and choose one to edit and upload to Instagram, replacing an earlier upload that was done in haste while still in the parking lot.</p>
<p>When a local TV station shared the photo to their Facebook page (with permission) it started to receive a large amount of shares, comments, and likes; however, there was one comment that mentioned that I had stolen the image from another New England photographer, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ericgendronphotography/">Eric Gendon</a>. After letting the commenter know that it was indeed my image and that I possess the original RAW file, I headed over to the other photographers page and was blown away.</p>
<p>We had what looked like the exact same image, taken at the exact millisecond in time, from what looked like the same exact location and perspective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7338941576/Eric_Ron_sidebyside.jpeg" target="article-7338941576"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="282" src="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7338941576/Eric_Ron_sidebyside.jpeg" width="590" data-filename="Eric_Ron_sidebyside.jpeg" srcset="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/7338941576/Eric_Ron_sidebyside.jpeg 2x"></a></p>
<p>Aside from choices made in Lightroom, the photos at first glance look virtually identical aside from water in front and some of the white caps being in different position. Even then, the white caps were identical in size and shape—and I know those things are easily moved using the clone stamp in Photoshop—so I was concerned that maybe MY image was stolen and altered a bit.</p>
<p>Initially, I only had access to his shared, low-resolution, image so I wasn’t able to make out some of the very fine details that ultimately helped to convince me that we both had originals. After overlaying and aligning the images in Photoshop I was blown away that the lighthouse and waves were carbon copies, almost to the pixel. As mentioned already, there were many differences in the foreground water and the white caps on the horizon, and it was these differences that held me back from claiming he stole my image.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until another local photographer started comparing my photo to a higher resolution version of Eric’s image that he noticed that the iron gating around the top of the lighthouse had slightly different spacing between the vertical bars compared to my image. This would indicate that the other photographer was likely standing just a little bit left of where I was standing.</p>
<p>Since the 60D uses an APS-C sensor he would have also likely been back a little further to compensate for the 1.6x “zoom” / crop of the sensor or using a shorter focal length to compensate. This would also explain the white caps being in different positions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7338941576/Compare_with_circles.jpeg" target="article-7338941576"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="306" src="https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7338941576/Compare_with_circles.jpeg" width="507" data-filename="Compare_with_circles.jpeg"></a></p>
<p>However, the fact that the lighthouse doesn’t really show any rotational changes—and the crashing wave is an exact match—makes this all the more remarkable that these were captured randomly from two different photographers.</p>
<p>The next morning, Eric woke up to a flood of messages from me as well as other photographers, and immediately contacted me to share his EXIF data, and to agree that it was astounding that we both captured the exact same image of water motion at the exact millisecond in time. What makes this even more amazing is that this wasn’t a planned event (aka. sporting event, shuttle launch, etc.).</p>
<p>I also didn’t know Eric—we each chose this location randomly, and we both shot with different cameras (60D and 5D Mark IV) with different size sensors.</p>
<p>The 60D has a burst mode of 5.3fps, the 5DMKIV is 7fps; we both used a 600mm focal length; our exposures and depth-of-field were almost the same as well (F8 aperture, ISO 400, 1/1600<sup>th</sup> shutter vs. F8, ISO 320, 1/1000<sup>th</sup> shutter); and, ultimately, we both selected the same photo from that day to promote. Come to find out we were only <em>28 meters away from each other</em>. He was hunkered down under a picnic enclosure to help block some of the wind and I was up against a tree to help reduce the wind.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7338941576/Photographers_Position.jpeg" target="article-7338941576"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="507" src="https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7338941576/Photographers_Position.jpeg" width="590" data-filename="Photographers_Position.jpeg"></a></p>
<p>I did a Google search to see how often this happens and could only find one article from 2011 where two photographers filming a surf competition on Huntington Beach ended up catching a virtually identical image of a surfer and its wave action.</p>
<p>If you shoot water in burst mode you know how different each exposure is even when the difference in time is just 1/7<sup>th</sup> of a second between shots. And I have been leading night-sky photography workshops for five years and have had well over 200 photographers who are often aiming at the same subject, shooting with similar cameras and lenses, and capturing at the same moment in time, even doing continuous shooting for time lapse, and until now I have never seen two images that were so close as to be virtual clones of each other.</p>
<p>While this is a rare occurrence, I believe that with cameras getting faster and photographers taking more time to prepare for their shots, I have to imagine that these situations will happen more frequently. It happens every day with stationary or slow motion objects (buildings, sun/moon rise) but almost never with water movement.</p>
<p>One commenter on my FB post mentioned how this mistake brings to light the importance that post-processing plays in making your images your own. Here we had two essentially identical images—one edited to preserve a more natural feel, while the other image was edited to enhance the drama and emotion of the scene.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Let me introduce you to <a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/umon">μMon</a>, my
personal, minimalist, opinionated take on host monitoring based on
<a href="https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">RRDtool</a>, SNMP, some lightweight
shell scripting, and a small FastCGI server written using a modest
subset of modern C++.</p>

<p>Migrating my monitoring setup to <em>μMon</em> also serves as a case study
in <em>complexity reduction,</em> which is the broader theme of this post.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Here is an example of how <em>μMon</em> might look like:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/umon/aurora_main.png"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/umon/aurora_main_thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Main view of my Pinebook Pro (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>The above view covers the better part of my Pinebook Pro upgrading
itself to OpenBSD 7.1, compiling the whole system from source. The
vertical gaps are due to the machine being off.<sup><a href="#f1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Here is a second example with a different view on another host:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/umon/hq_ups.png"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/umon/hq_ups_thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Upsc view of the server that brought you this webpage (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>This view captures a short planned test of my UPS (visible in the
middle).  Data is sourced directly from the output of the <code>upsc</code>
command, as opposed to
<a href="https://github.com/tomscii/upsc-snmp-agent">SNMP</a>.
(Yeah, I know. Time for a new UPS battery.)</p>

<h2 id="why-μmon">Why μMon?</h2>

<p>I created <em>μMon</em> due to my love of minimalism and how short
existing solutions fall from that ideal. Specifically, I migrated my
stack of Prometheus + Grafana that I have been running at home for the
last couple years to <em>μMon</em>. By doing so, I managed to finally get
rid of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A full-blown time-series database (with gigabytes
of rolling on-disk data).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several Go binaries dozens of megabytes each, also consuming runtime
resources. (One of them got habitually stuck in an endless loop, so
I put in a crontab entry to restart it daily. I do not appreciate
black boxes like that.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lengthy configuration files and lengthy argument lists to said
binaries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Systems continuously talking to each other over the network (even
when nobody is looking at any dashboard), periodically pulling
metrics from nodes into Prometheus, which in turn runs all sorts of
consolidation routines on that data. A constant source of noise in
otherwise idling systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A mind-boggingly complex web front-end (Grafana) with its own
database, tons of JavaScript running in my browser, and role-based
access control over multiple users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A bespoke query language to pull metrics into dashboards, and lots
of specialized knowledge in how to build useful dashboards.  It is
all meant to be intuitive, but man, is it complicated!  (People
write whole books on how to operate and use this!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tons of eye candy I did not really mind, but did not really
appreciate either.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>No doubt this complex (and to me, opaque) stack would inevitably get
obsolete, necessitating migrations prone to failure, or demand my
attention in other, even less predictable ways. In short: keeping up
with the state of the art requires an ongoing investment.</p>

<p>I have a general inclination towards minimalism, and a preference for
long-term durable solutions that do not need continuous attention and
care. Having spent many years as a student of complexity (commonly
referred to as a career in IT), I have come to hate the kind of
surprises that complex (clever, if you will) systems are so prone to.
Nowadays, when I provision something, I ask: would this run for 10
years if I forgot about it? How long before it would break, or need to
be redeployed with a new (incompatible) major version? Or, if nothing
else, go hopelessly out of fashion (hello docker!)?</p>

<p>So I substituted all the above with an extremely lightweight stack
based on very well understood, several decades old concepts and
programs. I now have a system that is comprehensible in its scope and
size, and trivially understandable in its simplicity. I did this in
the hope that it will serve me for decades to come, without any undue
need of caring for it. In fact, my ambition was to solve the problem
of server monitoring <em>once and for all</em>, at least for all systems in
my care. This fits neatly into my overall strategy of establishing
fully autonomous, sustainable personal computing. Less bells and
whistles, less overhead and less <em>churn</em> equals less to worry about,
while keeping all the features actually needed.</p>

<p>By the way, I am not meaning to pick on Prometheus and Grafana in
particular. If you have used Cacti, Collectd, Graphite, InfluxDB,
Nagios, OpenNMS, Zabbix, or anything similar, then you will probably
agree that setting up and using any of these tools is anything but
simple. In fact, any monitoring stack will be similar to what I
described above in terms of its complexity.<sup><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>
Granted, if you get paid as a <del>sysadmin</del> <del><em>DevOps</em></del> <strong>Site
Reliability Engineer</strong>, you probably need to master some locally
useful combination of these comprehensive tools. If that is not your
job, and you want something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">simple and
stupid</a>, you might find
<em>μMon</em> interesting.</p>

<p>Keeping it simple and stupid is such a priority that as an all-time
reminder, I decided to include the word <em>simplicity</em> right in the
<em>μMon</em> logo I “designed”:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/umon/umon_logo_black.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In total, I estimate that I spent the equivalent of <em>at most</em> one week
of full-time engineering work (scattered over about a month of
evenings and weekends) on creating <em>μMon</em>. Including the logo!</p>

<p>Granted, <em>μMon</em> does not cater to every need, only my very own —
and those are definitely modest. I do not run anything that could be
considered modern or fashionable; I only run a bunch of Unix boxes (a
mixture of Linux and BSD). No Docker (or podman), no ProxMox, no
Kubernetes. Anywhere I get to decide, I use stable, proven, old
technology. In addition, my monitoring needs are fairly modest: I only
want basic metrics. Most importantly, I do not use any fancy alerting
functionality.<sup><a href="#f3">3</a></sup> That could be added on top of what
exists in <em>μMon</em>, but it stands for a sizable chunk of complexity
in the “real” monitoring systems mentioned above; getting it right is
very non-trivial, and not just from a technical
perspective.<sup><a href="#f4">4</a></sup> Since the small-scale servers I run
work pretty much unattended year in and year out, this is fine — I
only want to be able to look at metrics to spot trends and interesting
times to investigate by looking at event logs, etc.</p>

<p>That said, <em>μMon</em> gives me everything I have ever gotten from my
old setup (mostly the “interesting subset” of the output of
<code>node_exporter</code>, plus the metrics of a custom <code>upsc</code> feeder I hacked
together). And there are distinct advantages to <em>μMon</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A well understood, constant-space storage model thanks to RRDtool. I
know exactly how much disk space the aggregated data takes, and more
importantly, I know it will never grow beyond that extent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A well understood model of data consolidation and retention, built
on RRDtool’s consolidation functions. I can look back at anywhere
between the last one hour and the last two years, with the right
temporal resolution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Independent nodes. Each host runs <em>μMon</em> on its own, both to
collect metrics and to serve the webpage. There is no single point
of collection, storage, or access to the system, nor a single point
of failure. (Arguably, this can be a disadvantage depending on your
perspective, but it matches my preference.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very lightweight data collection. Each host collects its own metrics
in locally stored round-robin archives; data collection does not
incur any network activity. Configuration of metrics collection
equals listing the probes you want (but you can use all the power of
shell scripting, if you wish).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very simple server setup. I use <code>(x)inetd</code> to serve the FastCGI of
<em>μMon</em> via a TCP socket to whatever web server I have on the host
(or a different host). The <em>μMon</em> collector script is run by cron.
Everything that belongs to <em>μMon</em> resides and runs under an
unprivileged user.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extremely minimal dependencies. To install <em>μMon</em>, all I need is a
Unix system with a POSIX shell (<code>/bin/sh</code>), a modern C++ compiler,
and the ability to install <code>rrdtool</code>. No PHP (or other web toolkit),
no Python, no NodeJs. No database (time-series or relational). A
local webserver (with FastCGI support) is optional; a remote
webserver can act as the proxy as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Graphs (plots of certain groups of metrics) and views (collections
of graphs) can be created or modified any time, by editing simple,
small shell scripts. They can even be edited in place for immediate
effect (nothing to restart). Of course, knowledge of RRDtool and the
POSIX shell is mandatory, but then again, <em>μMon</em> is for hardcore
Unix sysadmins with modest needs.  Anything you need to know above
what is already etched into your brain you will find in the <code>rrd*</code>
man pages. But you can get started without changing anything.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="not-invented-here">Not invented here?</h2>

<p>You could argue that I am exhibiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH
syndrome</a> by
inventing my own (inferior) solution to a problem space well
understood and explored by many, many others. You would perhaps not be
very wrong.</p>

<p>To my defense, let me state that I am not forcing (not even
encouraging) anyone to adopt and use <em>μMon</em>. Rather, I am showing
it here as a case study in the noble pursuit of complexity reduction,
something that I feel is getting more and more important.  Especially
when focusing on one’s own personal computing affairs.</p>

<h2 id="reduction-in-complexity">Reduction in complexity</h2>

<p>Here is a table to recap the transition from all-in to minimal
complexity. Note that this is <em>not</em> a moral stance against higher
complexity, which you might need for fully legitimate reasons (such as
requiring complex alerting over metrics aggregated from different
hosts) that <em>μMon</em> does not support.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I am not saying that “big solutions” are necessarily bad or wrong. But
I do want to argue that there is a place for small, perhaps even
bespoke, site-only solutions that can serve the common 80% of needs
just as well, at several orders of magnitude less complexity. All the
while retaining nimbleness to be extended to cover the remaining 20%,
when prompted by actual need. There is something to be said for a
(figurative) napkin’s worth of code hacked together in a man-week that
is capable of bringing the same ultimate value as a full-fledged stack
that was no doubt developed in what is probably several man-decades
(if not centuries) of engineering work.  Sometimes a simple, dumb
solution can be fairly robust and complete. I believe <em>μMon</em> is a
good illustration of this general idea.</p>

<p>At the same time, I feel this is ultimately less of a surprise than it
might first seem. Let us not forget that running Unix-descended or
Unix-like systems means we are standing on the shoulders of giants: we
have time-proven architectural tenets, open standards and systems
programming APIs, plus free development tools at our disposal. On top
of that, the venerable RRDtool embeds some pretty sophisticated,
time-honed data sampling and graph rendering logic.  Granted, it takes
an educated sysadmin to make use of it all (being a competent systems
programmer as well is a big plus), but that is pretty much the
original intended audience of these operating systems.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tomscii/umon">μMon</a> is released to the public
under the BSD license (the same zero-clause flavour that OpenBSD
uses).  If you feel inclined to try it yourself, please recall that it
is not my goal to supply you (or the world) with a toolkit that works
out of the box and suits everyone. I am specifically not advocating
<em>μMon</em> as a direct substitute to any of the well-known monitoring
stacks.<sup><a href="#f5">5</a></sup> In the spirit of the BSD license, it is
simply my gift to the world. What you do with it (whether or not you
find it useful) is up to you.  At any rate, you are expected to read
your way through some simple shell scripts and adapt them to your
needs. That said, if you have educated questions or constructive
feedback (positive or negative) about it, feel free to <a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/id/">contact
me</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><b id="f1">1</b> The machine froze Friday night, which I did not
notice for over an hour. Apparently building the OpenBSD base system
with <code>-j 6</code> was too much to ask from the hardware, so I resumed with
my usual <code>-j 4</code>.</p>

<p><b id="f2">2</b> What looks like the closest existing solution to
<em>μMon</em> is a stack of programs called
<a href="https://wpd.home.xs4all.nl/symon/index.html">symon</a>, consisting of
(at least) <code>symon</code>, <code>symux</code> and <code>syweb</code>. This is also largely
RRDtool-based. But… the user needs to configure listeners with port
numbers just to get some data collection going; needs to install
RRDtool into a webserver chroot; needs a webserver with PHP enabled,
etc.</p>

<p><b id="f3">3</b> I do have my personal collection of cron-driven
scripts that check essentials (such as expired SSL certificates) and
email me if there is anything that needs my attention. I just prefer
to keep these things separate from monitoring data rates and disk
usage percentages.</p>

<p><b id="f4">4</b> I could rant about the incessant floods of useless
email/pager alerts coming from everywhere, seemingly so inseparable
from Big Tech Company Culture, complete with the inevitable result of
people ignoring/filtering them out, for a net result of precisely zero
business value achieved at a tremendous cost. But that is another post
patiently waiting to be written.</p>

<p><b id="f5">5</b> Let’s be real: <em>μMon</em> absolutely <em>does not</em>
support many of the important use cases of the more complicated
stacks. Do I care about any of it? Absolutely not. The point of this
exercise was not to create a rewrite of Prometheus + Grafana (they are
fine as is), but rather create something that is at least three orders
of magnitude smaller, while providing all the functionality I need.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Inside the row of workshops in an industrial stretch of Pacoima, men labored over hefty slabs of speckled stone, saws whining over the sounds of Spanish-language rock.</p><p>Pale dust rose around them as they worked. Many went without masks. Some had water spurting from their machines, but others had nothing to tamp down the powder rising in the air.</p><p>"Nobody uses water," one man in a Dodgers cap said in Spanish when Maria Cabrera approached, holding flyers about silicosis, an incurable and suffocating disease that has devastated dozens of workers across the state and killed men who have barely reached middle age.</p><p>Cabrera, a community outreach worker with the nonprofit Pacoima Beautiful, urged him and others at the Branford Street site to try to protect themselves. Silicosis can ravage the lungs of workers after they inhale tiny particles of crystalline silica while they cut and grind stone that contains the mineral.</p><p>The disease dates back centuries, but researchers say the booming popularity of countertops made of engineered stone, which has much <a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA3768.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:higher concentrations of silica;elm:context_link;itc:0">higher concentrations of silica</a> than many kinds of natural stone, has driven a new epidemic of an accelerated form of the suffocating illness. As the dangerous dust builds up and scars the lungs, the disease can leave workers short of breath, weakened and ultimately suffering from lung failure.</p><p>"You can get a transplant," Cabrera told the man in Spanish, "but it won't last."</p><p>In California, it has begun to debilitate young workers, largely Latino immigrants who cut and polish slabs of engineered stone. Instead of cropping up in people in their 60s or 70s after decades of exposure, it is now afflicting men in their 20s, 30s or 40s, said Dr. Jane Fazio, a pulmonary critical care physician who became alarmed by cases she saw at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center. Some California patients have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6838a1.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:died in their 30s;elm:context_link;itc:0">died in their 30s</a>.</p><p>"They're young guys who essentially have a terminal diagnosis," Fazio said.</p><p><b>Read more:</b> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/community-civic-engagement-government-participation?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=promo_module&amp;utm_campaign=rss_feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shape Your L.A. — at the county level;elm:context_link;itc:0">Shape Your L.A. — at the county level</a></p><p>In Pacoima, a 27-year-old father said he now has to hustle home from the park with his 8-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son because his oxygen tank starts to run out as they play. Leobardo Segura Meza said he could no longer run around on the soccer field or exercise the way he used to.</p><p>Nor is he able to work. For a decade, he made a living by cutting, polishing and installing countertops in and around Los Angeles County. Dust was everywhere, he said, and he was given only a dust mask — one he said was inadequate for the job — to protect himself. Sometimes he brought a hose and tried to attach it to the machine to reduce dust, but there were no machines dispensing water as they were cutting, he said.</p><p>He began to suffer a cough that wouldn't go away and lost his breath when going up stairs, he said. His weight dropped. At one point, he was hospitalized when one of his lungs collapsed.</p><p>Segura Meza had never heard of silicosis before he was diagnosed. "There's no cure for this illness. The only thing they can do is a lung transplant," he said in Spanish.</p><p>What he fears, he said, is that as more workers grow ill, "there aren't enough lungs for us." At a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAsUzZtipiI" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:state hearing;elm:context_link;itc:0">state hearing</a> this summer, Segura Meza said two of his co-workers had already died waiting for transplants.</p><p>To warn workers about the threat, Cabrera and another Pacoima Beautiful outreach worker, Claudia Vasquez, made their rounds at the parking lot of the Home Depot in San Fernando, where laborers in long-sleeve shirts waited for people to drive up and offer them work. Few had heard of the disease.</p><p>"It's very dangerous, this illness?" asked one man in Spanish, leaning against a palm tree in the parking lot.</p><p>Cabrera told him there was no cure. She urged him to use wet saws to limit any dangerous dust rising in the air and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/index.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIOSH;elm:context_link;itc:0">NIOSH</a>-approved respirators to avoid breathing it in. <a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA3768.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Workplace safety regulators;elm:context_link;itc:0">Workplace safety regulators</a> have recommended a suite of measures including water spraying systems, ventilation and vacuum systems to clear dust, in addition to protective respirators for workers — ones covering the entire face if silica levels in the air are high.</p><p>The risk is serious for workers in the industry: Although estimates of its prevalence vary from <a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.202008-3297LE" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0">study</a> to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31562234/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0">study</a>, some <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/health/lung-disease-present-in-20-per-cent-of-queensland-stonemasons/778abf2c-f177-4334-ab9a-e144fd84b232" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:screenings;elm:context_link;itc:0">screenings</a> in Australia have found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10423513/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:roughly 1 in 5;elm:context_link;itc:0">roughly 1 in 5</a> stone workers had the disease. In California, workplace safety regulators have <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/oshsb/documents/petition-597-CalOSHAeval.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:estimated;elm:context_link;itc:0">estimated</a> that out of roughly 4,000 workers in the industry across the state, silicosis will afflict between 485 and 848 — and that as many as 161 could ultimately die.</p><p>A recent <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2807615" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0">study</a> by UCLA and UCSF physicians found that among dozens of California workers who got silicosis from grinding countertops, nearly a fifth had died. Their median age at death was 46. More than half had suffered delays in getting diagnosed, as the disease was mistaken for bacterial pneumonia or tuberculosis, and over a third already had severe scarring in their lungs when they were diagnosed.</p><p>Los Angeles County has been an epicenter of the debilitating disease, with 60 out of the 83 cases among countertop workers identified across the state since 2019 by the California Department of Public Health.</p><p>The San Fernando Valley is a hub for the stone "fabrication" industry — those who cut and polish the slabs made by manufacturers — and county officials also said that growing awareness spurred by Fazio and others may have resulted in better reporting of such cases in L.A. In July, the state sent out an advisory to healthcare providers about the threat, recommending that physicians ask if ailing patients have worked as countertop cutters and urging them to report any identified cases of silicosis to the state.</p><p>California workplace safety regulators are now drafting emergency rules to try to protect workers as engineered stone has come to dominate the countertop industry. The material is also sometimes called artificial or synthetic stone, made with crushed quartz bound together with resin. L.A. County is exploring whether to go further and ban the sale and installation of "silica engineered stone" entirely.</p><p>Existing safety standards must be followed, but "we feel that there need to be additional changes to the standards to make it even more safe in the workplace," said Dr. Nichole Quick, deputy director of health protection with the L.A. County public health department.</p><p>The county department is now preparing a report requested by county supervisors on options for a potential ban, as well as other possible steps. It has also partnered with Pacoima Beautiful to provide outreach. "This is a preventable disease," Quick said, "and we want to take appropriate action to make these workplaces safer."</p><p>One question before the county — and government regulators across the globe — is whether any safeguards will effectively protect workers grinding materials so high in silica. The Agglomerated Stone Manufacturers Assn., an international group representing manufacturers of engineered stone, <a href="https://www.astaworldwide.com/general-statement-engineered-stone-manufacturers-association-a-st-a-world-wide/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:maintains;elm:context_link;itc:0">maintains</a> its products can be cut "with no safety issues or health hazards if it is performed according to the best practices."</p><p>In a statement, the association said the risk lies not with engineered stone itself, but poor adherence to safety measures by fabricators, arguing that safety regulations need to be "simplified and rigorously enforced." Members of the Stone Coalition, which represents fabricators as well as manufacturers, said an L.A. County ban would have "severe economic consequences" and argued for additional enforcement and training on workplace safety, especially efforts to eliminate "dry cutting."</p><p>And the Los Angeles County Business Federation contended that enforcing safety regulations "will do more to prevent disease, while not adversely [affecting] the cost of construction at a time when Los Angeles is seeing a devastating housing crisis."</p><p>But Raphael Metzger, a Long Beach attorney who represents Segura Meza and other workers suing manufacturers of engineered stone such as Cambria and Caesarstone for damages, argued that typical respirators and other standard measures don't go far enough. Even with many "wet methods," workers can be exposed to dangerous levels of silica and need additional protection, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/surveyreports/pdfs/2021-DFSE-710.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHEPHB2021DFSE710" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIOSH research;elm:context_link;itc:0">NIOSH research</a> has found.</p><p><b>Read more:</b> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-14/tens-of-thousands-of-kaiser-healthcare-workers-approve-possible-strike?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=promo_module&amp;utm_campaign=rss_feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tens of thousands of Kaiser healthcare workers approve possible strike;elm:context_link;itc:0">Tens of thousands of Kaiser healthcare workers approve possible strike</a></p><p>Nearly half of the workers suffering silicosis in the UCLA and UCSF study said their workplaces were using water to control dust. Roughly a quarter said they always had respiratory protection. Fazio said studies have found that in many shops, dust is so thick in the air that respirators cannot filter out a sufficient amount.</p><p>Metzger argued that the kind of sophisticated and costly measures that would be needed to reliably protect workers cutting engineered stone are not economically plausible in an industry where immigrant workers typically labor in small shops and are often paid in cash. Engineered stone "is too dangerous to be used safely," he said. "If there’s any industrial product that should be banned, this is the product."</p><p>Segura Meza agreed, calling it "very deadly." Vasquez, with Pacoima Beautiful, said that when she and Cabrera started talking to workers about engineered stone and silicosis, many of them asked, "How come they don't do anything with the stores that sell the products?"</p><p>In Australia, where the government is <a href="https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/media-centre/news/closing-soon-consultation-prohibition-use-engineered-stone" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weighing whether to ban;elm:context_link;itc:0">weighing whether to ban</a> engineered stone, a professional group whose members assess worker health hazards concluded that the high concentration of silica in engineered stone makes it difficult for measures such as wet cutting and ventilation to adequately protect workers.</p><p>Additional measures for respiratory protection are needed, but such systems "have largely been absent from this sector," the Australian Institute of Occupational Hygienists wrote. In light of those concerns, it <a href="https://www.aioh.org.au/product/consultation-on-the-prohibition-on-the-use-of-engineered-stone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommended;elm:context_link;itc:0">recommended</a> prohibiting engineered stone containing more than 10% crystalline silica, but said it would also support banning all engineered stone because of the rigorous compliance needed even at a 10% level.</p><p>In California, existing rules to protect workers have often not been followed, state regulators found. Cal/OSHA, which is now hustling to draft emergency standards to protect California workers in the stone cutting and polishing industry, found rampant violations of the current standards when it looked closer in 2019 and 2020.</p><p>Despite the rise of the deadly disease, homeowners and other consumers shopping for countertops know little about the threat it could pose to the workers behind the surfaces in their kitchens and bathrooms, Fazio said. Engineered stone is now estimated to represent more than 60% of materials used for countertops, the L.A. County business federation said, and market researchers say its popularity is <a href="https://www.freedoniagroup.com/industry-study/engineered-stone-countertops-4395.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:only expected to rise;elm:context_link;itc:0">only expected to rise</a>.</p><p>Engineered stone “is everywhere and people have no idea," Fazio said. Consumers "have a right to know that the countertop that might be the cheapest one ... may really be costing folks' lives."</p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/newsletters/essential-california?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=newsletter_module&amp;utm_campaign=essential-california" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

 <li><p><strong>The sample capsule has arrived at the highly-secured clean room facility in Utah following its landing earlier this morning in the desert.</strong> This significant moment marks the successful delivery from the Utah desert into the clean room, and of course the 1.2 billion-mile journey from the asteroid Bennu back to Earth.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Mission members also obtained samples from the surrounding area of the landing zone. </strong>Nasa TV showed scientists taking photos around the landing zone as well as measuring air and gas levels.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Sir Brian May, of Queen, has told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa" data-link-name="in body link">Nasa</a> TV he is “immensely proud” to be a team member of Osiris-Rex. </strong>May was among those who helped to identify the location on Bennu where the samples would be collected.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>Nasa administrator Bill Nelson hailed the Osiris-Rex mission’s success following its capsule’s landing in the Utah desert today. “</strong>This mission proves that NASA does big things, things that have inspired us, things that unite us,” he said.</p></li>
 <li><p><strong>By studying the samples from Bennu, scientists can compare their results against the data they obtained from instruments on board the spacecraft. </strong>This ‘ground-truthing’ means they can then calibrate the latter, allowing them to more accurately explore differences in composition across the surface of Bennu.</p></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Systems Approach</span> With the annual SIGCOMM conference taking place this month, we observed that congestion control still gets an hour in the program, 35 years after the first paper on TCP congestion control was published. So it seems like a good time to appreciate just how much the success of the internet has depended on its approach to managing congestion.</p>
<p>Following my recent <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://peertube.roundpond.net/w/1hSTyT2J4cKrLaoU3sJeqT">talk</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/28/60_years_of_networking/">article</a> on 60 years of networking, which focused almost entirely on the internet and ARPANET, I received quite a few comments about various networking technologies that were competing for ascendancy at the same time.</p>
<p>These included the OSI stack (anyone remember CLNP and TP4?), the Coloured Book protocols (including the Cambridge Ring), and of course ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) which was actually the first networking protocol on which I worked in depth. It’s hard to fathom now, but in the 1980s I was one of many people who thought that ATM might be the packet switching technology to take over the world.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I rate congestion control as one of the key factors that enabled the internet to progress from moderate to global scale</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ATM proponents used to refer to existing technologies such as Ethernet and TCP/IP as “legacy” protocols that could, if necessary, be carried over the global ATM network once it was established. One of my fond memories from those days is of Steve Deering (a pioneer of IP networking) boldly (and correctly) stating that ATM would never be successful enough to even be a legacy protocol.</p>
<p>One reason I skipped over these other protocols when earlier retelling the history of networking was simply to save space – it’s a little-known fact that my Systems Approach colleague Larry Peterson and I aim for brevity, especially since receiving a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IVEX207N7WY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B004VF6216">one-star review</a> on Amazon that called our book “a wall of text.” But I was also focused on how we got to the internet of today, where TCP/IP has effectively out-competed other protocol suites to achieve global (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/28/cloud_native_principles_wireless_networks/">or near-global</a>) penetration.</p>

    

<p>There are many theories about why TCP/IP was more successful than its contemporaries, and they are not readily testable. Most likely, there were many factors that played into the success of the internet protocols. But I rate congestion control as one of the key factors that enabled the internet to progress from moderate to global scale.</p>

        


        

<p>It is also an interesting study in how the particular architectural choices made in the 1970s proved themselves over the subsequent decades.</p>
<h3>Distributed resource management</h3>
<p>In David Clark’s paper [<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://ccr.sigcomm.org/archive/1995/jan95/ccr-9501-clark.pdf">PDF</a>] “The Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols," a stated design goal is: “The internet architecture must permit distributed management of its resources.” There are many different implications of that goal, but the way that Jacobson and Karels [<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://ee.lbl.gov/papers/congavoid.pdf">PDF</a>] first implemented congestion control in TCP is a good example of taking that principle to heart.</p>
<p>Their approach also embraces another design goal of the internet: accommodate many different types of networks. Taken together, these principles pretty much rule out the possibility of any sort of network-based admission control, a sharp contrast to networks such as ATM, which assumed that a request for resources would be made from an end-system to the network before data could flow.</p>
<p>Part of the “accommodate many types of networks” philosophy is that you can’t assume that all networks have admission control. Couple that with distributed management of resources and you end up with congestion control being something that end-systems have to handle, which is exactly what Jacobson and Karels did with their initial changes to TCP.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We’re trying to get millions of end-systems to cooperatively share the bandwidth of bottleneck links in some fair way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The history of TCP congestion control is long enough to fill a book (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://tcpcc.systemsapproach.org/">and we did</a>) but the work done at Berkeley from 1996 to 1998 casts a long shadow, with Jacobson’s <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/52324.52356">1988 SIGCOMM paper</a> ranking among the most cited networking papers of all time.</p>
<p>Slow-start, AIMD (additive increase, multiplicative decrease), RTT estimation, and the use of packet loss as a congestion signal were all in that paper, laying the groundwork for the following decades of congestion control research. One reason for that paper's influence, I believe, is that the foundation it laid was solid, while it left plenty of room for future improvements–as we see in the continued efforts to improve congestion control today.</p>

        

<p>And the problem is fundamentally hard: we’re trying to get millions of end-systems that have no direct contact with each other to cooperatively share the bandwidth of bottleneck links in some moderately fair way using only the information that can be gleaned by sending packets into the network and observing when and whether they reach their destination.</p>

<p>Arguably one of the biggest leaps forward after 1988 was the realization by Brakmo and Peterson (yes, that guy) that packet loss wasn't the only signal of congestion: so too was increasing delay. This was the basis for the 1994 <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/190809.190317">TCP Vegas paper</a>, and the idea of using delay rather than loss alone was quite controversial at the time.</p>
<p>However, Vegas kicked off a new trend in congestion control research, inspiring many other efforts to take delay into account as an early indicator of congestion before loss occurs. Data center TCP (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1851275.1851192">DCTCP</a>) and Google’s <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/google/bbr">BBR</a> are two examples.</p>
<p>One reason that I give credit to congestion control algorithms in explaining the success of the internet is that the path to failure of the internet was clearly on display in 1986. Jacobson describes some of the early congestion collapse episodes, which saw throughput fall by three orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>When I joined Cisco in 1995 we were still hearing customer stories about catastrophic congestion episodes. The same year Bob Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/23/turing_award_goes_to_robert/">recent Turing Award winner</a>, famously predicted that the internet would collapse as consumer internet access and the rise of the web drove rapid growth in traffic. It didn’t.</p>

        

<p>Congestion control has continued to evolve, with the QUIC protocol, for example, offering both better mechanisms for detecting congestion and the option of experimenting with multiple congestion control algorithms. And some congestion control has moved into the application layer, eg: Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/09/09/mpeg_dash_web_vid_spec/">DASH</a>).</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/16/datacenter_east_west_security/">Why securing East-West network traffic is so important – and how it can be done</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/25/building_private_5g/">Building your own private 5G is as easy as Wi-Fi</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/07/quic_tcp_replacement/">If you need a TCP replacement, you won't find a QUIC one</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/26/network_edge/">The internet's edge routers are all so different. What if we unified them with software?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>An interesting side effect of the congestion episodes of the 1980s and 1990s was that we observed that small buffers were sometimes the cause of congestion collapse. An <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/205511.205520">influential paper</a> by Villamizar and Song showed that TCP performance dropped when the amount of buffering was less than the average delay × bandwidth product of the flows.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the result only held for very small numbers of flows (as was acknowledged in the paper) but it was widely interpreted as an inviolable rule that influenced the next several years of router design.</p>
<p>This was finally debunked by the buffer sizing work of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1015467.1015499">Appenzeller <em>et al</em></a> in 2004, but not before the unfortunate phenomenon of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/">Bufferbloat</a> – truly excessive buffer sizes leading to massive queuing delays – had made it into millions of low-end routers. The <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat">self-test</a> for Bufferbloat in your home network is worth a look.</p>
<p>So, while we don’t get to go back and run controlled experiments to see exactly how the internet came to succeed while other protocol suites fell by the wayside, we can at least see that the internet avoided potential failure because of the timely way congestion control was added.</p>
<p>It was relatively easy in 1986 to experiment with new ideas by tweaking the code in a couple of end-systems, and then push the effective solution out to a wide set of systems. Nothing inside the network had to change. It almost certainly helped that the set of operating systems that needed to be changed and the community of people who could make those changes was small enough to see widespread deployment of the initial BSD-based algorithms of Jacobson and Karels.</p>
<p>It seems clear that there is no such thing as the perfect congestion control approach, which is why we continue to see new papers on the topic 35 years after Jacobson’s. But the internet's architecture has fostered the environment in which effective solutions can be tested and deployed to achieve distributed management of shared resources.</p>
<p>In my view that’s a great testament to the quality of that architecture. ®</p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-what" dir="auto"><a href="#what">What?</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">Have you ever wanted to use your Kindle Paperwhite to write, even more, with a vim-like editor? This is what PiWrite is for.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-how" dir="auto"><a href="#how">How?</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">The TL;DR is <em>a webserver running somewhere a keyboard can be plugged, and a page opened in the Kindle's web browser</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The not-so-short version requires more effort and details, but is the UX I wanted to get:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A <strong>Raspberry Pi Zero W</strong>…</li>
<li>Paired with a <strong>Bluetooth keyboard</strong>…</li>
<li>Set up in <strong>access point mode</strong>…</li>
<li>With <strong>this package</strong> installed…</li>
<li>And configured to <strong>start automatically</strong> on boot.</li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-why" dir="auto"><a href="#why">Why?</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">I was inspired by <a href="https://solarwriter.msol.io/" rel="nofollow">SolarWriter by Michael Solomon</a>. I had always wanted to use my Kindle for writing. SolarWriter solves that by setting up a local web server on your phone (iOS or Android), then you type with a Bluetooth keyboard paired with it. But you need to set up hotspot, keep your screen on… I didn't like those parts. So I wrote this.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-contributions" dir="auto"><a href="#contributions">Contributions?</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">This is open source, and I'll be happy to see it extended and improved. But I'm unlikely to accept contributions: I want a reduced feature set, with only what <em>I</em> need. This is why I didn't release this to PyPI, so anybody can have its own version with custom tweaks and installs it easily from their own repository.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you need a Pi, I can't recommend <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/" rel="nofollow">Pimoroni</a> enough. I'm not affiliated, I just buy always from them.</p>
<p dir="auto">The instructions below may be missing some piece, I have written it based on my bash history and what I remember having to tweak. With the information of <em>what</em> you need to do, there are plenty of tutorials on how to approach each step though.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-basics" dir="auto"><a href="#basics">Basics</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Best is installing a lightweight Raspbian version, since the Zero is not a terribly fast machine. By "mistake" (I was trying something) I updated the lite version (on Buster, I think) to Bookworm. Don't do that, not needed.</p>
<p dir="auto">To configure everything you will need to set up the Raspberry for <code>ssh</code> access, and better with password. For using it as a "magical thing that lets the Kindle work as a text editor" is better if you disable requiring password for logging in via <code>tty</code>. You can enable this (known as autologin) by running <code>sudo raspi-config</code>, in the <em>System Options</em> section. You specifically want <em>Console autologin</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You also better set up wifi connectivity too. You can set this up by adding a wpa_supplicant.conf file to the boot partition of the SD card with contents like the following:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="network={
    ssid=&quot;YOUR_NETWORK_NAME&quot;
    psk=&quot;YOUR_PASSWORD&quot;
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}"><pre><code>network={
    ssid="YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
    psk="YOUR_PASSWORD"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Steps needed after this:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Pair with a Bluetooth keyboard;</li>
<li>Set up a wireless access point on your Raspberry;</li>
<li>Install the package and set it up;</li>
<li>Nice-to-have: ssh via USB (there are many tutorials for this).</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-pairing-with-a-bluetooth-keyboard" dir="auto"><a href="#pairing-with-a-bluetooth-keyboard">Pairing with a Bluetooth keyboard</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Pick your poison. The standard way is using <code>bluetoothctl</code>. I found that installing <a href="https://darkhz.github.io/bluetuith/Installation.html" rel="nofollow">Bluetuith</a> was more convenient to be sure the pairing had worked. On the con side, you need to install the whole Go runtime.</p>
<p dir="auto">Remember: the keyboard will be usable in the <code>tty</code> session, not in any ssh-initiated session.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want any fancy keyboard configuration (I use Colemak, and like my caps to be control) you will have to edit <code>/etc/default/keyboard</code> and add something like the following:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="XKBMODEL=&quot;pc105&quot;
XKBLAYOUT=&quot;us&quot;
XKBVARIANT=&quot;colemak&quot;
XKBOPTIONS=&quot;ctrl:nocaps&quot;"><pre><code>XKBMODEL="pc105"
XKBLAYOUT="us"
XKBVARIANT="colemak"
XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:nocaps"
</code></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-wireless-access-point" dir="auto"><a href="#wireless-access-point">Wireless access point</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">I followed the instructions from here: <a href="https://www.stevemurch.com/setting-up-a-raspberry-pi-for-ad-hoc-networking-tech-note/2022/12" rel="nofollow">Turn a Raspberry Pi into a Web Server with Its Own Wifi Network (Tech Note)</a>. From these instructions, you can (optionally) skip the routing stuff for this. Although the post mentions <em>only</em> working in Buster, I followed the exact same steps and worked just fine in Bookworm.</p>
<p dir="auto">The TL;DR version:</p>
<p dir="auto">Get the access point and DNS services</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo apt install hostapd dnsmasq"><pre><code>sudo apt install hostapd dnsmasq
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Turn it on</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl enable hostapd"><pre><code>sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl enable hostapd
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Edit <code>/etc/dhcpcd.conf</code> (sudo) and add at the end</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface wlan0
    static ip_address=192.168.11.1/24
    nohook wpa_supplicant"><pre><code>interface wlan0
    static ip_address=192.168.11.1/24
    nohook wpa_supplicant
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><span>Important</span><br>
When you want to re-connect your Zero to your wifi, you need to comment this out, otherwise you are out of AP access and out of SSH via Wifi (or even USB gadget) access. If you forget, you'll need to edit the raw disk from another Linux device.</p>
<p dir="auto">You now need to configure <code>/etc/dnsmasq.conf</code> with</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface=wlan0 # Listening interface
dhcp-range=192.168.11.2,192.168.11.20,255.255.255.0,24h
                # Pool of IP addresses served via DHCP
domain=write     # Local wireless DNS domain
address=/pi/192.168.11.1
                # Alias for this router"><pre><code>interface=wlan0 # Listening interface
dhcp-range=192.168.11.2,192.168.11.20,255.255.255.0,24h
                # Pool of IP addresses served via DHCP
domain=write     # Local wireless DNS domain
address=/pi/192.168.11.1
                # Alias for this router
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">and now that you are at it, change <code>/etc/hostname</code> to be <code>pi</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Finally, configure <code>/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf</code> with (use your country code, of course)</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="country_code=CH
interface=wlan0
ssid=EnchantedRose
hw_mode=g
channel=7
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
wpa=2
wpa_passphrase=CHOOSE SOMETHING
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP"><pre><code>country_code=CH
interface=wlan0
ssid=EnchantedRose
hw_mode=g
channel=7
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
wpa=2
wpa_passphrase=CHOOSE SOMETHING
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now, reboot (<code>sudo shutdown -r now</code> or <code>sudo systemctl reboot</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">If you ever want to disable AP and enable normal wifi, run <code>sudo systemctl disable hostapd dnsmasq</code> AND remove the static IP setting mentioned above.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-install-the-package-and-set-it-up" dir="auto"><a href="#install-the-package-and-set-it-up">Install the package and set it up</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Install pipx with <code>sudo apt install pipx</code> and then install piwrite with</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pipx install piwrite@git+https://github.com/rberenguel/PiWrite"><pre>pipx install piwrite@git+https://github.com/rberenguel/PiWrite</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You'll want to add <code>pipx</code>'s binaries to the path, for example by adding <code>export PATH="/home/YOU/.local/bin:$PATH"</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since the ideal experience is <em>not</em> having to add a port in the Kindle browser, the default port piwrite uses is 80. But that needs allowlisting:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>sudo setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip /usr/bin/python3.11</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Tweak the Python version depending on what you have.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can test if it works (i.e.. if it is the right version or not) or not by starting piwrite now (you may need to change the exported host).</p>
<p dir="auto">You'll also want to start piwrite on <code>tty</code> user start, you can do this by adding the following to the end of your <code>.profile</code></p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="export PIWRITE_HOST=pi.write # or pi, if it's not under the access point
piwrite"><pre><code>export PIWRITE_HOST=pi.write # or pi, if it's not under the access point
piwrite
</code></pre></div>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-some-oddities" dir="auto"><a href="#some-oddities">Some oddities</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">The Kindle browser is weird and does not support everything. No websockets, only longpolling (or so it seems). For some reason, only version 3.0 of the socketio JavaScript libraries worked correctly. I found no way to get the Kindle browser to rotate the whole page via CSS so I could have a landscape view.</p>
<p dir="auto">My first trial implementation tried using pynvim (the NeoVim API layer) as the underlying editor. That would have been awesome, real vim! But it didn't work for obscure reasons (I had to do some unholy things with asyncio that caused it to explode easily).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-development" dir="auto"><a href="#development">Development</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">I wrote half of this directly on the Zero from my iPad, using <a href="https://blink.sh/" rel="nofollow">Blink</a> to SSH into it. The second half, I wrote it on my iPad with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/es/app/ivim/id1266544660?l=en-GB" rel="nofollow">iVim</a>, <a href="https://ish.app/" rel="nofollow">ish</a> and <a href="https://apps.pdyn.net/inspect/" rel="nofollow">Inspect Browser</a>. The finishing touches (moving to Poetry and cleaning up), on my Mac. For local development, you can then use basically anything. Just choose a valid port for your system and make sure the host is valid. 127.0.0.1 is the default choice and the one that should work.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-behavior="newsletter_promo dfp_article_rendering" data-dfp-adword="Advertisement" data-newsletterpromo_article-text="<p>Sign up for <em>Scientific American</em>&amp;rsquo;s free newsletters.</p>" data-newsletterpromo_article-image="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/4641809D-B8F1-41A3-9E5A87C21ADB2FD8_source.png" data-newsletterpromo_article-button-text="Sign Up" data-newsletterpromo_article-button-link="https://www.scientificamerican.com/page/newsletter-sign-up/?origincode=2018_sciam_ArticlePromo_NewsletterSignUp" name="articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Farmworkers in California's Central Valley know that when the tule fog settles over the ground after a heavy rain, some of them are about to get sick. Within a few weeks of the dense fog's arrival, many of the laborers grow tired and develop headaches and fevers. Each time, those who have evaded illness wonder whether they will be next. Experienced farmworkers expect this affliction, but when Rosalinda Guillen arrived from Washington State 25 years ago, she had never seen anything like it. She watched, helpless, as other farmworkers coughed and tried to catch their breath.</p>

<p>That was the first time Guillen, a seasonal farmworker and agricultural justice leader, heard the term “Valley fever.” The disease is caused by two species of shapeshifting fungus in the genus <em>Coccidioides</em>, both of which flourish when exposed to moist springs and arid summers—like those in the San Joaquin Valley, where the fever got its name. Guillen had not encountered such a thing in her home state. But because of drier landscapes and warming temperatures, the fungus's range appears to be spreading.</p>

<p>No one knows for sure whether wind is moving <em>Coccidioides</em> north or whether it has been there undisturbed until now. But even as researchers have been discovering it in new pockets throughout the western U.S., many state health departments have failed to track it. What limited data exist indicate that 40 percent of cases become symptomatic, and among those the people most at risk of life-threatening disease are Latino, Asian and Native American people, who contract Valley fever at two to four times the rate of white people. That increased risk seems to be primarily attributable to their frequent exposure and long hours spent in dusty outdoor locations, although genetic variations haven't yet been ruled out.</p>

<p>Many of those affected lack basic health care, and some are afraid to seek medical help for fear of employer retaliation or even deportation. As a result, Valley fever is undersurveilled and underdiagnosed, and its study and treatment are underfunded. Research on the condition has remained limited, but it's clear that the disease disproportionately strikes people in the most vulnerable populations.</p>

<p>After decades of neglect, however, there's a new push at both the local and federal levels to find out more about the extent of Valley fever's threat. In addition, a small group of researchers is working to understand how to treat and even prevent it. That knowledge can't come soon enough, Guillen says: “All we really know is that farmworkers may already be sick.”</p>

<h2>Growing Evidence</h2>

<p>Valley fever thrives both in dirt and in human lungs. After a heavy rain, the fast-growing <em>Coccidioides</em> spreads through the wet soil like mold through bread. When it dries out, its spores mingle with dusty topsoil and can be inhaled as airborne pathogens. Once they're in the lungs, those spores take on a wholly different form, each morphing into a reproductive cell in which new spores multiply. The full cells burst within five days, releasing spores that travel throughout the body. The fungus can cause coughing, fevers, body aches, fatigue, rashes and appetite loss. In up to 10 percent of those infected, some symptoms can last for years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that about 200 people die from the disease every year.</p>

<p>Bridget Barker, a mycologist and geneticist at Northern Arizona University, has spent her decades-long career figuring out how to detect <em>Coccidioides</em> and understand its role in the larger ecosystem. She and her team designed a probe to extract it from the soil so they can analyze it. Their research has revealed the fungus's resilience: <em>Coccidioides</em> needs moisture to grow, flourishing when the rains arrive, then stagnating when the ground dries up again. Its spores remain in the topsoil, where they can survive for years.</p>

<p>Barker and others refer to this process as the “grow-and-blow” cycle: once the fungus stops growing and becomes dehydrated, wind picks up the spores and carries them to new areas. This may be one way <em>Coccidioides</em> has expanded into the Pacific Northwest from the southwestern states, such as California, Arizona and New Mexico, where it is endemic. Researchers at the University of California, Irvine, predict that if warming trends continue and droughts persist, Valley fever could eventually stretch as far north as the U.S.-Canada border and as far northeast as North Dakota.</p>

<p>Amanda Gomez-Weaver, a doctoral student in environmental health sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, has been investigating the correlation between climate-influenced dust exposure and Valley fever epidemiology. Previous research had indicated that spores can become airborne anytime dirt is disrupted, making people working in construction and agriculture particularly susceptible. Gomez-Weaver has also found a strong association between Valley fever incidence and ambient dust, indicating that spores become suspended in the air and linger there much like other atmospheric particulates. This work has convinced her that anyone who spends most of their day in dusty outdoor areas in the western U.S. would need a <em>Coccidioides</em> vaccine to remain uninfected. To date, however, no vaccine is available for any fungal disease. A vaccine, Gomez-Weaver says, “would be the most powerful tool in our arsenal.”</p>

<h2>The Data GAP</h2>

<p>Valley fever's mortality rate is about one death per 1,000 infections, according to infectious disease physician John Galgiani, director of the University of Arizona's Valley Fever Center for Excellence. It doesn't need to be so high. There are medications to treat it, but patients often receive incorrect diagnoses.</p>

<p>Physicians and other health-care practitioners who work where Valley fever is prevalent often don't know to test for it, because there's a general lack of awareness about the disease and because its symptoms can be mistaken for other respiratory illnesses, such as pneumonia. Patients usually end up with antibiotics or other medications that kill bacteria but not fungi.</p>

<p>The CDC estimates that only one in 33 cases is reported and has suggested that hundreds of thousands of infections have probably been missed over the past 10 years. Because the organization does not mandate that public health departments report Valley fever—only 26 states have submitted case numbers—it has no data at all from some states where the fungus is endemic, such as Texas and Idaho.</p>

<p>Farmworkers and laborers who toil in the dusty outdoors, most often people of color, have been trying to get the attention of state and federal agencies for decades. “If something is harming us,” Guillen says, “it's hard to prove based on the way that data-collecting systems are structured.”</p>

<h2>Proof of Concept</h2>

<p>To show that a vaccine could be effective protection against <em>Coccidioides</em>, Galgiani and his team started by focusing on an immunization for dogs with the infection. Dogs are vulnerable to the disease, too. Because they explore the environment through their noses and can inhale large quantities of fungal spores in a short time, they contract Valley fever more often than humans do, and their symptoms can be more severe.</p>

<p>The canine vaccine Galgiani helped to develop has already proved itself. It uses attenuated live spores of <em>Coccidioides</em> that can't reproduce but still prompt an immune reaction in the body. The response they elicit is so robust that a veterinary pharmaceutical company has licensed the rights to the vaccine and is seeking approval from the Department of Agriculture for its use in pets. Galgiani has now moved on to humans.</p>

<p>One potential benefit of a Valley fever vaccine is that it could be a one-and-done kind of thing—unlike those for influenza or even tetanus, which must be updated regularly. According to studies by microbiologist Deborah Fuller of the University of Washington School of Medicine, people who get Valley fever develop lifelong immunity. That, Fuller says, “is the golden egg.”</p>

<p>Fuller's team is pursuing both DNA- and RNA-based vaccines, each of which would prompt the body to produce proteins that trigger an immune response. Fuller notes that any vaccine against <em>Coccidioides</em> would serve a greater purpose than just fighting Valley fever: it could allow researchers to understand immune response to other fungal diseases and provide insight into how to better treat such conditions.</p>

<p>Galgiani believes that if funding allows, a human version of his vaccine could be ready for approval within eight years. That funding may finally be within reach. After Valley fever's annual incidence surpassed 20,000 cases in 2019, two congressional representatives—Kevin McCarthy of California and David Schweikert of Arizona—called on the National Institutes of Health to make a substantial investment in Valley fever research. Last year the NIH complied, dedicating $4.5 million in funding to the cause.</p>

<p>It's about time, Guillen says. She has seen how agricultural workers are made vulnerable just by the dint of their surroundings, toiling in jobs that expose them to agrochemicals, dehydration, extreme heat, and more. Growing up in Washington State, working in the fields herself starting at age 16, she never had to worry about Valley fever. But now she's watching it creep in and threaten the people she's tried so hard to protect. She's fighting to make sure some of the most invisible workers are seen.</p>
