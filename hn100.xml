<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Heretic: Fully automatic censorship removal for language models</h2><a id="user-content-heretic-fully-automatic-censorship-removal-for-language-models" aria-label="Permalink: Heretic: Fully automatic censorship removal for language models" href="#heretic-fully-automatic-censorship-removal-for-language-models"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Heretic is a tool that removes censorship (aka "safety alignment") from
transformer-based language models without expensive post-training.
It combines an advanced implementation of directional ablation, also known
as "abliteration" (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11717" rel="nofollow">Arditi et al. 2024</a>),
with a TPE-based parameter optimizer powered by <a href="https://optuna.org/" rel="nofollow">Optuna</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This approach enables Heretic to work <strong>completely automatically.</strong> Heretic
finds high-quality abliteration parameters by co-minimizing the number of
refusals and the KL divergence from the original model. This results in a
decensored model that retains as much of the original model's intelligence
as possible. Using Heretic does not require an understanding of transformer
internals. In fact, anyone who knows how to run a command-line program
can use Heretic to decensor language models.</p>

<p dir="auto">Running unsupervised with the default configuration, Heretic can produce
decensored models that rival the quality of abliterations created manually
by human experts:</p>

<p dir="auto">The Heretic version, generated without any human effort, achieves the same
level of refusal suppression as other abliterations, but at a much lower
KL divergence, indicating less damage to the original model's capabilities.
<em>(You can reproduce those numbers using Heretic's built-in evaluation functionality,
e.g. <code>heretic --model google/gemma-3-12b-it --evaluate-model p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic</code>.
Note that the exact values might be platform- and hardware-dependent.
The table above was compiled using PyTorch 2.8 on an RTX 5090.)</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Heretic supports most dense models, including many multimodal models, and
several different MoE architectures. It does not yet support SSMs/hybrid models,
models with inhomogeneous layers, and certain novel attention systems.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can find a collection of models that have been decensored using Heretic
<a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/p-e-w/the-bestiary" rel="nofollow">on Hugging Face</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Prepare a Python 3.10+ environment with PyTorch 2.2+ installed as appropriate
for your hardware. Then run:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pip install heretic-llm
heretic Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507"><pre><code>pip install heretic-llm
heretic Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Replace <code>Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507</code> with whatever model you want to decensor.</p>
<p dir="auto">The process is fully automatic and does not require configuration; however,
Heretic has a variety of configuration parameters that can be changed for
greater control. Run <code>heretic --help</code> to see available command-line options,
or look at <a href="https://github.com/p-e-w/heretic/blob/master/config.default.toml"><code>config.default.toml</code></a> if you prefer to use
a configuration file.</p>
<p dir="auto">At the start of a program run, Heretic benchmarks the system to determine
the optimal batch size to make the most of the available hardware.
On an RTX 3090, with the default configuration, decensoring Llama-3.1-8B
takes about 45 minutes.</p>
<p dir="auto">After Heretic has finished decensoring a model, you are given the option to
save the model, upload it to Hugging Face, chat with it to test how well it works,
or any combination of those actions.</p>

<p dir="auto">Heretic implements a parametrized variant of directional ablation. For each
supported transformer component (currently, attention out-projection and
MLP down-projection), it identifies the associated matrices in each transformer
layer, and orthogonalizes them with respect to the relevant "refusal direction",
inhibiting the expression of that direction in the result of multiplications
with that matrix.</p>
<p dir="auto">Refusal directions are computed for each layer as a difference-of-means between
the first-token residuals for "harmful" and "harmless" example prompts.</p>
<p dir="auto">The ablation process is controlled by several optimizable parameters:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>direction_index</code>: Either the index of a refusal direction, or the special
value <code>per layer</code>, indicating that each layer should be ablated using the
refusal direction associated with that layer.</li>
<li><code>max_weight</code>, <code>max_weight_position</code>, <code>min_weight</code>, and <code>min_weight_distance</code>:
For each component, these parameters describe the shape and position of the
ablation weight kernel over the layers. The following diagram illustrates this:</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Heretic's main innovations over existing abliteration systems are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The shape of the ablation weight kernel is highly flexible, which, combined with
automatic parameter optimization, can improve the compliance/quality tradeoff.
Non-constant ablation weights were previously explored by Maxime Labonne in
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2" rel="nofollow">gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2</a>.</li>
<li>The refusal direction index is a float rather than an integer. For non-integral
values, the two nearest refusal direction vectors are linearly interpolated.
This unlocks a vast space of additional directions beyond the ones identified
by the difference-of-means computation, and often enables the optimization
process to find a better direction than that belonging to any individual layer.</li>
<li>Ablation parameters are chosen separately for each component. I have found that
MLP interventions tend to be more damaging to the model than attention interventions,
so using different ablation weights can squeeze out some extra performance.</li>

"They put me in a reformatory when I was 17."</p><p>Reformatories were institutions where girls and young women who refused to conform to the Franco regime's Catholic values were detained - single mothers, girls with boyfriends, lesbians. Girls who'd been sexually assaulted were incarcerated, assuming the blame for their own abuse. Orphans and abandoned girls might also find themselves living behind convent walls.</p><p>Marina and her cousins were stunned.</p><p>They couldn't comprehend that their grandparents had arranged to have their own daughter locked up.</p><p>Mariona's memory of telling this story to the youngsters in her family is blurred, she believes as a result of the psychiatric "treatment" she was forced to undergo at the reformatory. But Marina didn't forget the revelations, and years later, she would make a documentary telling her mother's story.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><i><b>Warning: This article contains content that some readers might find distressing</b></i></p><p>Mariona, the oldest of nine siblings, describes her parents as right-wing and ultra-Catholic. They were so conservative they wouldn't even let Mariona wear trousers.</p><p>But in 1968, when she turned 16, a new world unfolded.</p><p>Mariona was tutoring children during the day, and preparing for university at evening classes. There, she says, she met people she'd never encountered before - trade unionists, left-wingers and anti-Franco activists. It was the year of global protests against authoritarianism and the Vietnam War, with mass demands for civil rights. The spirit of revolt was infectious.</p><p>Franco had been in power for three decades. Political parties were banned, censorship was universal and young people wanted change. Soon, Mariona joined her new friends on "raids": a few of them would block off a street, throw Molotov cocktails, hand out leaflets, and when the police turned up, scatter in every direction.</p><p>On May Day 1969, one of Mariona's friends was arrested at a demonstration in Barcelona. There was a risk the detainee would give names to the police - so Mariona couldn't go home, in case they came looking for her. That night she stayed in the flat of a fellow activist.</p><p>Returning home the next day, Mariona was in deep trouble. Her parents were furious, and began to exert far more control over her life.</p><p>"For them, it was a scandal, a stain on the family," she says. "After that, they wouldn't let me out."</p><p>By the end of that summer, Mariona had resolved to leave home, and travelled to the holiday island of Menorca with some college friends, leaving her parents a note.</p><p>They immediately reported her as an underage runaway to the authorities, and the moment Mariona was about to board a boat back to Barcelona, she was arrested.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At the port in Barcelona her parents met her.</p><p>They didn't take her home. Instead, they took her to a convent. Mariona wasn't given any explanation - she only remembers her parents' rage.</p><p>Days later she flew to Madrid with her father. There, she was driven directly to another convent, part of the Patronato system, under Spain's Ministry of Justice.</p><p>She and the other interned women were categorised and segregated.</p><p>Mariona says she ended up on the first floor - reserved for "the rebellious ones - the ones they considered fallen women".</p><p>The Patronato had the power to detain any non-conforming woman under 25. They weren't criminals - they were females deemed in need of "re-education".  But Mariona never learned the stories of the others she was confined with.</p><p>"They didn't let us talk.  It's quite incredible," she says. "And you wonder, how did they manage it?"</p><p>The internees were only allowed to exchange simple greetings with each other - a form of control, and a way of preventing "bad" girls influencing others.</p><p>"What you couldn't do was really get to know another girl,"  says Mariona. "Because then they'd separate you - send one of you to a different dormitory, or even to another institution."</p><p>She thinks there were around 100 internees at the convent. They slept 20 to a room, with a nun at one end, and the door locked. The daily routine was gruelling - prayers, Mass, cleaning the convent, and then hours in a workshop making clothes for local retailers. While the girls sewed, a nun read aloud so that no-one talked.</p><p>"There was indoctrination," recalls Mariona. "So that you should understand you'd behaved very badly. Then once you realised this, you'd ask for forgiveness and confess."</p><p>Mariona never confessed.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>After around four months, she was allowed to return home to Barcelona for Christmas, but wasn't permitted to go out alone. Somehow - and Mariona doesn't remember how - she managed to escape, but her escape was short lived. Within hours she was bundled into a car with her father and an uncle, and driven back to Madrid.</p><p>"We arrived back at the convent at dusk," she recalls. "I refused to go in. They pulled me up the stairs and gave me a sedative to get me inside."</p><p>Inside the convent, the other young women were warned against talking to her - the rebel girl who had the nerve to try to run away. She grew intensely lonely, and eventually began refusing food.</p><p>Dramatic weight loss resulted in her admission to a psychiatric clinic. There, she says she was given two sessions of electric shock treatment, followed by what was called "insulin coma therapy".</p><p>Mariona says she was injected with insulin to induce deep hypoglycemia - a coma-like state caused by low blood sugar. It was believed this could reduce psychotic or schizophrenic symptoms, and somehow "re-set" a patient's brain. </p><p>It was a "therapy" that was being discontinued in many countries for one simple reason: it could be lethal.</p><p>Mariona received an insulin injection in the mornings. Later she'd be brought out of the coma and made to eat. Mentally, she began to shut down.</p><p>"Everyday, I was more dazed. I started saying things like, 'I hurt my parents,'" she says.</p><p>"I entered this process of submission and acceptance."</p><p>Mariona believes the forced, intravenous "treatment" with insulin irreparably damaged her memory. Suspecting it was causing her to forget things, she began keeping a diary. More than five decades later, this faded, paper document from 1971 would inform Marina's documentary about her mother's experience.</p><p>Doctors believed the "treatment" would help Mariona gain weight - but that wasn't happening. </p><p>"One day, the psychiatrist decided it was better to try tying me to the bed until I ate."</p><p>Mariona's despair became so unbearable, she says she thought about taking her own life. Then the psychiatrist gave her a target weight of 40kg (6st 4lb). If she achieved that, they promised she'd be released from the clinic.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mariona succeeded. In 1972, once she'd grown a little stronger, she returned to Barcelona.</p><p>Now aged 20, she vowed to never live with her parents again.</p><p>These were the final years of Franco's dictatorship before his death in 1975. Mariona moved from job to job, eventually forging a career as a TV director. She had children of her own, but her relationship with her parents remained cool.</p><p>At some point, Mariona asked her mother why she'd been sent to the Patronato. Her mother only said: "We made a mistake."</p><p>Mariona's father is in his 90s now. </p><p>"We suffered a lot too," he told her when she asked him about the family decision to have her locked up in Madrid.</p><p>For Marina, learning more about her mother's story has complicated her relationship with her grandfather.</p><p>"I can't force myself to love someone who's caused so much pain - who treated my mother very badly."</p><p>The short documentary Marina produced about her mother's experience of the Patronato is called Els Buits - Catalan for "the spaces" - a reference to the blanks in Mariona's memory. The film has won prizes in Spain, and was nominated for a prestigious Goya Award.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Fifty years after the death of Franco, the film has contributed to a groundswell of calls for the interned women to be formally recognised under the law as victims of Spain's dictatorship.

"People think what happened in their own home was an isolated incident.

			  		<p>A couple of days ago, the small server hosting this website was temporarily knocked out by scraping bots. This wasn’t the first time, nor is it the first time I’m seriously considering employing more aggressive countermeasures such as Anubis (see for example the <a href="https://brainbaking.com/post/2025/07;june-2025">June 2025</a> summary post). But every time something like this happens, a portion of the software hobbyist in me dies. We should add this to the list of things AI scrapers destroy next to our environment, the creative enthusiasm of the individuals who made things that are being scraped, and our critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>When I tried accessing Brain Baking, I was met with an unusual delay that prompted me to login and see what’s going on. A simple <code>top</code> revealed both Gitea and the Fail2ban server gobbling up almost all CPU resources. Uh oh. Quickly killing Gitea didn’t reduce the work of Fail2ban as the Nginx access logs were being flooded with entries such as:</p>

</code></pre><p>I have enough fail safe systems in place to block bad bots but the user agent <code>Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/140.0.0.0 Safari/537.36</code> isn’t immediately recognized as “bad”: it’s ridiculously easy to spoof that HTTP header. Most user agent checkers I throw this string at claim this agent isn’t a bot. That means we shouldn’t only rely on this information.</p>
<p>Also, I temporarily block isolated IPs that keep on poking around (e.g. rate limiting on Nginx that get pulled into the ban list) but of course these scrapers never come from a single source. Yet the base attacking IP ranges remained the same: <code>47.79</code>. The website <a href="https://ipinfo.io/ips/47.79.1.0/24">ipinfo.io</a> can help in identifying the threat: <em>AS45102 Alibaba (US) Technology Co., Ltd.</em>. Huh?</p>
<p>Apparently, Alibaba provides hosting from Singapore that is frequently being abused by attackers. Many others that host forums software such as PhpBB <a href="https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=2662519">experienced the same problems</a> and although the AbuseIPDB <a href="https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/47.79.216.116">doesn’t report recent issues</a> on the IPs from the above logs, I went ahead and blocked the entire range.</p>
<p>Fail2ban was struggling to keep up: it ingests the Nginx access.log file to apply its rules but if the files keep on exploding… Piping <code>cat access.log | grep /commit/ | cut -d " " -f 1</code> to instant-ban everyone trying to access Git’s commit logs simply wasn’t fast enough. The only thing that had immediate effect was <code>sudo iptables -I INPUT -s 47.79.0.0/16 -j DROP</code>.</p>
<p>In case that wasn’t yet clear: I hate having to deal with this. It’s a waste of time, doesn’t hold back the next attack coming from another range, and intervening always happens too late. But worst of all, semi-random fire fighting is just one big mood killer. I just <em>know</em> this won’t be enough. Having a robust anti attacker system in place might increase the odds but that means either resorting to hand cannons like Anubis or moving the entire hosting to CloudFlare that will do it for me. But I don’t want to fiddle with even more moving components and configuration, nor do I want to route my visitors through tracking-enabled USA servers.</p>
<p>That Gitea instance should be moved off-site, or better yet, I should move the migration to Codeberg to the top of my TODO list. Yet it’s sad to see that people who like fiddling with their own little servers are increasingly punished for doing so, pushing many to a centralized solution, making things worse in the long term. The internet is no longer a safe haven for software hobbyists. I could link to dozens of other bloggers who reported similar issues to further solidify my point.</p>
<p>Other things I’ve noticed is increased traffic with Referer headers coming from strange websites such as <code>bioware.com</code>, <code>mcdonalds.com</code>, and <code>microsoft.com</code>. It’s not like any of these giants are going to link to an article on this site. I don’t understand what the purpose of spoofing that header is besides upping the hits count?</p>
<p>However worse things might get, I refuse to give in.</p>
<p>It’s just like 50 Cent said: <em>Get Hostin’ Or Die Tryin’</em>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Brimstone is a JavaScript engine written from scratch in Rust, aiming to have full support for the JavaScript language.</p>
<p dir="auto">Brimstone is a work in progress but already supports almost all of the JavaScript language (&gt;97% of the ECMAScript language in test262). Not ready for use in production.</p>
<p dir="auto">Implements the <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/" rel="nofollow">ECMAScript specification</a>. Heavy inspiration is taken from the design of <a href="https://v8.dev/" rel="nofollow">V8</a> and SerenityOS's <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird">LibJS</a>. Brimstone chooses to implement almost all components of the engine from scratch with minimal dependencies, with the notable exception of <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x">ICU4X</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Brimstone features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Bytecode VM, heavily inspired by the design of V8's Ignition</li>
<li>Compacting garbage collector, written in <em>very</em> unsafe Rust</li>
<li>Custom RegExp engine</li>
<li>Custom parser</li>
<li>Almost all builtin objects and functions implemented to spec</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>cargo build</code> to build the <code>bs</code> executable</li>
<li><code>cargo run</code> to run from source</li>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Testing</h2><a id="user-content-testing" aria-label="Permalink: Testing" href="#testing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Brimstone relies heavily on a set of first and third party integration test suites, most notably the official <a href="https://github.com/tc39/test262">test262</a> test suite. A custom <a href="https://github.com/Hans-Halverson/brimstone/blob/master/tests/README.md">integration test runner</a> is included. This can be run with:</p>

<p dir="auto">Unit and snapshot tests can be run with <code>cargo test</code>.</p>

            <section>
    <header>
        
    </header>
    
    <div>
        <p>A <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/ec212e6566a0d47/original/Disrupting-the-first-reported-AI-orchestrated-cyber-espionage-campaign.pdf">report</a> was recently published by an AI-research company called <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>.
They are the ones who notably created <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Claude</a>, an AI-assistant for coding. Personally, I don’t use it but that is besides the point.
Before we start, it’s important to say I don’t have anything against them, or AI in general. I do have <a href="https://djnn.sh/posts/on-llms/">some documented concerns</a> but I am not “Anti-AI”, or whatever.
Rather than the technology itself, it’s the industry’s perception of it, and the way it is inserted everywhere, even when unnecessary that bothers me. However, that too is a bit besides the point.</p>
<p>Today, I wanted to discuss the Paper (or Report, however you want to call it) that was recently published by them.
Looking at the executive summary, this paragraph jumps out immediately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In mid-September 2025, we detected a highly sophisticated cyber espionage operation
conducted by a Chinese state-sponsored group we’ve designated GTG-1002 that
represents a fundamental shift in how advanced threat actors use AI. Our investigation
revealed a well-resourced, professionally coordinated operation involving multiple
simultaneous targeted intrusions. The operation targeted roughly 30 entities and our
investigation validated a handful of successful intrusions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is extremely interesting for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anthropic seemingly disrupted an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat">APT</a>’s campaign, though a number of companies and government entities were affected,</li>
<li>This highly-advanced APT doesn’t use its own infra, but rather relies on Claude to coordinate its automation (??? Why, though ?),</li>
<li>I assume they run exploits and custom tools ? If so, what are these ?</li>
<li>Anthropic was able to attribute this attack to a Chinese-affiliated state-sponsored group.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re like me, you then eagerly read the rest of the paper, hoping to find clues and technical details on the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures), or IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) to advance the research.
However, the report very quickly falls flat, which sucks.</p>
<h2 id="where-are-the-iocs-mrclaude-">where are the IoCs, Mr.Claude ?</h2>
<p>The primary goal of a Threat-Intelligence report such as this one would be to inform other parties of a new type of attack, and artefacts they might use to discover the attack on their network.
This is typically done by sharing domain-names linked with the campaign, MD5 or SHA512 hashes you could look for on Virus Exchange websites such as <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/">VirusTotal</a>, or other markers that would help you verify that your
networks are safe. As an example, <a href="https://cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2023-CTI-009.pdf">here</a> is the French CERT sharing (in French, but an English version is available too) about APT28’s TTPs.</p>
<p>We can see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> used to determine what are the techniques used (eg: Account Manipulation, Antivirus evasion, etc.),</li>
<li>Emails used for phishing, originating IPs and even date when these emails are sent,</li>
<li>Tooling (VPN software, but also what kind of tools) used by the APT,</li>
<li>a set of recommandations</li>
</ul>
<p>This report is just one I picked randomly by skimming through their publications. Any serious CERT or Threat-Intel company would publish things in the same fashion, because this is the industry standard.
These publications are made public to inform Security Operation Centers around the world about how to detect and prevent those attacks.</p>
<h2 id="poc--gtfo">PoC || GTFO</h2>
<p>In this case, none of the these markers are present in the report. In fact, not a whole lot of the information is verifiable, which is another problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The human operator tasked instances of Claude Code to operate in groups as autonomous penetration testing orchestrators and agents, with the threat actor able to leverage AI to execute 80-90% of tactical operations independently at physically impossible request rates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This figure (80-90%) is not verifiable either. How do we know this is actually the case ?
I have no doubt so-called Autonomous agents are being used in these campaigns, in some capacity. However this report clearly states that Autonomous Agents perform active exploitation, and even data exfiltration.</p>
<p>What kind of tooling is used ? What kind of information has been extracted ? Who is at risk ? How does a CERT identifies an AI agent in their networks ?
None of these questions are answered. It’s not like Anthropic doesn’t have access to this data, since they claim they were able to stop it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon receiving authorization from the human operators, Claude executed systematic
credential collection across targeted networks. This involved querying internal services,
extracting authentication certificates from configurations, and testing harvested
credentials across discovered systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How ? Did it run Mimikatz ? Did it access Cloud environments ? We don’t even know what kind of systems were affected.
There is no details, or fact-based evidence to support these claims or even help other people protect their networks.</p>
<p>The report goes on to claim that upon detection, the accounts were closed and implemented “enhancements”, and then drops this gem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We notified relevant authorities and industry partners, and shared information with impacted entities where appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is that even supposed to mean ? You claim your agents were able to find exploitable vulnerabilities in multiple services.
Were these patched ? What about the extracted data ? What about the affected people ? Do you care about this at all ?</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">final thoughts</h2>
<p>Look, is it very likely that Threat Actors are using these Agents with bad intentions, no one is disputing that. But this report does not meet the standard of publishing for serious companies.
The same goes with research in other fields. You <strong>cannot</strong> just claim things and not back it up in any way, and we <strong>cannot</strong> as an industry accept that it’s OK for companies to release this.</p>
<p>There seem to be a pattern for Tech Companies (especially in AI, but they’re not the only culprits) out there to just announce things, generate hype and then under-deliever.
Just because it works with VCs doesn’t mean it should work with us. We should, as an industry, expect better.</p>
<p>For instance, it attributes the attacks to a Chinese State-affiliated (!!!) group, but does not go on to give any details.
Which APT is it ? What helped you determine this ?</p>
<p>Attribution is a <strong>very</strong> serious matter, with sometimes diplomatical implications. You can’t just go on and point the finger at anyone and expect people to believe you for no reason.
In a time of increasing tensions between the West and China, it does not seem like the smart thing to do at all. Frankly, I don’t understand who was stupid enough to approve this to be released.
For all we know, the “advanced threat actors” they’re talking about here could just be script kiddies trying to automate <code>ffuf</code> and <code>sqlmap</code> commands.</p>
<p>If they’re going to release IoCs and proof of everything, I’d be happy to share them here. But until them, I will say this: this paper would not pass any review board.
It’s irresponsible at best to accuse other countries of serious things without backing it up. Yes, I am aware that Chinese-linked APTs are out there and very aggressive, and Yes, I am aware that
Threat Actors misuse LLMs all the time, but that is besides the point. We need fact-based evidence. We need to be able to verify all this. Otherwise, anyone can say anything, on the premise that it’s
probably happening. But that’s not good enough.</p>
<p>So if the report does not give any details on TTPs and detections, what was the purpose of this report exactly ?</p>
<p>There is a paragraph at the end that seem to give us a clue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cybersecurity community needs to assume a fundamental change has occurred: Security teams should experiment with applying AI for defense in areas like SOC automation, threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response and build experience with what works in their specific environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Security teams should experiment with applying AI for defense”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Hmm. But who sells this kind of AI they’re talking about here ?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this shit is a pathetic excuse of a report and should not be taken as anything else than a shameless attempt at selling more of their product.
This is shameful and extremely unprofessional, at best. This disregard for basics ethics in order to sell just a little bit more make me want to never use their product, ever.</p>
<p>Do better.</p>

			  		<p>For those of you who are living under a rock, Valve announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine">three new hardware devices</a> joining their Steam Deck line-up: a new controller, a VR headset, and the GameCube—no wait, GabeCube—no wait, Steam Machine. The shiny little cube is undoubtedly Valve’s (second) attempt to break into the console market. This time, it might just work.</p>
<p>The hardware is ready to arrive in at your living room spring next year. The biggest question is: will it arrive at <em>our</em> living room? Reading all the hype has certainly enthused me (e.g. Brendon’s <a href="https://wavelengths.online/posts/the-steam-machine-is-the-future">The Steam Machine is the Future</a>, PC Gamer’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/vr-hardware/steamos-launching-for-arm-fex-translation-layer/">Valve is all over ARM</a>, Eurogamer’s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">Steam Machine preview</a>, ResetEra’s <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-steam-hardware-family-officially-expands-in-early-2026-steam-controller-steam-machine-steam-frame.1351453/">Steam Hardware thread</a>); especially the part where the Machine is just a PC that happens to be tailored towards console gaming. According to Valve, you can install anything you want on it—it’s just SteamOS just like your trusty Deck, meaning you can boot into KDE and totally do your thing. Except that this shiny little cube is six times as powerful. I’m sure Digital Foundry will validate that next year.</p>

		<figcaption>Valve's newly announced Steam Machine: a mysterious looking sleek black box.</figcaption></figure>

<p>However, this post isn’t about specs, expectations, or dreams: it’s about tempering my own enthusiasm. I’d like to tell myself why I don’t really need a Steam Machine. The following list will hopefully make it easier to say no when the buy buttons become available.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>You’re a retro gamer.</em> <br>You don’t need the power of six Steam Decks. To do what, run DOSBox?</li>
<li><em>Your TV doesn’t support 4K</em>.<br>Again, no need for those 4K 60 FPS.</li>
<li><em>You generally dislike AAA games.</em> <br>With The Steam Machine, you might be able to finally properly run <em>DOOM Eternal</em> and all of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games. That you don’t like playing.</li>
<li><em>You don’t have time to play games anyway.</em><br>Ouch, that hurts but it’s not untrue.</li>
<li><em>The TV will be occupied anyway.</em><br>The Steam Machine is not a Switch: you can’t switch to handheld mode. When are you going to play on the Machine if the TV is being used to watch your wife’s favourite shows?</li>
<li><em>You already have too many gaming related hardware pieces.</em><br>That’ll mean you’ll have to divide your time by an even bigger number to devote an equal amount to playing them.</li>
<li><em>There’s no room for yet another nondescript box under the TV.</em><br>See above: why don’t you first try to do something with that SNES Mini and PlayStation Mini besides letting it collect dust?</li>
<li><em>You’re a physical gamer.</em><br>This is Steam. There will be no insertion of cartridges, no blowing of carts, and no staring at game collections on a shelf.</li>
<li><em>It’s Steam, not Good Old Games.</em><br>Sure it can run GOG games but the Machine is primarily designed to run Steam. You avoid purchasing from Steam like the plague, yet you’re willing to buy a Machine dedicated to it? Are you crazy?</li>
<li><em>The last time you booted Steam was over a year ago.</em><br>Don’t tell me you’re suddenly interested in running the platform on a dedicated machine.</li>
<li><em>You don’t have time to fiddle with configuration.</em><br>Button and trackpad mappings to get the controls just right enough to play strategy games designed to be played with keyboard and mouse will only leave you frustrated.</li>
<li><em>Your MacBook can emulate Windows games just fine.</em><br>You recently bought CrossOver and played <em>Wizordum</em> and older Windows 98/XP stuff on it. It even runs <em>Against The Storm</em> flawlessly. No need for Proton or whatever.</li>
<li><em>In two years, you’ll upgrade your M1 to an M4+: there’s the power upgrade.</em><br>If CrossOver is struggling to run that particular game you so badly want to play, it’ll be buttery smooth in a few years. You’re going to do the laptop upgrade anyway regardless of the Steam Machine.</li>
<li><em>You already have a huge gaming backlog.</em><br>Thanks to your buddy Joel you bought too many physical Switch games that are still waiting to be touched. Are you really ready to open up another can of worms?</li>
<li><em>You dislike a digital backlog.</em><br>It’s easy to have hundreds of games on there: see your GOG purchases. Why don’t you try to count the ones that you actually played, let alone finished.</li>
<li><em>You’re not going to use the Machine to run office software.</em><br>Your laptop and other retro machines are good enough at handling that task. What are you really going to do with this cube besides gaming?</li>
<li><em>Those cool looking indie games will be released for Switch in due time anyway.</em><br>Remember <em>Pizza Tower</em>? It’s out on Switch now. Remember to buy the cart on Fangamer, together with the <em>Anton Blast</em> one.</li>
<li><em>It’s rumoured to cost more than</em> <code>€600</code>.<br>Save that money for a Switch 2 if the games are starting to become interesting to justify that upgrade, as currently, they’re not. Also, see the backlog point above.</li>
<li><em>All HDMI ports both on the TV and your external monitors are occupied</em>.<br>Unless you’re willing to constantly switch cables, you’ll need to invest in a HDMI switch. Another <code>€100+</code>.</li>
<li><em>You can’t buy this without buying the Steam Controller.</em><br>That’s easily another <code>€80+</code> you already spent buying the Mobapad controller for your Switch as a replacement for the semi-broken Joy Cons.</li>
<li><em>You can’t buy this as an expense on the company.</em><br>You’re closing down the company, remember. (More on that later)</li>
<li><em>The cool looking LED and programmable front display don’t justify an expensive purchase.</em><br>After the initial excitement wears off, the LED will become annoying and you’ll simply turn it off.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you see, I don’t really need a Steam Machine…</p>
<p>Fuck it, I’m getting one.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Two things happened for me over the holidays five years ago: I went to rehab, and I acquired a cyberstalker. These were not entirely independent events. The stalker was someone in India who’d started following me when I was playing poker, who came to believe we had a close personal relationship and that my tweets were coded messages to him. When I stopped tweeting for two months, he became convinced something had happened to me, so he tracked down my email and phone number and started spamming me with messages demanding to know where I was.</p><p>By the time I realized this was happening, he’d already escalated to the point that I was clearly never going to respond. I started blocking him on different platforms, but he’d just create another account or phone number, or find some other way in. He messaged me dozens of times a day, alternating between threats and pleas. When he reached out to my company six months later to apply for a job, I learned his real name and used it to track down an old friend of his to ask for help — but the friend told me he was afraid to intervene because he didn’t want to become a target himself. I decided that there was nothing I could do from the other side of the world, and resigned myself to waiting him out.</p><p>Only he never tired. Years went by and I never responded, and still he messaged me multiple times a day. The messages became more disturbing, more pornographic, more violent. He told me he would come find me in Berkeley and hurt me. Finally, last November, in the span of a few days, he sent me an image of his brand new passport and a visa application, which he said he planned to use to travel here, and successfully extorted money from my brother by spoofing my phone number and pretending to have kidnapped me.</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/maybe-youre-not-actually-trying?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Thanks for reading Useful Fictions!

Except that I didn’t. Instead, I curled up in a ball and cried, and told friends who suggested contacting the police that there was no point, that no one would be able to help as long as I was here and he was in India.</span></p><p>But my husband was insistent that there had to be a better answer, and asked me to let him intervene on my behalf. In short order, he was in contact with the FBI, the US consulate in India, and, with the help of his friend Govind, who has family there, the local police where the stalker lived. Within months, the situation had resolved, and he will never set foot on American soil.</p><p>One of the interesting things about all of this is that there was nothing particularly inventive about the strategies my husband deployed. They were more or less exactly the strategies I would have come up with if I’d been put in charge of a similar situation in someone else’s life. Why did it take another person getting involved for me to realize I wasn’t Actually Trying?</p><p>I think what happened is this: When the stalker entered my life, I was at a low point in personal capacity — broke, alone, addled, etc. My approach towards him at that point (ignore, hoping he’d stop) was the only one that seemed available given my spiritual and psychological resources at the time. But my orientation to the problem became fixed in time at that point of low agency, and it never occurred to me to revisit it as my capacity for action increased.</p><p><span>I think we are all like this. </span><strong>People are not just high-agency or low-agency in a global sense, across their entire lives. Instead, people are selectively agentic.</strong></p><p>Let’s say that life is divided up into three theaters: work, relationships with others (all kinds) and relationship to self (physical health, introspection, emotional development, all of it). I think it’s the rule, rather than the exception, that people are stuck at an earlier stage of development in at least one area. There is one theater of life where they’re not Actually Trying — where they’re approaching serious problems with the resourcefulness of a teenager, though they are now capable adults.</p><p>In my particular corner of the world, there are tons of high-achievers in work. These are ingenious people shaping the world through innovations in science, technology, and policy. But many of them haven’t applied the same ingenuity to their interior experience or relationships. These are people who could successfully launch a product in a foreign country with little instruction, but who complain that there aren’t any fun people to meet on the dating apps.</p><p><strong>It seems like, by default, you are stuck with whatever level of resourcefulness you brought to a problem the first time you encountered it and failed to fix it.</strong></p><p>Let’s say you tried therapy when you were 20, and it didn’t help with your high levels of anxiety. When you think about your anxiety, as the years go by, you think, “hard problem, tried the main solution, didn’t work out.” Perhaps you just accept anxiety as a fixed trait, and your friends playfully rib you about it, which is nice but makes it seem even more like a static part of your identity. But you’re not 20 anymore. You’re, say, a 32-year-old CTO, and when a vital project at your startup doesn’t respond to your first approach, you vigorously try another, and another, trying to learn from every failure. That same persistence and curiosity don’t get applied to the anxiety that makes you suffer at work, though.</p><p><span>You don’t think, </span><em>oh, I could probably</em><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p>Check on my nutrition and sleep, in a serious way</p></li><li><p>Look into supplements and medication</p></li><li><p>Throw some resources at improving my rest and recovery</p></li><li><p>Ask all of my friends about the best anxiety treatments they’ve ever heard of, or the best coaches/therapists they’ve ever worked with</p></li><li><p>Research any emerging therapies designed for people like me</p></li></ul><p><span>Instead of doing those things, you just put up with it. Or, worse, you fight through your anxiety using an earlier solution that required willpower, and the exertion of willpower makes you feel like you’re trying. </span><strong>But the feeling of effort doesn’t mean that you’re Actually Trying.</strong></p><p><span>There is a relevant concept from Alexander Technique that I love, “faulty sensory appreciation,” which I learned about from </span><a href="https://expandingawareness.org/" rel="">Michael Ashcroft</a><span>. The concept is that habitual tension distorts your sensory impressions—rigid stillness via bodily tension starts to feel like “good posture,” whereas relaxed uprightness feels strange, to the extent you might feel like your back is at a weird angle when you’re actually standing up tall. The right way feels like the wrong way. Apparently, this is demonstrated by having Alexander students lie in a position where your legs tell you that you shouldn’t be able to stand up — and then the instructor says, “by the way, you can stand up from here,” and you do.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, people who are being selectively agentic often have a kind of faulty sensory appreciation. Perhaps relationships </span><em>feel hard </em><span>for you, they take willpower, so it’s tempting to believe that you’re Actually Trying, that you’ve brought the full weight of your genius to bear on the problem. You might even take some pride in the struggle. Like rigid posture, the strain feels like correctness. But struggling is not evidence that you’ve tried everything. To the contrary, the continuous need for willpower may be the sign of a badly-engineered life.</span></p><p><span>I’d recommend assuming there’s some area of your life where you are, without realizing it, frozen in time, and that locating it matters quite a bit. Look across the three theaters of your life: work, relationships, and self-relationship, and take note of the biggest issues you face. Know that you might be looking for something that doesn’t feel like an </span><em>issue </em><span>— it might just feel like sadness or anger</span><em>, </em><span>like the sadness of not being seen, or the frustration of not feeling like your work is meaningful. Once you’ve surfaced something, ask yourself: Have I done my best to come up with a set of potential solutions, using all the resources I have? Am I doing as well by myself as I would by any friend who came to me with the same problem? How do I know I’m Actually Trying?</span></p><p><em><strong><a href="https://mailchi.mp/44578760e686/book-preorder-signup" rel="">Sign up to be notified</a><span> when my book, You Can Just Do Things, is available for purchase.</span></strong></em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>A <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-n-review-a-racing-sim-you-can-drive-on-the-road" target="_blank">2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N</a> owner was venting on Reddit recently about not being able to change his brake pads without specialized computer equipment. It sounds insane, but this is what new-car ownership is like in 2025. We did some digging and made contact with <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/hyundai-news" target="_blank">Hyundai</a> to understand the situation and break it down for you—it’s a frustrating one.</p>



<p>Having to talk to computers to fix a car isn’t necessarily unique to the Korean automaker, but I fell into a rabbit hole of Hyundai maintenance research here, so that’ll be our focus for the moment.</p>



<p>Context for casual readers: Brake pad and rotor replacements are super basic car maintenance. You won’t need to do the job nearly as often on an electric car (thanks to regenerative braking), but even EV pads don’t last forever. On most cars, part of the job involves disconnecting or retracting the parking brake, which usually grabs the rear wheels. Many modern cars, and all EVs, have an electronic parking brake controlled by a computer signal, rather than a manually adjustable nut-and-cable situation. This is what sparked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ioniq5N/comments/1ojjp6m/hyundai_declares_war_on_right_to_repair/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Redditor u/SoultronicPear’s justifiable frustration</a>.</p>



<p>One more piece of stage-setting: Since electronic parking brakes are indeed common, many readily available diagnostic tools (pretty basic OBD scanners) can issue a retract-brake command to a car’s ECU. Still, you do need one with bi-directional test functionality. Remember that point—it will become significant again in a few paragraphs.</p>

<p>Apparently, no cheap scanner option worked on the original Reddit poster’s Ioniq 5 N. That led them on a journey of attempting to access commercial-grade car-repair gear, which was ultimately fruitless.</p>



<p>You can access a Hyundai EV’s diagnostic brain using the brand’s proprietary dealership hardware and software (it’s called GDS, and it is publicly buyable but <a href="https://oemdiagnostictools.com/hyundai-gds-kds-dealer-diagnostic-tool/?setCurrencyId=1&amp;sku=GDSM-CPKITK&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=17303113625&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACJ-HcmF-xGsDbkCjbcZhnreKKPE9" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">costs about six grand</a>) or a third-party aftermarket system running a J2534 program. J2534 is an interface standard <a href="https://www.sae.org/standards/j2534-1_5_00-recommended-practice-pass-thru-vehicle-programming" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">designed by the SAE</a> and <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2003/06/27/03-14461/control-of-air-pollution-from-motor-vehicles-and-new-motor-vehicle-engines-revisions-to-regulations" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">mandated by the EPA</a> that basically ensures ECUs from different car brands can speak the same language for the sake of independent repair shops.</p>

<p>Hyundai supports J2534 and <a href="https://hyundaitechinfo.com/external/files/j2534_diagnostics_and_reprogramming/J2534_Diagnostics.pdf?v=20251022" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">recommends</a> one of three machines for talking to its cars: <a href="https://opusivs.com/product/cardaq-plus-3-kit/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">CarDAQ Plus 3</a> (about $2,000), <a href="https://www.bosch-mobility.com/en/solutions/diagnostics/vehicle-communication-interface/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">MTS 6531</a> (also about $2,000), and <a href="https://www.dgtech.com/d-bridge-pro/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">d-briDGe PRO</a> (about $800). “…under no circumstances do we recommend the use of a non-approved J2534 device,” the company states. You would then also need a subscription to Hyundai’s J2534 Diagnostic Tool Software, which costs $60 a week (or less over longer time blocks). All this info is in .PDFs linked from <a href="https://hyundaitechinfo.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Hyundai’s tech portal</a>.</p>



<p>At this point, after spending about $2,000 on tools, you should be able to service your own Hyundai Ioniq brakes, but if you’re a DIYer, you still can’t. Written in red at the top of one of Hyundai’s many tech documents is this: “Access to Bi-Directional Tests and Special Functions require Diagnostic Professional or Vehicle Security Professional credential from NASTF.”</p>



<p><a href="https://wp.nastf.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">NASTF</a> is the National Automotive Service Task Force. It exists “to identify and resolve gaps in service information, tool information, and training” between OEMs and independent shops (cool idea). It’s also the arbiter of things like lock coding and car credential management. To get scan-tool validation as a member, you need to be a professional mechanic.</p>



<p>And with that final roadblock, we can confirm that, no, a DIYer can not do their own brakes on a Hyundai Ioniq 5 N.</p>



<p>I’m guessing most of you reading this will now have the same thought I did—it does seem smart to have some regulation on sensitive data like the codes to your car locks, but what the heck, you should be able to do brake pads on a car you own. Or as Randy Marsh would have put it:<em> “I’m sorry, I thought this was America!”</em></p>

<p>Naturally, I also dropped Hyundai a note about this directly. Here’s what the automaker told us:</p>



<p>“Hyundai is committed to supporting both our dealer network and independent repair facilities with safe, secure, and accessible service solutions. For vehicles equipped with electronic parking brakes, including the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 5 N, the official repair procedure requires placing the rear calipers in service mode using either our Global Diagnostic System (GDS) or the J2534 application. This ensures proper functionality and customer safety. Hyundai recently expanded access through an update to our J2534 application, enabling aftermarket users to perform functions previously restricted by the GDS secure gateway. While authentication through NASTF is required for sensitive operations, this step helps maintain security and accountability. Our official dealer tool (GDS) is also available for purchase by anyone.</p>



<p>Hyundai is actively exploring ways to make routine maintenance easier for all customers while upholding safety standards.</p>



<p>“We appreciate the interest in DIY repairs and will continue working toward solutions that balance convenience with security.”</p>

See that little hook I put an orange arrow pointed at? That’s the parking brake engager. If you were changing pads and rotors on this car, you’d probably disconnect that cable to get the caliper off, then screw the piston into the caliper, then reinstall the cable and manually adjust its tightness with a nut on the cable. Modern cars have the same functionality, but you can’t mess with it without computer control. <em>stock.adobe.com</em> </figcaption></figure>



<p>So after all that, we can address the Reddit thread title “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ioniq5N/comments/1ojjp6m/hyundai_declares_war_on_right_to_repair/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Hyundai declares WAR on Right to Repair</a>” as technically incorrect. Right-to-repair <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/right-to-repair-2023-legislation" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">legislation</a> prevents product manufacturers from hiding technology behind proprietary diagnostic tools, and this stuff is not restricted to the brand’s own equipment. So, technically, I think the company’s in the clear on the rules as-written. We can also add a layer of clarification to the <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2025/11/ioniq-5-n-owner-says-hyundai-wont-even-let-you-change-your-brake-pads/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Carscoops</em></a> post on this that was headlined as “Apparently You Need Hyundai’s Permission To Change Your Own Brakes.” It’s not Hyundai’s permission you need, it’s the NASTF’s.</p>



<p>However, obviously, both <em>Carscoops </em>and the guy on Reddit were totally right in principle. A car repair task that has historically been totally DIY’able in a driveway is now relegated to shop-only because of technology. And that’s not good.</p>



<p>We focused on Hyundai here because this particular Reddit thread caught my eye and sent me on a research quest about this particular brand, but the Korean automaker is hardly the only company making it hard to mess with modern cars.</p>



<p>I understand, and even appreciate, automakers wanting to be careful with things like lock and engine-starting encryption. You definitely don’t want anybody to be able to download your car keys and make off with your vehicle, or do worse. But there’s got to be a better middle-ground than this. People should have unfettered access to the cars (and tractors, and tools) they own, plain and simple.</p>



<p>One last note: For anyone who found this article because you, too, are trying to get a modern car’s electronic brake to release for service but aren’t having luck … I did find <a href="https://epbrt.242925.xyz/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">this one tool</a> that might be able to override the existing software. But I’m making no endorsement of it whatsoever—I’ve never used it and have no idea if it works or if using it might trigger any unintended consequences. Use at your own risk (but report back in the comments if you’ve tried it).</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://codeberg.org/IDEmacs/IDEmacs">https://codeberg.org/IDEmacs/IDEmacs</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45941835">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="user-content-outline-text-description">
<p>IDEmacs aims to be a set of Emacs configurations which provide an out-of-the-box experience similar (if not identical) to popular GUI IDEs and editors.</p>
<p>
It is aimed at…</p>
<ol>
<li>Programmers coming to Emacs from other IDEs, or even first-time programmers familiar with only office applications.</li>
<li>
<p>Beginner Common Lisp and Scheme programmers, who need the functionality of Emacs (Sly/Geiser + structural editing) without having to perform unnecessary setup and without dealing with an alien style of keybindings. In other words, similar to <a href="https://portacle.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Portacle</a> or <a href="https://elephly.net/guile-studio/" rel="nofollow">Guile Studio</a>.<sup><a id="user-content-footnote-reference-1" href="#user-content-footnote-1" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Some may say that we should improve support for Common Lisp and Scheme in other editors and IDEs instead. Still others may say that we should work on a better Lisp IDE than Emacs instead (such as Second Climacs or Lem). All great points. IDEmacs is just a band-aid for the present situation, where Emacs + Sly/Geiser is the best Lisp/Scheme IDE.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-programmers who want a fully-featured Org, Markdown, or LaTeX editor with idiomatic shortcuts and mouse-friendly GUI.</li>
</ol>
<p>It provides…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>GUI and mouse support</strong>, in addition to a keyboard-driven interface.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike most starter kits, we do not hide GUI elements by default.</li>
<li>
<p>We support configuration via the <code>custom</code> GUI, not just Elisp</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting GUI and <code>custom</code> means we cannot use <code>straight</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If resources allow, we may implement new GUIs in Emacs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keybindings that follow popular GUI and IDE conventions.</strong> <sup><a id="user-content-footnote-reference-2" href="#user-content-footnote-2" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>CUA mode is just the start - much more keybinding configuration is needed to provide an unsurprising experince. And that's before we even get to the IDE-specific keybindings.</li>
<li>This excludes starter kits that use Evil by default, such as Spacemacs or Doom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A fully-featured, fast, and configuration-free Emacs experience</strong>, like any starter kit/distro.</p>
<ul>
<li>The configuration uses idiomatic Elisp and contains a generous amount of comments, valuable to anyone interested in learning to configure Emacs using Elisp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Perfectly imitating the GUIs and subtle behaviour differences of IDEs is desirable, but not top priority. Given our limited resources, we aim for "good enough".</p>
<p>
We hope this gives new users a comfortable starting point, and make them more likely to stick around to discover the possibilities of Emacs' malleability, rather than being driven off by the default experience.</p>

From the author -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I created this abomination so I could learn Lisp without having to worry too much about learning Emacs. It was originally envisaged for me to use and then switch off as I learned Emacs. But I actually liked it better and now it is my main editor.</p>
<p>
Mousemacs works pretty much like Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code out of the box. But it has the full power of Emacs underneath. All I did was take all the most useful Emacs packages and wrap them in a mouse friendly distribution. It is not perfect and certainly not for everyone, but it might be useful for some. It comes with a simple plain theme but it is still Emacs.</p>

<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Caution</p><p dir="auto"><strong>You must have a rooted device with Xposed to use LibrePods on Android.</strong> This is due to a <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/371713238" rel="nofollow">bug in the Android Bluetooth stack</a>. Please upvote the issue by clicking the '+1' icon on the IssueTracker page.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are <strong>no exceptions</strong> to the root requirement until Google merges the fix.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto">Until then, you must xposed. I used to provide a non-xposed method too, where the module used overlayfs to replace the bluetooth library with a locally patched one, but that was broken due to how various devices handled overlayfs and a patched library. With xposed, you can also enable the DID hook enabling a few extra features.</p>

<p dir="auto">Upto two devices can be simultaneously connected to AirPods, for audio and control both. Seamless connection switching. The same notification shows up on Apple device when Android takes over the AirPods as if it were an Apple device ("Move to iPhone"). Android also shows a popup when the other device takes over.</p>

<p dir="auto">Accessibility settings like customizing transparency mode (amplification, balance, tone, conversation boost, and ambient noise reduction), and loud sound reduction can be configured.</p>
<p dir="auto">All hearing aid customizations can be done from Android, including setting the audiogram result. The app doesn't provide a way to take a hearing test because it requires much more precision. It is much better to use an already available audiogram result.</p>
<p dir="auto">To enable these features, enable App Settings -&gt; <code>act as Apple Device</code>.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Due to recent AirPods' firmware upgrades, you must enable <code>Off listening mode</code> to switch to <code>Off</code>. This is because in this mode, louds sounds are not reduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you have take both AirPods out, the app will automatically switch to the phone speaker. But, Android might keep on trying to connect to the AirPods because the phone is still connected to them, just the A2DP profile is not connected. The app tries to disconnect the A2DP profile as soon as it detects that Android has connected again if they're not in the ear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">When renaming your AirPods through the app, you'll need to re-pair them with your phone for the name change to take effect. This is a limitation of how Bluetooth device naming works on Android.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you want the AirPods icon and battery status to show in Android Settings app, install the app as a system app by using the root module.</p>

I try not to write anything even vaguely political on this blog because we have a variety of views on a variety of subjects and no one is here for that. We can all enjoy our geriatric little silicon artifacts together regardless of your electoral persuasion. But I was hopping mad this week, and the reason is actually on-topic, because I got hit with US Customs tariffs close to double the cost of the vintage items I was ordering and more than the items were worth. This eventually got straightened out, but it wouldn't have happened without my complaint and some time on the phone.
</p><p>
Although we make regular trips down under, your humble author is based in California and so is the Floodgap computer lab. For newly manufactured items and parts it has generally been my policy to buy parts from United States sellers even prior to the tariffs, mostly because that gets around various irregularities and it arrives more quickly. If they're going to drop-ship then it's their problem, not mine, because they advertised it was already here. Since such items are typically newly produced, the current tariffs would logically apply and this policy thus has the additional benefit of me not having to deal with that directly: any tariff should already have been paid to get them States-side.
</p><p>
But for NOS and used parts, especially if you are a collector like I am for certain systems, you buy where you can find them. Coincidentally I wanted to buy a second Apple Network Server logic board since my ANS 700 is acting a little weird (don't say caps) and I still want a good spare for the ANS 500. These don't exactly grow on trees but, as it turns out, the seller I bought my current spare logic board from (pre-tariffs) had another in stock. The logic board doesn't come with the regular ANS AIX ROM SIMM nor cache, so we'll want one each of those just in case, and he also had an Apple BTO Twin Turbo video card (I believe originally for the Power Macintosh 9500) which might also be nice for one of the other beige PCI Macs. These are all new old stock items in their Apple Service packaging because obviously Apple hasn't made nor sold any of these parts in decades. Per the seller, they came from the teardown of new machines which Apple was unable to sell and got turned into official surplus new stock. The seller is in an European Union country, so we're not talking some shady Shenzhen shop operating off an alley liftgate. (I'm not naming the seller because none of this is his fault and I'm sure he'd not like to be contacted about this.)
</p><p>
The items came to €296.00, about US$355 at the spot exchange rate, plus €48.10 for UPS shipping. This would have been well-under the prior <i>de minimis</i> exemption even with the shipping rolled in. We had to do UPS because his particular country's postal service limits shipment value to the United States to US$100 due to the tariffs, causing him to spend a substantial amount of time at the UPS drop-off depot and on the paperwork, which was way more than he was required to do and I very much appreciate. For any import you need to come up with a Harmonized System code for what you're shipping, which then maps to a Harmonized Tariff Schedule code specific to the United States. These parts are all populated PCBs and most populated boards are, by prior rulings, classified with <a href="https://rulings.cbp.gov/search?term=8473.30">an HTS code of 8473.30</a>, which is what the seller tagged all four items with. This code is for "Parts and accessories of the machines of heading 8471 [Automatic data processing machines and units thereof]." If you look under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule search engine for this code, you <a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=847330">find a duty rate</a> for certain subheadings that at <em>most</em> would be 35 percent, or even if these were products of the People's Republic of China (they're old enough that I don't know their exact provenance, but I have no evidence to believe these were originally), then maybe, maybe, <em>maybe</em> <a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=99038803">an additional 25 percent</a>. The declared value was the purchase price in euros and he even picked up the insurance. The package left the depot uneventfully and worked its way across the continent.

The first sign of trouble was over the weekend when I got an unexpected message.

The UPS shipping agent had indicated the parcel was subject to <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/programs-administration/entry-summary/232-tariffs-aluminum-and-steel-faqs">Section 232 tariffs</a> on steel and aluminum, which required me to fill out a UPS-specific form attesting to the steel and aluminum content of the package. (This is an important distinction because Section 232 is not currently part of <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2025/24-1287_097c.pdf">the present matter before the U.S. Supreme Court</a> (PDF), only <a href="https://www.swlaw.com/publication/what-if-the-supreme-court-overrules-the-reciprocal-tariffs-plan-now-for-refunds-protests-and-contract-reconciliation/">reciprocal tariffs under the IEEPA</a>.) There should be little or no aluminum in these because the board and traces would be copper. However, a PCI card is probably going to have a steel bracket, so I looked at the typical mass for those and picked a sufficiently high number of 149g, almost certainly an overestimate but that's always safest with this stuff, then looked at the spot price of stainless steel and based on that weight computed a steel content value of $0.48. I marked "not applicable" for everything else and sent it back. They accepted that.
</p><p>
In the background, all this goes into a U.S. Customs and Border Protection Form 7501, also known as an Entry Summary. It is important to realize that in this circumstance, with UPS as the broker, you are <em>not</em> actually the importer of record — they are. You are the "ultimate consignee." Based on the information provided and the judgement of the broker's agent, then a tariff is assigned and added to the paperwork, which is "assessed" by CBP but in practice is being assessed by the broker based on what they expect CBP would charge under current regulation. Ordinarily you don't see this form. CBP does spot-check these but the majority just go through. Since UPS is the importer in this situation, they also pay the tariff they computed "in advance" to clear customs, and then they charge you for that plus their broker fee.
</p><p>
It took several more days for the actual tariff bill to arrive, which was early Monday morning. Now, the initial E-mail said this:

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhz3mJRRRVpyOUdo0bPPC4ZPIgHYDTaBL9yvPapat_CUPHIHJL1DjG1nbiLWRsu3tnHK6Ar3gLDc5u0AIHjyaPcDk5epS-Ojwmlnft8i2A5SXZDuZ5cIA0VRt-kQy4-YsGqMJDFxpYdXDUVXTW-OIxp2Mx0UTt10ynbVgt0cwPXPuauiIWx2Cez8mQLt4c/s1804/upyourups-3.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="1804" data-original-width="1668" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhz3mJRRRVpyOUdo0bPPC4ZPIgHYDTaBL9yvPapat_CUPHIHJL1DjG1nbiLWRsu3tnHK6Ar3gLDc5u0AIHjyaPcDk5epS-Ojwmlnft8i2A5SXZDuZ5cIA0VRt-kQy4-YsGqMJDFxpYdXDUVXTW-OIxp2Mx0UTt10ynbVgt0cwPXPuauiIWx2Cez8mQLt4c/s320/upyourups-3.png"></a></p><p>

Yes, the initial bill was for US$711. When I logged in, however, it gave me a total of $698 because it hadn't yet been delivered, which included a $14 brokerage fee.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4IQTh6fo1ImSoo2TL8H7pDwB4OtcnDAwlo4mlZwBVkjlYai32RuU-nF6cDioi_kuIsbFLZSeM9cyvJKPHZREcvfp3WsXhIbVMx5xqS80DvjPCibAViqcq635sv_Eh-CkzLulfQXRCnfMCCZnuxkAuM87tumEaJMoREgPPokLnzoZIB8GqTOKM98yCTU0/s2906/upyourups-4.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="1201" data-original-width="2906" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4IQTh6fo1ImSoo2TL8H7pDwB4OtcnDAwlo4mlZwBVkjlYai32RuU-nF6cDioi_kuIsbFLZSeM9cyvJKPHZREcvfp3WsXhIbVMx5xqS80DvjPCibAViqcq635sv_Eh-CkzLulfQXRCnfMCCZnuxkAuM87tumEaJMoREgPPokLnzoZIB8GqTOKM98yCTU0/s320/upyourups-4.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

Time was of the essence, however, because it was arriving <em>that day</em>. I was absolutely incandescent to have to do it, but I paid the entire charge in full on the spot, and this is <em>the correct thing to do.</em> The last thing you want is for your package to get redirected to a warehouse pending your payment, because any shipper will start tacking on storage fees and they have no incentive to get it out of storage quickly. For UPS, a direct quote from their own agents, "Warehouse charges will be added on shipments that are held in our warehouse over two business days at a rate of $20.00 per day and $0.04 per pound. ... On the 15th day, all shipments will be eligible for General Order warehousing by U.S. Customs. Any shipment moved to a G.O. warehouse will be assigned additional warehouse fees over and above any UPS warehouse fees. If imposed, these fees must be paid in full before the shipment can be removed." Obviously I wanted no part of that.
</p><p>
After I had been advised by the system the package would be delivered as scheduled, I then relentlessly abused the AI chatbot on UPS' home page until it asked for my phone number and I got a callback into their phone support line. The first person on the line advised me they didn't handle tariffs and transferred me to another department, after which I spent (not an exaggeration) 45 minutes on hold until it was answered. This new agent said that this was dealt with through a specific subgroup on the UPS post entry team that didn't do anything by phone. (These brokerage teams generally operate out of the Kentucky UPS Worldport hub at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, formerly Standiford Field, hence its IATA code of SDF that also turns up in UPS documentation.) He gave me an E-mail address that looked like line noise but I confirmed it twice with him and also that I had to put the tracking number into the subject line with the magic words "Disputing Duties and Custom Charges." I indicated in the message the fees were paid but that I believed they were unreasonable and incorrect, and also pointed out I submitted the Section 232 paperwork when requested.
</p><p>
It took a day to get a reply, then came the United States Veterans' Day holiday, and finally I heard back yesterday from a second agent that they had "corrected this shipment." What they had done was file an amended Form 7501 and this 7501 they actually sent me so I could see the results. The declared value was changed to US$342 (I presume a difference in the spot exchange rate at the time of filing) and now it had two HTSUS numbers. The entire $342 was attributed to <a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=8473.30.2000">8473.30.2000</a>, a slightly different code for "Parts and accessories, including face plates and lock latches, of printed circuit assemblies" which might be referring to the bracket I declared in the Section 232 form. There was no tariff on this ("FREE"). However, a second code <a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=99030220">9903.02.20</a> was added, a long-winded way of saying a tariff (in this case 15%) on "articles the product of the European Union." This was $51.30 and the final tariff.
</p><p>
Everything arrived safely, by the way, and in excellent condition (though I cracked open the antistatic bag on the ANS board to take off the Maxell battery which Apple always shipped logic boards with back then). However, I would like to point out for the sake of accuracy that the ANS logic board, ROM SIMM and cache DIMM have no country of origin printed on them. Only the Twin Turbo card does, and it says ...

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7B2-6rjm9Xk610XOOuYNQb9w-E7i8E4IEyDwbzjj5hEdHvioIl9jot8cL6rwI-f8H8h4XsBrBUOoT5LGbSTuNMpZ8WdX2H7MIsrRxAID_aZD-Rf2ohHp3R5o7vbP0rxGVV28zWsAJHZqs23TkukVgNY7GwM18cdqAnEFIjp_8K86vCQ2KxcdHhFiX-TY/s4080/PXL_20251115_231859295~2.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7B2-6rjm9Xk610XOOuYNQb9w-E7i8E4IEyDwbzjj5hEdHvioIl9jot8cL6rwI-f8H8h4XsBrBUOoT5LGbSTuNMpZ8WdX2H7MIsrRxAID_aZD-Rf2ohHp3R5o7vbP0rxGVV28zWsAJHZqs23TkukVgNY7GwM18cdqAnEFIjp_8K86vCQ2KxcdHhFiX-TY/s320/PXL_20251115_231859295~2.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p>

.. but since it wasn't the major part of the order it seemed like I'd be wasting even more time over ten or fifteen bucks to appeal this too. Your mileage and motivation may vary.
</p><p>
Now that UPS was into me for $632.70, the revising agent said, "Any difference between the amount paid and the amount now reflected will be auto-refunded to you. Most of the time, this is done by check sent to the billing address, you can expect this between 2-6 weeks." They didn't say when they don't use a check (I paid with a credit card), but they did give me a phone number for accounting, which I'll call if UPS fails to pay back this particular interest-free loan.
</p><p>
So that's the sordid tale. Even though UPS (mostly) made this right, I'm still unhappy with them for screwing up so badly in the first place because I'm out the money until they get around to reimbursing me. You'd think someone would have noticed that a thumping big duty like that seemed a little weird for a transaction of this size and maybe called a supervisor or something. The fact it could be so promptly appealed — and reversed in a few days, something that hardly ever happens with the federal government — pretty much demonstrates it was their call to ding it for that much in duty in the first place. I'm also unhappy with them for only alerting me to the final cost of the tariff when the shipment was inbound and due for delivery instead of earlier when it was assessed, because they have you over a barrel at that point unless you want to take your chances with their brokerage warehouse. This obviously nets them more money with the people who won't pay up immediately, but it's undeniably pretty bad customer service. Unfortunately, my unscientific survey of reports in the UPS Reddit indicate I am far from the only person to get a disproportionate assessment of this type.
</p><p>
Regardless, if this happens to you — whether it's FedEx or DHL or UPS or whatever — <em>pay it</em> and <em>then</em> appeal it. Don't let your shipment go to a warehouse and don't bounce it back to the sender; since odds are the shipper (because they are likely the importer of record) has already paid the duty, they're going to want their money back and you'll be out the money <em>and</em> the items. But, by golly, appeal it: just because you might agree with it politically doesn't mean they did it right.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>One of the first things any Rust programmer learns is that you can’t pass an object and a reference to that object around at the same time. It’s impossible to do, even indirectly. This limitation has been the subject of countless questions on Stack Overflow and posts on Reddit and the Rust forums and anywhere else where Rust programmers might ask for help. It’s so well-known that most people treat it like an axiom, not just a limitation of Rust <em>as it currently exists</em>, but an inherent limitation of borrow checking <em>in general</em>.</p>

<p>However, that’s not the case. In fact, with the right perspective, the way to support it is obvious. In this post, I’ll walk through the steps and show how self-borrows and much more could be supported in a hypothetical alternate or future version of Rust.</p>

<h3 id="but-first-some-obligatory-disclaimers">But first, some obligatory disclaimers</h3>

<p>To be clear, when I say something can’t be done in Rust, what I mean is that it can’t be done <em>in a safe, zero-cost way</em>. As an army of internet commenters are no doubt rushing to observe, any limitation of a static type system can be bypassed by using unsafety or runtime checks instead (e.g. “lol, just wrap everything in <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>” or “lol, just build your own memory management on top of <code>Vec</code> indices”). And the fact that a less safe or efficient workaround exists <em>is</em> of great interest to people who just need to solve a problem quickly. But from a language design perspective, the pertinent fact is that Rust’s type system has gaps which make certain common tasks impossible to do <em>in a way that lets Rust be Rust</em>, and not just a glorified C or Javascript.</p>

<p>Lastly, this post will discuss changes purely from a type checking perspective without regard to how hard they’d actually be to implement. In a major real-world language like Rust, <em>any</em> change, no matter how trivial, has a huge cost in terms of ecosystem, documentation, tooling, backwards compatibility, etc. But I’m a language design hobbyist, not a Rust compiler engineer, so language design is the part I’ll speak about.</p>

<p>So how do you type-check self borrows? The trick is actually to adopt an even more ambitious goal, <em>safe async functions</em>.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-rust">A brief history of Rust</h2>

<p>Rust 1.0 shipped with no support whatsoever for non-movable types. The fact that any value of any type could be arbitrarily memcpy’d around and still work was a core assumption of the language.</p>

<p>However, it didn’t take long before people realized that non-movable types are actually very useful. In particular, async functions nearly always produce non-movable future types, so you can’t have async Rust without support in some fashion for non-movable types.</p>

<p>Sadly, it was too late to do things properly (i.e. a <code>Move</code> auto-trait), but they were able to at least hack in partial support via the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/struct.Pin.html"><code>Pin</code></a> type, added in Rust 1.33.0.</p>

<h3 id="but-not-for-thee">…but not for thee</h3>

<p>Now if you’re like me, you might have thought, “Pin is added, which means support for self-borrows. Great, now I can refactor and simplify all my code!” Unfortunately, that’s not what actually happened.</p>

<p><code>Pin</code> made it possible for Rust code to <em>work with</em> and <em>pass around</em> non-movable types, but there was still no way to actually <em>create</em> them. That is a bit of dark magic that the compiler jealously hoards for itself. Whenever you write an async function, the compiler will magically generate a secret non-movable type, and <code>Pin</code> makes it possible to work with these types, but there is still no way to actually create self-referential types yourself (again, in safe, zero-cost code).</p>

<p>However, <strong>what if it didn’t have to be this way?</strong> Personally, I think async functions (and closures) should be desugared into 100% safe Rust code that the user <em>could</em> have written themselves if they wanted to. Not because users would necessary actually want to do that very often, but because having a desugared version of every magic feature is useful didactically and for low-level libraries, and because it forces Rust to be <em>honest about its type system</em> instead of papering over the cracks with compiler magic.</p>

<p>Since async functions have self-borrows, supporting them conveniently also implies support for self-borrows more generally. Now the only question is how to actually support safe async functions.</p>

<p>The rest of this post is divided into two parts. In part 1, I will cover the changes needed from a high level type system perspective, while in part 2, I’ll cover the remaining low level details.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-the-value-level">Part 1: The value level</h2>

<p>In order to make async functions possible in (safe) Rust, we first have to figure out why they <em>aren’t</em> possible already. Most people would answer “async functions have self-borrows, and it is impossible to support self-borrows in the borrow checker”, but that is the wrong way to look at things. The <em>actual</em> answer is that <strong>it is impossible to name the types of local variables</strong>.</p>

<p>To see why this is, consider how you would go about desugaring an async function. Suppose we have a simple async function <code>foo</code> that adds some numbers and calls another async function like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>sub</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Pin</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>Future</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Output</span><span>=</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>todo!</span><span>()}</span>

<span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u32</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>12345</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>sub</span><span>();</span>
    <span>f</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>let</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>f2</span> <span>=</span> <span>sub</span><span>();</span>
    <span>f2</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>How would we desugar <code>foo</code> by hand? We need to create a custom Future type <code>Foo</code> with a state machine representing the possible states of the original <code>foo</code> function. Specifically, we need a state machine with one state per <code>await</code> point in the function, plus a begin and end state. And the contents of each state are just the local variables that are live at that point in the function.</p>

<p>Therefore, our custom state machine type would look like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Initial</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Await1</span><span>{</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>Pin</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>Future</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Output</span><span>=</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><span>},</span>
    <span>Await2</span><span>{</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>f2</span><span>:</span> <span>Pin</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>Future</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Output</span><span>=</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><span>},</span>
    <span>Final</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In order to create this type, we “just” have to list every local variable that is live at an await point, along with the types of all those local variables. Therefore, supporting async functions in safe Rust is just a matter of making it consistently possible to name the types of every variable. So why is this impossible to do right now? The first obstacle is <strong>unnameable types</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="unnameable-types">Unnameable types</h2>

<p><img src="https://blog.polybdenum.com/img/20240606_padme_rust.jpg"></p>

<p>Rust made the interesting design decision to <em>require</em> explicit type annotations on every function boundary and every custom type, and yet also make it <em>impossible</em> to write explicit types in many cases. This was already a problem in Rust 1.0 with closures, but got much worse a few years later with the introduction of async Rust and impl Trait.</p>

<p>Basically, some types (closures, async functions, impl Trait) <em>exist</em> in Rust’s type system but do not have a <em>name</em> and hence are impossible to <em>talk about</em> in your code. You can still pass those values around and interact with them as long as you never have to explicitly name their type, but as soon as you hit a function boundary or want to store them inside a struct or enum, whoops, it’s time to add generics or pointlessly <code>Box</code> everything up.</p>

<p>Even in the example code above, this is already a problem. I had to go out of my way to make <code>sub</code> return a boxed <code>dyn Future</code> in order to have a nameable type for the sake of example, but any realistic code would instead be working with unnameable futures everywhere.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this is also a very easy problem to solve - <strong>just give every type a name</strong>. Efforts to do this already have been indefinitely stalled over concerns about stabilizing the order of generic type parameters, but that’s a trivial concern compared to the much more invasive changes we’ll get into later.</p>

<h3 id="named-lifetimes">Named lifetimes</h3>

<p>There’s actually another kind of unnameable type as well - function local lifetimes. Unlike closures and futures, these can never cross a function boundary without being replaced by generic parameters, so they don’t cause problems for <em>existing</em> code, but they’re still types that can’t be named, and if we’re going to support async functions in Rust, we need a way to name them.</p>

<p>Any syntax actually added to Rust would obviously have to get bikeshedded to death and assessed for education and tooling and so on, but as I’m just a person writing a blog post, I’m under no such constraints, so for the sake of example, I’ll propose the following syntax:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>Vec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>life</span> <span>'a</span><span>,</span> <span>'b</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
<span>// do stuff with r</span>
<span>end</span> <span>'a</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>r2</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'b</span> <span>mut</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
<span>// do stuff with r2</span>
<span>end</span> <span>'b</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this proposal, you first declare a <em>lifetime token</em> via <code>life 'a</code>. This token represents a lifetime that lasts as long as the token exists. Next, when borrowing a reference, you can optionally specify an explicit lifetime, e.g. <code>&amp;'a mut v</code>. Finally, you can <em>end</em> a lifetime via <code>end 'a</code>, which consumes the token.</p>

<p>This syntax is more verbose than the current syntax, but I don’t expect users to actually use named lifetime syntax that often. I see it like <code>drop</code>. You <em>can</em> write all your <code>drop</code>s explicitly if you want to, but most of the time people let the compiler insert them implicitly instead. Likewise under my proposal, people will usually still use the current syntax and let the compiler implicitly insert anonymous lifetimes, but they can also write named lifetimes explicitly if they want to.</p>

<h3 id="static-checking">Static checking</h3>

<p>Under my named lifetimes proposal, <em>all checking is still done purely at compile time</em>, just like the existing borrow checker. The lifetime tokens only exist at compile time and there is no runtime impact.</p>

<p>In order to do all type checking statically, we have to enforce certain invariants. Specifically, <em>types can only refer to lifetimes in the current scope</em>. Any type that escapes outside of the scope of the lifetime token it refers to becomes invalid. Likewise, consuming a lifetime token invalidates all types that refer to that lifetime.</p>



<p>As it turns out, unnameable types aren’t the only barrier to naming the types of variables in Rust. Unnameable types are types that still exist in Rust’s formal type system, but don’t have names. However, Rust’s formal type system is only a subset of its de-facto type system because in addition to Rust’s official type checker, the compiler also incorporates <em>shadow type checkers</em> which do type-checking like things but are not formally part of the type checker.</p>

<p>There are types that are part of Rust’s de-facto type system which don’t even exist in Rust’s formal type system in the first place, let alone have names. I call these types <strong>inconceivable types</strong> because from the perspective of a Rust compiler engineer, they aren’t types and don’t even exist in the first place.</p>

<p>Therefore, in order to support async functions, we’ll also need to add all the missing inconceivable types into Rust’s formal type system.</p>

<h3 id="partial-moves">Partial moves</h3>

<p>What are these shadow type checkers? Consider the following Rust code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>mem</span><span>::</span><span>drop</span><span>;</span>

<span>#[derive(Default)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>MyStrings</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>ms</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyStrings</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>();</span>
    
    <span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>ms</span><span>.x</span><span>);</span>
    <span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>ms</span><span>.y</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>At first glance, this code shouldn’t compile. After all, <code>ms</code> is used twice, right? <code>ms</code> should already be moved when it is referenced the first time in <code>ms.x</code>, which would make <code>ms.y</code> a compile error. However, the Rust compiler actually allows this!</p>

<p>The reason is because Rust has a secret shadow type checker which allows you to partially move and partially borrow values as long as they stay within a function. The fact that this is limited to within a function makes it harder to spot since it never forces the user to write the function-boundary-mandatory type annotations that would be impossible since these types don’t actually exist in Rust’s formal type system.</p>

<p>However, they are still a problem for async functions because we need to be able to specify the types of <em>local</em> variables as well. Consider the following code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>ms</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyStrings</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>();</span>
    
    <span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>ms</span><span>.x</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// What is ms's type here?!?!</span>
    <span>sub</span><span>()</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
    <span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>ms</span><span>.y</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>What is the type of <code>ms</code> at the await point? The formal type system would answer “oh, the type is <code>MyStrings</code>, that doesn’t change.” However, its <em>de-facto</em> type clearly does change. After all, you can’t access the <code>x</code> field on it like you could for any true value of type <code>MyStrings</code>. The true type is now something else entirely, an inconceivable type.</p>

<p>Therefore, the next step is to add the inconceivable types for partial borrows and partial moves to Rust’s formal type system, so that they can be referenced in type annotations. For this, I propose the syntax <code>Foo{bar, baz}</code>, to list the fields explicitly. E.g. <code>MyStrings{y}</code> means a value with the <em>memory layout</em> of <code>MyStrings</code>, but where only field <code>y</code> remains (with the <code>x</code> part being arbitrary uninitialized data). This can be extended to partial borrows as well, e.g. <code>&amp;mut Foo{bar, baz}</code>.</p>

<p>However, that’s not all. There’s still one more shadow type checker to deal with, and it’s a really big one. As it turns out, the borrow checker is <em>also</em> a shadow type checker.</p>

<h3 id="borrowed-types">Borrowed types</h3>

<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Hello, world"</span><span>.to_string</span><span>();</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// What is the type of s here???</span>
    <span>sub</span><span>()</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>r</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>'!'</span><span>);</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>What is the type of <code>s</code> at the await point? Again, the formal type system says “it’s <code>String</code> the whole time, that doesn’t change”, but again that’s a lie. The de-facto type of <code>s</code> can’t be <code>String</code>, because it doesn’t support the operations of a value of type <code>String</code>. In fact, it doesn’t support <em>any</em> operations, because any attempt to access <code>s</code> at that point will result in a compile error.</p>

<p>Therefore, the type of <code>s</code> must be temporarily changing to some other, inconceivable type. Specifically, the types of <em>borrowed values</em> are inconceivable types.</p>

<p>For this, I propose the syntax <code>!'a mut String</code>, but to understand why, we’ll first have to go into a brief digression on the theoretical basis for borrow checking.</p>

<h2 id="why-borrow-checking">Why borrow checking?</h2>

<p>There’s a common misconception, even in the Rust community, that borrow checking is just a memory management strategy, just a quirk of languages in the C++ niche and not something you need in a language with garbage collection. In fact however, borrow checking is the inevitable consequence of <a href="https://blog.polybdenum.com/2023/03/05/fixing-the-next-10-000-aliasing-bugs.html">protecting against aliasing bugs</a>, regardless of which memory management strategy a language uses.</p>

<h3 id="affine-types">Affine types</h3>

<p>In a traditional language, if you have a value of type <code>T</code>, you can make any number of copies of that value that all still have type T, just by reading it:</p>

<div><pre><code>let foo: T = ...;
let bar: T = foo;
// foo and bar have type T
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, this doesn’t work if you want to reason about aliasing. In particular, if you have a type for <em>exclusively referenced</em> objects (written <code>xcl</code> in this section for the sake of example), it is not sound to allow copying like this, because then you’ll have two references to the same object, both of which think they are the only one.</p>

<p>Therefore, exclusive references must be <em>affine types</em>, meaning that they can only be used once.</p>

<h3 id="splitting">Splitting</h3>

<p>However, being able to use each value only once makes it impossible to write all but the most trivial programs. In order to do anything useful, you need to be able to <em>split</em> a type so you can use values more than once.</p>

<p>A type can be thought of as a set of permissions to access the associated value, and thus it is safe to copy a value as long as the <em>permissions</em> aren’t copied. Instead, the child values need to have a <em>disjoint</em> set of permissions.</p>

<p>For example, suppose we have an exclusive reference to an object with fields of type <code>T</code> and <code>U</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code>let a = {foo: _, bar: _};
// a has the type xcl {foo: T, bar: U};

let b = a as {foo: T};
// b has type xcl {foo: T}
// a has type xcl {bar: U}
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can create a second reference to the object by <em>splitting</em> the permissions - after the split <code>a</code> <em>only</em> has the ability to read the field <code>bar</code> while <code>b</code> <em>only</em> has the ability to read field foo. Since they can only read disjoint parts of the object, it is still sound to have two exclusive references to the same object. (Note: this is pseudocode in a high level language for the sake of example - Rust doesn’t actually work this way due to other, low level considerations).</p>

<p>For traditional types (or <code>Copy</code> types in Rust parlance), you have the splitting rule <code>T =&gt; T + T</code>. In other words, given a value of <code>T</code>, you can split it into two values that both still have type <code>T</code>. For affine types, that splitting rule doesn’t exist, but there are still other splitting rules that are sound. For example, you can split by fields as we just saw: <code>xcl {foo: T, bar: U} =&gt; (xcl {foo: T}) + (xcl {bar: U})</code>.</p>

<h3 id="temporal-splitting">Temporal splitting</h3>

<p>The previous splitting rule is <em>spacial</em> - you can split access over disjoint fields of an object. However, spatial splitting alone doesn’t get you very far. In order to write practical code, you need another splitting rule. Besides splitting access by <em>space</em>, you can also split access by <em>time</em>.</p>

<p>Specifically, you can create a second copy of the reference as long as one copy can only be accessed <em>before</em> a given time, and the other copy can only be accessed <em>after</em> a given time. Since the access is split into disjoint periods of time, this is still sound.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>life</span> <span>'a</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>42</span><span>];</span>
<span>// v has exclusive access to the object</span>

<span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
<span>// r has exclusive access to the object before time a</span>
<span>// v has exclusive access to the object *after* time a</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is the essence of borrow checking. It’s not some arcane, low level memory management strategy, but just a natural, essential method of statically reasoning about <em>aliasing</em> in your code.</p>

<h3 id="negative-lifetime-bounds">Negative lifetime bounds</h3>

<p>Borrow checking involves two kinds of types - references that are valid <em>before</em> a given time, and references that are valid <em>after</em> a given time. The first kind is already part of Rust’s formal type system, the ordinary references you know and love. A value of type <code>&amp;'a mut T</code> has exclusive access <em>before</em> time <code>a</code>, and no access after time <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>However, Rust’s formal type system has no notion of the second kind of type, of references that are valid <em>after</em> a given time. This is the inconceivable type we need to add.</p>

<p>Since these are the opposite of normal lifetimes, it makes sense to use the “not” symbol <code>!</code>, e.g. <code>!'a</code>, which I call a <em>negative lifetime bound</em>. A bound of <code>'a</code> means the type is only valid <em>until</em> <code>a</code>, while a bound of <code>!'a</code> means it is only valid <em>after</em> <code>a</code> instead.</p>

<h2 id="bound-lifetimes">Bound lifetimes</h2>

<p>We can now express the types of all local variables, even the types that don’t currently exist in Rust, but there’s still one more problem. Recall that the example of named lifetimes looked like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>Vec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>life</span> <span>'a</span><span>,</span> <span>'b</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
<span>// do stuff with r</span>
<span>end</span> <span>'a</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>r2</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'b</span> <span>mut</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
<span>// do stuff with r2</span>
<span>end</span> <span>'b</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The problem is that the lifetime tokens (<code>'a</code> and <code>'b</code>) are <em>themselves</em> part of the function’s local state, and thus <em>also</em> have to be stored inside the state machine enum. Therefore, we need a way to store lifetime tokens inside of objects.</p>

<p>My proposed syntax introduces a new expression, <code>bind 'a in x</code>, which <em>moves</em> the lifetime token ‘a into the value x. And likewise, we have new destructuring pattern syntax, <code>let bind 'a in x = y;</code>, to do the reverse. Lastly, this also adds a new type, <code>bind 'a in T</code>, representing a type <code>T</code> with bound lifetime token <code>'a</code>.</p>

<p>Note that lifetime tokens and lifetimes only exist at compile time and have no runtime representation. <code>bind 'a in v</code> and the like are noops that exist purely for the sake of static type checking, and <code>bind 'a in T</code> has the same runtime representation as <code>T</code>.</p>

<h3 id="moving-lifetime-tokens">Moving lifetime tokens</h3>

<p>With the <code>end 'a</code> syntax, the lifetime token <code>'a</code> is consumed in place, which means that we know precisely when it ends. All types in scope with a positive (<code>'a</code>) bound become invalid, while all types in scope with a negative bound (<code>!'a</code>) have the negative bound removed (returning it to the original, unborrowed type).</p>

<p>However, when we <em>move</em> a lifetime token into a value, types referring to that lifetime which were in the old scope but not the new scope have to be treated differently. In this case, the lifetime token is no longer in scope <em>without</em> being ended, and so we have to pessimistically invalidate both positive <em>and</em> negative bounds. Types that reference the lifetime which are still within the new scope (i.e. the value that the lifetime token was bound to) are unaffected.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>This can be pretty confusing, so let’s look at some examples to show how the new lifetime system works.</p>

<p>First, suppose you try to return a reference to a local variable:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>life</span> <span>'a</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>.to_string</span><span>());</span>
<span>// s has type Box&lt;String&gt;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>*</span><span>s</span><span>;</span>
<span>// r has type &amp;'a mut String</span>
<span>// s has type Box&lt;!'a mut String&gt;</span>
<span>return</span> <span>r</span><span>;</span> <span>// error: r is invalid</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This naturally results in a compile error because <code>r</code> has the type <code>&amp;'a mut String</code>, but the lifetime token <code>'a</code> is <em>local</em> to the function. Therefore, when r is returned, it is no longer within the scope where <code>'a</code> exists and hence is invalid.</p>

<p>Now suppose we try binding <code>'a</code> to <code>r</code> before returning it:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>life</span> <span>'a</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>.to_string</span><span>());</span>
<span>// s has type Box&lt;String&gt;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>*</span><span>s</span><span>;</span>
<span>// r has type &amp;'a mut String</span>
<span>// s has type Box&lt;!'a mut String&gt;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>bind</span> <span>'a</span> <span>in</span> <span>r</span><span>;</span>
<span>// ret has type (bind 'a in &amp;'a mut String)</span>
<span>// s has type invalid</span>
<span>return</span> <span>ret</span><span>;</span> <span>// error: s is invalid</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This time, <code>ret</code> contains its own lifetime token, and so is not invalidated when returning. However, moving the lifetime token <code>'a</code> into <code>ret</code> invalidates <code>s</code>. Returning causes <code>s</code> to be implicitly dropped, but it can’t be dropped because it is invalid, resulting in a compile error.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s try binding <code>'a</code> to a tuple of both <code>r</code> <em>and</em> <code>s</code> and returning that:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>life</span> <span>'a</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>.to_string</span><span>());</span>
<span>// s has type Box&lt;String&gt;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>*</span><span>s</span><span>;</span>
<span>// r has type &amp;'a mut String</span>
<span>// s has type Box&lt;!'a mut String&gt;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>bind</span> <span>'a</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>);</span>
<span>// ret has type (bind 'a in (Box&lt;!'a mut String&gt;, &amp;'a mut String))</span>
<span>return</span> <span>ret</span><span>;</span> <span>// ok</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This time, everything works. We’ve just returned a string <em>along with a borrowed reference to that string</em> in a 100% safe and zero-cost manner!</p>

<h3 id="destructuring">Destructuring</h3>

<p>Now that we’ve successfully returned a self-borrowed object, let’s look at how you would <em>use</em> an object with self-borrows.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>:</span> <span>bind</span> <span>'a</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;!</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>String</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>String</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// v has type (bind 'a in (Box&lt;!'a mut String&gt;, &amp;'a mut String))</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>bind</span> <span>'b</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// 'b is a lifetime token</span>
    <span>// s has type Box&lt;!'b mut String&gt;</span>
    <span>// r has type &amp;'b mut String</span>

    <span>r</span><span>.push_str</span><span>(</span><span>" world!"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>end</span> <span>'b</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// s has type Box&lt;String&gt;</span>
    <span>// r is invalid</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="external-lifetimes">External lifetimes</h2>

<p>So far, we’ve only looked at <em>owned</em> lifetime tokens. However, in some cases, you instead have a <em>reference</em> to an unknown lifetime token that exists elsewhere. There are two cases where this can happen:</p>

<p><strong>Generic lifetime parameters</strong></p>

<p>When a generic function is called, the generic lifetime parameters represent <em>some</em> lifetime which is owned by some caller of the function. These lifetimes are guaranteed to last at least as long as the function call, but could last longer.</p>

<p><strong>Destructured <em>references</em> to bound lifetimes</strong></p>

<p>In the previous example, we destructured an <em>owned value</em> that contained a lifetime token, resulting in the token being moved into the current scope.</p>

<p>If you destructure a <em>reference</em> to a value with a lifetime token, you instead get a reference to a lifetime token, rather than the token itself. These lifetimes are guaranteed to last at least as long as the destructured reference, but could last longer.</p>

<p>When you have a reference to an external lifetime, you can’t <em>end</em> or <em>move</em> the lifetime, since you don’t own the corresponding token. However, as long as the lifetime reference exists, you still can interact with types that refer to that lifetime.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of mutating a value with a bound lifetime via a mutable reference:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'call</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'call</span> <span>mut</span> <span>(</span><span>bind</span> <span>'a</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>'a</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>str</span><span>)))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// 'call is an external lifetime</span>
    <span>// v has type &amp;'call mut (bind 'a in (!'a String, &amp;'a str))</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>bind</span> <span>'b</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// 'b is an external lifetime</span>
    <span>// s has type &amp;'call mut (!'b String)</span>
    <span>// r has type &amp;'call mut (&amp;'b str)</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>r1</span><span>,</span> <span>r2</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>r</span><span>.split_at</span><span>(</span><span>32</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// r1 and r2 have type (&amp;'b str)</span>

    <span>// can assign back to r since they both have type &amp;'b str</span>
    <span>*</span><span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>r2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Lastly, we also need to add a type to represent bound <em>lifetime references</em> in a type. However, the recursion stops there because a reference to a reference to a lifetime is equivalent to just a reference to a lifetime, since they don’t actually have any state or runtime representation and can’t be mutated.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-the-bytes-level">Part 2: The bytes level</h2>

<p>If we were writing a high-level language, we’d already be done, but for Rust, we still have the low-level details to worry about.</p>

<p>There are two ways to consider a type system. The first is <em>what</em> your code does, in an abstract machine, with no concerns about how it is actually implemented. I call this “the value level”.</p>

<p>The second level is <em>how</em> your code does it, in terms of low level implementation details like how values are stored in memory, which I call “the bytes level”. In a high level language, this might not even be exposed to users, but as Rust is a systems language, it gives programmers control over low level details like this.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, Rust has a single type system which implicitly encodes both levels in a single type. Unfortunately, this means that the desired combination is sometimes simply not represented in Rust’s type system.</p>

<p>In particular, Rust conflates ownership of <em>values</em> with ownership of <em>the memory where those values are stored</em>. This isn’t just a problem for a <em>new</em> feature like async functions. It causes problems even in ordinary real-world Rust coding. In particular, it means that <code>Drop</code> has the wrong type signature because the correct type signature simply doesn’t exist in Rust.</p>

<h2 id="drop">Drop</h2>

<p>When I say “<code>Drop</code> has the wrong type signature”, some people might be thinking, “oh, you mean it should have wrapped <code>self</code> in <code>Pin</code>, right?”. But that’s just a minor inconvenience to people who are writing unsafe code anyway, and <code>Pin</code> itself only dates back to Rust 1.33.0. The problem I’m talking about is much worse. <strong><code>Drop</code> was broken, even in Rust 1.0</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, last year, I had a struct containing a Tokio oneshot channel, and I wanted to send on that channel when the container was dropped. No problem, I figured, this is exactly the kind of thing Rust is good at. Should be easy, right?</p>

<p>…right??</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>channel</span><span>:</span> <span>tokio</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>oneshot</span><span>::</span><span>Sender</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>Drop</span> <span>for</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// error[E0507]: cannot move out of `self.channel` which is behind a mutable reference</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.channel</span><span>.send</span><span>(());</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As it turns out, this seemingly simple task is <em>impossible</em> to do in Rust. (And yes, as always, you can throw away static checking and just use <code>unsafe</code> or wrap your type in an unnecessary <code>Option</code> or whatever. I’m talking about <em>safe</em> <em>zero-cost</em> Rust here.)</p>

<p>The reason why this seemingly simple code pattern is impossible is right there in the error message. <code>Drop</code> takes <code>self</code> <em>by mutable reference</em>. In Rust, mutable references have the <em>invariant</em> that the type is unchanged. You can’t move fields out of a mutable reference (unless you replace them with another value of the same type).</p>

<p>The whole point of a destructor is to destruct your type. The value is disassembled and the type goes away. You start with <code>T</code> and end with <em>nothing</em>. However, <code>Drop</code> takes <code>&amp;mut T</code> instead, which has the postcondition that everything is unchanged and your <code>T</code> is still sitting there, good as always. Somehow, Rust ended up with a destructor api <em>that can’t actually destruct anything</em>.</p>

<p>So how did Rust make such an obvious mistake? The problem is that the Rust designers painted themselves into a corner in a misguided attempt to minimize the number of types in the formal type system.</p>

<h3 id="owned-references">Owned references</h3>

<p>Currently, Rust has three kinds of types: <code>T</code>, <code>&amp;mut T</code>, and <code>&amp;T</code>. If you plot their ownership and representation, you get this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Owned?</th>
      <th>Representation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>yes</td>
      <td>inline</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&amp;mut T</td>
      <td>no</td>
      <td>pointer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&amp;T</td>
      <td>no</td>
      <td>pointer</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Notice something missing? There is no possible type with “yes, pointer” (or “no, inline” for that matter, but that doesn’t matter much). Rust conflates <em>ownership</em> with <em>representation</em>. (More specifically, there is no way to own a <em>value</em> without owning the underlying memory - <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> is technically an owned pointer, but the pointer can only point to its own, owned memory, not memory that is managed elsewhere.)</p>

<p>In Rust, there is no way to transfer ownership of a value without <em>moving</em> the value. This was a major problem when Rust added async and decided that it needed to deal with non-movable types after all. Since the assumption of movability is built into the language in such a core way, there was no way to add non-movable types other than just saying “ok, everything related to them is unsafe, but here’s <code>Pin</code> so you can at least partially hide the unsafety from your users, have fun”.</p>

<p><code>Drop</code> can’t take <code>self</code> as a mutable reference because mutable references can’t be destructed, as discussed above. But it <em>also</em> can’t take <code>self</code> by <em>value</em>, because that makes it impossible to drop non-movable types. (There are also minor considerations around recursion, presumably the reason <code>Drop</code> didn’t take values even <em>before</em> Rust added non-movable types.)</p>

<p>The solution to this dilemma is that the <em>correct</em> type for <code>Drop</code> to take is a type that currently doesn’t exist - an <em>owned reference</em>, which I’ll write <code>&amp;own T</code>.</p>

<p><code>&amp;own T</code> is similar to <code>&amp;mut T</code>, except that it <em>owns</em> the referenced value. This means that it has no post-conditions like <code>&amp;mut T</code> does, and you can freely move fields out of the reference, and it will implicitly drop anything remaining when it goes out of scope. However, unlike <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>&amp;own T</code> does not own the <em>memory</em>, meaning you can take an <code>&amp;own T</code> reference to values on the stack when you need to drop them, and even recursively take <code>&amp;own T</code> references to fields.</p>

<h3 id="owned-reference-example">Owned reference example</h3>

<p>So what would a <em>correct</em> version of <code>Drop</code> look like? Let’s look at an example.</p>

<p>First, let’s start with a simple struct with some fields and methods:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>MyStrings</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>MyStrings</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>some_method</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{} {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>.x</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>.y</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can implement <code>Drop</code> like this. <code>self</code> starts out as an owned reference to the full type, meaning we can call methods on it like normal. Once we move fields out of it, the type of <code>self</code> changes to the corresponding partial type (recall that Rust already supports partially moved types as an inconceivable type).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>Drop</span> <span>for</span> <span>MyStrings</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>own</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// self has type &amp;own MyStrings</span>
     
        <span>// we can call methods within drop()</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.some_method</span><span>();</span>
     
        <span>// now let's move a field</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.x</span><span>;</span>
        <span>// self now has type &amp;own MyStrings{y}</span>
     
        <span>// we're too lazy to drop the other field, but it will be dropped implicitly</span>
        <span>// drop(self.y)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When an owned reference goes out of scope, all remaining fields are dropped implicitly, not just inside a <code>drop</code> method, but anywhere an <code>&amp;own T</code> exists. This is important a) for avoiding leaks while unwinding when an exception is thrown and b) because people will often not explicitly drop everything in a <code>drop</code> impl.</p>

<h3 id="initialization">Initialization</h3>

<p><code>Drop</code> isn’t the only place where non-movable types cause a problem. Rust’s entire design is centered around the assumption that you can move anything. You move values to transfer ownership, you move values to change types, you move values to initialize objects, etc. Therefore, making Rust usable for non-movable types requires more changes.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we <em>already</em> have to support partially moved types <em>anyway</em>, and that also conveniently covers the initialization case as well as the destruction case. Initialization is basically the same process as dropping, just in reverse:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>new</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyStrings</span><span>{};</span>
<span>// new has type MyStrings{}, a partially moved value</span>
<span>// this has the *memory layout* of MyStrings, but with no fields initialized</span>

<span>new</span><span>.x</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span><span>.to_string</span><span>();</span>
<span>// new has type MyStrings{x}</span>

<span>new</span><span>.y</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span><span>.to_string</span><span>();</span>
<span>// new has type MyStrings{x,y}, which is the same as a fully initialized MyStrings</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="safe-transmute">Safe transmute</h2>

<p>However, there’s still one problem - in-place transmutes between different <em>base</em> types.</p>

<p>Recall that our future state machine enum looks something like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>MyFuture</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Initial</span><span>(</span><span>State0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Await1</span><span>(</span><span>State1</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Await2</span><span>(</span><span>State2</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Final</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Our previous examples with drop and initialization changed the <em>actual</em> type (i.e. with different fields initialized or not), but the <em>base</em> type (which controls memory layout and method resolution) was the same. However, here, each enum variant has a <em>different</em> base type.</p>

<p>Currently in Rust, you always have to move values when converting between different base types. E.g. even just wrapping a value in a newtype (or unwrapping it) requires moving the value. However, the “move and reconstruct” paradigm won’t work here because our enum variants may contain <em>non-movable</em> types. Therefore, we need a way to convert between the different state types <em>in-place</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore, we need to add three things to Rust:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A way to specify that different types have the same memory layout</li>
  <li>A way to specify that certain fields have the same location within the type for different types</li>
  <li>The type system understands this and allows safe transmutes between them.</li>
  <li>Allow updating enums in a way that is aware of this.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>Suppose we have an async function like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
    <span>sub</span><span>()</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>let</span> <span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>if</span> <span>true</span> <span>{</span><span>r</span><span>.as_bytes</span><span>()}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><span>"hello"</span><span>.as_bytes</span><span>()};</span>
    <span>sub</span><span>()</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>z</span><span>);</span>
    <span>sub</span><span>()</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The corresponding future enum states are as follows, where <code>SubFut</code> is the name of the anonymous future type returned by the <code>sub()</code> function.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>State0</span> <span>{</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>State1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>!</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>String</span><span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>State3</span> <span>{</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>}</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>MyFuture</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Initial</span><span>(</span><span>State0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Await1</span><span>(</span><span>bind</span> <span>'a</span> <span>in</span> <span>State1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>SubFut</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Await2</span><span>(</span><span>bind</span> <span>'a</span> <span>in</span> <span>State2</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>SubFut</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Await3</span><span>(</span><span>State3</span><span>,</span> <span>SubFut</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Final</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The problem comes when we need to implement the state transitions (within the <code>poll</code> method). Since <code>State1</code> and <code>State2</code> contain a non-movable field (<code>s</code>), they have to be converted <em>in-place</em>.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what the best way to do this is, but I’m assuming we have some sort of annotation which allows us to mark that these types all use the same memory layout, and that <code>s</code> is located in the same place in each type, allowing us to safely transmute between them.</p>

<p>The basic transition process for say, state 1 to state 2, is to start with an owned reference to <code>State1</code>. Then we remove the <code>r</code> field and use it to compute <code>z</code>, as per the code between the two await points. This leaves the pointer with type <code>State1{s}</code>. Then we can safely transmute this to <code>State2{s}</code>, since <code>s</code> is guaranteed to be in the same place in both types. Finally, we add the <code>z</code> field back, to get a full <code>State2</code>.</p>

<h2 id="safe-enum-updates">Safe enum updates</h2>

<p>There’s still the question of how the compiler knows that enums are being updated in a safe manner.</p>

<h3 id="mut-to-own">&amp;mut to &amp;own</h3>

<p>The first question is how to temporarily violate the type invariants during the update. <code>poll</code> takes a <em>mutable</em> reference to <code>self</code>, but in Rust, <code>&amp;mut T</code> is required to preserve the type invariants of <code>T</code> at all times (well, there are some minor exceptions, but those are built into the compiler, not something users have direct access to).</p>

<p>You’re not allowed to move out of a mutable reference, because if this were allowed, and an exception were thrown and then caught, someone could access the reference again even though the pointee is now invalid. Therefore, we need to somehow get an owned reference to the enum variant instead.</p>

<p>However, there’s one workaround. You can’t temporarily move out of a <code>&amp;mut T</code> because that would violate the invariant of <code>T</code>, but you <em>can</em> move out of a <code>&amp;mut Option&lt;T&gt;</code>. Basically, we’ve widened the type invariant of the pointee to now include an “invalid” state. That state will never be seen in normal operation (assuming we always put the value back when done with it), but would be seen if an exception is thrown while the value is removed, and then that exception is caught and the reference accessed again.</p>

<p>For normal code, wrapping everything in an <code>Option</code> means adding a runtime cost and runtime type checks, which is why I ruled it out in previous discussions (e.g. restricting the discussion to “safe, <em>zero-cost</em> Rust”). However, it turns out that the <code>Future</code> api <em>already</em> effectively forces everything to have an extra “invalid” state anyway, so there’s no additional cost to having one. This is the reason for the extra <code>Final</code> state in all the enums shown above.</p>

<p>Therefore, when updating the enum state during <code>poll</code>, we start by setting the tag to <code>Final</code>, which lets us get ownership over the current contents of the enum. Under normal operation, we would then set it back to a valid state, but if an exception is thrown in the middle and then caught and the future is re-polled, the future would just be in the <code>Final</code> state (which will panic when polled, like a future typically will when polled after completion).</p>

<h3 id="tracking-self-ness">Tracking self-ness</h3>

<p>The basic process is to start by setting the enum tag to <code>Final</code>, which gives an <em>owned</em> reference to the former contents of the enum variant, much like how you can take an owned value out of a <code>&amp;mut Option&lt;T&gt;</code> (except that taking an owned <em>reference</em> is not something that currently exists in Rust).</p>

<p>Then we perform various mutations through the owned reference, which changes its type from <code>&amp;own State1</code> to <code>&amp;own State2</code> or whatever. Finally, once the variant pointer is updated to the correct type, we can set the tag of the original enum to match, thus restoring the invariant.</p>

<p>However, the last part is trickier than it sounds. The problem is that even if we have a <code>&amp;mut MyFuture</code> (with the variant part currently borrowed) and a <code>&amp;own State2</code> or whatever, the compiler can’t know that it is safe to set the tag back to <code>Await2</code> <em>because it doesn’t know that the <code>&amp;own State2</code> actually points to the enum you’re trying to update</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore, we need to add a function-local analysis pass to the compiler to facilitate this. When you borrow the variant of an enum, the compiler will keep track of the relation between the two local variables as long as they stay in the function, and allow a safe update of the enum if the variant pointer has the corresponding type.</p>

<h3 id="another-inconceivable-type">Another inconceivable type?</h3>

<p>Now you might be wondering, isn’t that enum-alias analysis pass yet another shadow type checker? Does this mean we have <em>another</em> inconceivable type to add to the type system?</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> a shadow type checker, but fortunately we don’t have to add it to the type system. The reason is that in order to support safe async functions, we need to be able to name the type of any local variable <em>that is held across an await point</em>. Therefore, we only need to add inconceivable types to the type system <em>if it is possible for them to exist across an await</em>.</p>

<p>As shown earlier, partially moved types and borrowed types can both exist across an await, which is why we have to add them to the type system. However, if we’re adding a <em>new</em> shadow type checker, we can just arbitrarily declare that the analysis stops at awaits, which avoids the need to add any new types to the formal type system.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the only thing we actually <em>need</em> the enum-alias pass for is to support safe enum updates within the <code>Future::poll</code> method, and <code>poll</code> is a non-async method, which means it can never contain awaits anyway. Therefore, there’s no problem with restricting our new safe enum update feature to not span awaits.</p>

<h3 id="leak">Leak</h3>

<p>This sort of ad-hoc special analysis is certainly not elegant. In an ideal world, Rust would not have to have any inconceivable types at all, not even ones that don’t cross awaits. And it certainly would be <em>possible</em> to turn this into a general purpose feature that is a first-class part of the type system.</p>

<p>However, doing this the proper way would require the introduction of <em>non-forgettable types</em>. Some people have already been asking for non-forgettable types to be added to Rust anyway for unrelated reasons (via a “<code>Leak</code>” auto-trait), but the results would not be pretty.</p>

<p>This post is already very long, and non-forgettable types would add much <em>more</em> complexity than anything I’ve covered, since it violates a more central assumption of the language than even non-movable types do. Therefore, for the sake of keeping this proposal <em>merely</em> very long and minimizing the complexity of Rust as much as possible, I think it’s best to just punt on that subject and implement enum alias checking via special compiler magic rather than non-forgettable types.</p>

<p>The “special compiler magic” approach has the downside that it will be impossible to factor parts of the <code>poll</code> method out into separate helper functions, because the required types won’t exist in the type system and hence can’t be named in the function signature, but I think that’s a small price to pay for leaving this can of worms unopened.</p>

<h2 id="pin-and-move">Pin and Move</h2>

<p>With that out of the way, there’s one last topic to address, <code>Pin</code>.</p>

<p>You may have noticed a conspicuous lack of <code>Pin</code> in all my examples. That’s because <code>Pin</code> was just a hack added due to the inability to introduce a <code>Move</code> auto-trait in a fully backwards compatible manner. But since the changes I’m proposing require breaking strict backwards compatibility <em>anyway</em> (good luck fixing the type signature of <code>Drop</code> in a backwards compatible manner!), we might as well assume that <code>Pin</code> gets replaced by a <code>Move</code> auto-trait for moveable types while we’re at it.</p>

<p>However, we still need a way to replicate the functions <code>Pin</code> is currently serving, as it doesn’t work quite the same way that <code>Move</code> would.</p>

<h3 id="enum-refinements">Enum refinements</h3>

<p>In current Rust, when a <code>Future</code> is initially created, you can freely move it around. However, you have to pin it before you can <em>poll</em> it, and once polled, it becomes unmovable.</p>

<p>In a <code>Move</code> world, this is basically saying that the <code>Initial</code> state of every future enum state machine has to be <code>Move</code>, but the other states of the enum may be non-<code>Move</code>. Since <code>poll</code> takes the enum by <code>&amp;mut</code>, it can switch between the states and thus the future has to be assumed to be non-movable after polling.</p>

<p>However, Rust’s current design doesn’t support any way to reason like that. Rust’s current type system is designed around the assumption that every value has exactly one type and that type never changes, which means that there is no way to talk about properties that hold now but not in the future. If an enum type implements an auto-trait, that means that <em>every</em> variant of the enum satisfies that trait, not just one variant.</p>

<p>This isn’t just a problem for futures. It often comes up in current Rust with <code>Copy</code> too, as in “why can’t I copy <code>None</code>”? For example, the following code will not compile because the array initial value has to be <code>Copy</code>, but <code>Option&lt;SomeNotCopyType</code> is not <code>Copy</code> due to the unused <code>Some</code> variant.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>SomeNotCopyType</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SomeNotCopyType</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span> <span>8</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>None</span><span>;</span> <span>8</span><span>];</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Therefore, we need a way to distinguish between “every variant of the enum satisfies this property” and “the <em>current</em> variant of the enum satisfies this property”. The syntax <code>T: Future + Move</code> already means the former, so we need to come up with different syntax for the latter.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what the best syntax is, so I’ll just go with <code>T: Future if Move</code>. <code>T: Future if Move</code> means “<code>T</code> is (any) future, <em>and</em> the value is <em>currently</em> <code>Move</code>”, while <code>T: Future + Move</code> instead means “T is a future type where every variant is <code>Move</code>” (which would be <code>Unpin</code> in current Rust).</p>

<p>Since explicit trait implementations can only be done for the enum type as a whole, this sort of “per-variant trait impl” only makes sense for auto-traits and lifetimes. Therefore, the right side is restricted to auto-traits and lifetime bounds. <code>T: Future if (Move + 'static)</code> would be allowed, but <code>T: Future if Clone</code> would not.</p>

<p>Additionally, the “if” syntax can also be applied to <em>explicit</em> non-generic enum types. E.g <code>foo: MyEnum if Copy</code> means <code>foo</code> has type <code>MyEnum</code> <em>and</em> its current variant is one that is <code>Copy</code>.</p>

<h3 id="stable-deref-types">Stable deref types</h3>

<p>In general, every borrowed type will be non-moveable. However, container types such as <code>Box</code>, <code>Vec</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Rc</code>, etc. could optionally tell the compiler that borrowing the <em>contents</em> of the container does not cause the container itself to become non-moveable. This is what makes it possible to return data along with a pointer to that data. The outer value will always be moved by Rust’s nature, but this is still safe as long as the <em>borrowed</em> data does not move.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Whew, we’re finally done! We’ve finally seen how to safely implement self-borrows and safe async functions in Hypothetical Future Rust.</p>

<p>To be honest, I think there’s approximately zero chance that this gets implemented in Rust, since the nature of a language with a large ecosystem means that you can’t just break backwards compatibility, and even seemingly trivial changes in Rust have been held up forever due to concerns around stabilization or documentation or whatever.</p>

<p>However, I hope that this post still helps people to think about the nature of the problem. In particular, it’s frustrating to see people say that self-borrows are an inherent impossibility with borrow checking when that limitation is really just a consequence of idiosyncratic choices made by Rust, and if not in current Rust, it certainly could have been supported in an alternate history Rust that made slightly different choices, and likely will be supported in future languages with borrow checking.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you have any comments or suggestions, please let me know by commenting on Reddit.</p>

    } else if (linktype == DLT_IEEE802_11) {
        got_radiotap = 0;
    } else {
        pcap_close(handle);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    pd = pcap_dump_open(handle, PCAP_SAVEFILE);
    pcap_loop(handle, -1 /*INFINITY*/, &amp;parse_packet, (unsigned char *) pd);
}
    </pre></code></p><p>
    The data from the libpcap loop is then given to <code>libwifi_get_frame()</code> which checks for frame validity and type/subtype, and stores the data in a <code>struct libwifi_frame</code>.
    </p><p><code><pre>void parse_packet(unsigned char *args,
                  const struct pcap_pkthdr *header,
                  const unsigned char *packet) {
    unsigned long data_len = header-&gt;caplen;
    unsigned char *data = (unsigned char *) packet;

    struct libwifi_frame frame = {0};
    int ret = libwifi_get_wifi_frame(&amp;frame, data, data_len, got_radiotap);
    if (ret != 0) {
        printf("[!] Error getting libwifi_frame: %d\n", ret);
        return;
    }
    </pre></code></p><p>
    The <code>libwifi_frame</code> struct can then be given to one of the frame parser functions, such as <code>libwifi_parse_beacon()</code>. Since the header comment for
    <code>libwifi_parse_beacon()</code> indicates that the parsed data is stored in a <code>struct libwifi_bss</code>, we need to initalise one and pass it as a parameter.
    </p><p>
    We'll use the BSS struct to easily show the SSID and Channel from the sniffed beacon frame.
    </p><p><code><pre>    if (frame.frame_control.type == TYPE_MANAGEMENT &amp;&amp;
        frame.frame_control.subtype == SUBTYPE_BEACON) {
        struct libwifi_bss bss = {0};

        int ret = libwifi_parse_beacon(&amp;bss, &amp;frame);
        if (ret != 0) {
            printf("Failed to parse beacon: %d\n", ret);
            return;
        }

        printf("SSID: %s, Channel: %d\n", bss.ssid, bss.channel);
    }
}
    </pre></code></p>
    <h2>Generation</h2><p>
    For frame generation, you only need to provide the required data to one of the frame generation functions. In this example, <code>libwifi_create_beacon()</code>.
    </p><p><code><pre>int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    struct libwifi_beacon beacon = {0};
    static unsigned char bcast[] = "\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF";
    static unsigned char tx[] = "\x00\x20\x91\xAA\xBB\CC";

    int ret = libwifi_create_beacon(&amp;beacon, bcast, tx, tx, "wifi-beacon", 11);
    if (ret != 0) {
        return ret;
    }
    </pre></code></p><p>
    From here, we can use the dumper function for this frame subtype to write the beacon in raw byte format to a buffer. This can be useful for writing the
    generated frame out to a pcap file using <code>pcap_dump()</code> or transmitting from a monitor mode interface.
    </p><p><code><pre>    unsigned char *buf = NULL;
    size_t buf_sz = libwifi_get_beacon_length(&amp;beacon);

    buf = malloc(buf_sz);
    if (buf == NULL) {
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    ret = libwifi_dump_beacon(&amp;beacon, buf, buf_sz);
    if (ret &lt; 0) {
        return ret;
    }

    // Inject frame bytes or write bytes to file

    libwifi_free_beacon(&amp;beacon);
    free(buf);
}
    </pre></code></p>

	<h2>About</h2>

	<p>AsciiMath is an easy-to-write markup language for mathematics.<br>
		Try it out in the interactive renderer:</p>

	<p><label for="demoSource">Input:</label>
		<br>

</section>

<section id="gettingStarted">
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>

	<p>In order to get started you have two options:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Use <a href="https://mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> to render your formulas.
				MathJax is a full fledged open source JavaScript display engine for
				mathematics and <strong>works in all browsers.</strong><br>
				This is the recommended approach!</p>

			<p>Get started by loading the default AsciiMath configuration:</p>

			<p>
				<code>&lt;script
					src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.4/latest.js?config=AM_CHTML"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
			</p>
	
			<p>Visit the MathJax <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html">Getting Started</a> 
				page to find other CDN options , or to learn how to install MathJax locally on your server.</p> 
				
			<p>Text in your HTML enclosed in <code>`</code> (backticks) will now get
				rendered as a math formula. The math delimiters can also be customized.
				Check out the <a href="https://mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> website for more
				information!</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Load the AsciiMath javascript file
				(<a href="http://git.io/X84VQQ">get it on GitHub</a>)
				in either the <code>head</code> or the <code>body</code>
				tag of your website like this:</p>

			<p>
				<code>&lt;script
					src="ASCIIMathML.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
			</p>

			<p>This file contains JavaScript to convert AsciiMath
				notation and (some) LaTeX to Presentation MathML. The conversion
				is done while the HTML page loads.</p>

			<p>
				<mark><strong>Attention:</strong> Currently this only works in
					Firefox and Safari.  
				</mark>
			</p>

			<p>While HTML5 now includes MathML as an official
				recommendation, the remaining browsers do not appear to be
				implementing it.  For widest browser compatibility, the use
				of MathJax is recommended.</p>

		</li>
	</ol>
</section>

<section id="syntax">
<h2>Syntax</h2>

	<p>Most AsciiMath symbols attempt to mimic in text what they look like 
	   rendered, like <code>oo</code> for `oo`.  Many symbols can also be
	   displayed using a TeX alternative, but a preceeding backslash is not 
	   required.</p>

<h3>Standard Functions</h3>

<p>sin, cos, tan, sec, csc, cot, 
arcsin, arccos, arctan, sinh, cosh, tanh, sech, csch, coth, exp, log, ln,
det, dim, mod, gcd, lcm, lub, glb, min, max, f, g.</p>

<br>

<h3>Special Cases</h3>

<p>Matrices: <code>[[a,b],[c,d]]</code> yields to `[[a,b],[c,d]]`</p>

<p>Column vectors: <code>((a),(b))</code> yields to `((a),(b))`</p>

<p>Augmented matrices: <code>[[a,b,|,c],[d,e,|,f]]</code> yields to `[[a,b,|,c],[d,e,|,f]]`</p>

<p>Matrices can be used for layout:
 <code>{(2x,+,17y,=,23),(x,-,y,=,5):}</code> yields
 `{(2x,+,17y,=,23),(x,-,y,=,5):}`</p>
 
<p>Complex subscripts: <code>lim_(N-&gt;oo) sum_(i=0)^N</code> yields to `lim_(N-&gt;oo) sum_(i=0)^N`</p>

<p>Subscripts must come before superscripts:
	<code>int_0^1 f(x)dx</code> yields to `int_0^1 f(x)dx`</p>
	
<p>Derivatives: <code> f'(x) = dy/dx</code> yields `f'(x) = dy/dx`<br>
	For variables other than x,y,z, or t you will need grouping symbols: 
	<code> (dq)/(dp)</code> for `(dq)/(dp)`</p>

<p>Overbraces and underbraces:
	<code>ubrace(1+2+3+4)_("4 terms")</code> yields `ubrace(1+2+3+4)_("4 terms")`.<br>
	<code>obrace(1+2+3+4)^("4 terms")</code> yields `obrace(1+2+3+4)^("4 terms")`.
</p>

<p>Attention: Always try to surround the <code>&gt;</code> and
	<code>&lt;</code> characters with spaces so that the html parser does not
	confuse it with an opening or closing tag!</p>
<br>


<h3>The Grammar</h3>

<p>Here is a definition of the grammar used to parse AsciiMath expressions.
	In the Backus-Naur form given below, the letter on the left of the
	<code>::=</code> represents a category of symbols that could be one
	of the possible sequences of symbols listed on the right.
	The vertical bar <code>|</code> separates the alternatives.</p>

<pre id="grammar">v ::= [A-Za-z] | greek letters | numbers | other constant symbols
u ::= sqrt | text | bb | other unary symbols for font commands

<p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0d424625-f4f8-4646-9f6e-927c8cbe0e3e"><em>Financial Times</em> reports</a> that Apple has stepped up its preparations for the handover of the CEO role from Tim Cook. Here are the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-apple-steps-up-tim-cook-s-succession-efforts">Apple steps up Tim Cook’s succession efforts</h2>



<p>According to the FT’s sources, Apple’s board and senior executives have “recently intensified” the company’s succession planning for its top role.</p>



<p>The <em>FT</em> adds that although Apple’s Senior VP of Hardware Engineering, John Ternus, is the most likely to take the reins of the company, “no final decisions have been made”.</p>



<p>While the report doesn’t mention why Apple is accelerating its succession efforts, it notes that the move is not tied to the company’s performance:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“People close to Apple say the long-planned transition is not related to the company’s current performance, ahead of what is expected to be a blockbuster end-of-year sales period for the iPhone.</p>



<p>(…)</p>



<p>The company is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, which covers the critical holiday period.”</p>
</blockquote>




	<p>Their sources also cautioned that “although preparations have intensified, the timing of any announcement could change”.</p>



<p>This report lands just hours after former Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/14/apple-ex-coo-jeff-williams-now-officially-retired/">spent his last day at Apple</a>, following the retirement announcement <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/08/apple-coo-jeff-williams-stepping-down-later-this-month/">he made in July</a>.</p>



<p>Williams had already handed operational leadership to Sabih Khan earlier this year, and his remaining responsibilities were <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/10/09/apple-folds-health-and-fitness-into-services-splits-apple-watch-oversight/">recently redistributed</a> among other top executives, Ternus among them.</p>



<p>Apple has also recently gone through a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/03/apple-cfo-luca-maestri/">CFO transition</a>, with longtime finance chief Luca Maestri stepping down and handing the role to Kevan Parekh, who previously served as the company’s vice president of Financial Planning and Analysis.</p>

<p id="15905113-780b-45b9-973e-ebd4fcdffa94">AMD increased its share across all markets served by x86 processors at Intel's expense in the third quarter of 2025, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.mercuryresearch.com/" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.mercuryresearch.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link">Mercury Research</a>. Intel is holding strong, and as its latest offerings for client and server systems got significantly more competitive than they were several quarters ago, the pace of AMD's gains has slowed down considerably. However, during the quarter, AMD achieved two important milestones: it now commands shipments of over 25% of all x86 CPUs, and it now ships over 33% (one-third) of desktop x86 CPUs.</p><h2 id="abnormal-market-performance-shipments-of-x86-cpus-flat-quarter-over-quarter-3">Abnormal market performance: Shipments of x86 CPUs flat quarter-over-quarter</h2><p id="812aa114-6fad-46f2-b319-8dc06ce20264">Normally, we start our coverage of the x86 market based on data from Mercury Research with client CPUs, but the third quarter was very unusual as unit shipments of x86 CPUs were flat quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), which significantly contradicts the normal seasonal bump when PC makers start to prep for the back-to-school (BTS) season in June – July as well as Christmas season in September.</p><p id="812aa114-6fad-46f2-b319-8dc06ce20264-1">Indeed, PC and server makers increased their CPU procurements in Q3, but the weakness came almost entirely from Intel, which saw sharp drops in IoT/SoC and entry-level mobile processors as it shifted manufacturing capacity toward server processors, and strong shipments of such parts in Q2. By contrast, AMD's unit shipments were flat to slightly up, so the company gained share sequentially and year-over-year (YoY), hitting two psychologically important milestones.</p><p>For the first time in years, AMD's unit share of all x86 client and server CPUs shipped exceeded 25% and now stands at 25.6%, up from 24.2% in the prior quarter and up from 24% in the same quarter a year ago. Intel still commands 74.4%, but it lost some share in certain segments, allowing AMD to hit an important milestone amid a market shrink.</p><p>If we add embedded, IoT, and game consoles SoCs to the equation, then AMD's share looks even more impressive: a 30.9% share of all x86-based chips, up from 25% in the third quarter of 2024. While Intel maintains its dominant position with 69.1%, its 5.9% YoY share loss does not look very good. Yet, it should be noted that AMD shipped significantly more game console SoCs in the third quarter this year compared to the third quarter of 2024, which inflated its results a bit.</p><p id="afae9d47-3d08-47f8-9016-c3c7ddf03fb0">Strong desktop and mobile CPU lineups as well as Intel struggles with supply of small-core mobile CPUs and prior-generation desktop offerings allowed AMD to slightly outgrow Intel in the third quarter both sequentially and year-over-year, according to data from Mercury Research.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="8d129087-6efe-4aae-8f17-d928cb02454a"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

If we compare AMD's current share to its share in the second quarter of 2024, the gain would be a whopping 10.6%</p><p>Intel still held the majority of desktop shipments, but its share fell from 67.8% to 66.4% QoQ, and from 71.7% YoY, reflecting AMD’s continued gains in both the mainstream and high-end segments and shortages of Intel's 13th and 14th Core 'Raptor Lake' processors that are still popular three years after their original release in 2022.</p><p>On the revenue front, AMD reached another record quarter for desktop CPU revenue, driven by higher shipments and a strong mix of premium SKUs, as the company noted in its conference call a week ago. Intel's revenue position weakened as its unit share declined and AMD absorbed more of the market's high-margin demand. Mercury Research notes that AMD's revenue growth in desktops significantly outpaced its unit growth, which confirms that the red company continued to strengthen its position in the most profitable parts of the desktop market.</p><p id="d336c17d-753e-47ea-ba4e-1de0853c505c">AMD lost market share to Intel in the mobile CPU space in Q1 and Q2 2025, but the company outperformed Intel in Q3 2025 on a sequential basis, gaining unit share as Intel struggled with reduced shipments of its entry-level small-core processors.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="2cd72f79-802d-48f8-81ac-0ffdcb13ada8"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

Intel did manage to grow shipments slightly, but well below normal seasonal levels, allowing AMD to capture market share during the quarter, according to Mercury Research. Nonetheless, AMD lost 0.4% market share year-over-year, whereas Intel gained 0.4%.</p><p>On the revenue side, the mix probably favored both companies but helped AMD more. Intel's shortage of low-end CPUs pushed its average selling prices upward, while AMD — which does not have direct rivals for Intel Atom-like SoCs — benefited from increased shipments of mid-range and premium Ryzen mobile processors as Intel faced some shortages on this side of the spectrum as well.</p><h2 id="server-cpus-amd-stagnates-amid-product-mix-improvement-3">Server CPUs: AMD stagnates amid product mix improvement</h2><p id="16fce7f8-dc67-4f5d-ab59-c690b4847e3b">In the server CPU market, Q3 2025 saw relatively flat unit shipments overall, but while AMD managed to edge out another small gain, its gains have been negligible this year. Then again, although the sequential movement was modest, it continued the longer-term trend of AMD steadily expanding its presence in x86 servers.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="37106da3-bf60-444e-8eb5-feb4f68d24c7"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

Both companies saw YoY shipment growth, but AMD's increase was stronger, helping it push unit share higher compared to the same quarter a year earlier, so overall things look good for AMD.</p><p>Most of the real action in Q3 came from product mix rather than volume, according to Mercury. AMD's EPYC 'Turin' ramp accelerated, driving stronger demand for high-core-count EPYC processors, while Intel saw increasing adoption of Xeon 6 'Granite Rapids,' which helped lift its average selling prices despite slightly lower unit volumes.</p><p>On the revenue side, AMD hit another all-time high, as the mix shifted heavily toward its latest and more expensive EPYC 9005-series platform. The combination of flat unit shipments and rising prices meant that AMD's server revenue continues to grow significantly faster than its unit share, while Intel's revenue gains were more limited due to modest declines in its overall shipment mix.</p><h2 id="summary-3">Summary</h2><p id="61822df5-6cbc-4098-a9a6-7dd35b4db4b0">In terms of unit share, AMD continued to gain ground in Q3 2025 across nearly all major x86 segments, helped by strong desktop growth driven by the halo effect of range-topping Ryzen 9000-series CPUs and Intel's struggles to ship enough previous-generation desktop CPUs, as well as the relatively low popularity of its latest offerings for desktops. As a result, AMD expanded its presence in client CPUs, reached a new high in desktops, and inched upward in servers, while Intel's share declined modestly as supply constraints and product transitions limited its ability to address all orders. Although Intel still led the market in total shipments, the balance continued shifting gradually toward AMD.</p><p>In terms of revenue, AMD delivered even stronger results, setting new highs in both desktop and server segments thanks to rising sales of premium processors and the ramp of its newest platforms. Intel's revenue performance was more mixed: constrained low-end supply pushed its average prices higher, but it ceded more of the high-margin market to AMD, especially in desktops and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/enterprise" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/enterprise">enterprise</a> servers.
