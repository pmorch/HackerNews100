Full C ABI Compatibility
</h3> <p>
C3 fits right into your C/C++ application with full C ABI
            compatibility out of the box: no need for special "C compatible"
            types or functions, no limitations on what C3 features you can use
            from C.
</p> </div> <div> <h3>
Module System
</h3> <p>
A simple and straightforward module system that doesn't get in the
            way, with defaults that makes sense.
</p> </div> <div> <h3>
Operator Overloading
</h3> <p>
C3 empowers you with precise, purpose-built operator overloading — no C++ baggage, just clean, expressive code.
            Ideal for vectors, matrices, and fixed-point math that reads exactly how it should.
</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2>
C3 is an evolution, not a revolution:
<span>the C-like for programmers who like C.</span> </h2> <div><p>
C3 is a programming language that builds on the syntax and semantics of
        the C language, with the goal of evolving it while still retaining
        familiarity for C programmers.</p><p>
Thanks to full ABI compatibility with C, it's possible to mix C and C3 in
        the same project with no effort. As a demonstration, vkQuake was compiled
        with a small portion of the code converted to C3 and compiled with the c3c
        compiler.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/2025-hn-top-5/">https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/2025-hn-top-5/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46478377">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><header></header><p>With 2025 wrapped up, I can finally answer a question I’m curious about every year: who were <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2025-01-01&amp;end=2025-12-31">the most popular bloggers of Hacker News</a>?</p><div><p><strong>Who counts as a blogger?</strong></p><p>I explain more in <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/methodology/">my methodology page</a>, but it’s basically anyone who blogs as an individual rather than as part of a company or a team. As an example, <a href="https://jgc.org/">John Graham-Cumming</a> is the CTO of Cloudflare, so I count his <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=jgc.org">personal blog</a> but not his posts to the Cloudflare company blog.</p></div><h2 id="1-simon-willison">#1 <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=simonwillison.net&amp;start=2025-01-01&amp;end=2025-12-26">Simon Willison</a><a href="#1-simon-willison">🔗</a></h2><p>For the third straight year, Simon Willison was the most popular blogger on Hacker News.</p><p>At first, Simon’s position at #1 feels obvious: he wrote about AI in a year when everyone’s obsessed with AI. But there are tons of AI bloggers, and Simon is the only one who’s popular on HN, so what sets Simon apart?</p><p>First, Simon isn’t selling you anything. Simon writes about LLMs as a power user not as a sales pitch from some startup’s VP of product. He tries every AI tool he can get his hands on with no allegiance to any particular vendor. That allows him to write about how new AI tools fit into the ecosystem at large. It’s like getting restaurant recommendations from someone who eats out 20 times a week as opposed to someone who owns 20 restaurant chains.</p><p>Simon is also one of the most prolific bloggers on Hacker News. In 2025 alone, he wrote over 1,000 blog posts, though only 118 were full-length articles (“only”).</p><p>Simon often finds ideas within walled-garden platforms (e.g., TikTok, Twitter) and simply brings them to the open web, where it’s easier for HN to discuss. Some of his most popular posts were just short quotes or links with a bit of commentary. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45820872">“I’m worried that they put co-pilot in Excel”</a> is just a quote from a video he watched on TikTok. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42923870">“A computer can never be held accountable”</a> is Simon summarizing a few tweets.</p><p>Simon has said these types of posts are easy to write yet high in value.</p><blockquote><p>Sharing interesting links with commentary is a low effort, high value way to contribute to internet life at large.</p><p>—Simon Willison, “<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/">My approach to running a link blog</a>”</p></blockquote><h2 id="2-jeff-geerling">#2 <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=jeffgeerling.com&amp;start=2025-01-01&amp;end=2025-12-26">Jeff Geerling</a><a href="#2-jeff-geerling">🔗</a></h2><p>This is Jeff’s most successful year on Hacker News, beating his <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/?start=2023-01-01&amp;end=2023-12-31&amp;domain=jeffgeerling.com">#5 finish in 2023</a>.</p><p>The #2 spot was an extremely tight race this year. Jeff’s posts totaled 10,813 upvotes, edging out the #3 blogger by just 9 points (a 0.08% difference). The #4 finisher was just 100 points behind that. Past stories can still accrue upvotes, so this could still flip, but these were the rankings as of midnight on Dec. 31st.</p><p>Jeff is a popular YouTube creator with over 1M subscribers. He covers some of HN’s favorite topics, like Raspberry Pi computers, self-hosted software, and computer hardware. YouTube videos rarely succeed on Hacker News, so when Jeff publishes a new video, he often publishes an accompanying blog post. Jeff isn’t the only YouTuber who does this, but he’s one of the few who does it <em>well</em>.</p><p>I’ve seen other YouTube creators try to repurpose their videos by auto-generating a transcript and calling that a blog post. Jeff approaches his blog more thoughtfully.</p><p>Jeff started out as a blogger, and he still treats his blog readers as first-class citizens. He structures his articles to fit the text medium rather than just lazily scraping dialog from his videos. You can read his post about <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/upgrading-m4-pro-mac-minis-storage-half-price">upgrading storage on his Mac mini</a> and not even realize it’s adapted from a video.</p><h2 id="3-sean-goedecke">#3 <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=seangoedecke.com&amp;start=2025-01-01&amp;end=2025-12-26">Sean Goedecke</a><a href="#3-sean-goedecke">🔗</a></h2><p>Sean came out of nowhere as a blogging powerhouse this year. He’d been blogging sporadically since 2020, but he hit a turning point at the end of 2024 with <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-ship/">“How I ship projects at big tech companies.”</a> It was one of HN’s top 100 posts of the year and remains <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42111031">Sean’s most popular post on HN</a>.</p><p>After his first success on HN, Sean went from publishing every few months to multiple times per week, becoming a regular fixture on the front page.</p><p>Sean is a Staff Software Engineer at GitHub and previously worked at Zendesk. Like Simon, Sean is extremely prolific. He wrote 140 posts this year. Of those, 47 reached the front page. I’ve had a few years where a lot of my posts reached the front page, but for me that was <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=mtlynch.io&amp;start=2020-01-01&amp;end=2020-12-31">about 10 articles</a>. I can’t imagine what it’s like to have a new article on HN almost every week.</p><p>Sean explains his strategy in <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/on-writing/">“Writing a tech blog people want to read”</a>:</p><blockquote><p>the recipe for a popular post is to have a clear opinion about working in tech that many people disagree with.</p></blockquote><p>I think Sean’s insight is true, but he’s selling his own writing a bit short. To me, Sean’s greatest strength is his ability to explain big tech organizational politics to engineers.</p><p>Most junior to mid-level developers don’t care about company politics. They think of office politics as something that strong technical thinkers shouldn’t have to waste brain cells on. As a result, they can’t understand why <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/staff-engineer-promotions/">they can’t get promoted</a> or how <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/bad-code-at-big-companies/">their company’s codebase got so bad</a>. Sean’s posts explain these phenomena in a way that’s clear and intelligible to engineers.</p><p>Sean’s posts are also a good example of how much luck comes into play on Hacker News, especially for less established authors. Sean’s top three posts of the year all flopped on their first submission and didn’t succeed until their second or third try, sometimes months later. Even then, only a third of his posts reached the front page at all.</p><h2 id="4-brian-krebs">#4 <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=krebsonsecurity.com&amp;start=2025-01-01&amp;end=2025-12-26">Brian Krebs</a><a href="#4-brian-krebs">🔗</a></h2><p>Brian Krebs is an independent investigative journalist who covers cybercrime. He’s one of HN’s <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/">most popular bloggers of all time</a>, second only to <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>, the creator of HN. For 11 of the last 12 years, Brian has been one of HN’s top 10 bloggers.</p><p>In 2025, Brian mostly stuck to his usual beat of deeply investigated cybersecurity stories, but his <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43529707">second most popular story</a> of the year was a sobering post about the Trump administration’s steps to undermine free speech in the US. It immediately shot to the #1 slot and stayed there for several hours. Unfortunately, too many users flagged the post, and it was moderated off the front page, which is often the fate of political stories on HN.</p><h2 id="5-neal-agarwal">#5 <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=neal.fun&amp;start=2025-01-01&amp;end=2025-12-26">Neal Agarwal</a><a href="#5-neal-agarwal">🔗</a></h2><p>Neal’s work isn’t what you might think of as blog posts; they’re more like interactive art. Some of his posts are games that parody the web, while others are straight-faced visual essays about topics he finds interesting.</p><p>This was Neal’s most successful year on HN. Everything he published reached the front page, with about half hitting #1, and the rest peaking at #2. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42611536">Stimulation Clicker</a> was the 4th most popular post of the entire year.</p><h2 id="other-notes">Other notes<a href="#other-notes">🔗</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d=daringfireball.net&amp;start=2025-01-01&amp;end=2025-12-31">John Gruber</a> finished the year in #6 despite wondering aloud back in March <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43489058">whether Hacker News</a> had shadowbanned his blog.

            <span>Abstract:</span>We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Venezuela’s authoritarian government has accused the US of launching a series of attacks against civilian and military targets in the South American country, after explosions rocked its capital, Caracas, before dawn on Saturday.</p><p>In a statement, Venezuela’s government urged citizens to rise up against the assault and said Washington risked plunging Latin America into chaos with “an extremely serious” act of “military aggression”.</p><p>“The entire country must mobilise to defeat this imperialist aggression,” it added.</p><p>US media reported that Donald Trump had ordered the strikes against the South American country.</p><p>Explosions and low-flying aircraft were heard in Caracas in the early hours of Saturday. In its statement, Venezuela’s government confirmed that the city had come under attack, as well as three other states: Miranda, La Guaira and Aragua.</p><p>“The only objective of this attack is to seize control of Venezuela’s strategic resources, in particular its oil and minerals,” it said, calling on the international community to denounce what it called a flagrant violation of international law that put millions of lives at risk.</p><p>The president of neighbouring Colombia, Gustavo Petro, claimed on social media that Venezuela was coming under attack. “Right now they are bombing Caracas … bombing it with missiles,” Petro wrote on X, calling for an immediate emergency session of the UN security council.</p><p>Soon after CBS News reported that Trump had had ordered the attacks – including on military facilities. The White House and Pentagon did not respond to request for comment.</p><p>At least seven explosions were heard about 2am local time and people in various neighbourhoods rushed to the street, the Associated Press reported. “The whole ground shook. This is horrible. We heard explosions and planes in the distance,” said Carmen Hidalgo, a 21-year-old office worker.</p><p>Eyewitnesses reported seeing smoke pouring from two key military installations in Caracas: the La Carlota military airfield at the heart of the city and the Fuerte Tiuna military base where Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, has long been thought to live. Another important airport to the east of Caracas, Higuerote, also appeared to come under attack.</p><p>The explosions come after a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/trump-venezuela-war" data-link-name="in body link">five-month US pressure campaign against Maduro</a>, which many analysts believe is designed to topple the Venezuelan leader. Since August, Donald Trump has ordered a massive military buildup off Venezuela’s northern coast and conducted a series of deadly airstrikes on supposed “narco boats”.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly promised land operations in Venezuela, amid efforts to pressure Maduro to leave office, including expanded sanctions, a ramped-up US military presence in the region and more than two dozen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/us-venezuela-alleged-drug-boats-strikes-pacific-death-toll-increases" data-link-name="in body link">strikes on vessels allegedly involved in trafficking drugs</a> in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.</p><p>The US has also seized sanctioned oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela, and Trump ordered a blockade of others in a move that seemed designed to put a tighter chokehold on the South American country’s economy.</p><p><em>This is a developing story …</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p>TL;DR: 2026 is going to be The Year of The Linux Desktop for me. I haven't booted into Windows in over 3 months on my tower and I'm starting to realize that it's not worth wasting the space for. I plan to unify my three SSDs and turn them all into btrfs drives on Fedora.</p>
<p>I've been merely tolerating Windows 11 for a while but recently it's gotten to the point where it's just absolutely intolerable. Somehow Linux on the desktop has gotten so much better by not even doing anything differently. Microsoft has managed to actively sabotage the desktop experience through years of active disregard and spite against their users. They've managed to take some of their most revolutionary technological innovations (the NT kernel's hybrid design allowing it to restart drivers, NTFS, ReFS, WSL, Hyper-V, etc.) then just shat all over them with start menus made with React Native, control-alt-delete menus that are actually just webviews, and forcing Copilot down everyone's throats to the point that I've accidentally gotten stuck in Copilot in a handheld gaming PC and had to hard reboot the device to get out of it. It's as if the internal teams at Microsoft have had decades of lead time in shooting each other in the head with predictable results.</p>
<p>To be honest, I've had enough. I'm going to go with Fedora on my tower and <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite</a> (or SteamOS) on my handhelds.</p>
<p>I think that Linux on the desktop is ready for the masses now, not because it's advanced in a huge leap/bound. It's ready for the masses to use because Windows has gotten so much actively worse that continuing to use it is an active detriment to user experience and stability. Not to mention with the price of ram lately, you need every gigabyte you can get and desktop Linux lets you waste less of it on superfluous bullshit that very few people actually want.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p></div>
<p>At the very least, when something goes wrong on Linux you have log messages that can let you know what went wrong so you can search for it.</p>
