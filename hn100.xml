<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Justice Department has ordered the Drug Enforcement Administration to suspend its longstanding practice of searching passengers at airports — and seizing their cash — after the department’s internal watchdog raised concerns&nbsp;that it was fueling&nbsp;widespread civil rights violations and potential racial profiling.</p><p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://oig.justice.gov/news/doj-oig-releases-management-alert-identifying-concerns-deas-transportation-interdiction" target="_blank">management directive</a>&nbsp;issued&nbsp;on&nbsp;Thursday, the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General said it had been hearing complaints about the searches for years — and had recently learned new information that suggested there were significant problems&nbsp;with them, including potential constitutional violations.</p><p>The IG&nbsp;found&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;program “creates substantial risks that DEA Special Agents and Task Force Officers will conduct these activities improperly; impose unwarranted burdens on, and violate the legal rights of, innocent travelers.” It&nbsp;also found that the searches “waste law enforcement resources on ineffective interdiction actions.”</p><p>In response, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco ordered that the searches be suspended&nbsp;pending an internal&nbsp;evaluation.</p><p>The DEA concurred with most of the report’s recommendations but declined to comment.</p><p>The inspector general found that DEA agents and their local police partners have been stopping passengers at airports solely because they bought a last-minute ticket — and demanding, without a warrant, to search their bags.&nbsp;</p><p>The searches are supposed to be voluntary, but the report&nbsp;found that the timing of the operations&nbsp;created a&nbsp;de facto&nbsp;threat in that refusing&nbsp;to agree to a search&nbsp;could cause passengers to miss their flights. If the agents found cash, they&nbsp;seized it through civil forfeiture — a legal process that places&nbsp;the onus on the passenger to prove it was not connected to drugs in order to get it back.</p><p>The IG said investigators could not come to any conclusions about whether the searches involved racial profiling because the DEA&nbsp;does not collect&nbsp;data on all the people it stops — only on the cases in which money is seized.</p><p>“The Department has long been concerned — and long received complaints — about potential racial profiling in connection with cold consent encounters in transportation setting,” the report said, adding that the DEA between 2000 and 2003 “collected consensual encounter data on every encounter in certain mass transportation facilities as part of a Department pilot project to examine the use of race in law enforcement operations.”</p><p>But neither the DEA nor the Justice Department “drew any conclusions from the data collected about whether the consensual encounters were being conducted in an unbiased manner, and in 2003 the DEA terminated its data collection efforts,” the report said, and “its consensual encounter activities continued.”&nbsp;</p><h2>A search in Cincinnati</h2><p>The IG report highlighted an incident documented in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XBzV0bDZdQ" target="_blank">video</a>&nbsp;released four months ago by the Institute for Justice,&nbsp;a nonprofit civil liberties law firm&nbsp;which is pursuing a class action lawsuit against the DEA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The passenger,&nbsp;who was in&nbsp;the Cincinnati airport&nbsp;and flying&nbsp;to New York, recorded&nbsp;himself telling a DEA agent that he&nbsp;did&nbsp;not consent to a search of his bags.&nbsp;The&nbsp;agent&nbsp;replied&nbsp;that his consent&nbsp;wasn’t required&nbsp;and used&nbsp;what the institute called “illegal bullying tactics.” The video has been viewed more than 2.6 million times.</p><p>“You don’t have to consent,” the agent&nbsp;was recorded saying. “When you buy a last-minute ticket, we get alerts. … We have a lot of money and drugs going out of every airport to New York.”</p><p>The passenger ultimately agreed to the search after missing his flight.&nbsp;Nothing&nbsp;illegal was found.</p><p>The IG found that the search was based on a tip by an airline employee who passed on the names of passengers who had purchased flights 48 hours before departure.&nbsp;</p><p>That employee was being paid by the DEA a percentage of the cash seized, the IG found, and had received tens of thousands of dollars over several years.&nbsp;That arrangement is problematic, investigators concluded.</p><h2><strong>Lawsuit alleges rights violations</strong></h2><p>In January 2020,&nbsp;the Institute for Justice filed a class action suit against the DEA and the Transportation Security Administration, alleging that the agencies routinely violate airport travelers’ constitutional rights by confiscating their money without probable cause.</p><p>In some cases, the DEA has seized money only to have judges order the government to return it.&nbsp;In 2021, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/new-orleans-shoeshine-man-wins-legal-battle-over-30-000-n1282629" target="_blank">NBC News reported</a> that the DEA seized $30,000 in cash that an unemployed shoeshiner from New Orleans was carrying through the Columbus, Ohio, airport because his purchase of a truck had fallen through.&nbsp;Prosecutors later agreed to return the money after the Institute for Justice got involved.</p><p>In 2020, NBC Los Angeles&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/like-i-was-mugged-woman-says-agents-took-82k-from-her-at-airport/2293622/?fbclid=IwY2xjawGrH3BleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHQrWe7NLmZ1ZW5SzYTWO8ULicsfRePMX0X6ErCAVPyWO2wBZ1I_TSY3sAQ_aem_BjsZRwZS2mcNBR04r_WByg" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;$82,000&nbsp;was&nbsp;seized&nbsp;by the DEA&nbsp;from an elderly man and his daughter in Pittsburgh.</p><p>“The government took my dad’s life savings,” the daughter said. “It’s like I was mugged on the street.”&nbsp;</p><p>USA Today <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/08/10/dea-travel-record-airport-seizures/88474282/"

    <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN! I'm Dex, building HumanLayer (<a href="https://humanlayer.dev/">https://humanlayer.dev</a>), an API that lets AI agents contact humans for feedback, input, and approvals. We enable safe deployment of autonomous/headless AI systems in production. You can try it with our Python or TypeScript SDKs and start using it immediately with a free trial. We have a free tier and transparent usage-based pricing. Here’s a demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/5sbN8rh_S5Q?t=51" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/5sbN8rh_S5Q?t=51</a></p><p>What's really exciting is that we're enabling teams to deploy AI systems that would otherwise be too risky. We let you focus on building powerful agents while knowing that critical steps will <i>always</i> get a human-in-the-loop. It's been dope seeing people start to think bigger when they consider dynamic human oversight as a key ingredient in production AI systems.</p><p>This started when we were building AI agents for data teams. We wanted to automate tedious tasks like dropping unused tables, but customers were (rightfully!) opposed to giving AI agents direct access to production systems.</p><p>Getting AI to "production grade" reliability is a function of "how risky is this task the AI is performing". We didn't have the 3+ months it would have taken to sink into evals, fine tuning, and prompt engineering to get to a point where the agent had 99.9+% reliability—and even then, getting decision makers comfortable with flipping the switch on was a challenge. So instead we built some basic approval flows, like "ask in Slack before dropping tables".</p><p>But this communication itself needed guardrails—what if the agent contacted the wrong person? How would the head of data look if a tool he bought sent a nagging Slack message to the CEO? Our buyers wanted the agent to ask stakeholders for approval, but first <i>they</i> wanted to approve the "ask for approval" action itself. And then I started thinking about it... as a product builder + owner, <i>I</i> wanted to approve the "ask for approval to ask for approval" action!</p><p>I hacked together a human-AI interaction that would handle each of these cases across both my and my customers' Slack instances. By this time, I was convinced that any team building AI agents would need this kind of infrastructure and decided to build it as a standalone product. I presented the MVP at an AI meetup in SF and had a ton of incredible conversations, and went all in on building HumanLayer.</p><p>When you integrate the HumanLayer SDK, your AI agent can request human approval at any point in its execution. We handle all the complexity of routing these requests to the right people through their preferred channels (Slack or email, SMS and Teams coming soon), managing state while waiting for responses, and providing a complete audit trail. In addition to "ask for approval", we also support a more generic "human as tool" function that can be exposed to an LLM or agent framework, and will handle collecting a human response to a generic question like "I'm stuck on $PROBLEM, I've tried $THINGS, please advise" (I get messages like this sometimes from in-house agents we rolled out for back-office automations).</p><p>Because it's at the tool-calling layer, HumanLayer's SDK works with any AI framework like CrewAI, LangChain, etc, and any language model that supports tool calling. If you're rolling your own agentic/tools loop, you can use lower level SDK primitives to manage approvals however you want. We're even exploring use cases where HumanLayer is used for human-to-human approval, not just AI-to-human.</p><p>We're already seeing HumanLayer used in some cool ways. One customer built an AI SDR that drafts personalized sales emails but asks for human approval in Slack before sending anything to prospects. Another uses it to power an AI newsletter where subscribers can have email conversations with the content. HumanLayer handles receiving inbound emails and routing them to agents that can respond, and giving those agents tools to do so. One team uses HumanLayer to build a customer-facing DevOps agent—their AI agent reviews PRs, plans and executes db migrations, all while getting human sign-off at critical steps and reaching out to the team for steering if it encounters any issues.</p><p>We have a free tier and flexible credits-based pricing. For teams building customer-facing agents, you get whitelabeling and additional features and priority support.</p><p>If you want to integrate HumanLayer into your systems, check out our docs at <a href="https://humanlayer.dev/docs">https://humanlayer.dev/docs</a> or book a demo at <a href="https://humanlayer.dev/">https://humanlayer.dev</a>.</p><p>Thank you for reading! We’re admittedly early and I welcome your ideas and experiences as it relates to agents, reliability, and balancing human+AI workloads.</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td></td></tr>  </tbody></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-11-18/special-education-schools-gifted">https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-11-18/special-education-schools-gifted</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42247334">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-subscriber-content=""> <p>Schools have generally been working hard to meet the special educational needs of an array of students — those with learning disabilities, those learning English, those with behavioral issues and those whose households struggle with poverty. But they have widely neglected one major group of students with special needs: the academically gifted.</p><p>Many school districts around the country have <a href="https://www.teachforamerica.org/stories/gifted-programs-equity" target="_blank">dropped programs</a> for students who catch on quickly. The trend toward eliminating or scaling back such programs started about 15 years ago. But it picked up steam in 2021, when the Black Lives Matter movement made schools reckon with the discomfiting fact that they were far less likely to identify Black and Latino as gifted than they were white and Asian students.</p><p>Part of the problem was that the original purpose of gifted programs had been lost in parental competition for prestige and advantage. Unlike other special-education categories, the gifted label was coveted by parents. Classes and sometimes entire schools for gifted students often had richer curricula and more resources. They became classrooms for high achievers rather than for students properly defined as gifted.</p><p>These programs were originally meant to meet the needs of students with intense, often irregular learning patterns. They used to be seen as not needing special attention because they often excelled. As standardized testing required schools to aim for student proficiency, all the focus went to those who hadn’t met that mark. Those who exceeded it were deemed to be just fine.</p><p>But they’re not just fine. Gifted children, more than others, tend to shine in certain ways and struggle in others, a phenomenon known as <a href="https://www.sengifted.org/post/asynchronous-development" target="_blank">asynchronous development</a>. A third-grader’s reading skills might be at 11th-grade level while her social skills are more like a kindergartner’s. They often find it hard to connect with other children. They also are in danger of being turned off by school because the lessons move slowly.</p><p>I don’t know whether I would have been identified as gifted when I was a kid, but I certainly was bored out of my mind in elementary school. It felt as though everything was repeated to the point that paying attention in class was worthless. I started acting up simply to keep myself occupied. </p><p>My third-grade teacher tried a few strategies, including sending me on errands invented just to get me out of the classroom. Nothing worked. So they sent me on to fourth grade even though school policy prohibited it.</p><p>That was a disaster. I was cut off from my friends and anxious about constant grilling from adults and children asking why I was in the higher grade. It didn’t work academically, either. I enjoyed the challenge of catching up, but once that happened, school was boring again. The problem wasn’t third-grade material; it was the pace of learning.</p><p>When I started covering education in the late 1970s, it was a pleasant surprise to see this need being addressed — though it was a little off-putting to hear a 10-year-old describe herself as a “mentally gifted minor” at a school board meeting. “MGM” was the name given to the programs, later rebranded “GATE,” for Gifted and Talented Education.</p><p>It was never clear exactly what gifted education was, though. In some districts, it amounted to highly sought-after schools devoted to high achievers. Sometimes it was enrichment for certain students. Teachers were supposed to have special training, as any special-ed teacher would, but it seemed hit-or-miss. In the schools my kids attended, the gifted program basically meant extra homework.</p><p>When giftedness became a matter of prestige rather than a particular learning style and need, all bets were off. Maybe the problem was calling it “gifted” instead of “asynchronous development”; no one’s going to fight to get their kid into an asynchronous development program unless they need it.</p><p>There’s little doubt that racism played a role in identifying children as gifted even though the label was based on supposedly objective criteria. But the solution to that problem is to eliminate biases, not the programs themselves. </p><p>To its credit, the Los Angeles Unified School District has retained gifted education, with programs catering to different academic and creative skills. One is for highly gifted students, who may be well into college material in some areas while still high school sophomores. But proportional underenrollment of students of color led the district to relax its requirements for entry before it recently <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-11/admission-changes-lausd-honors-program-sparks-debate-academic-equity">reversed</a> course. The criteria should be fairly simple: whether a student needs to and can advance extremely quickly through academic material.</p><p>California <a href="https://reason.com/2023/10/04/california-state-guidelines-discourage-schools-from-offering-advanced-middle-school-math/" target="_blank">doesn’t require</a> schools to offer gifted programs and stopped funding them in 2013, so schools have little incentive to keep them. The answer certainly isn’t eliminating the programs entirely. It doesn’t seem to have helped to open them to all children either; that led some to slow down the pace, defeating their purpose.</p><p><a href="https://reason.com/2023/10/04/california-state-guidelines-discourage-schools-from-offering-advanced-middle-school-math/" target="_blank">Differentiated instruction</a> — in which a teacher tailors lessons to varying student needs — sounds good but is difficult to carry off in a large class. </p><p>My eldest child had the good fortune to be in a small program within her public school, open to all until the spaces were filled, that solved much of the differentiation problem. It involved few tests and many individual projects. Students chose their own books to read and report on. Their projects could be written reports or, if their talents lay elsewhere, movies, plays, songs or board games — as long as they showed they had learned the lesson at hand. It gave students free rein to work at their own level, avoid boredom and show off their talents.</p><p>But that program was run by two extremely gifted teachers who knew how to bring out the best in each student. It’s much easier to grade a test than to evaluate a project, and I don’t know how widely the program could be replicated. In any case, it no longer exists.</p><div data-list-id="00000192-be42-da32-a3db-ff76fc3b0000" data-module-id="00000192-be42-da32-a3db-ff76fc3b0000" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center="">  <p data-element="element-header" data-click="liZZListTitleCTA">  <h3 data-element="element-header-title" data-counter="3">More to Read </h3>  </p>      </div> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>This work was carried out during an <strong>internship</strong> at Thalium on the subject of deobfuscation of virtualized binaries.</p><h2 id="context">Context</h2><p>Obfuscation is the process of deliberately making code difficult to understand in order to hinder its analysis. It is often used in malware to conceal malicious intent and avoid detection.</p><p>Various binary obfuscation strategies exist today, including:</p><ul><li>Removing comments / symbols</li><li>Adding opaque predicates (branches on a constant condition)</li><li>Control flow flattening</li><li>Virtualization</li></ul><p><strong>Virtualization</strong> is one of the most popular, and potent<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> forms of obfuscation today.</p><p>Various obfuscators including <a href="https://tigress.wtf/">Tigress</a>, <a href="https://www.oreans.com/Themida.php">Themida</a> and <a href="https://vmpsoft.com/">VMProtect</a> offer virtualization. Due to its potency and the high availability of obfuscators, virtualization has unfortunately been used by threat actors and found in numerous malware (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002/">source: MITRE</a>).</p><p>Here is a rough outline of the architecture of a virtualized obfuscated binary:</p><p><a href="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image.png" alt="Virtualized binary schematized architecture"></a></p><p>In a virtualized binary, the original program gets encoded into a sequence of <em>virtual instructions</em>.
The obfuscated program is going to contain these <em>virtual instructions</em> as well as an <em>interpreter</em>.
The <em>interpreter</em> is responsible for executing the virtual instructions. It often contains distinctive components:</p><ul><li>a <em>VM entry</em> responsible for context switching and initializing the virtual CPU;</li><li>a <em>VM exit</em>, also for context switching;</li><li>a <em>dispatcher</em> which retrieves the <em>virtual instruction</em> at the <em>virtual program counter</em> (VPC), then sends the control flow to the appropriate <em>handler</em> for the given <em>virtual instruction</em>;</li><li><em>handlers</em>, which encode the semantics of the different <em>virtual instructions</em>.</li></ul><p>Virtual instructions can be anything ranging from logical operations (AND, XOR), control flow operations (JUMP, BRANCH) to more complex operations (see Schloegel <em>et. al.</em> <strong>Loki: Hardening Code Obfuscation Against Automated Attacks</strong> (<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/schloegel">usenix.org</a>)).</p><h2 id="devirtualization-strategy">Devirtualization strategy</h2><h3 id="manual-analysis">Manual analysis</h3><p>If you have ever been led to manually reverse engineering a VM (a program protected with virtualization), you know that it is often a long and complex task. If you haven’t, you can check out our other post <a href="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/ecw-2023-kaleidoscope-write-up/">kaleidoscope</a> and give it a try yourself!</p><p>The intuitive approach to devirtualization is usually to identify the VM context (e.g. where are located the virtual program counter and other virtual registers), reverse engineer each handler, and then create a custom disassembler for this VM.
We can then disassemble the virtual instructions and reverse engineer the original program.</p><p>This is extremely tedious, mainly because the architecture used in the VM may change in each obfuscated program.
Moreover, virtualized binaries can be further obfuscated, making it hard to identify and reverse engineer the handlers.
For example, a common hardening strategy is to encrypt the virtual instructions.</p><h3 id="automated-analysis">Automated analysis</h3><p>A different approach put forward by Yadegari <em>et al.</em> in their paper <strong>A Generic Approach to Automatic Deobfuscation of Executable Code</strong> (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7163054">ieee.org</a>) consists in using a dynamic taint analysis to reconstruct the original program’s CFG.
Jonathan Salwan <em>et al.</em> expanded this strategy in <strong>Symbolic deobfuscation: from virtualized code back to the original</strong> (<a href="https://shell-storm.org/talks/DIMVA2018-deobfuscation-salwan-bardin-potet.pdf">shell-storm.org</a>) by then leveraging symbolic execution and compiler optimizations to recreate a devirtualized program.</p><p>Our devirtualization approach was heavily inspired by these taint-based methods. Given the limited timeframe of the internship, we slightly simplified this approach. We also wanted to experiment with <strong>removing the symbolic execution component</strong> which is notoriously slow.</p><p>For our devirtualization, we perform a dynamic taint analysis on the obfuscated function, tainting its parameters.
We then split an execution trace of the obfuscated binary each time we encounter a tainted conditional instruction in the CFG (branches, <code>cmove</code>, etc.).
Finally, we combine these blocks to reconstruct a CFG.</p><p>This approach is not the most robust, but worked well for the Tigress obfuscated binaries we tested against (this will be further detailed in the <em>Results</em> section).</p><h3 id="example">Example</h3><p>The best way of explaining our approach is through an example.</p><p>Let’s consider we have a simple program:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="C"><span><span><span>int</span> <span>counter</span>(<span>int</span> input) {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>int</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;
</span></span><span><span>    <span>while</span> (i <span>&lt;</span> input) {
</span></span><span><span>        i <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>;
</span></span><span><span>    }
</span></span><span><span>    <span>return</span> i;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Its CFG would look like this:</p><p><a href="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-7.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-7.png" alt="CFG of the counter function"></a></p><p>A virtualized version of this program could look like this:</p><p><a href="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-8.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-8.png" alt="CFG of the virtualized counter function"></a></p><p>The main elements of a VM are present in the above diagram.
Here, the virtual instructions (“opcodes”) are simply the handlers’ colors.</p><p>Note that the process of obfuscating this program added additional basic blocks (the hatched ones). These include operations that modify the VPC and the dispatcher.</p><h4 id="taint">Taint</h4><p>Performing a taint analysis on the above obfuscated program reveals that the red block (the branching instruction) is the only tainted instruction (it is the only one which interacts with the user input).</p><blockquote><p><em>This is a very simplified view: in a more complex program, the taint would get propagated during the execution.</em></p></blockquote><h4 id="execution-trace">Execution trace</h4><p>We then collect an execution trace of the obfuscated program with a random input (in this example we picked <code>2</code>):</p><p><a href="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-10.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-10.png" alt="Trace of the virtualized counter function"></a></p><p>These instructions are all consecutive, the arrows are simply to make the trace fit on screen.</p><p>Note that the trace depends on the input. Had we picked input <code>-1</code>, the trace would not contain the green block.</p><h4 id="splitting-the-trace">Splitting the trace</h4><p>At this stage, we can split the trace on the tainted CFG instructions (which we determined was the red block).</p><p>After splitting, our blocks look like this:</p><p><a href="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-11.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-11.png" alt="Split trace of the virtualized counter function"></a></p><p>As you can see, the second and the third groups of blocks are identical. We could therefore merge them.
Using various heuristics detailed in the complete report, we are able to merge and split blocks to create this final CFG:</p><p><a href="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-12.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/img/llvm-powered-devirtualization/image-12.png" alt="Reconstructed CFG of the counter function"></a></p><h3 id="simplifying-the-cfg">Simplifying the CFG</h3><p>At this point, the CFG is still quite complex with many useless instructions. The next step in the deobfuscation process consists in simplifying the code using compiler optimizations.</p><h2 id="using-llvm">Using LLVM</h2><p>As we just saw, taint-based devirtualization relies on compiler optimizations to simplify the recreated CFG and deobfuscate the program.
We decided to use LLVM’s state-of-the-art optimizations.</p><p>Instead of simply integrating LLVM at the very end of our deobfuscation pipeline, we decided to perform all our analysis in LLVM IR.
We were inspired by another deobfuscator: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01752"><em>Saturn</em></a>, which uses LLVM IR as an intermediate representation to deobfuscate opaque predicates.</p><p>First and foremost, this allows us to perform optimizations at the very beginning of our deobfuscation pipeline.
This initial round of optimizations allows us to remove simple obfuscation passes allowing further analysis to run faster.</p><p>Another important consideration, is that using an IR we are able to easily create a multi-architecture tool. As of writing this article, we were able to devirtualize both <code>amd64</code> and <code>aarch64</code> binaries. We are in the process of adding support for their 32-bit counterparts.</p><p>Last but not least, using LLVM’s IR gives us access to a whole suite of tools. LLVM’s ecosystem not only includes LLVM’s analysis and optimization passes, but also third party tools such as the symbolic execution engine <a href="https://klee-se.org/">KLEE</a>.
Notably, this also works the other way around: we will be able to contribute to LLVM’s ecosystem with our analysis modules. For example, during this internship, we were led to create a dynamic taint analysis engine for LLVM IR (version 17).</p><h3 id="lifting">Lifting</h3><p>An important step is <em>lifting</em>: the process of translating machine instructions to another representation (in this case, LLVM IR).</p><p>To do so, we used Trail of Bits’ <a href="https://github.com/lifting-bits/remill"><em>remill</em></a> library.
Using <em>remill</em> proved to be tricky, but we received some helpful advice from the authors of <em>Saturn</em> detailing not only strategies to lift complete CFGs but also custom LLVM passes and tricks to simplify the generated LLVM IR.</p><p>Lifting binaries was a large and complex part of the internship.</p><h2 id="results">Results</h2><p>During this internship, we were able to use our devirtualization tool on binaries (both <code>amd64</code> and <code>aarch64</code>) obfuscated with the Tigress obfuscator.</p><p>Notably, we were able to partially deobfuscate the first <a href="https://tigress.cs.arizona.edu/challenges.html">Tigress challenge</a>, and so very quickly.</p><p>For example, on our machine (OS: Linux - Fedora 40, CPU: 6-core Intel Core i5-8500, Mem: 15.44 GiB), we <strong>partially</strong> deobfuscated <code>challenge0000-binary1</code> in under a second.
For reference, <em>Triton</em> claims to <strong>fully</strong> deobfuscate the same binary in 9.20s.</p><p>Here is the obfuscated <code>amd64</code> <code>challenge0000-binary1</code>:

<p dir="auto">A Jekyll generator plugin to lets you use SQLite database instead of data files as a data source. It lets you easily create APIs and websites from a SQLite database, by linking together a database file, your template, and the relevant queries.</p>
<p dir="auto">It supports site-level queries, per-page queries, and prepared queries that can
use existing data (possibly generated via more queries) as parameters.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Add this line to your site's <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto">And then add this line to your site's <code>_config.yml</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">🏁 A fully-functional demo website that uses this plugin is available at
<a href="https://northwind.captnemo.in/" rel="nofollow">northwind.captnemo.in</a>. The source code for
the demo is available at <a href="https://github.com/captn3m0/northwind">captn3m0/northwind</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Update your <code>_config.yml</code> to define your data sources with your SQLite database.</p>

    <span>file</span>: <span>*db</span>
    <span>query</span>: <span>SELECT * from Customers</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then, you can use the <code>site.data</code> attributes accordingly:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{{ site.data.customers | jsonify }}"><pre>{{ <span>site</span>.<span>data</span>.<span>customers</span> | <span>jsonify</span> }}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prepared Queries</h2><a id="user-content-prepared-queries" aria-label="Permalink: Prepared Queries" href="#prepared-queries"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This plugin supports prepared queries with parameter binding. This lets you
use existing data from a previous query, or some other source (such as
<code>site.data.*</code> or <code>page.*</code>) as a parameter in your query.</p>
<p dir="auto">Say you have a YAML file defining your items (<code>data/books.yaml</code>):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="- id: 31323952-2708-42dc-a995-6006a23cbf00

  <span>name</span>: <span>The Art of Cache Invalidation</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">and the prices for the items in your SQLite database, the following configuration will enrich the <code>items</code> array with the price:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sql:

  <span>query</span>: <span>SELECT price, author FROM pricing WHERE id =:id</span>
  <span>db</span>: <span>books.db</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This would allow the following Liquid loop to be written:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{% for item in site.data.items %}
{{item.meta.price}}, {{item.meta.author}}
{% endfor %}"><pre>{% <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>site</span>.<span>data</span>.<span>items</span> %}

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Per Page Queries</h2><a id="user-content-per-page-queries" aria-label="Permalink: Per Page Queries" href="#per-page-queries"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The exact same syntax can be used on a per-page basis to generate data within
each page. This is helpful for keeping page-specific queries within the page
itself. Here's an example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="---

---
<span>{{page.suppliers|jsonify}}</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will generate a <code>page.suppliers</code> array with all the suppliers, and a <code>page.FeaturedSupplier</code> object with the details of the featured supplier.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each supplier will have a <code>products</code> array with all the products for that supplier.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Generating Pages</h2><a id="user-content-generating-pages" aria-label="Permalink: Generating Pages" href="#generating-pages"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">This will automatically generate a file for each restaurant
restaurants/#{id}.html file with the layout <code>_layouts/restaurant.html</code> and page.id, page.name, page.active set and page.title set to restaurant name</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that the <code>datapage_gen</code> plugin will run <em>after</em> the <code>jekyll-sqlite</code> plugin,
if you generate any pages with per-page queries, these queries will not execute.</p>

To see the solution, jump to the end of the post.</p><p id="b9ba">I first became interested in the the problem of cutting onions in a way to reduce the variance of the volumes of the slices at a gathering with friends. One of my friends and colleagues, Dr. Gabe Feinberg, also a mathematician, pointed me to the Youtube video below.</p><figure><figcaption>The origin of the onion problem.</figcaption></figure><p id="6733">In the video, Chef Kenji López-Alt says he has a friend who is a mathematician, who claims that you should cut radially towards a point 60% of the radius below the center of the onion, and claims that this is related to the reciprocal of golden ratio, 0.61803398875…</p><p id="f146">I was intrigued by this, and even began cutting onions at home with this technique, just because it made me happy.</p><figure><figcaption>A post in the Washington College Mathematics and Computer Science Department Discord where I show the results of cutting onions in this manner.</figcaption></figure><p id="13fa">Each time I cut an onion for dinner, my mind would wander. I would think about why this is true, and what techniques I could use to approach the problem. While this was meditative for me, these musings did not lead anywhere substantial over the span of two months.</p></div><div><p id="000f">Last weekend, my thoughts actually lead me towards a solution. Within two days I had found the “true onion constant”, which, spoiler alert, is not the reciprocal of the golden ratio. The depth to which you have to aim your knife for radial cuts depends on the number of layers. You can see this by thinking of how to cut an onion with one layer versus an onion with ten layers to keep the pieces as similar as possible. For one layer you would aim towards the center of the onion, but for ten layers you would aim somewhere below the center of the onion. To simplify matters, I therefore thought of an onion with infinitely many layers (or, as Gabe called it, “the great onion in the sky,” which I love). These kind of abstractions are common in mathematics, and make problems tractable. Once there are infinitely many layers, it makes sense to think of infinitely many cuts. This moves the problem into the realm of continuous mathematics, where calculus can be used to great effect.</p><figure></figure><figure><figcaption>More discussion from the Departmental Discord about the problem. There is also proof that I’m a millennial with the use of the 😂 emoji.</figcaption></figure></div><div><p id="9219">Here’s the technical part of the post. You probably need to know multivariable calculus to follow from here. I’m going to switch to using “we” instead of “I” to match mathematical writing conventions, and to indicate that we (you, dear reader, and I) are walking down this mathematical path together.</p><p id="7f6d">First, we model the onion as half of a disc of radius one, with its center at the origin and existing entirely in the first two quadrants in a rectangular (Cartesian) coordinate system. This ignores a dimension, and perhaps also some geometry of actual onions (are cross sections actually circles?) but makes the problem tractable and is still a good approximation.</p><p id="e6d8">The insight that leads to a solution comes from the Jacobian. When we change from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates in integration, small rectangular pieces of area <em>dx dy</em> are transformed into small pieces of area <em>r dr dθ</em>, where <em>x = r </em>cos<em>(θ)</em> and<em> y = r </em>sin<em>(θ)</em>. The idea of the Jacobian applies to all changes in coordinate systems. We can calculate the Jacobian as</p><figure></figure><p id="baa6">Below is a diagram showing the change of coordinates and the Jacobian in this setting.</p><figure></figure><p id="3db0">Notice that the coordinate system cuts the onion, much as usual grid lines cut the plane into rectangles in the Cartesian coordinate system. The radial part of the coordinate system cuts the onion radially (which of course nature does by default, but we need to model this mathematically), while the angular part of the coordinate system cuts the onion as our knife would if we were making straight cuts towards the center of the onion. Even though every piece of the onion is infinitely small (there are infinitely many layers, and infinitely many cuts) The Jacobian <em>r dr dθ</em> gives a measure of how big the infinitely small pieces are relative to each other. Pieces near the center of the onion are smaller than pieces near the edge of the onion, as we can see that since <em>r</em> is smaller towards the center of the onion and larger towards the edge of the onion.</p><p id="4c45">We can find the average value of the function <em>f(r,θ) = r</em> over the part of the plane that defines the onion to find the average weight of the infinitesimal area, <em>A</em>.</p><figure></figure><p id="6e8b">Once we have the average, we can find the variance, <em>v</em>, of the weight of the infinitesimal area by calculating</p><figure></figure><p id="b3bb">The variance is a good measure of the uniformity of the pieces. If the variance is large, the pieces are not very uniform, and vice-versa.</p><p id="b5a2">The problem with this analysis, of course, is that we are cutting towards the center of the onion. We want to cut towards a point below the center of the onion. To accomplish this, we need a new coordinate system.</p><p id="21c7">We make a coordinate system for cutting towards a point a distance <em>h&gt;0</em> below the center of the onion. In this coordinate system, we measure the angle theta from the point <em>(0,-h)</em>, while we measure the radius from the origin <em>(0,0)</em> (both points in the rectangular coordinate system). The radial part of the coordinate system cuts the onion radially from the origin as before, while the angular part of the coordinate system cuts the onion as our knife would if we were making straight cuts towards the point <em>(0,-h)</em>, below the onion.</p><figure><figcaption>The new coordinate system also cuts the onion, but in exactly the way we want it to in order to model the cutting of an onion radially towards a point beneath the cutting board.</figcaption></figure><p id="ca8e">This coordinate system only works for the upper half plane, as there are now technically two points in the plane for a given point <em>(r,θ)</em>. Luckily, our onion is entirely in the upper-half plane!</p><p id="0d7b">In this coordinate system, the region of the plane that we model as the onion is defined by <em>-</em>arctan<em>(</em>1<em>/h) ≤ θ ≤ </em>arctan<em>(</em>1<em>/h)</em>, and <em>h |</em>tan<em>(θ)| ≤ r ≤1</em>. We can eliminate the absolute value by using symmetry. Since the left side of the onion is a mirror image of the right side of the onion, and therefore both sides would have the same variance in area, we can perform this analysis just in the first quadrant. So, the region is defined by 0<em>≤θ≤</em>arctan<em>(</em>1<em>/h)</em>, and <em>h </em>tan<em>(θ) ≤r≤</em>1.</p><p id="e86e">The relation between <em>(x,y)</em> and <em>(r,θ)</em> is less clear. Given we know <em>r, h</em>, and <em>θ</em>, we can draw the following triangle, with a new variable c which represents the distance from the point <em>(0,-h)</em> to a given point <em>(x,y)</em> (both in the rectangular coordinate system).</p><figure></figure><p id="77f5">First, using the law of cosines, we can calculate</p><figure></figure><p id="dff5">Using this, we can find the relationship between <em>(x,y)</em> and <em>(r,θ)</em> as</p><figure></figure><p id="012d">From this, for a given depth <em>h</em>, we can calculate the Jacobian as</p><figure></figure><p id="f39c">This is, to put it mildly, complicated. Nevertheless, we have done fairly straightforward calculus computations to get here, which shows the power of making this problem continuous. Mimicking what we did before, given a depth <em>h</em>, we can find the average weight of the infinitesimal area, <em>A(h)</em>, by calculating the integral of the Jacobian over the onion region divided by the integral of 1 over the same region</p><figure></figure><p id="6248">And the variance of the weight of the infinitesimal area, <em>v(h)</em>, is found by calculating the integral of the square of the Jacobian minus <em>A(h) </em>over the onion region divided by the integral of 1 over the same region</p><figure></figure><p id="10e3">Yikes! Integrating this by hand looks really difficult, if not impossible. We should use a computer to help us. Using the power of numerical integration in Mathematica, we can plot the variance versus <em>h</em>, the depth of the point we are cutting towards.</p><figure></figure><p id="901c">We can see the minimum variance is around <em>h</em>=.55. We can use a numerical minimization technique to find the <em>h</em> that minimizes the variance.</p></div><div><p id="4d25">I am only confident of this number to 7 decimal points, but the “true onion constant” for the “onion in the sky” is given by 0.5573066…</p><p id="475f">To get the most even cuts of an onion by making radial cuts, one should aim towards a point 55.73066% the radius of the onion below the center. This is close, but different from, the 61.803% claimed in the Youtube video at the top. Also, this number will be different for onions for finitely many layers (that is to say, all onions). Nevertheless, I find this answer to be beautiful, and I will forever treasure the true onion constant.</p><p id="cd14">I think it would be interesting to consider the effect of the number of layers on this answer. Since with one layer the best strategy is to cut towards the center, I suspect that the best depth <em>h</em> to cut towards increases from zero with one layer, with .5573066… as the upper bound on the depth. So, the best depth for an onion with ten layers would be somewhere between 0 and 0.5573066. I have not investigated this in depth, but this seems like a fun next step.</p><p id="b002">I hope we all now know enough about onions to object.</p><figure><figcaption>Comic from Li Chen <a href="https://www.exocomics.com/685/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.exocomics.com/685/</a></figcaption></figure></div><div><p id="fe67">Update: I actually was able to evaluate <em>v(h) </em>in a closed form. The techniques used to do it are really fun, and I am hoping to write them up for a recreational mathematics journal.</p><p id="f87b">As calculus students know, if you want to minimize a function, you should take the derivative and set it equal to zero. Here, the derivative of <em>v(h) </em>is given by</p><figure></figure><p id="2ac1">The unique root of the above expression in the interval <em>(0,1)</em> is the onion constant, since it is a critical point for the function <em>v(h) </em>and the sign of <em>v’(h)</em> changes from negative to positive at this point, as seen in the graph of <em>v’(h)</em> below.</p><figure><figcaption>The derivative of v with respect to h. Notice that the derivative crosses the horizontal axis around 0.55, which is the onion constant. The sign change from negative to positive means this is a minimum of the v function.</figcaption></figure><p id="367e">With this, I can calculate the onion constant to arbitrary precision. Here it is to 1000 decimal places: 0.5573066929856644788510930591459271808320003020727327593398292131946981351272104586975295563488927792384215157297641443660261449855854165046873271472618959107816152780606384065758548635804885244580180000739444280590673621405484408743288174143897178500658897679049099235460450539966379793582365697832234771908624791276216076862484729083731336235000704236891376747519710815301807822317779086701048122723023915093054323298702150340065450327186756623642052156098646912508581593702205375240220768344875026631985363470644632525528856220691258227307037720900190873707797080215945078389222941122441664099620992665469305266348508835318836823451849946341751553954012216070423374355399193069992187951842347509926071534835419058678494025712006870992663407278202945110198402208378584410140122892631419360798953694134222761038423480438048889054739124583187162972867878589998414926409519790844390232917730134252343064728228633559834886507214553757974736357343027167265972675903577598983959532796594227162648681839040…</p></div><div><p id="1c5f">Such a beautiful mathematical constant deserves a name.

<div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec1" id="sec1"><h2> Introduction</h2>
<p> Space food is an area of intense research effort (Weiss, <a href="#ref145"><span>Reference Weiss</span>1972</a>; Mizuno and Weiss, <a href="#ref87"><span>Reference Mizuno, Weiss and Horton</span>1974</a>; Calvin and Gazenko, <a href="#ref24"><span>Reference Calvin and Gazenko</span>1975</a>; Grover <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref60"><span>Reference Grover, Bhasin, Dhingra, Nandi, Hansda, Sharma, Paul, Idrishi, Tripathi and Agarwal</span>2022</a>; Pandith <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref97"><span>Reference Pandith, Neekhra, Ahmad and Sheikh</span>2022</a>). The ability to create human-edible food in space is a key achievement that can foster economic exploitation of the asteroid belt (Gertsch, <a href="#ref52"><span>Reference Gertsch, McKay, McKay and Duke</span>1992</a>; Sommariva, <a href="#ref128"><span>Reference Sommariva</span>2015</a>; Ehresmann and Herdrich, <a href="#ref43"><span>Reference Ehresmann and Herdrich</span>2017</a>; Calla <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref22"><span>Reference Calla, Fries and Welch</span>2018</a>) as well as being a requirement for long-term human space exploration (Fritsche <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref47"><span>Reference Fritsche, Romeyn and Massa</span>2018</a>; James, <a href="#ref66"><span>Reference James</span>2018</a>). Current technologies that can supply food to space travellers are dependent on consumables from resupply missions from Earth (e.g., dried (Venir <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref136"><span>Reference Venir, Del Torre, Stecchini, Maltini and Di Nardo</span>2007</a>; Park <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref98"><span>Reference Park, Song, Han, Kim, Yoon, Choi, Byun, Sohn and Lee</span>2009</a>), freeze dried (Obrist <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref96"><span>Reference Obrist, Tu, Yao and Velasco</span>2019</a>), irradiated food (Pometto and Bourland, <a href="#ref108"><span>Reference Pometto and Bourland</span>2003</a>) or frozen food (Geiges, <a href="#ref51"><span>Reference Geiges</span>1996</a>)). These systems are completely dependent on Earth resupply and thus far from optimized for energy or economics. For example, food demands for a Mars mission for six astronauts will weigh around 12 tons without packaging (Park <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref99"><span>Reference Park, Song, Kim, Choi, Sung, Han and Lee</span>2012</a>). To explore further than Mars would entail massive quantities and masses of food. Even with SpaceX's relatively low cost of $2720 per kilogram to lift into space (Cobb, <a href="#ref25"><span>Reference Cobb</span>2019</a>), a less costly and more sustainable method is preferred. Recycling of air, water and waste will likely also be essential, but such systems are used in the context where waste mitigation includes the jettison or storage of these products, which ultimately leads to the need for resupply missions (Boscheri <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref14"><span>Reference Boscheri, Saverino and Lobascio</span>2021</a>). To deeply explore the solar system, it will be necessary to become less reliant on the resupply tether to Earth (Sercel <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref123"><span>Reference Sercel, Peterson, Britt, Dreyer, Jedicke, Love, Walton and Abreu</span>2018</a>).</p>
<p> Farming in space, on an external base, may be possible but is extremely complex (Monje <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref88"><span>Reference Monje, Stutte, Goins, Porterfield and Bingham</span>2003</a>; Tibbetts, <a href="#ref132"><span>Reference Tibbetts</span>2019</a>; De Pascale <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref37"><span>Reference De Pascale, Arena, Aronne, De Micco, Pannico, Paradiso and Rouphael</span>2021</a>). Bioregenerative life support systems are also a promising approach (Douglas <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref40"><span>Reference Douglas, Wheeler and Fritsche</span>2021</a>). These include methods of food production from almost classical crop cultivation and animal farming (including insects) to innovative microalgae (Yang <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref146"><span>Reference Yang, Li, Liu, Zhong, Ji, Lu, Fan, Li, Leng, Li and Zhou</span>2019</a>), and mushroom cultivation (Manukovsky <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref80"><span>Reference Manukovsky, Kovalev, Rygalov and Zolotukhin</span>1997</a>). There have been significant advances in vegetable production systems in space onboard the International Space Station. For example, the Vegetable Production System (aka Veggie), is a space garden that has grown eight different types of edible leafy greens since 2014 (Massa <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref85"><span>Reference Massa, Dufour, Carver, Hummerick, Wheeler, Morrow and Smith</span>2017</a>). The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) has shown similar success growing plants in a closed and automated system (Monje <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref89"><span>Reference Monje, Richards, Carver and Dimapilis</span>2020</a>). Bioregenerative systems designed to mimic elements of Earth's biological systems (namely microbial ecologies) (Hendrickx <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref63"><span>Reference Hendrickx, De Wever, Hermans, Mastroleo, Morin, Wilmotte, Janssen and Mergeay</span>2006</a>; Fahrion <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref45"><span>Reference Fahrion, Mastroleo, Dussap and Leys</span>2021</a>), however, are far from mature (Kliss <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref72"><span>Reference Kliss, Heyenga, Hoehn and Stodieck</span>2000</a>).</p>
<p> Protein storage is a particular concern since methods to store it can compromise quality (Bychkov <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref20"><span>Reference Bychkov, Reshetnikova, Bychkova, Podgorbunskikh and Koptev</span>2021</a>). All of these approaches, however, require an initially considerable input of resources from Earth and may well require periodic resupply. These virtual tether to Earth strategies are expensive and will become less viable the further humanity moves out into space. What if humanity could acquire the raw materials to make food in space? This article investigates ways to do just that using new techniques developed to recycle plastic waste into food on Earth, and extrapolating these techniques to the theoretical application of converting asteroidal material into food (Petsch <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref102"><span>Reference Petsch, Eglinton and Edwards</span>2001</a>; Byrne <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>; Schaerer <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref117"><span>Reference Schaerer, Wu, Putman, Pearce, Lu, Shonnard, Ong and Techtmann</span>2022</a>; Waajen <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref139"><span>Reference Waajen, Prescott and Cockell</span>2022</a>, <a href="#ref140"><span>Reference Waajen, Lima, Goodacre and Cockell</span>2024</a>).</p>
<p> Recently, Waajen <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref140"><span>Reference Waajen, Lima, Goodacre and Cockell</span>2024</a>) examined this process by growing anaerobic microbial communities on the CM2 carbonaceous chondrite Aguas Zarcas as the sole carbon, energy and nutrient source, successfully demonstrating that microbial communities can metabolically transform carbonaceous asteroidal material as a potential resource. Furthermore, Bryne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) demonstrated that potentially human-edible biomass could be produced from bacterial consortia acting on the pyrolytic breakdown products of high-density polyethylene plastics. Although Byrne's work is focused on the recycling of plastic waste, the idea of leveraging bacterial inocula to produce potentially edible biomass from initially inedible precursors is germane to the need to produce food in space (similar to synthetic biological processes described by Waajen <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref140"><span>Reference Waajen, Lima, Goodacre and Cockell</span>2024</a>). This article will outline an approach to providing human-edible food – and calculate theoretical yields – employing naturally occurring organic compounds commonly found in specific types of meteorites: the carbonaceous chondrites. Carbonaceous chondrite meteorites likely originate from the most abundant class of asteroid in our solar system, the C-class, which tend to be most abundant in the outer main asteroid belt (Vilas and Gaffey, <a href="#ref138"><span>Reference Vilas and Gaffey</span>1989</a>; DeMeo <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref32"><span>Reference DeMeo, Alexander, Walsh, Chapman and Binzel</span>2015</a>). In addition to their relatively high organic chemical content, some carbonaceous chondrites can contain as much as 10.5 wt% water (Rivkin <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref113"><span>Reference Rivkin, Howell, Vilas and Lebofsky</span>2002</a>). Selected asteroids could provide the raw materials – organic compounds and water – that when processed by bacterial consortia in bioreactors, would form the basis of an extra-terrestrial food-supply chain.</p>
<p> The mass of potentially available organic compounds in some C-class asteroids will be calculated to provide 100% of the caloric requirements for a human for one year. Furthermore, calculations will be made to determine how many years a single asteroid could theoretically sustain an astronaut. Based on the current biomass yields from bioreactors on Earth, future work will be provided to enable this path as a sustainable source of food for space travellers.</p>

<div data-magellan-destination="sec2" id="sec2"><h2> Background</h2>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec2-1" id="sec2-1"><h3> Meteorites</h3>
<p> The most abundant source of information available regarding asteroid composition is from the analysis of meteorites, which are – for the most part – fragments of asteroids. Meteorites are classified based on their mineralogical and petrological characteristics, as well as their whole-rock chemical and O-isotopic compositions. The main classifications are chondrites, primitive achondrites and achondrites. Within each of these main classifications are multiple sub-classifications. For example, there are currently 15 recognized groups of chondrites: 8 carbonaceous (CI, CM, CO, CV, CK, CR, CH, CB), 3 ordinary (H, L, LL), 2 enstatite (EH, EL) and R and K chondrites (Weisberg <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref144"><span>Reference Weisberg, McCoy and Krot</span>2006</a>). Each sub-group is believed to have sampled a separate parent body or asteroid. There are also individual chondritic meteorites that may share some, but not all, of the characteristics of one of these sub-classifications. These may remain as ungrouped or unique or they may be associated with one of the established sub-classifications but identified as outliers by designations such as C-ungrouped (Grady <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref58"><span>Reference Grady, Verchovsky, Franchi, Wright and Pillinger</span>2002</a>; Mittlefehldt, <a href="#ref86"><span>Reference Mittlefehldt</span>2002</a>; Yesiltas <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref147"><span>Reference Yesiltas, Kebukawa, Glotch, Zolensky, Fries, Aysal and Tukel</span>2022</a>).</p>

<p> Grady and Wright (<a href="#ref57"><span>Reference Grady and Wright</span>2003</a>) provide a very useful overview of the major carbon phases seen in meteorite groups. The carbonaceous chondrites, particularly the CI, CM and some related ungrouped C-chondrites contain the highest concentrations of organic compounds, up to&nbsp;~&nbsp;5&nbsp;wt% (Kissin, <a href="#ref71"><span>Reference Kissin</span>2003</a>; Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Cooper and Flynn</span>2006</a>). In ordinary chondrites and the achondrites, carbon is usually seen in inorganic forms, occurring as carbonates or carbides, as well as in elemental form as graphite or, more rarely, diamond. Ordinary chondrites, in general, contain less total organic carbon than carbonaceous chondrites, with values ranging from 0.03 to 0.2&nbsp;wt% (Alexander <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref2"><span>Reference Alexander, Barber and Hutchinson</span>1989</a>; Makjanic <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref79"><span>Reference Makjanic, Vis, Hovenier and Heymann</span>1993</a>). The carbon content of achondrites can range from 0.003 to as much as 7&nbsp;wt% but is also typically in inorganic forms (Alexander <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Alexander, Cody, De Gregorio, Nittler and Stroud</span>2017</a>).</p>
<p> Extensive reviews of the possible origins and modifications of extra-terrestrial organic compounds is given by various authors (e.g., Ehrenfreund and Charnley, <a href="#ref41"><span>Reference Ehrenfreund and Charnley</span>2002</a>; Elsila <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref44"><span>Reference Elsila, Aponte, Blackmond, Burton, Dworkin and Glavin</span>2016</a>; Glavin <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref55"><span>Reference Glavin, Alexander, Aponte, Dworkin, Elsila and Yabuta</span>2018</a>; d'Ischia <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref39"><span>Reference d'Ischia, Manini, Martins, Remusat, Alexander, Puzzarini, Barone and Saladino</span>2021</a>; Alexander, <a href="#ref1"><span>Reference Alexander</span>2022</a>; Furukawa <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref48"><span>Reference Furukawa, Saigusa, Kano, Uruno, Saito, Ito, Matsumoto, Aoki, Yamamoto and Nakamura</span>2023</a>). The variety and isotopic diversity of the organic compounds seen in carbonaceous meteorites indicates an initial interstellar and circumstellar formation with subsequent secondary modification on their parent body in the presence of water (Botta and Bada, <a href="#ref15"><span>Reference Botta and Bada</span>2002</a>; Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Cooper and Flynn</span>2006</a>). Water, in the form of ice, was accreted into primitive asteroidal bodies along with organic compounds and anhydrous minerals such as olivines and pyroxenes (Rubin <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref115"><span>Reference Rubin, Trigo-Rodriguez, Huber and Wasson</span>2007</a>; Le Gillou and Brearly, <a href="#ref76"><span>Reference Le Gillou and Brearly</span>2014</a>). Later heating, caused by the radioactive decay of Al26 and/or energetic impacts with other asteroidal bodies, melted the ice and provided the energy to drive the modification of the organic pre-cursors (Grimm and McSween, <a href="#ref59"><span>Reference Grimm and McSween</span>1989</a>; Nakamura, <a href="#ref91"><span>Reference Nakamura</span>2005</a>; Lee <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref75"><span>Reference Lee, Lindgren, King, Greenwood, Franchi and Sparkes</span>2016</a>). Keil (<a href="#ref70"><span>Reference Keil</span>2000</a>) provides an overview of heating on meteorite parent-bodies. The circulating water also altered the primary anhydrous silicate minerals, yielding a variety of secondary hydrous phyllosilicates (saponites, smectites, serpentines) as well as carbonates, oxides and sulphides. The phyllosilicates form the bulk of the matrix: 84.3% by volume in the Murchison meteorite and 71.2% by volume in Tagish Lake (Bland <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref13"><span>Reference Bland, Cressey and Menzies</span>2004</a>). The CI, CM and C-ungrouped meteorites also commonly contain carbonates (e.g., calcite, dolomite), oxides (e.g., magnetite) and sulphides (e.g., troilite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite) (Bland <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref13"><span>Reference Bland, Cressey and Menzies</span>2004</a>). A historical review of the study of organic compounds in meteorites is provided by Botta and Bada (<a href="#ref15"><span>Reference Botta and Bada</span>2002</a>).</p>
<p> The organic material in meteorites can be divided into two types: solvent-soluble organic material (SOM) and solvent-insoluble organic material (IOM). The SOM is composed of a wide variety of compounds such as ketones, alkanes, carboxylic and amino acids, methane, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Grady and Wright, <a href="#ref57"><span>Reference Grady and Wright</span>2003</a>; Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Cooper and Flynn</span>2006</a>). Solvents often used for the extraction of SOM include water, for the extraction of amino acids, and benzene or benzene/methanol mixtures (Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref104"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Huang, Becker, Poreda, Nieman, Cooper and Williams</span>2001</a>; Sephton, <a href="#ref121"><span>Reference Sephton</span>2002</a>). Sephton and Gilmour (<a href="#ref122"><span>Reference Sephton and Gilmour</span>2000</a>) provide a summary of organic moieties which have been identified in the CM-type meteorite, Murchison. The IOM comprises most of the organic compounds in carbonaceous chondrites; approximately 70% in the Murchison CM-type and as much as 99% in the Tagish Lake C-ungrouped meteorite (Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Cooper and Flynn</span>2006</a>; Alexander <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Alexander, Cody, De Gregorio, Nittler and Stroud</span>2017</a>). Elemental compositions of the IOM in the Murchison and Tagish Lake meteorites are given as C<sub>100</sub>H<sub>70</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>100</sub>H<sub>46</sub>N<sub>10</sub>O<sub>15</sub>S<sub>4.5</sub> respectively (Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Cooper and Flynn</span>2006</a>).</p>
<p> The IOM is typically in the form of complex, cross-linked macromolecules resembling types of terrestrial kerogens (Botta and Bada, <a href="#ref15"><span>Reference Botta and Bada</span>2002</a>; Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Cooper and Flynn</span>2006</a>; Alexander <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Alexander, Cody, De Gregorio, Nittler and Stroud</span>2017</a>). See ‘Kerogens as analogs for IOM’, below, for more discussion of terrestrial kerogens. Sephton and Gilmour (<a href="#ref122"><span>Reference Sephton and Gilmour</span>2000</a>) provide a summary of organic moieties which have been identified in the CM-type meteorite, Murchison, that include aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, carboxylic acids among many others as well as O, S and N bearing moieties. These compounds are bound together into a larger structure by aliphatic linkages. Derenne and Robert (<a href="#ref38"><span>Reference Derenne and Robert</span>2010</a>) proposed a model of the macromolecular structure of IOM in the Murchison CM-type carbonaceous chondrite.</p>
<p> In most studies, the IOM is separated from the mineral matrix of a meteorite by demineralization with acids (HCl, HNO, HF). Cody <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref26"><span>Reference Cody, Alexander and Tera</span>2002</a>) modified the traditional method with the addition of fluorine-salts to overcome issues arising from the use of hydrofluoric acid. Smith and Kaplan, however, noticed that only ~45–80% of the C in bulk carbonaceous chondrites can be accounted for by the reported IOM, SOM, and carbonate abundances, the rest of which is lost during isolation of the IOM (Smith and Kaplan, <a href="#ref127"><span>Reference Smith and Kaplan</span>1970</a>).</p>
<p> Alexander <em>et al</em>., provide a thorough review of studies done in determining the morphologies and distribution of IOM in meteorite matrices and also discuss those studies done <em>in situ</em> (Alexander <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Alexander, Cody, De Gregorio, Nittler and Stroud</span>2017</a>). The IOM occurs, generally, in two forms: as sub-micrometric grains or flakes, often referred to as ‘fluffy’ (Garvie and Buseck, <a href="#ref50"><span>Reference Garvie and Buseck</span>2006</a>), and as solid or hollow spherical, semi-spherical or tubular aggregates often referred to as nanoglobules. Nakamura <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref92"><span>Reference Nakamura, Matsumoto, Amano, Enokido, Zolensky, Mikouchi, Genda, Tanaka, Zolotov, Kurosawa, Wakita, Hyodo, Nagano, Nakashima, Takahashi, Fujioka, Kikuiri, Kagawa, Matsuoka, Brearley, Tsuchiyama, Uesugi, Matsuno, Kimura, Sato, Milliken, Tatsumi, Sugita, Hiroi, Kitazato, Brownlee, Joswiak, Takahashi, Ninomiya, Takahashi, Osawa, Terada, Brenker, Tkalcec, Vincze, Brunetto, Aléon-Toppani, Chan, Roskosz, Viennet, Beck, Alp, Michikami, Nagaashi, Tsuji, Ino, Martinez, Han, Dolocan, Bodnar, Tanaka, Yoshida, Sugiyama, King, Fukushi, Suga, Yamashita, Kawai, Inoue, Nakato, Noguchi, Vilas, Hendrix, Jaramillo-Correa, Domingue, Dominguez, Gainsforth, Engrand, Duprat, Russell, Bonato, Ma, Kawamoto, Wada, Watanabe, Endo, Enju, Riu, Rubino, Tack, Takeshita, Takeichi, Takeuchi, Takigawa, Takir, Tanigaki, Taniguchi, Tsukamoto, Yagi, Yamada, Yamamoto, Yamashita, Yasutake, Uesugi, Umegaki, Chiu, Ishizaki, Okumura, Palomba, Pilorget, Potin, Alasli, Anada, Araki, Sakatani, Schultz, Sekizawa, Sitzman, Sugiura, Sun, Dartois, De Pauw, Dionnet, Djouadi, Falkenberg, Fujita, Fukuma, Gearba, Hagiya, Hu, Kato, Kawamura, Kimura, Kubo, Langenhorst, Lantz, Lavina, Lindner, Zhao, Vekemans, Baklouti, Bazi, Borondics, Nagasawa, Nishiyama, Nitta, Mathurin, Matsumoto, Mitsukawa, Miura, Miyake, Miyake, Yurimoto, Okazaki, Yabuta, Naraoka, Sakamoto, Tachibana, Connolly, Lauretta, Yoshitake, Yoshikawa, Yoshikawa, Yoshihara, Yokota, Yogata, Yano, Yamamoto, Yamamoto, Yamada, Yamada, Yada, Wada, Usui, Tsukizaki, Terui, Takeuchi, Takei, Iwamae, Soejima, Shirai, Shimaki, Senshu, Sawada, Saiki, Ozaki, Ono, Okada, Ogawa, Ogawa, Noguchi, Noda, Nishimura, Namiki, Nakazawa, Morota, Miyazaki, Miura, Mimasu, Matsumoto, Kumagai, Kouyama, Kikuchi, Kawahara, Kameda, Iwata, Ishihara, Ishiguro, Ikeda, Hosoda, Honda, Honda, Hitomi, Hirata, Hirata, Hayashi, Hayakawa, Hatakeda, Furuya, Fukai, Fujii, Cho, Arakawa, Abe, Watanabe and Tsuda</span>2023</a>) reported on the <em>in situ</em> occurrence of nanoglobules in the Tagish Lake meteorite. The fluffy material is typically amorphous and often found intimately associated with the abundant phyllosilicate minerals in the meteorite matrix. Short, vein-like structures have also been reported and may be the result of migration and subsequent modification of the pre-cursor organic material during the secondary, post-accretion phase in the asteroidal parent-body.</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec2-3" id="sec2-3"><h3> Kerogens as analogues for IOM</h3>
<p> The IOM found in carbonaceous meteorites is often broadly compared with some terrestrial kerogens in terms of its insolubility in common solvents, its elemental composition and structure (Alexander <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Alexander, Cody, De Gregorio, Nittler and Stroud</span>2017</a>). Terrestrial kerogens are defined as insoluble organic matter formed from the remains of algae, zoo- and phytoplankton, and/or vascular plants, usually found in sedimentary rocks in petroliferous basins (Curiale, <a href="#ref31"><span>Reference Curiale</span>1986</a>; Vandenbroucke and Largeau, <a href="#ref133"><span>Reference Vandenbroucke and Largeau</span>2007</a>). The organic material in sedimentary rocks undergoes progressive alteration with increasing depth of burial. Initially, bacterial activity and low-temperature chemical reactions occur during diagenesis. Increasing temperature during catagenesis and later metagenesis produces a continuum of thermal maturation (Sanei, <a href="#ref116"><span>Reference Sanei</span>2020</a>). Thermal maturation leads to the production of a variety of substances including coal, bitumens (asphalt), oil and methane. Bitumens have also been proposed as analogues of cometary and asteroidal organic compounds (Moroz <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref90"><span>Reference Moroz, Arnold, Korochantsev and Wäsch</span>1998</a>). In <em>The Origins of Petroleum,</em> Walters (<a href="#ref141"><span>Reference Walters</span>2007</a>) provides a review of the history and classification of kerogens. Tarafdar and Sinha (Tarafdar and Sinh, <a href="#ref130"><span>Reference Tarafdar and Sinh</span>2019</a>) also review the formation of coal as well as hydrocarbons derived from kerogens.</p>
<p> Along the continuum of thermal maturation, characteristic changes occur. Behar and Vandenbroucke (<a href="#ref11"><span>Reference Behar and Vandenbrouke</span>1987</a>) produced structural models showing the progressive alteration of kerogens during their maturation. Kerogens become increasingly aromatic while bitumens become more aliphatic in character (Craddock <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref29"><span>Reference Craddock, van Le Doan, Bake, Polyakov, Charsky and Pomerantz</span>2015</a>). There are also characteristic variations in the ratios of hydrogen to carbon (H/C) and oxygen to carbon (O/C). Van Krevelen (<a href="#ref135"><span>Reference van Krevelen</span>1961</a>) used these elemental ratios to classify coal, but this method is now widely used in classifying kerogens and their products. Such plots are typically referred to as van Krevelen diagrams. Four kerogen types are recognized: Type I, generated from algal and bacterial remains (algal kerogens); Type II, generated from zoo- and phytoplankton (planktonic kerogens); Type III, from vascular plants (humic kerogens) and Type IV (residual kerogens). Types I and II often occur in shales. Type III kerogens commonly occur as varieties of coal which can, on occasion, be interlayered with Type I and II bearing shales. Type 4 kerogens are often found as degraded surface deposits associated with coal (Vandenbrouke, <a href="#ref134"><span>Reference Vandenbrouke</span>2003</a>; Walters, <a href="#ref141"><span>Reference Walters</span>2007</a>; Ławniczak <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref74"><span>Reference Ławniczak, Woźniak-Karczewska, Loibner, Heipieper and Chrzanowski</span>2020</a>) (<a href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>).

<p> The major elements in the composition of both IOM and terrestrial kerogens are C, H, O, N and S. The elemental compositions of the IOM in the Murchison and Tagish Lake meteorites are C<sub>100</sub>H<sub>70</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub>S<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>100</sub>H<sub>46</sub>N<sub>10</sub>O<sub>15</sub>S<sub>4.5</sub>, respectively (Pizzarello <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Pizzarello, Cooper and Flynn</span>2006</a>). From these general formulae the H/C are 0.7 (Murchison) and 0.46 (Tagish Lake). The O/C ratios are 0.12 and 0.15, respectively. Naraoka <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref94"><span>Reference Naraoka, Mita, Komiya, Yoneda, Kojima and Shimoyama</span>2004</a>) report H/C values of IOM extracted from 9 CM-type meteorites ranging from 0.11–0.72 (<a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>). The H/C and O/C of most terrestrial kerogens are notably higher, but some types are similar to those of Murchison and Tagish Lake, falling within the range of type 3 and type 4 kerogens (Behar and Vandenbrouke, <a href="#ref11"><span>Reference Behar and Vandenbrouke</span>1987</a>; Pathak <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref100"><span>Reference Pathak, Kweon, Deo and Huang</span>2017</a>) (<a href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>).

<p> Despite the abundance of C-complex asteroids, carbonaceous meteorites are rather rare in collections on Earth. Of the approximately 27&nbsp;000 known meteorites on Earth, only about 5% are carbonaceous chondrites, or approximately 1350 specimens. Of this number, approximately 733 specimens are of the CI, CM and C-ungrouped types of greatest interest. Of these, 633 are CM-type. Most are significantly under 1&nbsp;km in weight (Simkus <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref125"><span>Reference Simkus, Aponte, Elsila, Parker, Glavin and Dworkin</span>2019</a>). The sample sizes used by Naraoka <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref94"><span>Reference Naraoka, Mita, Komiya, Yoneda, Kojima and Shimoyama</span>2004</a>) ranged from 0.5–1&nbsp;g. Obtaining significant amounts of appropriate meteorite samples is possible but entails considerable cost. Therefore, future studies on the conversion of asteroidal matter into food should initially involve experimentation with selected kerogens instead, which will provide a more cost-effective alternative.</p>
</div>
<div data-magellan-destination="sec2-4" id="sec2-4"><h3> Asteroids containing organic compounds</h3>
<p> Reflectance spectra studies have proposed a strong link between the CI, CM and certain C-ungrouped meteorites and the C-complex of asteroids (Vilas and Gaffey, <a href="#ref138"><span>Reference Vilas and Gaffey</span>1989</a>). Although not distributed uniformly within the asteroid belt, the C-complex asteroids are the most numerous (DeMeo <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref32"><span>Reference DeMeo, Alexander, Walsh, Chapman and Binzel</span>2015</a>). A connection has also been proposed between the Ch-class asteroids – a subset of the C-complex defined by Bus and Binzel (<a href="#ref19"><span>Reference Bus and Binzel</span>2002</a>) – and CM-type (Rivkin <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref114"><span>Reference Rivkin, Thomas, Howell and Emery</span>2015</a>). Estimates of the number of Ch-type asteroids in the population of near-Earth objects (NEOs), with diameters greater than 1-km, are 53&nbsp;±&nbsp;27. If no minimum size constraints are applied, these numbers rise to 700&nbsp;±&nbsp;350 (Rivkin and DeMeo, <a href="#ref112"><span>Reference Rivkin and DeMeo</span>2019</a>). The recent success of two sample return missions – OSIRIS-REx (NASA) and Hyabusa2 (JAXA) – to the NEO asteroids 101955 Bennu and 162173 Ryugu demonstrate that, although technically demanding, it is possible to access such asteroids (Lauretta <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref73"><span>Reference Lauretta, Balram-Knutson, Beshore, Boynton, Drouet d'Aubigny, DellaGiustina, Enos, Golish, Hergenrother, Howell and Bennett</span>2017</a>; Nakamura <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref92"><span>Reference Nakamura, Matsumoto, Amano, Enokido, Zolensky, Mikouchi, Genda, Tanaka, Zolotov, Kurosawa, Wakita, Hyodo, Nagano, Nakashima, Takahashi, Fujioka, Kikuiri, Kagawa, Matsuoka, Brearley, Tsuchiyama, Uesugi, Matsuno, Kimura, Sato, Milliken, Tatsumi, Sugita, Hiroi, Kitazato, Brownlee, Joswiak, Takahashi, Ninomiya, Takahashi, Osawa, Terada, Brenker, Tkalcec, Vincze, Brunetto, Aléon-Toppani, Chan, Roskosz, Viennet, Beck, Alp, Michikami, Nagaashi, Tsuji, Ino, Martinez, Han, Dolocan, Bodnar, Tanaka, Yoshida, Sugiyama, King, Fukushi, Suga, Yamashita, Kawai, Inoue, Nakato, Noguchi, Vilas, Hendrix, Jaramillo-Correa, Domingue, Dominguez, Gainsforth, Engrand, Duprat, Russell, Bonato, Ma, Kawamoto, Wada, Watanabe, Endo, Enju, Riu, Rubino, Tack, Takeshita, Takeichi, Takeuchi, Takigawa, Takir, Tanigaki, Taniguchi, Tsukamoto, Yagi, Yamada, Yamamoto, Yamashita, Yasutake, Uesugi, Umegaki, Chiu, Ishizaki, Okumura, Palomba, Pilorget, Potin, Alasli, Anada, Araki, Sakatani, Schultz, Sekizawa, Sitzman, Sugiura, Sun, Dartois, De Pauw, Dionnet, Djouadi, Falkenberg, Fujita, Fukuma, Gearba, Hagiya, Hu, Kato, Kawamura, Kimura, Kubo, Langenhorst, Lantz, Lavina, Lindner, Zhao, Vekemans, Baklouti, Bazi, Borondics, Nagasawa, Nishiyama, Nitta, Mathurin, Matsumoto, Mitsukawa, Miura, Miyake, Miyake, Yurimoto, Okazaki, Yabuta, Naraoka, Sakamoto, Tachibana, Connolly, Lauretta, Yoshitake, Yoshikawa, Yoshikawa, Yoshihara, Yokota, Yogata, Yano, Yamamoto, Yamamoto, Yamada, Yamada, Yada, Wada, Usui, Tsukizaki, Terui, Takeuchi, Takei, Iwamae, Soejima, Shirai, Shimaki, Senshu, Sawada, Saiki, Ozaki, Ono, Okada, Ogawa, Ogawa, Noguchi, Noda, Nishimura, Namiki, Nakazawa, Morota, Miyazaki, Miura, Mimasu, Matsumoto, Kumagai, Kouyama, Kikuchi, Kawahara, Kameda, Iwata, Ishihara, Ishiguro, Ikeda, Hosoda, Honda, Honda, Hitomi, Hirata, Hirata, Hayashi, Hayakawa, Hatakeda, Furuya, Fukai, Fujii, Cho, Arakawa, Abe, Watanabe and Tsuda</span>2023</a>; Potiszil <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref109"><span>Reference Potiszil, Yamanaka, Sakaguchi, Ota, Kitagawa, Kunihiro, Tanaka, Kobayashi and Nakamura</span>2023</a>).</p>

Asteroid Bennu is about 500&nbsp;m in diameter, which is small for an asteroid (Peña <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref101"><span>Reference Peña, Fuentes, Förster, Martinez-Palomera, Cabrera-Vives, Maureira, Huijse, Estévez, Galbany, González-Gaitán and de Jaeger</span>2020</a>). Bennu is an excellent candidate for comparison for four reasons: (1) it is has spectral features consistent with a carbon-rich (presumably carbonaceous chondrite meteorite-like) composition (Simon <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref126"><span>Reference Simon, Kaplan, Hamilton, Lauretta, Campins, Emery, Barucci, DellaGiustina, Reuter, Sandford and Golish</span>2020</a>; Ferrone <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref46"><span>Reference Ferrone, Clark, Kaplan, Rizos, Zou, Li, Barucci, Simon, Reuter, Hasselmann and Deshapriya</span>2021</a>; Kaplan <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref69"><span>Reference Kaplan, Simon, Hamilton, Thompson, Sandford, Barucci, Cloutis, Brucato, Reuter, Glavin and Clark</span>2021</a>), (2) it is a near-earth asteroid meaning that it is feasible to reach and return from the asteroid (as proven by the OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa2 missions), (3) its mass is very well understood after nearly 2 years of study during the mission (77.6 million metric tons), and (4) studies are underway to determine the asteroid's composition. Thus, the potential of Bennu will be analysed as a human food source. To estimate the amount of usable organic material which may be within asteroid Bennu, values from the extensively studied Murchison CM-type meteorite will be used as a proxy. Dozens of studies have explored the organic compound composition of these samples (Studier <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref129"><span>Reference Studier, Hayatsu and Anders</span>1972</a>; Cronin and Pizzarello, <a href="#ref30"><span>Reference Cronin and Pizzarello</span>1990</a>; Callahan <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref23"><span>Reference Callahan, Smith, Cleaves, Ruzicka, Stern, Glavin, House and Dworkin</span>2011</a>; Botta and Bada, <a href="#ref15"><span>Reference Botta and Bada</span>2002</a>; Oba <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref95"><span>Reference Oba, Takano, Furukawa, Koga, Glavin, Dworkin and Naraoka</span>2022</a>).</p>

<div data-magellan-destination="sec2-5" id="sec2-5"><h3> Microbial assimilation of kerogens and related organic compounds</h3>
<p> Since the majority of organic compounds in carbonaceous meteorites, and presumably their asteroidal parent-bodies, are insoluble, work in the field of microbially mediated coal-bed methane (CBM) production is of particular interest for this proposal. Wang <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref143"><span>Reference Wang, Wang, Cui, Zhang and Yu</span>2019</a>) studied the effects of microbial activity in the generation of CBM from a Chinese coal deposit, showing that significant quantities of biomethane were produced. A detailed study by Vick <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref137"><span>Reference Vick, Gong, Sestak, Vergara, Pinetown, Li, Greenfield, Tetu, Midgley and Paulsen</span>2019</a>) on the microbial assimilation of coal identifies several of the principal phyla involved and also explores the optimization conditions for enhanced production. Reviews of work in the biogeneration of CBM are also provided by Ritter <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref111"><span>Reference Ritter, Vinson, Barnhart, Akob, Fields, Cunningham, Orem and McIntosh</span>2015</a>) and Colosimo <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref27"><span>Reference Colosimo, Thomas, Lloyd, Taylor, Boothman, Smith, Lord and Kalin</span>2016</a>). Gao <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref49"><span>Reference Gao, Jiang, Yang, Li and Yua</span>2011</a>) studied the effects of bacterial consortia to act on leonardite, a type 4 kerogen, in the production of humic acid for biofertilizers. There are also intriguing recent studies of direct bacterial assimilation of carbonaceous chondrite material. In 2022, Waajen <em>et al</em>., found that naturally occurring bacterial consortia could metabolize carbon from the Cold Bokkeveld CM-type carbonaceous chondrite. In 2024, Waajen <em>et al</em>., used a sample of the Aquas Zarcas CM-type carbonaceous chondrite and found that bacterial consortia could use the meteoritic material exclusively as a source of carbon as well as energy and nutrients. In both studies, bacteria were able to directly transfer meteoritic carbon into biomass. The 2022 study explored the possibilities of carbonaceous meteoritic material supporting early life on Earth. The 2024 study also explores this as well as suggesting the possible use of bacteria in processing asteroids for future human activities.</p>

<div data-magellan-destination="sec3" id="sec3"><h2> Methods</h2>
<p> Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) demonstrated the ability of pyrolysis to produce microbially biodegradable intermediate compounds from high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Pyrolysis uses high temperatures to break down plastics into lower-molecular-weight hydrocarbons (Gracida-Alvarez <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref56"><span>Reference Gracida-Alvarez, Mitchell, Sacramento-Rivero and Shonnard</span>2018</a>). These lower-carbon length hydrocarbons are more easily degraded by microorganisms, particularly for carbon lengths on the order of C10 – C40 (Ji <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref68"><span>Reference Ji, Mao, Wang and Bartlam</span>2013</a>). The hydrocarbons produced by pyrolysis by Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) were analysed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to quantify the residual compound concentrations of alkenes. In an ideal scenario, the pyrolysis results would be compared to the organic compounds available in high carbon carbonaceous meteorites to determine if the asteroid compounds contain the same potentially human edible biomass identified by Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>).</p>
<p> In the Murchison meteorite ~70% of the organic compounds comprise IOM. Studies of the precise breakdown of this IOM, in terms of specific compounds and quantities, are severely limited. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately determine what proportion of organic material in meteorites matches the types of compounds that can be converted into food, such as the low-C chain aliphatic hydrocarbons identified by Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>). Instead, the calculations in this study will use the abundance of aliphatic hydrocarbons in the Murchison meteorite (&gt;35&nbsp;ppm, <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>) as a baseline for the calculations, representing the <em>minimum amount of organic matter that could theoretically be attributed to protein production.</em> This minimum value assumes that only the aliphatic hydrocarbons present in asteroids will be effectively converted into biomass. <em>C</em>alculations for the total C in IOM represent the <em>maximum amount of organic matter that could theoretically be attributed to food production</em>. This is a pure theoretical exercise considering the lack of scientific literature on this topic. The maximum value assumes that all IOM is capable of being effectively converted into biomass. Together, these two values will provide a range of realistic yields to determine how much food could theoretically be extractable from an asteroid. To determine how many grams of biomass could be produced from this organic matter, the mass balance calculations from Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) are used.</p>
<p> The following calculations determine the biomass extractable from an asteroid (<em>b</em>) given the initial mass of the asteroid (<em>m</em> <sub>a</sub>), the proportion of organic material (<em>O</em>) of the asteroid (From <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>, adapted from Alexander <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Alexander, Cody, De Gregorio, Nittler and Stroud</span>2017</a>)), and the proportion of organic compounds that are in the pyrolysis list in Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) that can be converted into proteins. In the minimum scenario, <em>O</em>&nbsp;<em>=</em>&nbsp;<em>0.0035</em> to represent the concentration of aliphatic hydrocarbons in the Murchison meteorite (&gt;35&nbsp;ppm, <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>), and in the maximum scenario <em>O</em>&nbsp;<em>=</em>&nbsp;<em>0.096</em> to represent the concentration of IOM in the Murchison meteorite (0.96&nbsp;wt %, <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>).</p>
<p> First, the mass of organic material present in asteroid (<em>m<sub>o</sub>)</em> is given by:</p><p><span>(1)</span><span><span data-mathjax-type="texmath"><span>$$m_o{\rm \;}( {{\rm grams}} ) = m_a\;( {{\rm grams}} ) \times \;O\;\;( {{\rm unitless}} ) $$</span></span><img data-src="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn1.png?pub-status=live" width="293" height="20" data-original-image="/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn1.png" data-zoomable="false" src="https://www.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn1.png"></span></p>
<p> Next, the proportion of mass extractable for food production from asteroid (<em>e</em>) is:</p><p><span>(2)</span><span><span data-mathjax-type="texmath"><span>$$e\;( {{\rm unitless}} ) = \displaystyle{{m_p\;( {{\rm grams}} ) } \over {m_i\;( {{\rm grams}} ) }}\;\;\;$$</span></span><img data-src="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn2.png?pub-status=live" width="181" height="43" data-original-image="/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn2.png" data-zoomable="false" src="https://www.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn2.png"></span></p><p>where, <em>m</em> <sub>p</sub> is the mass attributed to protein production (<a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>, Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>)) (grams) and <em>m</em> <sub>i</sub> is the initial mass of pyrolysis product (<a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>, Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>)) (grams).</p>
<p> Finally, the biomass extractable from asteroid (<em>b</em>) is thus:</p><p><span>(3)</span><span><span data-mathjax-type="texmath"><span>$$b\;( {{\rm grams}} ) = m_o\;( {{\rm grams}} ) \times e\;( {{\rm unitless}} ) \times k\, ( {{\rm unitless}} ) \times 0.008\;\;$$</span></span><img data-src="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn3.png?pub-status=live" width="425" height="20" data-original-image="/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn3.png" data-zoomable="false" src="https://www.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn3.png"></span></p><p>where <em>k</em> is the conversion constant, which is currently 0.2 because the conversion efficiency from plastic to biomass is approximately 20% (Byrne <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>). At present, it is unclear if the conversion efficiency for organic material in asteroids would be similar to that for plastics. For the purposes of this mathematical exercise the assumption is that the conversion efficiency will be the same, however, this may have to be corrected in future studies after testing.</p>
<p> However, this calculation alone would be an oversimplification because of the inefficiencies of extracting resources from a planetary body via in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). Most ISRU technologies have primarily focused on the extraction of oxygen for life support and propellant production (e.g., Taylor and Carrier, <a href="#ref131"><span>Reference Taylor and Carrier</span>1992</a>; Bennett <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref12"><span>Reference Bennett, Ellender and Dempster</span>2020</a>; Schlüter and Cowley, <a href="#ref120"><span>Reference Schlüter and Cowley</span>2020</a>; Linne <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref78"><span>Reference Linne, Schuler, Sibille, Kleinhenz, Colozza, Fincannon, Oleson, Suzuki and Moore</span>2021</a>; Guerrero-Gonzalez and Zabel, <a href="#ref61"><span>Reference Guerrero-Gonzalez and Zabel</span>2023</a>) so there are not good estimates for what the efficiency of an ISRU technology for extracting organic material from an asteroid would be. One potential analogue for these calculations is the method of bioleaching to extract rare earth elements (REE) from rock. Rasoulnia <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref110"><span>Reference Rasoulnia, Barthen and Lakaniemi</span>2021</a>) conducted a critical review of the process and found that the total REE leaching efficiency varied significantly depending on the process parameters, from as low as 0.08% in bastnäsite-bearing rock (the mineral bastnäsite is the most abundant primary source of REEs (Wang <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref142"><span>Reference Wang, Huang, Yu, Zhao, Wang, Feng, Cui and Long</span>2017</a>)) to 80% for extraction from the mineral zircon. Given these extreme uncertainties, the resultant value from equation (<a href="#eqn3">3</a>) is multiplied again by 0.008 to simulate a low extraction efficiency similar to results from Zhang <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ref149"><span>Reference Zhang, Dong, Liu, Bian, Wang, Zhou and Huang</span>2018</a>) in the extraction from bastnäsite-bearing rock.</p>
<p> Caloric intake requirements differ among astronauts due to size and other factors such as age, metabolism, and gender (Stemonstration Nutrition, NASA, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/stem-content/stemonstrations-nutrition/">https://www.nasa.gov/stem-content/stemonstrations-nutrition/</a>). For these calculations, an average of 2500 calories (<em>C</em>) per day or 912&nbsp;500 calories per year will be assumed. These calorie totals will be used for converting biomass yield to astronaut life-years. Plastics converted to biomass in the lab were analysed by Eurofins Food Chemistry Testing Madison, Inc to determine the calory-content of the biomass (<em>c</em>), as well as specific breakdowns of fat content, carbohydrates, fibre and protein<a href="#fn1"><span>Footnote </span><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p> The results of this analysis show that 100&nbsp;g of biomass contains a total of 442 calories (<em>c</em>), 137 of which were from fat. The breakdown is as follows:

<p> The number of astronaut-life years (<em>y</em>) that the biomass extractable from an asteroid (<em>b</em>) could support considering a recommended diet consisting of 2500 calories per day or 912&nbsp;500 calories per year is:</p><p><span>(5)</span><span><span data-mathjax-type="texmath"><span>$$y\;( {{\rm years}} ) {\rm} = \displaystyle{{C\;( {{\rm calories}} ) } \over {912, \;500\;{\rm cal/year}}}\;\;$$</span></span><img data-src="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn5.png?pub-status=live" width="213" height="43" data-original-image="/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn5.png" data-zoomable="false" src="https://www.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20241002074449672-0657:S1473550424000119:S1473550424000119_eqn5.png"></span></p>
<p> The first set of calculations will determine what mass of edible biomass <em>(b)</em> can be obtained if asteroid Bennu were completely broken down. The mass of asteroid Bennu is 7.329&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.009 &nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;kg, or 7.329 &nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;g (Scheeres <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref118"><span>Reference Scheeres, McMahon, French, Brack, Chesley, Farnocchia, Takahashi, Leonard, Geeraert, Page and Antreasian</span>2019</a>).</p>

<p> In addition to these calculations that are specific to the mass of asteroid Bennu, estimates can be made using the same equations to determine the asteroid mass (<em>m</em> <sub>a</sub>) required to sustain an astronaut for a single year (assuming an annual diet consisting of 912&nbsp;500 calories). The results are 206&nbsp;448&nbsp;g of biomass is required to sustain an astronaut for one year to obtain the required 2500 calories per day.</p>
<p> On average, to feed an astronaut for one year would require over 160 million grams of asteroid (&gt; 160&nbsp;000 metric tons) in the minimum-efficiency scenario or over 5 million grams of asteroid (&gt; 5000 metric tons) in the maximum-efficiency scenario (<a href="#tab03">Table 3</a>). For reference, the mass of asteroid Bennu is 77.6 million metric tons.</p>

<div data-magellan-destination="sec5" id="sec5"><h2> Discussion</h2>
<p> The values obtained for the amount of asteroid mass that need to be processed to provide food for a single astronaut are large, but if human exploration of the solar system is to be done, it provides a potential path to doing so. Based on the results of this study, this approach appears promising but there are substantial areas of future work. First, the plastics recycling to food projects currently sponsored by DARPA have a number of ways to target human edible biomass (DARPA Cornucopia programme, <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/cornucopia">https://www.darpa.mil/program/cornucopia</a>) that can be leveraged for applying the same basic mechanisms to space. To get useful (human diet) relevant biomass outputs a scalable open source bioreactor has been developed (Hafting <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref62"><span>Reference Hafting, Yeung, Al-Aribe, Michels and Pearce</span>2023</a>) and is being used to produce biomass that is being tested for chemical toxicity using an open source toolchain (Pham <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref103"><span>Reference Pham, García Martínez, Brynych, Stormbjorne, Pearce and Denkenberger</span>2022</a>). The next state of that work is to do animal trials to obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status under sections 201(s) and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-ingredients-packaging/generally-recognized-safe-gras">https://www.fda.gov/food/food-ingredients-packaging/generally-recognized-safe-gras</a>) and then human trials.</p>
<p> Meteorites, particularly the carbonaceous type, are a precious and often limited resource. Fortunately, reasonable terrestrial analogues of meteoritic organic compounds (kerogens) are readily available. Future work on this topic could focus on these terrestrial analogues to develop effective and efficient techniques and procedures, before moving on to actual meteorite samples. Thus, in parallel, the identical microbial consortia can be tested on terrestrial kerogens. To make space exploration more cost-effective, there is a reasonable possibility that essentials such as food and water could be produced from resources existing in certain C-class asteroids using ISRU technologies. The extracted water could also potentially be a source of oxygen (for breathing) and fuel (e.g., Taylor and Carrier, <a href="#ref131"><span>Reference Taylor and Carrier</span>1992</a>; Bennett <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref12"><span>Reference Bennett, Ellender and Dempster</span>2020</a>; Schlüter and Cowley, <a href="#ref120"><span>Reference Schlüter and Cowley</span>2020</a>; Linne <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref78"><span>Reference Linne, Schuler, Sibille, Kleinhenz, Colozza, Fincannon, Oleson, Suzuki and Moore</span>2021</a>; Guerrero-Gonzalez and Zabel, <a href="#ref61"><span>Reference Guerrero-Gonzalez and Zabel</span>2023</a>). This study focuses only on the production of edible biomass. The essential idea of Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) to turn initially inedible precursors – post-consumer waste plastic – into edible biomass via microbial assimilation in bioreactors is the basis of this approach. In place of plastics, terrestrial kerogens can be used as the initial carbon source for future studies. Kerogens with H/C ratios in the same range as IOM will be selected. Considerable experimentation will be required to develop the techniques to achieve this, which will require the use of considerable amounts of study material. Fortunately, some types of abundant terrestrial kerogens could provide reasonable analogues of IOM.</p>
<p> Future studies will initially use terrestrial kerogens, however, a fundamental guiding principle is to design processes that mimic an extraterrestrial installation that relies on resources found in space. The use of acidic demineralization to extract IOM is unfeasible since it would involve regularly transporting enormous quantities of highly reactive chemicals as well as the disposal of the spent acids. The aim is to ensure that the only heavy-lift requirements in the initial stages of the development of an asteroidal base would be the processing equipment. Other inputs would be certain dry chemicals necessary to provide essential electrolytes for the bacterial innocula.</p>

</ul>
<p> The ability of bacteria to assimilate a wide range of naturally occurring terrestrial organic compounds provides a reasonable basis to investigate if the same is true for extraterrestrial organics. If possible, then the ultimate aim of producing food from existing resources found throughout the solar system is achievable, using the approach of Byrne <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Byrne, Schaerer, Kulas, Ankathi, Putman, Codere, Schum, Shonnard and Techtmann</span>2022</a>) and going beyond synthesis from carbon dioxide (Alvarado <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref7"><span>Reference Alvarado, Martinez, Matassa, Egbejimba and Denkenberger</span>2021</a>; Martínez <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref82"><span>Reference Martínez, Alvarado, Christodoulou and Denkenberger</span>2021a</a>). This work also has larger implications on Earth. It may provide alternative means to produce edible biomass from inedible precursors and support current activities in this area of research on alternative foods (Baum <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref10"><span>Reference Baum, Denkenberger, Pearce, Robock and Winkler</span>2015</a>; Martínez <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref83"><span>Reference Martínez, Egbejimba, Throup, Matassa, Pearce and Denkenberger</span>2021b</a>; <a href="#ref84"><span>Reference Martínez, Brown, Christodoulou, Alvarado and Denkenberger</span>2021c</a>) or resilient foods (Schipanski <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref119"><span>Reference Schipanski, MacDonald, Rosenzweig, Chappell, Bennett, Kerr, Blesh, Crews, Drinkwater, Lundgren and Schnarr</span>2016</a>; Gracida-Alvarez <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref56"><span>Reference Gracida-Alvarez, Mitchell, Sacramento-Rivero and Shonnard</span>2018</a>; Linder, <a href="#ref77"><span>Reference Linder</span>2019</a>). This opens up new potentially economic pathways for supplying basic nutrients during times of great distress such as famines or other natural or human-created disasters that cripple normal food supplies (Denkenberger and Pearce, <a href="#ref33"><span>Reference Denkenberger and Pearce</span>2014</a>, <a href="#ref34"><span>Reference Denkenberger and Pearce</span>2015</a>, <a href="#ref35"><span>Reference Denkenberger and Pearce</span>2016</a>; Denkenberger <em>et al</em>., <a href="#ref36"><span>Reference Denkenberger, Cole, Abdelkhaliq, Griswold, Hundley and Pearce</span>2017</a>).</p>
<p> In addition to the testing of terrestrial kerogens, various analyses and trials will be conducted on the biomass to further this research, such as:
</p><ul>
<li><p><span>•</span> Toxins analysis on biomass;</p></li>
<li><p><span>•</span> Animal studies on biomass;</p></li>

<div data-magellan-destination="sec7" id="sec7"><h2> Conclusions</h2>
<p> After comparing the experimental pyrolysis breakdown products, which were able to be converted to biomass using a consortia, it was hypothesized that equivalent chemicals found on asteroids could also be converted to biomass with the same nutritional content as the pyrolyzed products. The results of this study found that if only the aliphatic hydrocarbons can be converted into biomass (minimum scenario) the resulting mass of edible biomass extractable from asteroid Bennu ranges from 5.070&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;g to 2.390&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;g. If the biomass extraction process, however, is more efficient, and all IOM is converted into edible biomass (maximum scenario), then the mass of edible biomass extractable from asteroid Bennu ranges from 1.391&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;g to 6.556&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;g. This would provide between 5.762&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>8</sup> and 1.581&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>10</sup> calories that is enough to support between 600 and 17&nbsp;000 astronaut life years. The asteroid mass needed to support one astronaut for one year is between 160&nbsp;000 metric tons and 5000 metric tons. Based on these results, this approach of using carbon in asteroids to provide a distributed food source for humans exploring the solar system appears promising, but there are substantial areas of future work required.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-7830074591186405092" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>On the last day of 1945, with World War II finally behind it, Finland's government announced a new and very strange policy.</p><p>All Finns were required to take out a pair of scissors and snip their banknotes in half. This was known in Finland as <i>setelinleikkaus</i>, or banknote cutting. Anyone who owned any of the three largest denomination Finnish banknotes&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> the 5000 markka note, the 1000, or the 500&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> was required to perform this operation immediately. The left side of the note could still be used to buy things, but at only half its value. So if a Finn had a 1000 markka note in their wallet, henceforth he or she could now only buy 500 markka worth of items at stores. As for the right side, it could no longer be spent and effectively became a bond (more on this later).</p><p><br><i>Setelinleikkaus </i>was Finland's particular response to the post-War European problem of "monetary overhang," described <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=987262">in a 1990 paper</a> by economists Rudi Dornbusch and Holger Wolf. After many years of war production, price controls, and rationing, European citizens had built-up a substantial chest of <i>forced savings</i>, or involuntary postponed consumption, as Dornbusch &amp; Wolf refer to it. With WWII now over, Europeans would soon want to begin living as they had before, spending the balances they had accumulated on goods and services. Alas, with most factories having been configured to military purposes or having been bombed into dust, there wasn't nearly enough consumption items to make everyone happy.</p><p>It was plain to governments all across Europe what this sudden making-up of postponed consumption in a war-focused economy would lead to: a big one time jump in prices.</p><p>This may sound familiar to the modern day reader, since we just went through our own wartime economy of sorts: the 2020-21 battle against COVID and subsequent return to a peacetime economy. The supply chain problem caused by the COVID shutdowns combined with the big jump in spending as lockdowns expired, spurred on by a big overhang of unspent COVID support cheques, led to the steepest inflation in decades.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Dornbusch and Wolf, European authorities fretted that the post-WWII jump in prices could very well spiral into something worse: all-out hyperinflation, as had happened after the first World War. Currencies were no longer linked to gold, after all, having lost that tether when the war started<span lang="en"><span>, </span></span>or earlier, in response to the Great Depression.&nbsp;</p><p>To prevent what they saw as imminent hyperinflation, almost all European countries began to enact monetary reforms. Finland's own unique reform&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> obliging their citizens to cut their stash of banknotes in two&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> would reduce the economy's stock of banknotes to just "lefts," thereby halving spending power and muting the wave of post-wartime spending. After February 16, 1946 the halves would be demonetized, but until then the Finns could continue to make purchases with them or bring them to the nearest bank to be converted into a new edition of the currency.</p><p>As for the right halves, they were to be transformed into a long-term investment. Finns were obligated to bring each right half in to be registered, upon which it would be converted into a Finnish government bond that paid 2% interest per year, to be repaid four years later, in 1949. It was illegal to try and spend right halves or transfer their ownership to anyone else (although it's not apparent how this was enforced).</p><p>In theory, turning right halves into bonds would shift a large part of the Finnish public's post-war consumption intentions forward to 1949, when the bonds could finally be cashed. By then, the economy would have fully transitioned back to a civilian one and would be capable of accepting everyone's desired consumption spending without hyperinflation occurring.</p><div><p>To our modern sensibilities, this is a wildly invasive policy. Had <i>setelinleikkaus</i> been proposed in 2022-23 as a way to dampen the inflationary effects of the reopening of COVID-wracked economies, and we all had to cut our dollar bills or yen or euros in half, there probably would have been a revolt. </p><p>With the benefit of hindsight, we know that <i>setelinleikkaus </i>didn't work very well. Finland continued to suffer from high inflation in the years after the war, much more so than most European countries did.</p></div><p>Why the failure? As Finish economist Matti Viren has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081609/http://www.rahamuseo.fi/monetaria/studia_monetaria_viren_kev%C3%A4t_2007.pdf">pointed out</a>, the reform only affected banknotes, not bank deposits. This stock of notes only comprised 8% of the total Finnish money supply, (Finns being&nbsp; uncommonly comfortable with banks) so a major chunk of the monetary overhang was left in place.</p><p>Another glitch appears to have been the public's anticipation of <i>setelinleikkaus</i>. According to <br>former central banker Antti Heinonen, who wrote <a href="https://www.suomenpankki.fi/fi/julkaisut/muut-julkaisut/hallitus-kansan-kukkarolla/">an entire book</a> on the subject, banks began to advertise their services as a way to avoid the dangers of the upcoming monetary reform (see images below). So Finns deposited their cash prior to the final date, the monetary overhang to some degree evading the blockade.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgl0LBywd5JlwBT3JynEswJWvqMV_Kb2-rUoIT3dqbParkpHHEo64VI2hc6n3KWktGjJfpYt1hIsR6GJI14HRAuOBSYSfA-7a1_GEed001newOG9bZu9RjTTsap8FUzaMs_XjFAeoKulmCg6V6yyR1x2N1ak9JUkP8wwBSR4tnQygH2wz9_QR7X_QQhqF4/s487/heinonen.PNG"><img data-original-height="364" data-original-width="487" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgl0LBywd5JlwBT3JynEswJWvqMV_Kb2-rUoIT3dqbParkpHHEo64VI2hc6n3KWktGjJfpYt1hIsR6GJI14HRAuOBSYSfA-7a1_GEed001newOG9bZu9RjTTsap8FUzaMs_XjFAeoKulmCg6V6yyR1x2N1ak9JUkP8wwBSR4tnQygH2wz9_QR7X_QQhqF4/s16000/heinonen.PNG"></a></td></tr><tr><td><span>Finnish bank advertisements warning of the upcoming note cutting<br>Left: <i>"Bank accounts are fully secured in the banknote exchange</i>." <br>Right: <i>"Depositors are protected</i>."<br> <b>Source</b>: <a href="https://www.suomenpankki.fi/fi/julkaisut/muut-julkaisut/hallitus-kansan-kukkarolla/">Hallitus kansan kukkarolla</a>, by Antti Heinonen (Translations via Google Translate)</span><br></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br>If the Finnish experiment was a dud, other European responses to the post WWII overhang&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> either&nbsp; redenominations, temporarily blocking of funds, or all-out write offs of bank accounts&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> were more successful. Germany's <a href="https://www.bundesbank.de/en/press/contributions/the-economic-and-currency-reform-of-1948-the-basis-for-stable-money-915302">monetary reform of 1948</a>, which introduced the Deutschmark and was later dubbed the <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/GermanEconomicMiracle.html">"German economic miracle"</a>, is the one that captures the most attention, but here I want to focus on a lesser known reform.</p><div><p>Belgium's <i>Operation Gutt</i>, named after Belgium's Minister of Finance, Camille Gutt, was the earliest and perhaps the most dramatic of the post-war monetary operations. Taking place over four days in October 1944, Belgium contracted its entire money supply, both banknotes and deposits, from 165 billion to 57.5 billion francs. That's a two-thirds decline! You can see it illustrated in the chart below, along with the monetary reform enacted <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/financial-history-review/article/abs/netherlands-postwar-monetary-reform-1945521/36CF6F0267461A0A8E9BE14C807BC593">by the Dutch</a> the following year, inspired by the Belgians.</p></div><p>It's not just the size of Operation Gutt that is striking to the modern eye. It's also the oddity of the tool being used. Today, we control inflation with changes in interest rates, not changes in the quantity of money. To soften the effect of the global COVID monetary overhang, for instance, central banks in the U.S., Canada, and Europe began to raise rates in 2022 from around 0% to 4-5% in 2024.&nbsp;</p><div><p>By making it more lucrative for everyone to save and less attractive to borrow, central bankers were trying to reduce our propensity to spend our COVID support payments, and with less spending, prices wouldn't get pushed up as fast.&nbsp;This reliance on interest rates as our main tool of monetary policy is a relatively new phenomenon. In times past, central banks tended to lean heavily on changes in the supply of money, which may explain why in 1945, their main response&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> in Europe at least&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span>&nbsp; was to obliterate the public's money balances rather than to jack up interest rates to 25% or 50%.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>It's worth exploring in some more detail how Operation Gutt was designed. On October 9, 1944, Belgian bank depositors had 90% of the money held in their accounts frozen, leaving just 10% in spendable form.</p></div><p>As for holders of banknotes, there was no Finnish-style cutting. Rather,
 Belgians had four days, beginning October 9, to bring all their 
banknotes to the nearest bank, only the first 2,000 francs qualifying 
for conversion to newly printed versions. All notes above that ceiling 
got blocked in a separate account (along with excess deposits), some of 
which would be released slowly over the next few years<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span>while
 the rest would remain frozen forever, subject to whether the owner was 
deemed to have been a collaborator who got rich during the occupation. 
(Finland's <i>setelinleikkaus </i>also had this same "cleansing" motivation.) <br></p><br><div><p>In this sense, the post-WWII European monetary reforms were not only designed to reduce inflation, but also had a moral basis. Think of them as progenitors to India's 2016 demonetization, which was designed to catch so-called "black money," although <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/30/india-demonetisation-drive-fails-uncover-black-money">it failed</a> to do so.</p><p>Did Operation Gutt work? Incredibly, the decimation of two-thirds of the money supply in just a few days did <i>not </i>cause an immediate fall in Belgian prices. <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/258/oa_monograph/chapter/861769">According to</a> Belgian economic historians Monique Verbreyt and Herman Van der Wee, the Belgian retail price index stood at 260 the month of the reform, but had risen to 387 by September 1945. So it would seem that the whole operation failed. This surely draws into question the <i>quantity theory of money</i>, one of the basic tenets of monetary economics. A decline in the money supply, all things staying the same, is supposed to cause a fall in prices. Here is a glaring case in which it didn't. </p></div><p>However, the National Bank of Belgium (NBB), the country's central bank, strikes a more constructive tone. In a <a href="https://museum.nbb.be/en/resources/operation-gutt-gamble-paid">recent retrospective</a> on Operation Gutt, the NBB describes the reform as a gamble that paid off over time, eventually inspiring the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_economic_miracle">Belgian Economic Miracle</a>", a period of low inflation and fast growth lasting from 1946-1949. By contrast, France did not embark on its own monetary reforms, the NBB takes pains to point out, and it thereby "paid the consequences of post-World War II inflation well into the 1960s." Belgium's inflation rate was also much lower than Finland's in the four or five years after the war.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Which gets us back to Finland. Unlike the Belgian central bank, Finland's central bank&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> Suomen Pankki&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> notably <a href="https://www.suomenpankki.fi/fi/haku/?q=Setelinleikkaus">avoids almost all mention</a> of its post-war reform on its website. According to Matti Viren, <i>setelinleikkaus </i>led to "distrust towards the authorities and economic policy for decades," so there may be some sheepish reticence on the part of the central bank to draw attention to it.</p><p>But <i>setelinleikkaus </i>and Operation Gutt aren't just archaic monetary policy dead-ends. One day I suspect they'll be back. Not just as a special tool for responding to emergencies, but as a day-to-day policy wrench, albeit in a new and refined form.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Cash, which is awkward to immobilize for policy reasons, will be gone in a decade or two, leaving the public entirely dependent on bank deposits and fintech balances which, thanks to digitization and automation, can be easily controlled by the authorities. To rein in a jump in inflation, central bankers will require commercial banks and companies like PayPal to impose temporary <i>quantitative freezing</i> on their clients'&nbsp; accounts, but unlike Finland's 1945 blockade, the authorities will be able to rapidly and precisely define the criteria, say by allowing for spending on necessities&nbsp;<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> food, electricity, and gas<span lang="en"><span>—</span></span> while embargoing purchases of luxury cars and real estate.</p><p>The future version of <i>setelinleikkaus </i>won't be clumsy, it'll be a precise and surgical inflation-fighting tool, albeit a controversial one.<br></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The Silicon Valley dream is to build a tech startup that is such a unique idea it alters the commercial universe and turns its founders into billionaires. Participating in the Valley’s most famed startup factory, Y Combinator, is often part of that dream. Airbnb, Coinbase, and Stripe all got started there.</p>

<p>Yet, a deep dive into the data from all of the nearly 5,000 companies YC has backed to date reveals a surprising truth: YC startups don’t have to be unique. Far from it.&nbsp;</p>







<p>YC commonly accepts startups that are building similar or nearly identical products to previous YC grads. Some of them are direct competitors; others differ slightly by targeting a new geography (Asia or Latin America), or are a subset of a larger market (point-of-sale software for bars versus coffee shops).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Data analysis startup <a rel="nofollow" href="https://alphalens.com/">Deckmatch</a> conducted the research, inspired to look at competing YC products after a controversy over a YC-backed startup called PearAI. Critics said that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/30/y-combinator-is-being-criticized-after-it-backed-an-ai-startup-that-admits-it-basically-cloned-another-ai-startup/">PearAI’s code editor product wasn’t much more than a cloned version</a> of another YC product, called Continue — and PearAI’s founder essentially admitted it. There were more reasons that Pear found itself in hot water (including the bravado of its founders and how it handled the open source licensing). But the uproar concluded with Pear’s founders vowing to <a href="https://x.com/trypearai/status/1843336730012987613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">start over from scratch</a>.</p>

<p>YC CEO Garry Tan defended the company, and the fact that YC accepted this behavior, by<a href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1840490996528029942" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> posting on X</a>, “More choice is good, people building is good, if you don’t like it don’t use it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is clearly more than lip service for Tan, who has himself, for instance, championed two police bodycam startups a few years apart: Flock Safety (Summer 2017 cohort) and Abel Police (Summer 2024). Along the same lines, more than a dozen startups building AI code editors went through the YC program between 2022 and 2024 — some in the same batch with the same YC partner.</p>

<p>When asked about its propensity to back competitors, a YC spokesperson said that the organization is more interested in the founders’ backgrounds than their business ideas. “YC invests in founders over ideas, focusing on individuals with the potential to build transformative companies — no matter the space they operate in. Our investment strategy focuses on backing the most promising founders with vision, resilience, and ability to execute, which is clear in our RFS process,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>


<h2 id="h-some-founders-love-yc-s-approach">Some founders love YC’s approach</h2>

<p>One of YC’s big benefits is its cozy network, where startups often seek customers, partners, and the like. Consequently, some alums dislike competition if they feel another’s product mimics theirs, rather than differentiates. Around the time of the PearAI controversy, YC alum Bryan Onel, founder of security startup Oneleet, <a href="https://x.com/ayushswrites/status/1847000329201528999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X</a> about his experience with this. A few others chimed in to commiserate. (Onel did not respond to our requests for comment.)</p>

<p>Then again, other YC alums think this kind of direct competition is good, especially when the same YC partner advises them. Restaurant PoS systems is one area that has been popular in YC, and YC alum Nick Evans, co-founder CEO of restaurant PoS <a href="https://www.avocadopos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Avocado</a>, is fine with competitors.</p>

<p>He should know. Evans famously founded a device-tracking startup called Tile, which went crazy with crowdfunding, raised money from traditional VCs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/tile-secures-another-40-million-to-take-on-apple-airtag-with-new-products/">took on Apple’s AirTags</a>, then sold to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/family-locator-service-life360-to-acquire-tile-for-205-million/">Life360 in 2021 for $205 million</a>.&nbsp;</p>







<p>“I think it’s stupid that most investors don’t invest in competing companies,” Evans told TechCrunch about YC competition. “I want investors that deeply understand my business and industry. How the hell would they know anything useful if they aren’t working with similar companies? Startups don’t die by murder; they die by suicide. You are not fighting against other startups. You are fighting against people not giving a s— about your product.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-deep-dive-inspired-by-pearai-controversy">Deep dive inspired by PearAI controversy</h2>

<p>Before diving into the specifics of the categories YC has particularly favored, it’s worth noting that Deckmatch is not a YC company and has never applied to be one, CEO Leo Gasteen tells TechCrunch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Deckmatch was inspired to analyze YC products by the PearAI situation as a demo test for its new product AlphaLens. Deckmatch sells product analysis data on about 8 million startups to private market participants like investors, and corporate innovation and M&amp;A teams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It wants to do for product data what PitchBook did for company-level data, Gasteen says. Earlier this month, Deckmatch raised a $3.1 million seed round co-led by Alliance VC and Luminar Ventures, with participation from its pre-seed investors First Degree Capital and Skyfall Ventures. It’s raised $4.2 million to date, it says.</p>

<p>AlphaLens lets Deckmatch customers comb through its database to find unique and similar products, build scatter charts, cluster maps, and the like. But the <a href="https://labs.alphalens.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">results of the YC analysis</a>, shared exclusively with TechCrunch, should be fascinating to any founder wondering what kinds of startups YC tends to accept.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-types-of-products-yc-loves-according-to-the-data">Types of products YC loves, according to the data</h2>

<p>According to this data, the current popular product categories, each with at least a dozen startups, include:</p>

<p><strong>AI code editors:</strong> Beyond Continue and PearAI, another example is Void (another open source alternative to Cursor, the popular Andreessen Horowitz/OpenAI-backed startup). Then there’s EasyCode, Ellipsis, Cosine, Greptile, and more, each applying AI to various coding tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Food/beverage/restaurant point of sale systems:</strong> Most of the PoS startups were accepted into the program between 2020 and 2023, including Avocado, Dripos, or Latin American startup Polo.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Business finance/payroll:</strong> With the success of YC alums Gusto and Rippling came many competitors, some aimed at different international markets. Examples include Warp and Zeal.</p>

<p><strong>AI sales and customer relationship management.</strong> This is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/podcast/marc-benioff-says-its-crazy-talk-that-ai-will-hurt-salesforce-wants-a-billion-ai-agents-in-a-year/">very hot area of development for the big players </a>(Salesforce, Microsoft) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/22/ai-sdr-startups-are-booming-so-why-are-vcs-wary/">and startups</a>. YC alums include Apten, Persana AI, and Topo.</p>

<p><strong>AI meeting assistants:</strong> Circleback, Onward, Sonnet, and Spinach AI are but a few examples.</p>

<p><strong>AI legal assistants:</strong> Dioptra, Leya, and Tower are some examples.</p>

<p>Then again, several areas were popular but have been recently less so. These include:</p>

<p><strong>Crypto trading platforms:</strong> Given the success of YC grad Coinbase, YC was gung ho on this for a while, with about a dozen grads, largely from 2014 to 2022.</p>

<p><strong>E-commerce store platforms:</strong> In the wake of Shopify (not a YC alum) YC accepted about a dozen such companies since 2018, with the majority in the 2018 to 2022 time frame.</p>

<p><strong>Corporate expense cards:</strong> After YC alum Brex came many others, mostly from&nbsp;2018 to 2022.</p>

All this was possibly foreshadowed in 2023 when a leaked Tesla report showed the Cybertruck had <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/">basic design flaws</a>.</p><p>“We aren’t comfortable making [lifetime recall] predictions on the Cybertruck at this very early stage,” stresses Brauer, “but so far it isn’t doing very well.”</p><p>Most Cybertruck buyers pay scant attention to longevity estimates, believes Edmunds’ Drury, and plenty probably aren’t exercised by recalls, OTA or otherwise, he said. “Cybertruck customers are in it for the stares and glares—they don’t care about how many times [this vehicle is] going to be recalled over 30 years,” says Drury. “They’re buying this car for now, with zero thought to the future.”</p><p>“A standard auto customer wants to know if a car will last 10 years or will be ongoing good value for money,” he says. “A Cybertruck customer doesn’t care about any of that. Owning a Cybertruck isn’t practical; it’s a boast. A boast that ‘I have so much discretionary income I can afford to waste it on an impractical car.’”</p><p>Similar to other critics (earlier this year, a <a data-offer-url="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/23/business/tesla-cybertruck-is-a-troubled-beast" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/23/business/tesla-cybertruck-is-a-troubled-beast&quot;}" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/23/business/tesla-cybertruck-is-a-troubled-beast" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CNN reviewer called the pickup</a> a “disturbing level of individual arrogance in hard, unforgiving steel”), Drury believes Cybertruck buyers are people “who think, ‘I don’t care if I kill people when I drive this thing down the street,’” he says. “There aren’t many of those people out there, so there’s a relatively small market for the Cybertruck.”</p><p>If Tesla, which was contacted for this piece, is genuinely fishing in smaller pools than originally anticipated by Musk—at a <a data-offer-url="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-2023-cyber-roundup-annual-shareholder-meeting-live-blog/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-2023-cyber-roundup-annual-shareholder-meeting-live-blog/&quot;}" href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-2023-cyber-roundup-annual-shareholder-meeting-live-blog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2023 shareholder meeting</a> he predicted that Cybertruck sales could hit 250,000 by 2025, and reach 500,000 a year once production ramped up—this might help explain the softening of Cybertruck aftersales.</p><p>“Used values on these things have plummeted dramatically,” said Drury. Price tracking website <a data-offer-url="https://www.cargurus.com/research/price-trends/Tesla-Cybertruck-d3353" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.cargurus.com/research/price-trends/Tesla-Cybertruck-d3353&quot;}" href="https://www.cargurus.com/research/price-trends/Tesla-Cybertruck-d3353" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CarGurus</a> estimates that the average used Cybertruck dropped from $175,000 in April to $110,864 today. The cheapest Cybertruck on <a data-offer-url="https://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/all-cars/tesla/cybertruck" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/all-cars/tesla/cybertruck&quot;}" href="https://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/all-cars/tesla/cybertruck" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Autotrader</a> was $86,000 earlier this week, and many of the other 276 currently listed on the site sport “recent price drop” banners.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Aftermarket prices might soften further as Tesla is starting to deliver a <a data-offer-url="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design#overview" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design#overview&quot;}" href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design#overview" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">new $79,990 model</a> to reservation holders. Not that there’s any longer much need to place reservations—North American Tesla stores now accept walk-in orders for Cybertrucks, with delivery two or three weeks later. “I am calling it: Original reservation list is basically finished,” said reservationist <a data-offer-url="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/confirmed-original-us-reservation-list-exhausted.25244/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/confirmed-original-us-reservation-list-exhausted.25244/&quot;}" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/confirmed-original-us-reservation-list-exhausted.25244/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BayouCityBob</a> on a Cybertruck owners forum last month. Tesla had claimed to have banked <a data-offer-url="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/10/18/tesla-cybertruck-options-geography-opening-up/#:~:text=Once%20upon%20a%20time%2C%20there,required%20a%20%24100%20refundable%20deposit." data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://cleantechnica.com/2024/10/18/tesla-cybertruck-options-geography-opening-up/#:~:text=Once%20upon%20a%20time%2C%20there,required%20a%20%24100%20refundable%20deposit.&quot;}" href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/10/18/tesla-cybertruck-options-geography-opening-up/#:~:text=Once%20upon%20a%20time%2C%20there,required%20a%20%24100%20refundable%20deposit." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">more than 1 million</a> $100 prelaunch reservations for the Cybertruck.</p><p>“I was thinking I have to wait a couple of [years] before my time comes,” MC1987 responded to BayouCityBob, citing his invitation to purchase his second Cybertruck. (The poster had returned their first, a top-spec Cyberbeast, because of alleged “build quality issues.”) “This is so wild,” they said.</p><p>As most other parts of the world have yet to sanction Cybertruck sales, Tesla can’t boost take-up outside of North America. UK automobile listings website <a data-offer-url="https://www.carwow.co.uk/tesla/news/4408/tesla-cybertruck-price-specs-release-date#gref" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.carwow.co.uk/tesla/news/4408/tesla-cybertruck-price-specs-release-date#gref&quot;}" href="https://www.carwow.co.uk/tesla/news/4408/tesla-cybertruck-price-specs-release-date#gref" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Carwow</a> describes the Cybertruck as a “rolling axe head,” a nod to the fact that the sharp-angled pickup is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-rubberized-cybertruck-is-ploughing-through-european-pedestrian-safety-rules/">literally too edgy to meet strict European pedestrian-safety regulations</a>.</p><p>Nor can Tesla rely on the US consumer’s love affair with pickups. “Something like 70 percent of all truck sales involve a truck being traded in,” says Drury. “This isn’t the case with [the Cybertruck],” he revealed, using Edmunds’ trade-in data.</p><p>“While Cybertruck hasn’t been on the market too long, it’s been long enough for us to capture some of the used ones. Because there’s no sign that Cybertrucks are being traded for trucks—which is what we typically see in America—then this likely isn’t a vehicle being used for trucklike purposes,” says Drury.</p><p>While the Cybertruck’s six recalls this year might not alarm “edgy” consumers, the bad press that often results won’t impress Tesla shareholders—higher-than-average recalls could tarnish the greater brand.</p><p>Any spike in general automobile recalls should not necessarily worry consumers since defects range widely in severity, and very few are stop-sale orders or demands to immediately cease driving any particular model. Automakers might hate to file them, but recalls demonstrate that the regulatory system is working as designed.</p><p>However, with Musk advising the US government—<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-elon-musk-department-of-government-efficiency/">even if it’s at arms-length</a>—some regulators might get their wings clipped, perhaps even reducing the number of product recalls, potentially increasing danger for consumers. Not all Cybertruck owners will be too fussed about that, though.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>
