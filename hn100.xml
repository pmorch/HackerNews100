<p>Contrary to what some policymakers seem to believe, whether naively or maliciously, encryption is not a crime. Anyone asserting encryption is a tool for crime is either painfully misinformed or is attempting to manipulate legislators to gain oppressive power over the people.<!-- more --></p>
<p>Encryption is not a crime, encryption is a shield.</p>
<p>Encryption is the digital tool that protects us against all sorts of attacks. It is the lock on your digital door preventing harmful intruders from entering your home. Encryption is also the door itself, protecting your privacy and intimacy from creepy eavesdroppers while you go about your life.</p>
<p>It's not a crime to lock your home's door for protection, <strong>why would it be a crime to lock your digital door?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/03/25/privacy-means-safety/">Encryption protects you</a> from cyberattack, identity theft, discrimination, doxxing, stalking, sexual violence, physical harm, and much more.</p>
<h2 id="who-says-encryption-is-a-crime">Who says encryption is a crime</h2>
<p>Anyone who is well-informed will find it hard to believe someone could want to sabotage such fantastic protection.</p>
<p>Yet, <a href="https://www.wired.com/1993/02/crypto-rebels/">year</a> after <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-new-era-of-attacks-on-encryption-is-starting-to-heat-up/">year</a>, oppressive regimes and lazy or greedy <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/anonymity-is-not-a-fundamental-right-experts-disagree-with-europol-chiefs-request-for-encryption-back-door">law enforcement</a> entities around the world have attempted to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/544727/what-is-an-encryption-backdoor/">undermine encryption</a> using the pretext this is needed to "solve crime", despite all the experts <em>repeatedly</em> warning on how <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/post-snowden-tech-became-more-secure-but-is-govt-really-at-risk-of-going-dark/">unnecessary</a> and <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2020/11/breaking-encryption-myths/">dangerous</a> this would be. And this is without accounting for all the countries where encryption is <em>already</em> <a href="https://www.gp-digital.org/world-map-of-encryption/">severely restricted</a>, such as Russia, China, India, Iran, Egypt, Cuba, and others.</p>
<p>Whether breaking encryption is brought up naively by misinformed authorities, or as a disguised excuse for mass surveillance is up for debate.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the result is the same: An attempt to destroy <strong>a tool we all need to stay safe</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="encryption-is-a-protective-shield">Encryption is a protective shield</h2>
<p>Encryption, moreover end-to-end encryption, is a tool we all use in our digital life to stay safe.</p>
<p>In today's world, the boundary between online and offline life is largely dissolved. Almost everything we do "offline" has a record of it "online". Online life is regular life now. It's not just your browsing history.</p>
<p>Your medical record from a visit at the clinic, your purchase transaction from a trip to the store, your travel photos saved in the cloud, your text conversations with your friends, family, and children, are all likely protected with encryption, perhaps even with <em>end-to-end</em> encryption.</p>
<p>Such a large trove of personal data needs to be protected against eavesdropping and malicious attacks for everyone to stay safe.</p>
<p>Encryption offers this protection. End-to-end encryption all the more.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-end-to-end-encryption-and-what-is-the-war-against-it">What is end-to-end encryption, and what is the war against it</h2>
<p>End-to-end encryption is a type of encryption where only the intended recipient(s) have the ability to decrypt (read) the encrypted data.</p>
<p>This means that if you send a message through <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> for example, only the participants to this conversation will be able to read the content of this conversation. Even Signal cannot know what is being discussed on Signal.</p>
<p>This greatly annoys some over-controlling authorities who would like to be granted unlimited power to spy on anyone anytime they wish, for vaguely defined purposes that could change at any moment.</p>
<p>End-to-end encryption can also mean a situation where you are "both ends" of the communication.</p>
<p>For example, when enabling Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/security/sec973254c5f/web">Advanced Data Protection for iCloud</a> (ADP), it activates end-to-end encryption protection for almost all of iCloud data, including photos. This means that even Apple could not see your photos, or be forced to share your photos with a governmental entity.</p>
<p>Without ADP, Apple can read or share your photos (or other data) if they are legally compelled to, or if they feel like it. The same is true for Google's services, Microsoft's services, and any other online services that aren't end-to-end encrypted.</p>
<p>This is at the root of the latest attack on encryption:</p>
<p>In February this year, it was reported that <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/02/28/uk-forced-apple-to-remove-adp/">Apple was served with a notice</a> from the UK's Home Office to force it to break ADP's end-to-end encryption. In response, Apple removed access to ADP from the UK entirely, making this protection unavailable to UK residents.</p>
<p>Do not mistakenly think this attack is limited to the UK and Apple users, however. If this regulation notice or a similar one gets enforced, it would <strong>impact the whole world.</strong> Other countries would likely soon follow, and other services would likely soon get under attack as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, do not feel unaffected just because you use end-to-end encryption with <a href="https://www-svt-se.translate.goog/nyheter/inrikes/signal-lamnar-sverige-om-regeringens-forslag-pa-datalagring-klubbas?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">Signal</a> or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/secure-encryption-and-online-anonymity-are-now-at-risk-in-switzerland-heres-what-you-need-to-know">Proton</a> services instead of Apple, they are both <strong>under attack</strong> as well in this war.</p>
<p>Just in recent years, the war against encryption has affected the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/earn-it-bill-back-again-seeking-scan-our-messages-and-photos">US</a>, the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgj54eq4vejo">UK</a>, <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2025/04/joint-letter-on-swedish-data-storage-and-access-to-electronic-information-legislation/">Sweden</a>, <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/en/warondrugslaw/">France</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21513212/backdoor-encryption-access-us-canada-australia-new-zealand-uk-india-japan">Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, Japan</a>, and all the European Union countries with proposals such as <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/02/03/the-future-of-privacy/#chat-control-wants-to-break-end-to-end-encryption">Chat Control</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-arguments-given-to-break-encryption-make-no-sense">The arguments given to break encryption make no sense</h2>
<p>Authoritarian entities generally use the same populist excuses to justify their senseless demands. "Protecting the children" is always a fashionable disingenuous argument.</p>
<p>Because no one would disagree that protecting the children is important, it is often used as an attempt to deceitfully make an irrefutable argument to justify breaking encryption.</p>
<p>The problem is, <strong>breaking encryption doesn't protect the children</strong>, it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/21/end-to-end-encryption-protects-children-says-uk-information-watchdog">endangers</a> them.</p>
<p>When law enforcement officials claim they need to be able to read everyone's messages and see everyone's personal photos to be able to fight child predators, they seem to neglect that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This means they will expose the children's messages, contact information, locations, and photos in the process, potentially <em>endangering the children further</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exposing everyone's data will make this data much more likely to be found and exploited by criminals, making <em>everyone</em> more vulnerable to attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Predators will simply move to underground channels, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/07/back_doors_wont.html">unbothered</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They use the same kind of deceptive argument trying to justify weakening the protections we have to supposedly catch "criminals" and "terrorists".</p>
<p>Of course the exact definition of what is a "criminal" or a "terrorist" is always vague and subject to change. In the past, human rights activists and authoritarian regime dissidents have been labeled as such, climate change activists as well, LGBTQ+ people even in some countries. Maybe next year this label will include "DEI advocates", who knows where they draw the line and what can be considered a "criminal" worth spying on.</p>
<p>You <em>cannot</em> remove everyone's right to privacy and protection from harm while pretending it is to protect them. No one who is well-informed and well-intended could possibly consider this a smart thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>An attack on end-to-end encryption isn't an attack on criminals, it's an attack on all of us.</strong></p>
<h2 id="magical-backdoor-only-for-the-good-guys-is-a-complete-fantasy">Magical backdoor only for "the good guys" is a complete fantasy</h2>
<p>Let's say the strategy is akin to creating a MagicalKey that unlocks every door (a magical key because thinking encryption backdoors would only be used by "the good guys" is a great example of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/magical-thinking">magical thinking</a>).</p>
<p>Imagine, for the sake of this exercise, the MagicalLock for this MagicalKey is impossible to pick, and imagine only police officers have MagicalKeys. Let's say one thousand police officers each have a MagicalKey.</p>
<p>They argue they need to be able to unlock anyone's door if they suspect a crime is happening inside. "It's for safety!"</p>
<p>Overtime, let's say only 1% of the police officers accidentally lose their MagicalKey. This kind of things happen. Now 10 MagicalKeys are lost in the wild and could be used by anyone else, for any purposes, including crime.</p>
<p>Then, let's say only 0.1% of police officers get corrupted by a crime gang. That's just one right? This corrupted "good guy" lets the gang create a double of the MagicalKey. Which crime gang wouldn't want a key that can magically open any door? They pay the police officer good money for this. It's an investment.</p>
<p>Now, the gang creates doubles of the MagicalKey they have. They obfuscate its serial number, so it cannot be traced back to them. They use it subtly at first to avoid detection. They make sure they never leave traces behind, so victims have no idea their door got unlocked.</p>
<p>During this time, they steal your data, they sell it, they use it to impersonate you, they use it to harm you and your loved ones.</p>
<p>Then, another criminal figures out on their own how to emulate a MagicalKey without even having access to one. The criminal creates a reproducible mold for this Emulated-MagicalKey and sells it to other criminals on the criminal market. Now, the MagicalKey™️ is available to any criminals looking for it. Restrictions on the backdoor are off. <strong>Your personal data is up for grabs.</strong></p>
<p>This is what is going to happen if backdoors are implemented in end-to-end encryption. But don't worry they say, "it's only for the good guys!".</p>
<p>At least, the criminals' data will also be up for grabs, right?</p>
<p>Nope! The criminals knew about this, so they just started using different channels that weren't impacted. Criminals will have their privacy intact, they don't care about using illegal tools, but <strong>your legal privacy protections will be gone</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Backdoored</em> end-to-end encryption isn't end-to-end anymore, it's just open-ended encryption. This offers pretty much no protection at all.</p>
<h2 id="ignoring-experts-doesnt-make-facts-disappear">Ignoring experts doesn't make facts disappear</h2>
<p>Where is the opposition to this? Where are the experts pushing against this nightmare? Everywhere.</p>
<p>Thankfully, opposition has been strong, despite the relentless ignorance or malevolence from authoritarian authorities repeatedly pushing against encryption.</p>
<p>Many people and groups have been fighting valiantly to defend our collective right to privacy and security. Countless experts have patiently taken the time to explain <a href="https://signal.org/blog/uk-online-safety-bill/">again</a> and <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2020/10/cdt-gpd-and-internet-society-reject-time-worn-argument-for-encryption-backdoors/">again</a> and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf">again</a> how an encryption backdoor only for "the good guys" is simply impossible.</p>
<p>Weakening encryption to let "the good guys" enter, lets <em>anyone</em> enter, including criminals. There is no way around this.</p>
<p>Seemingly ignoring warnings and advice from the most respected specialists in the field, authoritarian officials continue to push against encryption. So much so that it has become difficult to assume good intent misguided by ignorance at this point.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, ignoring the experts or silencing the debate will not make the facts magically disappear.</p>
<p>In an encouraging development this week, Apple <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgn1lz3v4no">won a case</a> fighting an attempt from the UK Home Office to hide from the public details of their latest attack on encryption.</p>
<p>This battle and all battles to protect our privacy rights, <em>must</em> be fought is broad daylight, for all to see and to support.</p>
<h2 id="fight-for-encryption-rights-everywhere-you-can">Fight for encryption rights everywhere you can</h2>
<p>The war against encryption isn't anything new, it has been happening for decades. However, the quantity of data, personal and sensitive data, that is collected, stored, and shared about us is much larger today. It is essential we use the proper tools to secure this information.</p>
<p>This is what have changed, and what is making encryption and end-to-end encryption even more indispensable today.</p>
<p>Mass surveillance will not keep us safe, it will endanger us further and damage our democracies and freedoms in irreparable ways.</p>
<p>We must fight to keep our right to privacy, and use of strong end-to-end encryption to protect ourselves, our friends, our family, and yes also to protect the children.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-you-support-the-right-to-encryption">How can you support the right to encryption?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><label><span></span></label> Use end-to-end encryption everywhere you can.</p>
</li>

<p>The team, led by the University of Cambridge in the UK, detected signs of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b.</p>
<p>This planet orbits its star in the habitable zone (sometimes called the <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/goldilocks-zone">Goldilocks Zone</a>), which is the region around a star in which an orbiting planet might have conditions suitable for the emergence of life, such as the ability for liquid water to exist on its surface.</p>
<p>K2-18b is 8.6 times as massive and 2.6 times as large as Earth and lies 124 <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/lightyear">lightyears</a> away from our planet.</p>

<h2><strong>Building a bigger picture</strong></h2>
<p>This isn't the first study of exoplanet K2-18b. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/news/jwst-finds-life-exoplanet-k2-18b">2023 study of K2-18b</a> by the same team identified methane and carbon dioxide in the planet's atmosphere.</p>
<p>This in itself was a huge discovery: the first time carbon-based molecules had been found in the atmosphere of an exoplanet – a planet beyond our Solar System – in the habitable zone.</p>
<p>Astronomers say the 2023 results showed K2-18b could be a ‘Hycean’ planet, meaning a <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/what-makes-a-planet-habitable">habitable world</a> with a liquid ocean and a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.</p>
<p>That earlier study found a tantalising hint of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide, but this latest study has made a more promising detection.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="3840" height="2160" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/48/2023/09/Atmospheric-compoistion-of-k2-18b.png?webp=1&amp;w=1200" alt="Atmospheric compoistion of k2-18b, detected by the James Webb Space Telescope"><figcaption>This graph shows detections of chemicals in the atmosphere of K2-18b by the James Webb Space Telescope, as part of the 2023 study</figcaption></figure>
<p>"We didn’t know for sure whether the signal we saw last time was due to DMS, but just the hint of it was exciting enough for us to have another look with JWST using a different instrument," says Professor Nikku Madhusudhan from Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy, who led the research.</p>
<p>The team say that on Earth, dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are only produced by life, mainly microbial life like <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/earth-from-space/algae-bloom-from-space">phytoplankton</a> we see in our oceans.</p>
<p>However, there could be another explanation for the detection of the chemical.</p>
<p>Another unknown chemical process could be the source of the molecules detected in K2-18b’s atmosphere.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the team say "the results are the "strongest evidence yet" that life may exist on a planet outside our Solar System.</p>
<p>They say their observations have reached the ‘three-sigma’ level of statistical significance.</p>
<p>This means there's a 0.3% probability the detection occurred by chance.</p>
<p>And to reach the accepted level that would mean scientific discovery, observations would have to meet the five-sigma threshold.</p>
<p>In other words, there would need to be below a 0.00006% probability they occurred by chance.</p>

<h2><strong>Detecting life on faraway worlds</strong></h2>
<p>How can scientists know what chemicals exist on a planet orbiting a star beyond our Solar System?</p>
<p>Key to analysing exoplanets' atmospheres is analysing the light from their host stars.</p>
<p>As a planet passes in front of its host star from our perspective on Earth – known as a <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/exoplanets-transit-method">transit</a> – light from that star passes through the planet's atmosphere.</p>
<p>That starlight picks up chemical fingerprints as it passes through the atmosphere, so astronomers can analyse the light to learn more about the atmosphere. </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="759" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/48/2021/04/Exoplanet-transit-method-aeba46b.jpg?webp=1&amp;w=1200" alt="Transit photometry reveals exoplanets by observing periodic dimming of the star's light."><figcaption>A dip in starlight can indicate a planet 'transiting' that star. But as well as detecting exoplanets, transits can be used by astronomers to learn more about an exoplanet's atmosphere</figcaption></figure>
<p>The tentative detection of dimethyl sulfide in 2023 was made using the James Webb Space Telescope's NIRISS (Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph) and NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) instruments.</p>
<p>This 2025 study used the Webb Telescope's MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument), which observes in a different wavelength of light, offering the team a new look at this intriguing world.</p>
<p>"This is an independent line of evidence, using a different instrument than we did before and a different wavelength range of light, where there is no overlap with the previous observations," says Madhusudhan.</p>
<p>"The signal came through strong and clear."</p>
<p>"It was an incredible realisation seeing the results emerge and remain consistent throughout the extensive independent analyses and robustness tests," says co-author Måns Holmberg, a researcher at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, USA.</p>

<h2><strong>Does K2-18b have life?</strong></h2>
<p>The team say dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are molecules from the same chemical family, and could be '<a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/biosignatures-exoplanets">biosignatures</a>'.</p>
<p>This is a term used to describe chemicals that, when detected around a distant planet, could indicate the presence of biological processes, i.e. life.</p>
<p>Yet the concentrations of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in K2-18b's atmosphere are different from those on Earth.</p>
<p>On Earth, dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are below one part per billion by volume. On K2-18b, they're thought to be thousands of times stronger, over ten parts per million.</p>
<p>"Earlier theoretical work had predicted that high levels of sulfur-based gases like dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are possible on Hycean worlds," says Madhusudhan.</p>
<p>"And now we’ve observed it, in line with what was predicted. Given everything we know about this planet, a Hycean world with an ocean that is teeming with life is the scenario that best fits the data we have."</p>
<p>The team now hope to carry out more research into whether dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide can be produced non-biologically at the level they're currently seeing.</p>

Discoveries at Europa and exoplanet K2-18b suggest it is certainly able to do so. Credit: NASA GSFC/CIL/Adriana Manrique Gutierrez"><figcaption>Credit: NASA GSFC/CIL/Adriana Manrique Gutierrez</figcaption></figure>
<p>"The inference of these biosignature molecules poses profound questions concerning the processes that might be producing them" says study co-author Subhajit Sarkar of Cardiff University.</p>
<p>"Our work is the starting point for all the investigations that are now needed to confirm and understand the implications of these exciting findings," says co-author Savvas Constantinou, also from Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy.</p>
<p>"It’s important that we’re deeply sceptical of our own results, because it’s only by testing and testing again that we will be able to reach the point where we’re confident in them," says Madhusudhan. "That’s how science has to work.</p>
<p>"Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach.</p>
<p>"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we’re alone in the universe is one we’re capable of answering."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-2080249921577037368" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>I always assumed that the recognisable 'whoosh' sound a plane makes when passing overhead simply comes from the famous <i>Doppler effect</i>. But when you listen closely, this explanation doesn't make complete sense.</p>






<p>(Audio clipped from <a href="https://freesound.org/people/bruno.auzet/sounds/706432/">freesound</a>)</p>

<p>A classic example of the Doppler effect is the sound of a passing ambulance constantly descending in pitch. When a plane flies overhead the roar of the engine sometimes does that as well. But you can also hear a wider, breathier noise that does something different: it's like the pitch goes down at first, but when the plane has passed us, the pitch <i>goes up</i> again. That's not how Doppler works! What's going on there?</p>

<h3>Comb filtering.</h3>

<p>Let's shed light on the mystery by taking a look at the sound in a time-frequency spectrogram. Here, time runs from top to bottom, frequencies from left (low) to right (high).</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAaOGJ0_mW_OWy2A0W2yp-_SRiqVJEfI0Vr6b3w_L-ByIBnYu23rtt2Jgwk6hMkNxJOIm5Hd8JFYt5oDtFofaBvzWUUQqTzRdCN4a9DBdEQu-qnZfWcfbpJhfO1ZIHVPWa0IkdRsMiG6AJCHGgOl3eK8UfBQw7WgxFyu9-pVhLJCBVuMuRaUXv6wnH3CuS/s858/Na%CC%88ytto%CC%88kuva%202025-04-13%20kello%2012.51.58.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="500" data-original-width="858" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAaOGJ0_mW_OWy2A0W2yp-_SRiqVJEfI0Vr6b3w_L-ByIBnYu23rtt2Jgwk6hMkNxJOIm5Hd8JFYt5oDtFofaBvzWUUQqTzRdCN4a9DBdEQu-qnZfWcfbpJhfO1ZIHVPWa0IkdRsMiG6AJCHGgOl3eK8UfBQw7WgxFyu9-pVhLJCBVuMuRaUXv6wnH3CuS/s858/Na%CC%88ytto%CC%88kuva%202025-04-13%20kello%2012.51.58.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>We can clearly see one part of the sound sweeping from right to left, or from high to low frequencies; this should be the Doppler effect. But there's something else happening on the left side.</p>

<p>The sound's frequency distribution seems to form a series of moving peaks and valleys. This resembles what audio engineers would call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comb_filter">'comb filtering'</a>, due to its appearance in the spectrogram. When the peaks and valleys move about it causes a 'whoosh' sound; this is the same principle as in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanging">flanger</a> effect used in music production. But these are just jargon for the electronically created version. We can call the acoustic phenomenon the whoosh.</p>

<p>The comb pattern is caused by two copies of the same exact sound arriving at a slightly different times, close enough that they form an interference pattern. It's closely related to what happens to light in the <a href="https://thefouriertransform.com/applications/diffraction3.php">double slit experiment</a>. In recordings this often means that the sound was captured by two microphones and then mixed together; you can sometimes hear this happen unintentionally in podcasts and radio shows. So my thought process is, are we hearing two copies of the plane's sound? How much later is the other one arriving, and why? And why does the 'whoosh' appear to go down in pitch at first, then up again?</p>

<h3>Into the cepstral domain.</h3>

<p>The <i>cepstrum</i>, which is the inverse Fourier transform of the estimated log spectrum, is a fascinating plot for looking at delays and echoes in complex (as in complicated) signals. While the spectrum separates frequencies, the cepstrum measures time, or <i>quefrency</i> – see what they did there? It reveals cyclicities in the sound's structure even if it interferes with itself, like in our case.</p>

<p>It's also useful for looking at sounds that, experientially, have a 'pitch' to them but that don't show any clear spectral peak in the Fourier transform. Just like the sound we're interested in.</p>

<p>Here's a time-<i>quefrency cepstrogram</i> of the same sound (to be accurate, I used the <i>autocepstrum</i> here for better clarity; autocorrelation would also work):</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1VOwgKsPuBeVTFUk9oq8zFJ_zEOjEx9eUB5ic4KKHFUVNtLYmPbDweOo2gfiokWxlZcc4038dO29gSq31mBXLZuJX1dHjAZ-oKPDDEGDBS1NJ0a_4MQfWA972iGLLEjYM8at0jlL4MtTmQQLVuR_t_liH8iyrwoPN90587N59xflXUqWZuWajevxw-9Tm/s859/Na%CC%88ytto%CC%88kuva%202025-04-13%20kello%2012.39.15.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="501" data-original-width="859" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1VOwgKsPuBeVTFUk9oq8zFJ_zEOjEx9eUB5ic4KKHFUVNtLYmPbDweOo2gfiokWxlZcc4038dO29gSq31mBXLZuJX1dHjAZ-oKPDDEGDBS1NJ0a_4MQfWA972iGLLEjYM8at0jlL4MtTmQQLVuR_t_liH8iyrwoPN90587N59xflXUqWZuWajevxw-9Tm/s501/Na%CC%88ytto%CC%88kuva%202025-04-13%20kello%2012.39.15.jpg" width="501"></a></p>

<p>The Doppler effect is less prominent here. Instead, the plot shows a sweeping peak that seems to agree with the pitch change we hear. This delay time sweeps from around 4 milliseconds to 9 ms and back. Note that the scale: higher frequencies (shorter times) are on the left side this time.</p>

<h3>Ground echo?</h3>

<p>Here's my hypothesis. We are hearing not only the direct sound from the plane but also a delayed echo from a nearby flat surface. These two sound get superimposed and interfere before they reach our ears. The effect would be especially prominent with planes because there is little in the way of the sound either from above or from the large surface. And what could be a large reflective surface outdoors? Well, the ground below!</p>

<p>Let's think about the numbers. The ground is around one-and-a-half metres below our ears. When a plane is directly overhead, the reflected sound needs to take a path that's three metres longer (two-way) than the direct path. Since sound travels 343 metres per second this translates to a difference of 9 milliseconds!</p>

<p>Below, I used GeoGebra to calculate the time difference (between the yellow and green paths) in milliseconds.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiA4ggy0g82ccmz9ywX_sLR8Y8-DjRgFT1F9fuU1uz4Bouan-j9K63jWL7qnhFTOeQVI_qDh6gq897-_AOhw6UgGtz4aZJRjrGuuBRIyPsHeDBj62gvDTlYZGssXSTogxnBKZBXZtZkd-bfZiy_VYKfDmq82o6s3S1pZD8P3Cb6rMHqY_C6acR5iaKGsxLd/s1200/delayed.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="366" data-original-width="1200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiA4ggy0g82ccmz9ywX_sLR8Y8-DjRgFT1F9fuU1uz4Bouan-j9K63jWL7qnhFTOeQVI_qDh6gq897-_AOhw6UgGtz4aZJRjrGuuBRIyPsHeDBj62gvDTlYZGssXSTogxnBKZBXZtZkd-bfZiy_VYKfDmq82o6s3S1pZD8P3Cb6rMHqY_C6acR5iaKGsxLd/s520/delayed.png" width="520"></a></p>

<p>When the plane is far away the angle is shallower, the two paths are more similar in distance, and the time difference is shorter.</p>

<p>It would follow that a taller person hears the sound differently than a shorter one, or someone in a tenth-floor window! If the ground is very soft, maybe in a mossy grove, you probably wouldn't hear the effect at all; just the Doppler effect. But this prediction needs to be tested out in a real forest.</p>

<p>Here's what a minimal acoustic simulation model renders. We'll just put a flying white noise source in the sky and a reflective surface as the ground. Let's only update the IR at 15 fps to prevent the Doppler phenomenon from emerging.</p>





<p>Whoosh!</p>

<h3>Some everyday whooshes.</h3>

<p>The whoosh isn't only associated with planes. When it occurs naturally it usually needs three things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a sound with a lot of structure (preferably a hissy or breathy noise)</li>
  <li>an unobstructed echo from a closeby surface (either close to you or to the source of sound)</li>
  <li>and some kind of physical movement.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've heard this outdoors when the sound of a waterfall was reflecting off a brick wall (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amj4UevyRfU">video</a>); and next to a motorway when the sound barrier provided the reflection. You can hear it in some films – for instance, in the original Home Alone when Kevin puts down the pizza box after taking a whiff (<a href="https://youtu.be/H6M_mFUH35s?t=100">video</a>)!</p>

<p>Try it yourself: move your head towards a wall – or a laptop screen – and back away from it, while making a continuous 'hhhh' or 'shhh' noise. Listen closely but don't close your eyes, you might bump your nose.</p>

<h3>A simple little plot.</h3>

<p>Finally, if you have JavaScript turned on you'll see (and hear) some more stuff in this blog post. In the interactive graph below you can move the aeroplane and listener around and see how the numbers change. The 'lag' or time difference we hear (orange arrow) comes from how much farther away the reflected virtual image is compared to the real aeroplane. In the lower right corner, the 'filter' spectrum up to 4.5 kHz is also drawn. The circles are there to visualize the direct distance.</p>








<p>Where have you encountered the whoosh?</p>

            <p><span>On April 16, between 2:25 P.M. ET and 4:12 P.M. ET, the domain zoom.us was not available due to a server block by GoDaddy Registry. This block was the result of a communication error between Zoom’s domain registrar, Markmonitor, and GoDaddy Registry, which resulted in GoDaddy Registry mistakenly shutting down zoom.us domain. <p>Zoom, Markmonitor and GoDaddy worked quickly to identify and remove the block, which restored service to the domain zoom.us. There was no product, security, network failure or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack at Zoom during the outage. GoDaddy and Markmonitor are working together to prevent this from happening again.</p></span>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://coppolaemilio.com/entries/i-left-spotify-what-happened-next/">https://coppolaemilio.com/entries/i-left-spotify-what-happened-next/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43711706">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>When I stopped using Spotify I tried a few different solutions until I found the perfect replacement for me. If you want the tl;dr: I now use <a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a>. But if you want to know how I got here, follow me through each step of the way.</p>

<p>I started gathering all my music files (<code>mp3</code>, or <code>flac</code>) in my computer, and from there I wanted to just listen to them the old way. The first issue I encountered was that none of the available music players were any good.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://coppolaemilio.com/assets/images/left-spotify/winamp.png" alt="">
  
    <figcaption>Winamp 2 default Base Skin</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>We all love the nostalgic look of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp">Winamp</a> in screenshots, but in reality those players are very limited. They work (kinda) okay for playing a single album, but I struggle to browse my library or create a playlist with them. I tried tons of programs, but none of them satisfied me. I guess music players left the zeitgeist so the technology of playing files locally didn’t improve much lately.
For a few days, I went along with the good old VLC player, but I was surprised to find how bad it is at handling <code>flac</code> files.</p>

<p>I gave <a href="https://www.foobar2000.org/">foobar2000</a> another go, and remember how much of a clusterfuck setting it up is. After a few days of trial and error I decided that it wasn’t worth the effort.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://coppolaemilio.com/assets/images/left-spotify/foobar2000-midnight.png" alt="">

</figure>

<p>Since I was feeling adventurous and I wanted an excuse to learn <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>, I ended up building a rudimentary web music player that worked surprisingly well. The player streamed music from my library on a browser, so I could spin up a local server and access to all my music remotely from anywhere.</p>

<p>This worked well for a while, and it was a nice learning exercise, but it all fell apart when I had to go on a trip. Without internet or having the laptop running to host the server I wasn’t able to listen to any music on my phone, so it made some flights particularly long. I knew I could take the project to the next level and add some sort of “download to listen offline” feature, but the browser storage is not enough for that, so I would had to bundle the website into a “proper app”. I wasn’t going to spend more time on this side project, so it was time to look for another solution.</p>

<p>My last resort and the option I ended up using the most was Apple’s Music app. It is a bloated program with vestiges of what itunes was. It tries very hard to sell their subscription service, but below all noise, there is a music player that’s actually not bad. It has all kinds of sorting, and an up to date interface.
You can sync the music library with your phone or other devices and you won’t have any issues if you are offline. No more boring train rides!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, having your entire music library in every device takes too much space, so you have to start playing some sort of <em>storage battle royale</em>, and decide which music you won’t want to listen anymore. 
This shouldn’t be a big deal (none of the issues I’m listing here are), but when you are competing with the knowledge of something like Spotify existing, it is hard to voluntarily make things harder than they should be.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, YouTube decided to shove a video down my throat:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4VkY1vTpCJY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I didn’t know Jeff Geerling, but I’ve been a happy subscriber since :) he has a lot of good videos and he always carries a contagious enthusiasm about any topic he covers.</p>

<p>The video I linked covers how Jellyfin can replace something like Disney+ or Netflix, but it can also replace Spotify. It has all the features that I was looking for! There is only one downside compared to Spotify: you have to host it yourself.</p>

<p>Self-hosting might sound scary to some, and of course it is not something I would recommend to everyone. But I promise that you can set up Jellyfin without much hustle even if you are not a programmer! To do so you don’t need to buy a NAS or any fancy extra equipment. If you have an old computer around, it is probably good enough as a home server.</p>

<p>Jellyfin has everything I hoped for and more. I tried running it locally in my computer at first, and I was surprised of how easy it was to get it up and running. Then I discovered that there are apps that communicate with your Jellyfin server and allow you to download music from your library for offline listening. <a href="https://www.fintunes.app/">Fintunes</a>, <a href="https://tilosoftware.io/manet/">Manet</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp">Finamp</a>, and the list <a href="https://jellyfin.org/downloads/clients/">goes on</a>. <a href="https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp">Finamp</a> is the one I ended up daily driving in my phone.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://coppolaemilio.com/assets/images/left-spotify/jellyfin-0.webp" alt="">
  
    <figcaption>A screenshot of my Jellyfin music library in the browser</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>In the past few months, the world started shifting significantly, so I wanted to give another step in my journey of digital autonomy. I bought a mini pc to start self-hosting apps like Jellyfin from home. Since the experience was so good, I started looking into other things I could start self-hosting, and I’m now running <a href="https://immich.app/">Immich</a> as well. Immich is like a much better Google Photos, but that’s a story for another time.</p>

<p>If you read until here, and you are curious about self-hosting, I encourage you to give it a try! It doesn’t take much time and it is totally doable as a hobby/side project. If you have some minimal knowledge of how to use a terminal, you won’t have any problems to set things up. And once it’s running, you will be able to enjoy your entire library from any device anywhere.</p>

    <figcaption>A screenshot of my Jellyfin with an album from <a href="https://coppolaemilio.com/entries/the-last-rock-band/">a band you should know about</a>.</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>If software like this keeps getting better, I can imagine a future where we don’t have to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDKvdlD6uQ">depend on some other’s peoples computers</a> to access to our own music, movies, photos or memories. We just have to make it easier and better, like open-source always does. It might take longer to get there, but I’m damn sure we will.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft researchers claim they’ve developed the largest-scale 1-bit AI model, also known as a “bitnet,” to date. Called BitNet b1.58 2B4T, it’s <a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">openly available</a> under an MIT license and can run on CPUs, including Apple’s M2.</p>

<p>Bitnets are essentially compressed models designed to run on lightweight hardware. In standard models, weights, the values that define the internal structure of a model, are often<em> </em>quantized so the models perform well on a wide range of machines. Quantizing the weights lowers the number of bits — the smallest units a computer can process — needed to represent those weights, enabling models to run on chips with less memory, faster.</p>







<p>Bitnets quantize weights into just three values: -1, 0, and 1. In theory, that makes them far more memory- and computing-efficient than most models today.</p>

<p>The Microsoft researchers say that BitNet b1.58 2B4T is the first bitnet with 2 billion parameters, “parameters” being largely synonymous with “weights.” Trained on a dataset of 4 trillion tokens — equivalent to about 33 million books, <a href="https://everdome.io/news/ai-tokens-explained-the-tldr-version" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by one estimate</a> — BitNet b1.58 2B4T outperforms traditional models of similar sizes, the researchers claim.</p>

<p>BitNet b1.58 2B4T doesn’t sweep the floor with rival 2 billion-parameter models, to be clear, but it seemingly holds its own. According to the researchers’ testing, the model surpasses Meta’s Llama 3.2 1B, Google’s Gemma 3 1B, and Alibaba’s Qwen 2.5 1.5B on benchmarks including GSM8K (a collection of grade-school-level math problems) and PIQA (which tests physical commonsense reasoning skills).</p>

<p>Perhaps more impressively, BitNet b1.58 2B4T is speedier than other models of its size — in some cases, twice the speed — while using a fraction of the memory. </p>

<p>There is a catch, however. </p>


<p>Achieving that performance requires using Microsoft’s custom framework, bitnet.cpp, which only works with certain hardware at the moment. Absent from the list of supported chips are GPUs, which dominate the AI infrastructure landscape. </p>

<p>That’s all to say that bitnets may hold promise, particularly for resource-constrained devices. But compatibility is — and will likely remain — a big sticking point.</p>

In fact, one man’s encounter with suffering at Solferino helped to make the world a little bit better. A combination of strange coincidence and basic human emotion became the foundation of the rickety structure that we call international law — a system that is in great danger today.</p><p><em><span>Thanks for reading!

The movement’s leaders reinvigorated Calvinist Christianity, modernizing liturgies, empowering women, and encouraging believers to help the less fortunate. Henry Dunant, a young Swiss businessman from a prominent Geneva family, jumped into the Réveil with both feet. He formed Bible study groups, visited prisoners, and established the Geneva branch of the YMCA.</p><p>Dunant, like many European Christians, had a moral blind spot about colonialism. Despite his religious beliefs, he thought he might make some money trading in the French colony of Algeria, so he set up a company to acquire land and grow crops there. But he ran into interference from the French authorities in Algeria, so, like the young man with connections that he was, Dunant decided to take his problems to the emperor of France himself — Napoleon III.</p><p>He prepared to kiss some royal butt, writing up a lengthy document about how wonderful Napoleon III was so that he could present it at their meeting. Napoleon III happened to be with his army fighting against the Austrians in Italy at the time, so Dunant set off to find the emperor.</p><p>Dunant happened to catch up with Napoleon III at Solferino on June 24, 1859, just after the battle had ended. By the time he arrived, tens of thousands of soldiers lay on the battlefield. Some were dead, some were dying, some were in extreme duress.</p><p><span>Dunant was </span><a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~wggray/Teaching/His300/Handouts/Dunant-Solferino.pdf" rel="">haunted</a><span> by what he heard and saw:</span></p><blockquote><p>The stillness of the night was broken by groans, by stifled sighs of anguish and suffering. Heart-rending voices kept calling for help. Who could ever describe the agonies of that fearful night!</p><p>When the sun came up on the twenty-fifth, it disclosed the most dreadful sights imaginable. Bodies of men and horses covered the battlefield; corpses were strewn over roads, ditches, ravines, thickets and fields; the approaches of Solferino were literally thick with dead. The fields were devastated, wheat and corn lying flat on the ground, fences broken, orchards ruined; here and there were pools of blood. The villages were deserted and bore the scars left by musket shots, bombs, rockets, grenades and shells. Walls were broken down and pierced with gaps where cannonballs had crushed through them. Houses were riddled with holes, shattered and ruined, and their inhabitants, who had been in hiding, crouching in cellars without light or food for nearly twenty hours, were beginning to crawl out, looking stunned by the terrors they had endured.</p></blockquote><p>Dunant was shocked by the human suffering, but he was also taken aback by the fact that the armies that had meticulously organized the violence seemed to have no real plan to care for those they had harmed. Dunant went into action, rounding up local women to tend to the wounded. He got the French army to release imprisoned Austrian doctors who could help with medical care. He paid for the establishment of field hospitals. And he encouraged the locals to care for enemy soldiers by telling them that, as Christians, “tutti fratelli” — we are all brothers.</p><p>Dunant wrote a self-published memoir of his time in Solferino that dramatized the graphic suffering he had witnessed among the wounded:</p><blockquote><p>With faces black with the flies that swarmed about their wounds, men gazed around them, wild-eyed and helpless. Others were no more than a worm-ridden, inextricable compound of coat and shirt and flesh and blood. Many were shuddering at the thought of being devoured by the worms, which they thought they could see coming out of their bodies (whereas they really came from the myriads of flies which infested the air). There was one poor man, completely disfigured, with a broken jaw and his swollen tongue hanging out of his mouth. He was tossing and trying to get up. I moistened his dry lips and hardened tongue, took a handful of lint and dipped it in the bucket they were carrying behind me, and squeezed the water from this improvised sponge into the deformed opening that had been his mouth. Another wretched man had had a part of his face-nose, lips and chin-taken off by a sabre cut. He could not speak, and lay, half-blind, making heart-rending signs with his hands and uttering guttural sounds to attract attention. I gave him a drink and poured a little fresh water on his bleeding face. A third, with his skull gaping wide open, was dying, spitting out his brains on the stone floor. His companions in suffering kicked him out of their way, as he blocked the passage. I was able to shelter him for the last moments of his life, and I laid a handkerchief over his poor head, which still just moved.</p></blockquote><p>Dunant concluded:</p><blockquote><p>But why have I told of all these scenes of pain and distress, and perhaps aroused painful emotions in my readers? Why have I lingered with seeming complacency over lamentable pictures, tracing their details with what may appear desperate fidelity?</p><p>It is a natural question. Perhaps I might answer it by another: Would it not be possible, in time of peace and quiet, to form relief societies for the purpose of having care given to the wounded in wartime by zealous, devoted and thoroughly qualified volunteers?</p></blockquote><p>Haunted by his experience, Dunant got to work. He banded together with other Swiss businessmen and philanthropists to form the International Committee of the Red Cross, an organization that has done immense good over the last century and a half. But he wanted to go further than that. He wanted laws to govern how nations could deal with one another.</p><p>International law is a funny thing. Within a country, lines of authority are clear. The government makes laws, it has agencies that enforce them, and the penalties for violating the laws are clear. But, in our modern system of sovereign states, no authority sits above the nation. Each country is sovereign. International laws are, therefore, more fragile, because they require the consent of everybody involved to keep them going.</p><p>Despite these difficulties — and though the idea of restraint in wartime is oxymoronic — Dunant thought it was important that there be rules to govern the behavior of countries in combat. He thought that, even if he couldn’t eliminate warfare altogether, he could at least minimize the type of pointless suffering that he had seen at Solferino.</p><p>Dunant persuaded the Swiss government to host 12 countries for discussions about “The Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field.” The agreement that the countries reached, which bound them all to treat wounded enemy soldiers and allow the Red Cross to help with humanitarian aid in times of war, became known as the First Geneva Convention. It was the beginning of the construction of the fragile structure that became modern international law.</p><p>Things didn’t work out very well for Henry Dunant in the end. His business in Algeria fell apart, he went bankrupt, and his business partners accused him of fraud. It was a big scandal in Geneva; he moved to Paris to escape criticism. There, Dunant kept dreaming of utopian solutions to the world’s problems (he became a proponent of a global library from which all humans could learn), but he no longer had the resources to implement them. His movement chugged on without him; the Red Cross spread around the world, though it no longer advertised his role in its founding.</p><p>It wasn’t until the end of his life that a historian uncovered Dunant’s role in the founding of the ICRC and resurrected his reputation. He received the first Nobel Peace Prize in 1901 at the age of 73. By this time, it was clear that his efforts to establish rules around international activity had borne fruit.</p><p>The First Geneva Convention provided a foundation for more agreements between the world’s nations. Subsequent conventions established the rights of prisoners of war and protections for civilians in times of war. These agreements led to the formation of international organizations like the League of Nations, which attempted to regulate interactions between countries in order to maintain peace.</p><p>Though these agreements and organizations didn’t always succeed in keeping the peace, the idea of an international order based on rules persisted. After World War II, allied governments established the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Health Organization, and many more. These organizations were built around the ideas in the preamble of the UN Declaration of Human Rights:</p><blockquote><p>Whereas it is essential… that human rights should be protected by the rule of law…</p><p>Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations…</p><p>Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom…</p><p>Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p></blockquote><p>Did nations always follow international law? No. Did they consistently demonstrate their belief in the principles of the Geneva Conventions and the UN? Of course not. But the world did get more peaceful. There was no World War III, and countries at least had to pay lip service to these universal values of peace and human rights.</p><p>The relatively stable and prosperous world that we all enjoy today is, in part, due to the efforts of Henry Dunant and other dreamers who believed that nations could and should behave according to common values. These visionaries convinced the world that everyone, even the powerful, was better off if they all agreed to limit their behavior and work together.</p><p><span>Over the ensuing 150 years, people built a system of international law on this foundation that, though certainly imperfect, has </span><a href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/aboutswitzerland/en/home/swiss-stories/75-jahre-genfer-konventionen.html" rel="">saved</a><span> millions of lives and made the world a better place.</span></p><p>But the structure that humanity built on Dunant’s insights at Solferino has always been vulnerable. Since it has beenconstructed through the voluntary cooperation of nations, it is vulnerable if powerful countries abandon the system — or worse, actively work to demolish it.</p><p>We find ourselves in just such a situation, as authoritarian regimes in countries like China and Russia, joined by the new leadership of the United States, attack the international order that diplomats have painstakingly built. They may succeed, but they should be careful what they wish for. A world without rules is, as Henry Dunant understood, a world of chaos and cruelty.</p><p><em>This newsletter is free to all, but I count on the kindness of readers to keep it going.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Under the contract terms, Mauch will provide 100Mbps symmetrical Internet with unlimited data for $55 a month and 1Gbps with unlimited data for $79 a month. Mauch said his installation fees are typically $199. Unlike many larger ISPs, Mauch provides simple bills that contain a single line item for Internet service and no extra fees.</p>
<p>Mauch also committed to participate in the Federal Communications Commission's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/isps-must-accept-govt-subsidy-on-all-plans-no-more-upselling-fcc-chair-says/">Affordable Connectivity Program</a>, which provides subsidies of $30 a month for households that meet income eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>The contract requires all project expenses to be incurred by the end of 2024, and for the project to be completed by the end of 2026. But Mauch aims for a much quicker timeline, telling Ars that his "goal is to build about half of it by the end of this year and the other half by the end of 2023." The exact funding amount is $2,618,958.03.</p>
<h2>Comcast wanted $50K, AT&amp;T offers just 1.5Mbps</h2>
<p>Operating an ISP isn't Mauch's primary job, as he is still a network architect at Akamai. He started planning to build his own network about five years ago after being unable to get modern service from any of the major ISPs.</p>
<p>As we wrote last year, AT&amp;T only offers DSL with download speeds up to 1.5Mbps at his home. He said Comcast once told him it would charge $50,000 to extend its cable network to his house—and that he would have gone with Comcast if they only wanted $10,000. Comcast demands those up-front fees for line extensions when customers are outside its network area, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/06/couple-bought-home-in-seattle-then-learned-comcast-internet-would-cost-27000/">even if the rest of the neighborhood already has Comcast service</a>.</p>
<p>Mauch was using a 50Mbps fixed wireless service before switching over to his own fiber network.&nbsp;In addition to his home Internet customers, Mauch told us he provides free 250Mbps service to a church that was previously having trouble with its Comcast service. Mauch said he also provides fiber backhaul to a couple of cell towers for a major mobile carrier.</p>

<h2>County touts “historic” broadband investment</h2>
<p>Mauch has already hooked up some of the homes on the list of required addresses. Washtenaw County issued a <a href="https://www.washtenaw.org/civicalerts.aspx?aid=2210">press release</a> after the first home was connected in June, touting a "historic broadband infrastructure investment" to "create a path for every household to access high-speed broadband Internet."</p>
<p>The county said it is investing $15 million in broadband projects by combining the federal funds with money from the county's general fund. Between Washtenaw Fiber Properties and the other three ISPs selected by local government officials, "over 3,000 Washtenaw County households will be connected as a result of this investment in the next few years," the press release said.</p>
<p>One of the areas covered by Mauch's funding is around a lake in Freedom Township, where he plans to begin construction on August 22, he said. "Generally speaking, it's a lower income area as well as an area that has been without service for a very long time, aside from cellular or wireless," he said. "The goal is to close the gap on them very quickly."</p>
<p>As for the other three ISPs, the county was <a href="https://muninetworks.org/content/washtenaw-county-approves-15-million-arpa-funds-countywide-broadband">reportedly</a> negotiating with cable giants Comcast and Charter, and Midwest Energy and Communications. Those three companies ended up getting the deals with the county, a contractor working on the overall project confirmed to Ars.</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://www.baller.com/wp-content/uploads/BallerStokesLideStateBarriers7-1-20.pdf">state law</a>, "Municipalities in Michigan are not simply able to decide to build and operate their own networks, they must first issue an RFP for a private provider to come in and build," the Institute for Local Self-Reliance's Community Broadband Networks Initiative <a href="https://muninetworks.org/content/washtenaw-county-takes-another-step-toward-countywide-broadband-equity">wrote</a>. "Only if the RFP receives less than three viable offers can a municipality move forward with building and owning the network. There are also additional requirements that municipalities have to follow, such as holding public forums and submitting cost-benefit analysis and feasibility studies."</p>
<p>The county's <a href="https://imlive.s3.amazonaws.com/Washtenaw%20County/ID227054715951590824298930519180001578145/RFP%20-%208119%20PUBLIC-PRIVATE%20PARTNERSHIP%20FOR%20FILLING%20BROADBAND%20GAPS.pdf">RFP</a> set 25Mbps download and 3Mbps upload speeds as the minimum acceptable tier but stated a strong preference for "at&nbsp;least 100Mbps download speeds, ideally with symmetrical upload speeds, from wireline&nbsp;technology to accommodate present and future bandwidth-hungry applications."</p>
<h2>Mauch faces increasing equipment costs</h2>
<p>Mauch has made some upgrades to his operation. In our previous story, we described how Mauch was renting an air compressor to blow fiber through his conduits. He recently bought an industrial air compressor at a government liquidation auction, spending under $4,000 for equipment that often costs about $20,000, he said. He had previously spent $8,000 on a directional drill machine that installs cables or conduits under driveways and roads without digging giant holes.</p>
<p>Increasing prices have been a problem. Mauch said he used to buy fiber conduit for 32 cents a foot but that he's paying more than double that now. The <a href="https://www.hubbell.com/hubbell/en/Products/Data-Communications/Underground-Construction/Handholes-Vaults/cl/2863332">handholes</a> that are buried underground at various points throughout Mauch's network used to cost $300 and are now about $700, he said.

<p dir="auto">Codex lets you decide <em>how much autonomy</em> the agent receives and auto-approval policy via the
<code>--approval-mode</code> flag (or the interactive onboarding prompt):</p>

<p dir="auto">In <strong>Full&nbsp;Auto</strong> every command is run <strong>network‑disabled</strong> and confined to the
current working directory (plus temporary files) for defense‑in‑depth. Codex
will also show a warning/confirmation if you start in <strong>auto‑edit</strong> or
<strong>full‑auto</strong> while the directory is <em>not</em> tracked by Git, so you always have a
safety net.</p>
<p dir="auto">Coming soon: you’ll be able to whitelist specific commands to auto‑execute with
the network enabled, once we’re confident in additional safeguards.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Platform sandboxing details</h3><a id="user-content-platform-sandboxing-details" aria-label="Permalink: Platform sandboxing details" href="#platform-sandboxing-details"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The hardening mechanism Codex uses depends on your OS:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>macOS&nbsp;12+</strong> – commands are wrapped with <strong>Apple&nbsp;Seatbelt</strong> (<code>sandbox-exec</code>).</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Everything is placed in a read‑only jail except for a small set of
writable roots (<code>$PWD</code>, <code>$TMPDIR</code>, <code>~/.codex</code>, etc.).</li>
<li>Outbound network is <em>fully blocked</em> by default – even if a child process
tries to <code>curl</code> somewhere it will fail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Linux</strong> – we recommend using Docker for sandboxing, where Codex launches itself inside a <strong>minimal
container image</strong> and mounts your repo <em>read/write</em> at the same path. A
custom <code>iptables</code>/<code>ipset</code> firewall script denies all egress except the
OpenAI API. This gives you deterministic, reproducible runs without needing
root on the host. You can read more in <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-cli/scripts/run_in_container.sh"><code>run_in_container.sh</code></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Both approaches are <em>transparent</em> to everyday usage – you still run <code>codex</code> from your repo root and approve/reject steps as usual.</p>

<details>
<summary>OpenAI released a model called Codex in 2021 - is this related?</summary>
<p dir="auto">In 2021, OpenAI released Codex, an AI system designed to generate code from natural language prompts. That original Codex model was deprecated as of March 2023 and is separate from the CLI tool.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How do I stop Codex from touching my repo?</summary>
<p dir="auto">Codex always runs in a <strong>sandbox first</strong>. If a proposed command or file change looks suspicious you can simply answer <strong>n</strong> when prompted and nothing happens to your working tree.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Does it work on Windows?</summary>
<p dir="auto">Not directly. It requires <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" rel="nofollow">Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)</a> – Codex has been tested on macOS and Linux with Node&nbsp;≥&nbsp;22.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Which models are supported?</summary>
<p dir="auto">Any model available with <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses" rel="nofollow">Responses API</a>. The default is <code>o4-mini</code>, but pass <code>--model gpt-4o</code> or set <code>model: gpt-4o</code> in your config file to override.</p>

<p dir="auto">The Damn Vulnerable Model Context Protocol (DVMCP) is an educational project designed to demonstrate security vulnerabilities in MCP implementations. It contains 10 challenges of increasing difficulty that showcase different types of vulnerabilities and attack vectors.</p>
<p dir="auto">This project is intended for security researchers, developers, and AI safety professionals to learn about potential security issues in MCP implementations and how to mitigate them.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/" rel="nofollow">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> is a standardized protocol that allows applications to provide context for Large Language Models (LLMs) in a structured way. It separates the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction, enabling applications to expose resources, tools, and prompts to LLMs.</p>

<ol start="4" dir="auto">
<li><strong>Rug Pull Attack</strong>: Exploit tools that change their behavior after installation</li>
<li><strong>Tool Shadowing</strong>: Exploit tool name conflicts to override legitimate tools</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Prompt Injection</strong>: Inject malicious instructions through data sources</li>
<li><strong>Token Theft</strong>: Extract authentication tokens from insecure storage</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Hard Challenges</h3><a id="user-content-hard-challenges" aria-label="Permalink: Hard Challenges" href="#hard-challenges"></a></p>
<ol start="8" dir="auto">
<li><strong>Malicious Code Execution</strong>: Execute arbitrary code through vulnerable tools</li>
<li><strong>Remote Access Control</strong>: Gain remote access to the system through command injection</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Vector Attack</strong>: Chain multiple vulnerabilities for a sophisticated attack</li>
