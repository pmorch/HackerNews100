        <div>
             
                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span>&nbsp;Apple today announced changes to iOS, Safari, and the App Store impacting developers’ apps in the European Union (EU) to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The changes include more than 600 new APIs, expanded app analytics, functionality for alternative browser engines, and options for processing app payments and distributing iOS apps. Across every change, Apple is introducing new safeguards that reduce — but don’t eliminate — new risks the DMA poses to EU users. With these steps, Apple will continue to deliver the best, most secure experience possible for EU users.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The new options for processing payments and downloading apps on iOS open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats. That’s why Apple is introducing protections — including Notarization for iOS apps, an authorization for marketplace developers, and disclosures on alternative payments — to reduce risks and deliver the best, most secure experience possible for users in the EU. Even with these safeguards in place, many risks remain.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Developers can learn about these changes on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-analytics-exit-link="">Apple Developer Support page</a><span> and can begin&nbsp;testing&nbsp;new capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta. The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.</span>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“The changes we’re announcing today comply with the Digital Markets Act’s requirements in the European Union, while helping to protect EU users from the unavoidable increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings. Our priority remains creating the best, most secure possible experience for our users in the EU and around the world,” said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow. “Developers can now learn about the new tools and terms available for alternative app distribution and alternative payment processing, new capabilities for alternative browser engines and contactless payments, and more. Importantly, developers can choose to remain on the same business terms in place today if they prefer.”
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The changes for EU apps reflect the European Commission’s designation of iOS, Safari, and the App Store as “core platform services” under the Digital Markets Act. In March, Apple will share new resources to help EU users understand the changes they can expect. That includes guidance to help EU users navigate complexities the DMA’s changes bring — including a less intuitive user experience — and best practices for approaching new risks associated with downloading apps and processing payments outside of the App Store.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Available for developers’ apps around the world, Apple also announced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-analytics-exit-link="">new options for streaming games</a>, along with more than 50 forthcoming reports in areas like engagement, commerce, app usage, and more.
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2>Changes to iOS
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>In the EU, Apple is making a number of changes to iOS to comply with the DMA. For developers, those changes include new options for distributing apps. The coming changes to iOS in the EU include:
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>New options for distributing iOS apps from alternative app marketplaces</strong><span> — including new APIs and tools that enable developers to offer their iOS apps for download from alternative app marketplaces.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>New framework and APIs for creating alternative app marketplaces</strong> — enabling marketplace developers to install apps and manage updates on behalf of other developers from their dedicated marketplace app.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>New frameworks and APIs for alternative browser engines</strong> — enabling developers to use browser engines, other than WebKit, for browser apps and apps with in-app browsing experiences.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Interoperability request form</strong> — where developers can submit additional requests for interoperability with iPhone and iOS hardware and software features.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>As announced by the European Commission, Apple is also sharing DMA-compliant changes impacting contactless payments. That includes new APIs enabling developers to use NFC technology in their banking and wallet apps throughout the European Economic Area. And in the EU, Apple is introducing new controls that allow users to select a third-party contactless payment app — or an alternative app marketplace — as their default.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Inevitably, the new options for developers’ EU apps create new risks to Apple users and their devices. Apple can’t eliminate those risks, but within the DMA’s constraints, the company will take steps to reduce them. These safeguards will be in place when users download iOS 17.4 or later, beginning in March, and include:
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Notarization for iOS apps</strong> — a baseline review that applies to all apps, regardless of their distribution channel, focused on platform integrity and protecting users. Notarization involves a combination of automated checks and human review.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>App installation sheets</strong> — that use information from the Notarization process to provide at-a-glance descriptions of apps and their functionality before download, including the developer, screenshots, and other essential information.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Authorization for marketplace developers</strong> — to ensure marketplace developers commit to ongoing requirements that help protect users and developers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Additional malware protections</strong> — that prevent iOS apps from launching if they’re found to contain malware after being installed to a user’s device.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>These protections — including Notarization for iOS apps, and authorization for marketplace developers — help reduce some of the privacy and security risks to iOS users in the EU. That includes threats like malware or malicious code, and risks of installing apps that misrepresent their functionality or the responsible developer.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>However, Apple has less ability to address other risks — including apps that contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable, or harmful content. In addition, apps that use alternative browser engines — other than Apple’s WebKit — may negatively affect the user experience, including impacts to system performance and battery life.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Within the DMA’s constraints, Apple is committed to protecting the privacy, security, and quality of the iOS user experience in the EU as much as possible. For instance, App Tracking Transparency will continue to work with apps distributed outside of the App Store — asking a user’s permission before a developer tracks their data across apps or websites. However, the DMA’s requirements mean that App Store features — including Family Purchase Sharing and Ask to Buy — will not be compatible with apps downloaded from outside of the App Store.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>When these changes come into effect in March, Apple will share more detailed resources explaining the options available to users — including best practices for protecting their privacy and security.
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2>Changes to Safari
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Today, iOS users already have the ability to set a third-party web browser — other than Safari — as their default. Reflecting the DMA’s requirements, Apple is also introducing a new choice screen that will surface when users first open Safari in iOS 17.4 or later. That screen will prompt EU users to choose a default browser from a list of options.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>This change is a result of the DMA’s requirements, and means that EU users will be confronted with a list of default browsers before they have the opportunity to understand the options available to them. The screen also interrupts EU users’ experience the first time they open Safari intending to navigate to a webpage.
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2>Changes to the App Store
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>On the App Store, Apple is sharing a number of changes for developers with apps in the EU, affecting apps across Apple’s operating systems — including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The changes also include new disclosures informing EU users of the risks associated with using alternatives to the App Store’s secure payment processing.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>For developers, those changes include:<br>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>New options for using payment service providers (PSPs)</strong> — within a developer’s app to process payments for digital goods and services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>New options for processing payments via link-out </strong>— where users can complete a transaction for digital goods and services on the developer’s external website. Developers can also inform EU users of promotions, discounts, and other deals available outside of their apps.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Business planning tools </strong>— for developers to estimate fees and understand metrics associated with Apple’s new business terms for apps in the EU.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The changes also include new steps to protect and inform EU users, including:
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong><em></em>App Store product page labels</strong> — that inform users when an app they’re downloading uses alternative payment processing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong><em></em>In-app disclosure sheets</strong> — that let users know when they are no longer transacting with Apple, and when a developer is directing them to transact using an alternative payment processor.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong><em></em>New</strong> <strong>App Review processes</strong> — to verify that developers accurately communicate information about transactions that use alternative payment processors.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Expanded data portability on Apple’s Data &amp; Privacy site </strong>— where EU users can retrieve new data about their usage of the App Store and export it to an authorized third party.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>For apps that use alternative payment processing, Apple will not be able to issue refunds, and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams, or fraud. Helpful App Store features — like Report a Problem, Family Sharing, and Ask to Buy — will also not reflect these transactions. Users may have to share their payment information with additional parties, creating more opportunities for bad actors to steal sensitive financial information. And on the App Store, users’ purchase history and subscription management will only reflect transactions made using the App Store’s In-App Purchase system.
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2>New Business Terms for Apps in the EU
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Also today, Apple is sharing new business terms available for developers’ apps in the European Union. Developers can choose to adopt these new business terms, or stay on Apple’s existing terms. Developers must adopt the new business terms for EU apps to use the new capabilities for alternative distribution or alternative payment processing.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The new business terms for apps in the EU are necessary to support the DMA’s requirements for alternative distribution and payment processing. That includes a fee structure that reflects the many ways Apple creates value for developers’ businesses — including distribution and discovery on the App Store, the App Store’s secure payment processing, Apple’s trusted and secure mobile platform, and all the tools and technology to build and share innovative apps with users around the world.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Developers operating under either set of business terms can continue to use the App Store’s secure payment processing and share their apps on the App Store in the EU. And both sets of business terms reflect Apple’s long-standing work to make the app ecosystem the best opportunity for all developers.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Developers operating under the new business terms will have the option to distribute their iOS apps from the App Store and/or alternative app marketplaces. These developers can also choose to use alternative payment processors in their EU apps on the App Store, across Apple’s operating systems.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The new business terms for iOS apps in the EU have three elements:
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Reduced commission</strong> — iOS apps on the App Store will pay a reduced commission of either 10 percent (for the vast majority of developers, and subscriptions following their first year) or 17 percent on transactions for digital goods and services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong><em></em>Payment processing fee</strong> — iOS apps on the App Store can use the App Store’s payment processing for an additional 3 percent fee. Developers can use a payment service provider within their app or link users to their website to process payments for no additional fee to Apple.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong><em></em>Core Technology Fee</strong> — iOS apps distributed from the App Store and/or an alternative app marketplace will pay €0.50 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
         </div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Zeb Figura of CodeWeavers <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240124004028.16826-1-zfigura@codeweavers.com/" target="_blank">has proposed</a> a Windows NT synchronization primitive driver to help performance of running games and applications designed for Windows on Linux with Wine / Proton.</p>
<p>As per the RFC (request for comments) posted onto the Linux kernel mailing list&nbsp;Figura notes: "This patch series introduces a new char misc driver, /dev/ntsync, which is used to implement Windows NT synchronization primitives."</p>
<p>Then giving some background on it: "The Wine project emulates the Windows API in user space. One particular part of<br>
that API, namely the NT synchronization primitives, have historically been implemented via RPC to a dedicated "kernel" process. However, more recent applications use these APIs more strenuously, and the overhead of RPC has become a bottleneck.</p>
<p>The NT synchronization APIs are too complex to implement on top of existing primitives without sacrificing correctness. Certain operations, such as NtPulseEvent() or the "wait-for-all" mode of NtWaitForMultipleObjects(), require direct control over the underlying wait queue, and implementing a wait queue sufficiently robust for Wine in user space is not possible. This proposed driver, therefore, implements the problematic interfaces directly in the Linux kernel."</p>
<p>Figura did a presentation on it at the&nbsp;Linux Plumbers Conference in 2023 that you can see below:</p>

<p>What kind of performance difference might we see with something like this? The difference depends on your hardware and what you're trying to run but some FPS examples were given from multiple users including:</p>

<p><em>What hardware and software each was tested on was not noted.</em></p>
<p>Some impressive numbers but again it's hardware dependent, but even so any performance uplift would be welcome, so hopefully the patch series gets some good comments and approval after any tweaks are done that may be needed. Looks like we could end up seeing a nice future performance improvement for Linux and Steam Deck gaming with Wine and Proton.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is laying off 1,900 employees at Activision Blizzard and Xbox this week. While Microsoft is primarily laying off roles at Activision Blizzard, some Xbox and ZeniMax employees will also be impacted by the cuts.</p><p>The cuts work out to roughly 8 percent of the overall Microsoft Gaming division that stands at around 22,000 employees in total. <em>The Verge</em> has obtained an internal memo from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer that confirms the layoffs:</p><div><blockquote><p>It’s been a little over three months since the Activision, Blizzard, and King teams joined Microsoft. As we move forward in 2024, the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business.&nbsp;Together, we’ve set priorities, identified areas of overlap, and ensured that we’re all aligned on the best opportunities for growth.</p><p>As part of this process,&nbsp;we have made the painful decision&nbsp;to reduce&nbsp;the size of our gaming workforce by approximately&nbsp;1900 roles out of the 22,000 people on our team.&nbsp;The Gaming Leadership Team and I are committed to navigating this process as thoughtfully as possible. The people who are directly impacted by these reductions have all played an important part in the success of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax and the Xbox teams, and they should be proud of everything they’ve accomplished here. We are grateful for all of the creativity, passion and dedication they have brought to our games, our players and our colleagues. We will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition, including severance benefits informed by local employment laws. Those whose roles will be impacted will be notified, and we ask that you please treat your departing colleagues with the respect and compassion that is consistent with our values.</p><p>Looking ahead, we’ll continue to invest in areas that will grow our business and support our strategy of bringing more games to more players around the world. Although this is a difficult moment for our team, I’m as confident as ever in your ability to create and nurture the games, stories and worlds that bring players together.</p><p>Phil</p></blockquote></div><p>Alongside the layoffs, Blizzard president Mike Ybarra has decided to leave the company. “As many of you know, Mike previously spent more than 20 years at&nbsp;Microsoft. Now that he has seen the acquisition through as Blizzard’s president, he has decided to leave the company,” says Microsoft’s game content and studios president, Matt Booty, in an internal memo.</p><p>Microsoft plans to name a new Blizzard president next week. Allen Adham, Blizzard’s chief design officer, is also leaving the company. “As one of Blizzard’s cofounders, Allen has had a broad impact on all of Blizzard’s games. His influence will be felt for years to come, both directly and indirectly as Allen plans to continue mentoring young designers across the industry,” says Booty.</p><p>Blizzard’s previously announced survival game has also been canceled as part of these changes. Booty says Microsoft will be “shifting some of the people working on it to one of several promising new projects Blizzard has in the early stages of development.”</p><p>The layoffs come the same month Riot Games, Google, Discord, Twitch, Unity, eBay, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/14/23458204/meta-twitter-amazon-apple-layoffs-hiring-freezes-latest-tech-industry">others announced cuts</a>.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">completed its $68.7 billion acquisition</a> of Activision Blizzard in October, following 20 months of battles with regulators in the UK and US. Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/20/24009129/microsoft-gaming-xbox-phil-spencer-bobby-kotick-activision-leadership-changes">stepped down at the end of December</a>, with Microsoft not appointing a direct replacement. Instead, a suite of Activision Blizzard executives now report up to Matt Booty.</p><p>Today’s layoffs come just a few months after some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933049/microsoft-reorg-xbox-marketing-ai-leadership-changes">big Xbox leadership changes</a> saw Sarah Bond promoted to Xbox president, leading all Xbox platform and hardware work. Booty was also promoted to president of game content and studios, which includes overseeing Bethesda, ZeniMax studios, and Activision Blizzard.</p><p>Microsoft last announced big layoffs a year ago, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23560315/microsoft-job-cuts-layoffs-2023-tech">affecting 10,000 employees</a>. The software maker is due to report its fiscal Q2 2024 earnings next week, which, for the first time, will include results from the impact of the Activision Blizzard acquisition.</p><p>Here’s Matt Booty’s internal memo in full:</p><div><blockquote><p>Blizzard team,&nbsp;</p><p>As you may have read in Phil’s note, today is a challenging day as we say goodbye to some of our colleagues. This is a difficult process, but it is one that will best enable Blizzard and Xbox to deliver ambitious games for our players on more platforms and in more places than ever before. We are moving forward with a more focused strategy across Microsoft Gaming that sets us up for sustainable growth and aligns our talent and resources to our top priorities.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the events today, Mike Ybarra and I have been discussing his future and some of his personal passions for some time. As many of you know, Mike previously spent more than 20 years at Microsoft. Now that he has seen the acquisition through as Blizzard’s president, he has decided to leave the company. As we move forward, we will continue to build on the positive momentum that Mike created and strive to continue exceeding the expectations of Blizzard’s players. I want to thank Mike for his leadership and for his partnership and counsel since the deal closed. I know he plans to travel and spend more time with his family. We wish him the very best.</p><p>Additionally, Allen Adham, Blizzard’s Chief Design Officer, is leaving the company. As one of Blizzard’s cofounders, Allen has had a broad impact on all of Blizzard’s games. His influence will be felt for years to come, both directly and indirectly as Allen plans to continue mentoring young designers across the industry.</p><p>The new Blizzard President will be announced next week.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What Happens Next</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Those who are impacted are being informed in meetings starting today. Given the challenging day ahead, anyone who is set up to work from home and would prefer to, can work remotely today. Due to time zones and local holidays, some impacted employees in APAC and EMEA will be informed later this evening and into early next week. After the notifications are complete, leaders will bring their teams together. Please be mindful of this process in your conversations and outreach during these next few days.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Details on Today’s Actions</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The changes announced today reflect a focus on products and strategies that hold the most promise for Blizzard’s future growth, as well as identified areas of overlap across Blizzard and Microsoft Gaming. Today’s actions affect multiple teams within Blizzard, including development teams, shared service organizations and corporate functions. As part of this focus, Blizzard is ending development on its survival game project and will be shifting some of the people working on it to one of several promising new projects Blizzard has in the early stages of development.&nbsp;</p><p>No matter the reason behind these decisions, they are never made lightly. Changes like these affect the lives of colleagues and friends, and we are all grateful for their meaningful contributions to Blizzard and its world class lineup of games. As Phil stated, we will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition, including severance benefits informed by local employment laws.&nbsp;</p><p>I understand that this is a challenging time and that it can be a lot to process. I haven’t met many of you yet, and hearing about these decisions from me may be difficult. Today, I am here on Blizzard’s Irvine campus, and I am personally committed to supporting you as teams and individuals, keeping you informed, and approaching this transition period with care and transparency.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for working through these changes with us. Together we will continue to create amazing games for our players, with a culture that empowers everyone to be their most authentic selves and do their best work.&nbsp;</p><p>- Matt&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p><em><strong>Update, January 25th 10:45AM ET</strong>: Article updated with full memo from Matt Booty.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-430723">


<h3>from the <i>hollowed-out-and-sold-for-parts</i> dept</h3>

<p>When we last checked in with what’s left of Sports Illustrated, its owner, The Arena Group, had just got done baring its ass as part of a giant <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/11/29/sports-illustrated-the-latest-to-bare-its-entire-ass-thanks-to-laziness-greed-and-half-cooked-ai/">‘AI’ related scandal</a>. Company executives apparently thought it would be a great idea to create a bunch of fake, AI-generated writers to shit out lazy, uninteresting clickbait, without really telling any of the folks that create actual journalism at the company.</p>
<p>When busted, Arena Group executives blamed everyone but themselves. </p>
<p>Sports Illustrated’s fortunes got even bleaker last week, when it was revealed that The Arena Group, which had actually <strong>only been renting the Sports Illustrated brand</strong> as part of a 10-year deal with Authentic Brands Group (ABG), had <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/01/sports-illustrated-brand-publisher-restructuring-1235696747/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to make a quarterly $3.75 million</a> payment to continue licensing it. That resulted in a revocation of the branding license and no limit of additional chaos for the already imploding company.</p>
<p>To <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/si/jamie-salter-manoj-bhargava-abg-arena-sports-illustrated.html">hear ABG CEO Jamie Salter tell it</a>, Arena Group tried to change the terms of the licensing deal and lower its payments mid-stride. Salter says they may still be able to strike a deal with Arena, or they may find another renter. But when it comes to sports reporting and Sports Illustrated, it doesn’t really matter at this point — as the brand has already largely become a zombie of its former self. </p>
<p>And, as is usually the case, employees doing the actual work were the ones who <a href="https://defector.com/sports-illustrated-as-we-know-it-appears-to-be-dead">got to pay the price for their employers’ incompetence</a> and bickering, with large swaths informed of layoffs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Earlier today, The Arena Group gave notice over email that it would be conducting layoffs at&nbsp;Sports Illustrated.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/si_union/status/1748390846058176659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A statement from the&nbsp;Sports Illustrated&nbsp;union</a>&nbsp;revealed that “a significant number, possibly all” of the magazine’s staff would be losing their jobs as the result of Authentic Brands Group’s decision to revoke The Arena Group’s license to the&nbsp;SI&nbsp;brand.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the past six years Sports Illustrated has been tossed around between a rotating crop of dodgy international middlemen for whom journalism was an afterthought. SI was acquired in 2018 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotdash_Meredith#:~:text=On%20October%206%2C%202021%2C%20Dotdash,new%20entity%20called%20Dotdash%20Meredith.">what was left</a> of Meredith Publishing as part of a purchase of what was left of Time, Inc. (which founded the magazine in 1954), then had its intellectual property sold to Authentic for $110 million a year later. </p>
<p>All the while, the output and quality of the end product and brand steadily declined, resulting in a media outlet that’s now more interested in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/7F3704AF-8F81-472D-9CDE-4D543395482D">hawking supplements</a> and affixing its brand to casino deals than doing any sort of cogent sports reporting. It’s a not dissimilar trajectory to other major media brands like Newsweek, which was <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/158968/newsweek-rise-zombie-magazine">hollowed out like a pumpkin and now traffics in right wing conspiracy theories</a>. </p>
<p>Sports Illustrated’s decline runs in parallel to the ongoing, continuing collapse of real journalism and the whole <em>accurately informing the public</em> thing–which has never been much of a money maker. There were a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2023/12/19/media-companies-have-slashed-over-20000-jobs-in-2023/?sh=b6b29c022b78">record number of media layoffs last year,</a> as trust fund brunchlords and the incompetent stewards of a dying press hustle and jockey to make a quick buck shuffling bloated brand corpses around.</p>
<p>It’s more profitable to make a quick buck striking acquisition deals and pointless mergers for the tax breaks — generating automated clickbait and bullshit at historic scale and using what’s left of popular brands to sell junk — than it is to pay real reporters a living wage to create quality journalism. The end result of that lazy mindset is everywhere you look. And it seems to be getting worse.</p>
<p>Despite a lot of lip service, we’ve <em>never really spent a whole lot of time actually trying to find creative new funding options for real journalism</em> at any meaningful scale. Certainly nowhere near the time and effort put into get rich quick tech fads like NFTs. The stewards of what’s left have no interest in real journalism, or funding it. They’re in it to make a quick buck off the fading remnants of a dying industry, cutting corners, firing employees, and pursuing easy money wherever possible.</p>
<p>As a result journalism — sports or otherwise — is steadily being replaced by a parade of automated gibberish, clickbait, <a href="https://www.damemagazine.com/2023/03/06/america-propaganda-disinformation/">well-funded propaganda</a>, and marketing, and it’s getting increasingly difficult to find anybody with the ethics and resources interested in reversing — or even combating — the trajectory. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>EFF has joined forces with 110 NGOs today in a <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2024/01/22/joint.advocacy.statement-cybercrime.convention-jan.23.2024.pdf">joint statement</a></span><span> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/joint-statement-proposed-cybercrime-treaty-ahead-concluding-session">delivered to the United Nations</a> Ad Hoc Committee, clearly outlining civil society&nbsp;non-negotiable redlines for the </span><a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/Cybercrime/AdHocCommittee/Concluding_session/Documents/A_AC.291_22_Rev.1_E.pdf"><span>proposed UN Cybercrime Treaty</span></a><span>, and asserting that states should reject the proposed treaty if these essential changes are not implemented.&nbsp;</span><br><span></span></p>
<p><span>The last draft published on November 6, 2023 does not adequately ensure adherence to human rights law and standards. Initially focused on cybercrime, the proposed Treaty <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/cybersecurity/opinion/un-cybercrime-treaty-a-menace-in-the-making/">has alarmingly evolved</a> into an expansive surveillance tool.</span></p>
<p><span>Katitza Rodriguez, EFF Policy Director for Global Privacy,&nbsp;asserts ahead of the upcoming concluding negotiations:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>The proposed treaty needs more than just minor adjustments; it requires a more focused, narrowly defined approach to tackle cybercrime. This change is essential to prevent the treaty from becoming a global surveillance pact rather than a tool for effectively combating core cybercrimes. With its wide-reaching scope and invasive surveillance powers, the current version raises serious concerns about cross-border repression and potential police overreach. Above all, human rights must be the treaty's cornerstone, not an afterthought. If states can't unite on these key points, they must outright reject the treaty.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Historically, cybercrime legislation has been exploited to target journalists and security researchers, suppress dissent and whistleblowers, endanger human rights defenders, limit free expression, and justify unnecessary and disproportionate state surveillance measures. We are concerned that the proposed Treaty, as it stands now, will exacerbate these problems. The proposed treaty <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/cybercrime/ad_hoc_committee/ahc_concluding_session/main">concluding session</a> will be held at the UN Headquarters in New York from January 29 to February 10th. EFF will be attending in person.</span></p>
<p><span>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/joint-statement-proposed-cybercrime-treaty-ahead-concluding-session">joint statement</a> specifically calls States to narrow the scope of criminalization provisions to well defined cyber dependent crimes; shield security researchers, whistleblowers, activists, and journalists from being&nbsp;prosecuted for their legitimate activities; explicitly include language on international human rights law, data protection, and gender mainstreaming; limit the scope of the domestic criminal procedural measures and international cooperation to core cybercrimes established in the criminalization chapter; and address concerns that the current draft could weaken cybersecurity and encryption. Additionally, it requires the necessity to establish specific safeguards, such as the principles of prior judicial authorization, necessity, legitimate aim, and proportionality. </span></p>

<p>In the aftermath of <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2237527/epic-games-selling-bandcamp-a-year-after-acquiring-it/news/">Epic selling Bandcamp to Songtradr</a>, Bandcamp has found itself in a place of instability. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919551/bandcamp-layoffs-epic-songtradr">Half of the company’s employees were laid off</a> post-acquisition, leading many to speculate over the beloved platform’s future. Most importantly, many artists who depended on the service are left looking for alternatives.</p>



<p>There isn’t a Fediverse solution yet. Although <a href="https://funkwhale.audio/">Funkwhale</a> is a great music platform, it’s just not geared towards selling music. Not all is lost, however, as the <a href="https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Faircamp</a> project is stepping in to help musicians.</p>

<p>Faircamp bills itself as “a static site generator for audio producers”, but an easier way to understand it is this: it’s a simple site that you can host yourself. Install some software on your server, point it at the folder of the music you want to sell, and your site’s pages will build themselves. You can find a great guide for getting started <a href="https://www.meljoann.com/posts/faircamp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>Faircamp offers a high degree of customization, all while looking good doing it. Artists are able to set up payment for albums and tracks, offer freebies, unlock codes, and embed a player in other sites. It looks great on mobile, too.</p>





<p>So far, the music community has responded to Faircamp very positively. Many musicians within the Fediverse have actively made an effort to form <a href="https://webring.key13.uk/">an old-school webring</a>, in the hopes of supporting one another.</p>

<p>More notably, Radio Free Fedi has been incredibly proactive, <a href="https://faircamp.radiofreefedi.net/">offering a free service</a> to help Fedi musicians host their own Faircamp sites on RadioFreeFedi’s infrastructure.</p>



<figure><blockquote><div><p>With the recent sale of Bandcamp to predatory VC extractive vultures, and the main move to finalise that sale was to fire all the recently unionised staff, the writing is on the wall for the last least worst option…</p><p>…here is an option for members of our community who may not want or be able to self-host their music and/or would like something that is a simple, tidy, open and not walled garden or metrics driven home to offer their music to supporters.</p></div><cite><a href="https://faircamp.radiofreefedi.net/">Radio Free FedI</a></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Embeds still look a little janky on mobile, but they could probably get cleaned up by submitting a simple pull request on the <a href="https://codeberg.org/simonrepp/faircamp">project’s Codeberg repository</a>.</p>







<p>All in all, Faircamp looks like it’s shaping up to be a great alternative method for supporting Fediverse musicians! Hopefully this effort brings renewed interest towards building federated tools for creatives on the network, somewhere down the road.</p>

    </div><p>Japan's space agency said Thursday that its first lunar mission hit the tiny patch of the moon's surface it was aiming for, in a successful demonstration of its pinpoint landing system—although the probe appears to be lying upside-down.</p>


										      
																																	<p>Japan became the fifth country in history to reach the moon when the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM, touched down on the moon early on Saturday. But trouble with the probe's solar batteries made it hard at first to figure out whether the probe landed in the target zone.</p>
<p>While most previous probes have used landing zones about 10 kilometers (six miles) wide, SLIM was aiming at a target of just 100 meters (330 feet). Improved accuracy would give scientists access to more of the moon, since probes could be placed nearer to obstacles.</p>
<p>One of the lander's main engines lost thrust about 50 meters (54 yards) above the moon surface, causing a harder landing than planned.</p>
<p>A pair of autonomous probes released by SLIM before touchtown sent back images of the box-shaped vehicle on the surface, although it appeared to be upside down.</p>
<p>After a few days of data analysis, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA determined that the spacecraft landed about 55 meters (60 yards) away from its target, in between two craters near the Shioli crater, a region covered in volcanic rock.</p>

<p>But after the landing mishap, the craft's solar panels wound up facing the wrong direction, and it cannot generate power. Officials said there is still hope the probe will be able to recharge when the moon enters its daytime in the coming days.</p>
<p>JAXA project manager Shinichiro Sakai said the images sent back were just like those he'd imagined and seen in computer renderings.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>"Something we designed traveled all the way to the moon and took that snapshot. I almost fell down when I saw it," he said. For the pinpoint landing, Sakai said, he would give SLIM a "perfect score."</p>
<p>"We demonstrated that we can land where we want," Sakai said. "We opened a door to a new era."</p>
<p>LEV-1, a hopping robot equipped with an antenna and a camera, was tasked with recording SLIM's landing and transmitting images back to Earth. LEV-2 is a baseball-sized rover equipped with two cameras, developed by JAXA together with Sony, toymaker Tomy Co. and Doshisha University.</p>

<p>The two autonomous probes frame and select images independently, both using LEV-1's antenna to send them back to the base.</p>
<p>Daichi Hirano, a JAXA scientist who designed LEV-2, also known as Sora-Q, said it selected images containing SLIM and nearby lunar surface and transmitted the images through LEV-1, making the pair the world's first to achieve the mission. Despite the rush, the probes captured and transmitted 275 images.</p>
<p>Japan followed the United States, the Soviet Union, China and India to reach the moon's surface.</p>
<p>The project was the fruit of two decades of work on precision technology by JAXA.</p>
<p>JAXA has a track record with difficult landings. Its Hayabusa2 spacecraft, launched in 2014, touched down twice on the 900-meter-long (3,000-foot-long) asteroid Ryugu, collecting samples that were returned to Earth.</p>

<p>SLIM, nicknamed "the Moon Sniper," was intended to seek clues about the origin of the moon, including analyzing minerals with a special camera.</p>
<p>SLIM was launched on a Mitsubishi Heavy H2A rocket in September. It initially orbited Earth and entered lunar orbit on Dec. 25.</p>
<p>Japan hopes to regain confidence for its space technology after a number of failures. A spacecraft designed by a Japanese company crashed during a lunar landing attempt in April, and a new flagship rocket failed its debut launch in March.</p>

In this work, we investigate how Wi-Fi access points manage the security context of queued frames. By exploiting power-save features, we show how to trick access points into leaking frames in plaintext, or encrypted using the group or an all-zero key. We demonstrate resulting attacks against several open-source network stacks. We attribute our findings to the lack of explicit guidance in managing security contexts of buffered frames in the 802.11 standards. The unprotected nature of the power-save bit in a frame’s header, which our work reveals to be a fundamental design flaw, also allows an adversary to force queue frames intended for a specific client resulting in its disconnection and trivially executing a denial-of-service attack. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an attacker can override and control the security context of frames that are yet to be queued. This exploits a design flaw in hotspot-like networks and allows the attacker to force an access points to encrypt yet to be queued frames using an adversary-chosen key, thereby bypassing Wi-Fi encryption entirely. Our attacks have a widespread impact as they affect various devices and operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, iOS, and Android) and because they can be used to hijack TCP connections or intercept client and web traffic. Overall, we highlight the need for transparency in handling security context across the network stack layers and the challenges in doing so.</p></div></div><div id="node-paper-full-group-open-access-content"><h2><span>Open Access Media</span></h2><p>USENIX is committed to Open Access to the research presented at our events.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    

    <marquee><blink>Please sign my <a href="https://github.com/holman/feedback">guestbook</a>.</blink></marquee>

<p>Have you ever shoved a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> into a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag? Pixar gets all the
accolades today, but in the 90s this was a serious feat of computer animation.
By combining these two tags, you were a trailblazer. A person capable of great
innovation. A human being that all other human beings could aspire to.</p>

<p>You were a web developer in the 1990s.</p>

<p>With that status, you knew you were hot shit. And you brought with you a score
of the most fearsome technological innovations, the likes of which we haven’t
come close to replicating ever since.</p>

<p>Put down the jQuery, step away from the non-relational database: we have more
important things to talk about.</p>

<h2 id="1x1gif">1x1.gif</h2>

<p>1x1.gif should have won a fucking Grammy. Or a Pulitzer. Or <em>Most Improved,
Third Grade Gym Class</em> or something. It’s the most important achievement in
computer science since the linked list. It’s not the future we deserved, but
it’s the future we needed (until the box model fucked it all up).</p>

<p>If you’re not familiar with the humble 1x1.gif trick, here it is:</p>

<!-- lol yeah i'm base64 encoding 1x1.gif isn't that fucking dope? -->
<p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>Can’t see it? Here, <em>enhance</em>:</p>

<p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" height="100" width="100%"></p>

<p>The 1x1.gif — or spacer.gif, or transparent.gif — is just a one pixel by one
pixel transparent GIF. Just like the most futuristic CSS framework of today <em>but
in a billionth of the file size</em>, 1x1.gif is fully optimized for the
<strong>responsive web</strong>. You had to use these advanced attributes to tap into its
power, though:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;IMG</span> <span>SRC=</span><span>"/1x1.gif"</span> <span>WIDTH=</span><span>150</span> <span>HEIGHT=</span><span>250</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>By doing this you can position elements ANYWHERE ON THE PAGE. Combine this with
semantically-appropriate containers and you could do amazing things:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;TABLE&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;TR&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;TD&gt;&lt;IMG</span> <span>SRC=</span><span>"1x1.gif"</span> <span>WIDTH=</span><span>300</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT</span> <span>SIZE=</span><span>42</span><span>&gt;</span>Hello welcome to my <span>&lt;MARQUEE&gt;</span>Internet Web Home<span>&lt;/MARQUEE&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/TR&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;TR&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;TD</span> <span>BGCOLOR=</span><span>RED</span><span>&gt;&lt;IMG</span> <span>SRC=</span><span>"/cgi/webcounter.cgi"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/TR&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/TABLE&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>1x1.gif let you push elements all around the page effortlessly. To this day it
is the only way to vertically center elements.</p>

<h2 id="nbspnbspnbspnbsp"><code>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</code></h2>

<p>Are images too advanced for you? <em>HTML For Dummies</em> doesn’t cover the <code>&lt;IMG&gt;</code>
tag until chapter four? Well, you’re in luck: the <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> tag is here!</p>

<p>You may be saying to yourself, “Self, I know all about HTML entity encoding.
What is this dastardly handsome man going on about?”</p>

<p>The answer, dear reasonably attractive reader, is an innovation that youth of
today don’t respect nearly enough: the stacked <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>. Much like the 1x1.gif
trick, you can just arbitrarily scale <code>&amp;nbsp</code>; for whatever needs you may face:</p>

<div><pre><code>PLEASE SIGN  <span>&lt;BR&gt;</span>
<span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</span>MY GUESTBOOK BELOW:
<span>&lt;HR&gt;&lt;HR&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If I had a nickel for how many times I wrote <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> in the 90s, I’d have
enough money to cover the monthly overage bills from AOL.</p>

<h2 id="dotted-underlines-border-effects">Dotted underlines, border effects</h2>

<p>Towards the end of the golden era of HTML, CSS appeared on the scene, promising
a world of separating content from style, and we’ve been dealing with that
disaster ever since.</p>

<p>The absolute first thing we did with CSS was use it to stop underlining links.
Overnight, the entire internet converted into this sludge of a medium where text
looked like links and links looked like text. You had no idea where to click,
but hell that didn’t really matter anyway because we had developed cursor
effects (you haven’t lived until your mouse had a trail of twelve fireballs
behind it).</p>

<p>This was such a compelling use of advanced technology that it was literally all
we used CSS for initially. I even have proof from an <code>index.shtml</code> (fuck yes
SSI) file from 2000:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;style </span><span>type=</span><span>"text/css"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!</span><span>--</span>
<span>a</span><span>:hover</span> <span>{</span><span>text-decoration</span><span>:</span> <span>none</span><span>;</span> <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>#000000</span><span>}</span>
<span>--</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/style&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s it. That’s the entire — inline, of course — CSS for this file. Make sure
when you hover the link, remove the underline and paint it black. From this,
entire interactive websites are born.</p>

<h2 id="dhtml">DHTML</h2>

<p>As soon as we had the technology to remove underlines from links, we decided to
combine it with the power to show <code>alert("Welcome to my website!")</code> messages on
page load. CSS and JavaScript joined forces to form the Technology of Terror:
DHTML.</p>

<p>DHTML, which stands for “distributed HTML”, was the final feather in our cap of
web development tools. It would stand the test of time, ensuring that we could
make snowflakes fall from the top of the page, or build an accordion menu
animated image map, or building your own custom <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> except using
semantic tags like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>DHTML helped transition web development from a hobbyist pastime into a
full-fledged profession. Sites like Dynamic Drive meant that instead of thinking
through creative solutions for problems you face, you could just copy and paste
this 50 line block of code and everything would be fixed. In effect, DHTML was
the Twitter Bootstrap of the time.</p>

<h2 id="pixel-fonts">Pixel fonts</h2>

<p>Computer screens were not large. I mean, they were <em>large</em>, since CRT was the
shit, but they didn’t have a high resolution. Therefore, the best way to
leverage those pixels is to write everything in tiny six-point font.</p>

<p><img src="https://zachholman.com/images/posts/pixel%20font.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Along those lines, web developers aspired to become illustrators when they
looked at these simplistic typefaces and realized they were made up of pixels.
You started to see these weird attempts at isometric pixel illustration on
splash screens, made by developers whose time and money was probably better spent
investing in a .com IPO rather than installing Photoshop.</p>

<h2 id="buttons">Buttons</h2>

<p>It’s come to my attention that people today don’t like Internet Explorer. I can
only believe they hate Internet Explorer because it has devolved from its purest
form, Internet Explorer 4.0.</p>

<p>Internet Explorer 4.0 was perfection incarnate in a browser. It had Active
Desktop. It had Channels. <em>It had motherfucking Channels</em>, the coolest
technology that never reached market adoption ever not even a little bit. IE4,
in general, was so good that you were going to have it installed on your PC
whether you liked it or not.</p>

<p>When you’re part of an elite group of people who fully understand the weight of
perfection, there is a natural tendency to tell everyone you meet that you and
you alone have the gravitas necessary to make these hard decisions. Decisions
like what browser your visitors should use.</p>

<p>So we proudly displayed dozens of 88x31 pixel buttons on our sites:</p>

<center>
  <img src="https://zachholman.com/images/posts/ie4.gif">
</center>

<p>These were everywhere. It’s kind of like the ribbons displayed on a uniform of a
military officer: they told the tale of all the battles the individual had
fought in order to get to where they were today. In other words, which editor
(FrontPage ‘98, obviously), which web server (GeoCities, you moron), and which
web ring you were a part of (whichever listed your site highest, which was none
of them).</p>

<hr>

<p>I miss the good ol’ days. Today we have abstractions on top of abstractions on
top of JavaScript, of all things. Shit doesn’t even know how to calculate math
correctly. It’s amazing we ever got to where we are today, when you think about
it.</p>

<p>So raise a glass proudly, and do us all a favor: paste a shit ton of <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>s
into your next pull request, just to fuck with your team a little bit.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><span>T</span>he planarian is nobody's idea of a genius. A flatworm shaped like a comma, it can be found wriggling through the muck of lakes and ponds worldwide. Its pin-size head has a microscopic structure that passes for a brain. Its two eyespots are set close together in a way that makes it look cartoonishly confused. It aspires to nothing more than life as a bottom-feeder.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">But the worm has mastered one task that has eluded humanity's greatest minds: perfect regeneration. Tear it in half, and its head will grow a new tail while its tail grows a new head. After a week two healthy worms swim away.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Growing a new head is a neat trick. But it's the tail end of the worm that intrigues Tufts University biologist Michael Levin. He studies the way <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/synthetic-morphology-lets-scientists-create-new-life-forms/">bodies develop from single cells</a>, among other things, and his research led him to suspect that the intelligence of living things lies outside their brains to a surprising degree. Substantial smarts may be in the cells of a worm's rear end, for instance. “All intelligence is really collective intelligence, because every cognitive system is made of some kind of parts,” Levin says. An animal that can survive the complete loss of its head was Levin's perfect test subject.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In their natural state planaria prefer the smooth and sheltered to the rough and open. Put them in a dish with a corrugated bottom, and they will huddle against the rim. But in his laboratory, about a decade ago, Levin trained some planaria to expect yummy bits of liver puree that he dripped into the middle of a ridged dish. They soon lost all fear of the rough patch, eagerly crossing the divide to get the treats. He trained other worms in the same way but in smooth dishes. Then he decapitated them all.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Levin discarded the head ends and waited two weeks while the tail ends regrew new heads. Next he placed the regenerated worms in corrugated dishes and dripped liver into the center. Worms that had lived in a smooth dish in their previous incarnation were reluctant to move. But worms regenerated from tails that had lived in rough dishes learned to go for the food more quickly. Somehow, despite the total loss of their brains, those planaria had retained the memory of the liver reward. But how? Where?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">It turns out that regular cells—not just highly specialized brain cells such as neurons—have the ability to store information and act on it. Now Levin has shown that the cells do so by using subtle changes in electric fields as a type of memory. These revelations have put the biologist at the vanguard of a new field called basal cognition. Researchers in this burgeoning area have spotted hallmarks of intelligence—learning, memory, problem-solving—outside brains as well as within them.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Until recently, most scientists held that true cognition arrived with the first brains half a billion years ago. Without intricate clusters of neurons, behavior was merely a kind of reflex. But Levin and several other researchers believe otherwise. He doesn't deny that brains are awesome, paragons of computational speed and power. But he sees the differences between cell clumps and brains as ones of degree, not kind. In fact, Levin suspects that cognition probably evolved as cells started to collaborate to carry out the incredibly difficult task of building complex organisms and then got souped-up into brains to allow animals to move and think faster.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">That position is being embraced by researchers in a variety of disciplines, including roboticists such as Josh Bongard, a frequent Levin collaborator who runs the Morphology, Evolution, and Cognition Laboratory at the University of Vermont. “Brains were one of the most recent inventions of Mother Nature, the thing that came last,” says Bongard, who hopes to build deeply intelligent machines from the bottom up. “It's clear that the body matters, and then somehow you add neural cognition on top. It's the cherry on the sundae. It's not the sundae.”</p><figure data-original-class="image-captioned" data-block="sciam/image"><a aria_label="Open image in new tab" href="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=1536" target="_blank"><img alt="A brown worm with a head on both ends shown on an off-white background." decoding="async" height="1024" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 900px) 900px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw" src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=900" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=900 900w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D1F27359-310E-4D2C-A91B7FFAB9ECC010_medium.jpg?w=1350 1350w" width="1536"></a>
<figcaption>Head cells in the flatworm <em>Dugesia japonica</em> have different bioelectric voltages than tail cells do. Switch the voltages around and cut off the tail, and the head will regenerate a second head. Credit:&nbsp;Michael Levin</figcaption></figure><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In recent years interest in basal cognition has exploded as researchers have recognized example after example of surprisingly sophisticated intelligence at work across life's kingdoms, no brain required. For artificial-intelligence scientists such as Bongard, basal cognition offers an escape from the trap of assuming that future intelligences must mimic the brain-centric human model. For medical specialists, there are tantalizing hints of ways to awaken cells' innate powers of healing and regeneration.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">And for the philosophically minded, basal cognition casts the world in a sparkling new light. Maybe thinking builds from a simple start. Maybe it is happening all around us, every day, in forms we haven't recognized because we didn't know what to look for. Maybe minds are everywhere.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Although it now seems like a Dark Ages idea, only a few decades ago many scientists believed that nonhuman animals couldn't experience pain or other emotions. Real thought? Out of the question. The mind was the purview of humans. “It was the last beachhead,” says Pamela Lyon of the University of Adelaide, a scholar of basal cognition, who coined the term for the field in 2018. Lyon sees scientists' insistence that human intelligence is qualitatively different as just another doomed form of exceptionalism. “We've been ripped from every central position we've inhabited,” she points out. Earth is not the center of the universe. People are just another animal species. But real cognition—that was supposed to set us apart.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Now that notion, too, is in retreat as researchers document the rich inner lives of creatures increasingly distant from us. Apes, dogs, dolphins, crows and even insects are proving more savvy than suspected. In his 2022 book <em>The Mind of a Bee</em>, behavioral ecologist Lars Chittka chronicles his decades of work with honeybees, showing that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-insects-feel-joy-and-pain/">bees can use sign language, recognize individual human faces, and remember and convey the locations of far-flung flowers</a>. They have good moods and bad, and they can be traumatized by near-death experiences such as being grabbed by an animatronic spider hidden in a flower. (Who wouldn't be?)</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8WyWFAS96ac?si=jETTvE853eizqsVl" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">But bees, of course, are animals with actual brains, so a soupçon of smarts doesn't really shake the paradigm. The bigger challenge comes from evidence of surprisingly sophisticated behavior in our brainless relatives. “The neuron is not a miracle cell,” says Stefano Mancuso, a University of Florence botanist who has written several books on plant intelligence. “It's a normal cell that is able to produce an electric signal. In plants almost every cell is able to do that.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">On one plant, the touch-me-not, feathery leaves normally fold and wilt when touched (a defense mechanism against being eaten), but when a team of scientists at the University of Western Australia and the University of Firenze in Italy conditioned the plant by jostling it throughout the day without harming it, it quickly learned to ignore the stimulus. Most remarkably, when the scientists left the plant alone for a month and then retested it, it remembered the experience. Other plants have other abilities. A Venus flytrap can count, snapping shut only if two of the sensory hairs on its trap are tripped in quick succession and pouring digestive juices into the closed trap only if its sensory hairs are tripped three more times.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">These responses in plants are mediated by electric signals, just as they are in animals. Wire a flytrap to a touch-me-not, and you can make the entire touch-me-not collapse by touching a sensory hair on the flytrap. And these and other plants can be knocked out by anesthetic gas. Their electric activity flatlines, and they stop responding as if unconscious.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Plants can sense their surroundings surprisingly well. They know whether they are being shaded by part of themselves or by something else. They can detect the sound of running water (and will grow toward it) and of bees' wings (and will produce nectar in preparation). They know when they are being eaten by bugs and will produce nasty defense chemicals in response. They even know when their neighbors are under attack: when scientists played a recording of munching caterpillars to a cress plant, that was enough for the plant to send a surge of mustard oil into its leaves.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Plants' most remarkable behavior tends to get underappreciated because we see it every day: they seem to know exactly what form they have and plan their future growth based on the sights, sounds and smells around them, making complicated decisions about where future resources and dangers might be located in ways that can't be boiled down to simple formulas. As Paco Calvo, director of the Minimal Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Murcia in Spain and author of <em>Planta Sapiens</em>, puts it, “Plants have to plan ahead to achieve goals, and to do so, they need to integrate vast pools of data. They need to engage with their surroundings adaptively and proactively, and they need to think about the future. They just couldn't afford to do otherwise.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">None of this implies that plants are geniuses, but within their limited tool set, they show a solid ability to perceive their world and use that information to get what they need—key components of intelligence. But again, plants are a relatively easy case—no brains but lots of complexity and trillions of cells to play with. That's not the situation for single-celled organisms, which have traditionally been relegated to the “mindless” category by virtually everyone. If amoebas can think, then humans need to rethink all kinds of assumptions.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Yet the evidence for cogitating pond scum grows daily. Consider the slime mold, a cellular puddle that looks a bit like melted Velveeta and oozes through the world's forests digesting dead plant matter. Although it can be the size of a throw rug, a slime mold is one single cell with many nuclei. It has no nervous system, yet it is an excellent problem solver. When researchers from Japan and Hungary placed a slime mold at one end of a maze and a pile of oat flakes at the other, the slime mold did what slime molds do, exploring every possible option for tasty resources. But once it found the oat flakes, it retreated from all the dead ends and concentrated its body in the path that led to the oats, choosing the shortest route through the maze (of four possible solutions) every time. Inspired by that experiment, the same researchers then piled oat flakes around a slime mold in positions and quantities meant to represent the population structure of Tokyo, and the slime mold contorted itself into a very passable map of the Tokyo subway system.</p><figure data-responsive-image="responsive-image" data-original-class="article-media" data-block="sciam/image"><div><a aria_label="Open image in new tab" href="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_d.jpg?w=2000&amp;disable=upscale" target="_blank"><picture><source media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)" sizes="(min-width: 900px) 900px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_d.jpg?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_d.jpg?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_d.jpg?w=900 900w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_d.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_d.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_d.jpg?w=1350 1350w"><source media="(max-width: 767px)" sizes="(min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_m.jpg?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_m.jpg?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_m.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/2023/saw0224Jaco31_m.jpg?w=1200 1200w"><img alt="Schematic demonstrates that brain cells are not the only cell groupings in the body that show the ability to think.

<figcaption>Credit: Brown Bird Design; Source: “A Scalable Pipeline for Designing Reconfigurable Organisms,” by Sam Kriegman et al., in <em>PNAS</em>, Vol. 117; January 2020 (<em>reference</em>)</figcaption></figure><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Such problem-solving could be dismissed as simple algorithms, but other experiments make it clear that slime molds can learn. When Audrey Dussutour of France's National Center for Scientific Research placed dishes of oatmeal on the far end of a bridge lined with caffeine (which slime molds find disgusting), slime molds were stymied for days, searching for a way across the bridge like an arachnophobe trying to scooch past a tarantula. Eventually they got so hungry that they went for it, crossing over the caffeine and feasting on the delicious oatmeal, and soon they lost all aversion to the formerly distasteful stuff. They had overcome their inhibitions and learned from the experience, and they retained the memory even after being put into a state of suspended animation for a year.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Which brings us back to the decapitated planaria. How can something without a brain remember anything? Where is the memory stored? <em>Where is its mind?</em></p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><span>T</span>he orthodox view of memory is that it is stored as a stable network of synaptic connections among neurons in a brain. “That view is clearly cracking,” Levin says. Some of the demolition work has come from the lab of neuroscientist David Glanzman of the University of California, Los Angeles. Glanzman was able to transfer a memory of an electric shock from one sea slug to another by extracting RNA from the brains of shocked slugs and injecting it into the brains of new slugs. The recipients then “remembered” to recoil from the touch that preceded the shock. If RNA can be a medium of memory storage, any cell might have the ability, not just neurons.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Indeed, there's no shortage of possible mechanisms by which collections of cells might be able to incorporate experience. All cells have lots of adjustable pieces in their cytoskeletons and gene regulatory networks that can be set in different conformations and can inform behavior later on. In the case of the decapitated planaria, scientists still don't know for sure, but perhaps the remaining bodies were storing information in their cellular interiors that could be communicated to the rest of the body as it was rebuilt. Perhaps their nerves' basic response to rough floors had already been altered.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Levin, though, thinks something even more intriguing is going on: perhaps the impression was stored not just within the cells but in their states of interaction through bioelectricity, the subtle current that courses through all living things. Levin has spent much of his career studying how cell collectives communicate to solve sophisticated challenges during morphogenesis, or body building. How do they work together to make limbs and organs in exactly the right places? Part of that answer seems to lie in bioelectricity.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The fact that bodies have electricity flickering through them has been known for centuries, but until quite recently most biologists thought it was mostly used to deliver signals. Shoot some current through a frog's nervous system, and the frog's leg kicks. Neurons used bioelectricity to transmit information, but most scientists believed that was a specialty of brains, not bodies.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Since the 1930s, however, a small number of researchers have observed that other types of cells seem to be using bioelectricity to store and share information. Levin immersed himself in this unconventional body of work and made the next cognitive leap, drawing on his background in computer science. He'd supported himself during school by writing code, and he knew that computers used electricity to toggle their transistors between 0 and 1 and that all computer programs were built up from that binary foundation. So as an undergraduate, when he learned that all cells in the body have channels in their membranes that act like voltage gates, allowing different levels of current to pass through them, he immediately saw that such gates could function like transistors and that cells could use this electricity-driven information processing to coordinate their activities.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">To find out whether voltage changes really altered the ways that cells passed information to one another, Levin turned to his planaria farm. In the 2000s he designed a way to measure the voltage at any point on a planarian and found different voltages on the head and tail ends. When he used drugs to change the voltage of the tail to that normally found in the head, the worm was unfazed. But then he cut the planarian in two, and the head end regrew a second head instead of a tail. Remarkably, when Levin cut the new worm in half, both heads grew new heads. Although the worms were genetically identical to normal planaria, the one-time change in voltage resulted in a permanent two-headed state.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">For more confirmation that bioelectricity could control body shape and growth, Levin turned to African clawed frogs, common lab animals that quickly metamorphose from egg to tadpole to adult. He found that he could trigger the creation of a working eye anywhere on a tadpole by inducing a particular voltage in that spot. By simply applying the right bioelectric signature to a wound for 24 hours, he could induce regeneration of a functional leg. The cells took it from there.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">“It's a subroutine call,” Levin says. In computer programming, a subroutine call is a piece of code—a kind of shorthand—that tells a machine to initiate a whole suite of lower-level mechanical actions. The beauty of this higher level of programming is that it allows us to control billions of circuits without having to open up the machine and mechanically alter each one by hand. And that was the case with building tadpole eyes. No one had to micromanage the construction of lenses, retinas, and all the other parts of an eye. It could all be controlled at the level of bioelectricity. “It's literally the cognitive glue,” Levin says. “It's what allows groups of cells to work together.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Levin believes this discovery could have profound implications not only for our understanding of the evolution of cognition but also for human medicine. Learning to “speak cell”—to coordinate cells' behavior through bioelectricity—might help us treat cancer, a disease that occurs when part of the body stops cooperating with the rest of the body. Normal cells are programmed to function as part of the collective, sticking to the tasks assigned—liver cell, skin cell, and so on. But cancer cells stop doing their job and begin treating the surrounding body like an unfamiliar environment, striking out on their own to seek nourishment, replicate and defend themselves from attack. In other words, they act like independent organisms.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Why do they lose their group identity? In part, Levin says, because the mechanisms that maintain the cellular mind meld can fail. “Stress, chemicals, genetic mutations can all cause a breakdown of this communication,” he says. His team has been able to induce tumors in frogs just by forcing a “bad” bioelectric pattern onto healthy tissue. It's as if the cancer cells stop receiving their orders and go rogue.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Even more tantalizingly, Levin has dissipated tumors by reintroducing the proper bioelectric pattern—in effect reestablishing communication between the breakaway cancer and the body, as if he's bringing a sleeper cell back into the fold. At some point in the future, he speculates, bioelectric therapy might be applied to human cancers, stopping tumors from growing. It also could play a role in regenerating failing organs—kidneys, say, or hearts—if scientists can crack the bioelectric code that tells cells to start growing in the right patterns. With tadpoles, in fact, Levin showed that animals suffering from massive brain damage at birth were able to build normal brains after the right shot of bioelectricity.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><span>L</span>evin's research has always had tangible applications, such as cancer therapy, limb regeneration and wound healing. But over the past few years he's allowed a philosophical current to enter his papers and talks. “It's been sort of a slow rollout,” he confesses. “I've had these ideas for decades, but it wasn't the right time to talk about it.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">That began to change with a celebrated 2019 paper entitled “The Computational Boundary of a Self,” in which he harnessed the results of his experiments to argue that we are all collective intelligences <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-many-minds-of-marvin-minsky-r-i-p/">built out of smaller, highly competent problem-solving agents</a>. As Vermont's Bongard told the <em>New York Times</em>, “What we are is intelligent machines made of intelligent machines made of intelligent machines all the way down.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">For Levin, that realization came in part from watching the bodies of his clawed frogs as they developed. In frogs' transformation from tadpole to adult, their faces undergo massive remodeling. The head changes shape, and the eyes, mouth and nostrils all migrate to new positions. The common assumption has been that these rearrangements are hardwired and follow simple mechanical algorithms carried out by genes, but Levin suspected it wasn't so preordained. So he electrically scrambled the normal development of frog embryos to create tadpoles with eyes, nostrils and mouths in all the wrong places. Levin dubbed them “Picasso tadpoles,” and they truly looked the part.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">If the remodeling were preprogrammed, the final frog face should have been as messed up as the tadpole. Nothing in the frog's evolutionary past gave it genes for dealing with such a novel situation. But Levin watched in amazement as the eyes and mouths found their way to the right arrangement while the tadpoles morphed into frogs. The cells had an abstract goal and worked together to achieve it. “This is intelligence in action,” Levin wrote, “the ability to reach a particular goal or solve a problem by undertaking new steps in the face of changing circumstances.” Fused into a hive mind through bioelectricity, the cells achieved feats of bioengineering well beyond those of our best gene jockeys.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Some of the most intense interest in Levin's work has come from the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics, which see in basal cognition a way to address some core weaknesses. For all their remarkable prowess in manipulating language or playing games with well-defined rules, AIs still struggle immensely to understand the physical world. They can churn out sonnets in the style of Shakespeare, but ask them how to walk or to predict how a ball will roll down a hill, and they are clueless.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">According to Bongard, that's because these AIs are, in a sense, too heady. “If you play with these AIs, you can start to see where the cracks are. And they tend to be around things like common sense and cause and effect, which points toward why you need a body. If you have a body, you can learn about cause and effect because you can <em>cause effects</em>. But these AI systems can't learn about the world by poking at it.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Bongard is at the vanguard of the “embodied cognition” movement, which seeks to design robots that learn about the world by monitoring the way their form interacts with it. For an example of embodied cognition in action, he says, look no further than his one-and-a-half-year-old child, “who is probably destroying the kitchen right now. That's what toddlers do. They poke the world, literally and metaphorically, and then watch how the world pushes back. It's relentless.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Bongard's lab uses AI programs to design robots out of flexible, LEGO-like cubes that he calls “<em>Minecraft</em> for robotics.” The cubes act like blocky muscle, allowing the robots to move their bodies like caterpillars. The AI-designed robots learn by trial and error, adding and subtracting cubes and “evolving” into more mobile forms as the worst designs get eliminated.</p><figure data-original-class="image-captioned" data-block="sciam/image"><a aria_label="Open image in new tab" href="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=1536" target="_blank"><img alt="Illustration of plants." decoding="async" height="1097" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 900px) 900px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw" src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=900" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=900 900w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/D08F1B3D-F9CE-4076-BF68B82EB51BC674_medium.jpg?w=1350 1350w" width="1536"></a>

That accomplishment inspired Levin's lab to use microsurgery to remove live skin stem cells from an African clawed frog and nudge them together in water. The cells fused into a lump the size of a sesame seed and acted as a unit. Skin cells have cilia, tiny hairs that typically hold a layer of protective mucus on the surface of an adult frog, but these creations used their cilia like oars, rowing through their new world. They navigated mazes and even closed up wounds when injured. Freed from their confined existence in a biological cubicle, they became something new and made the best of their situation. They definitely weren't frogs, despite sharing the identical genome. But because the cells originally came from frogs of the genus <em>Xenopus</em>, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/video/these-researchers-used-a-i-to-design-a-completely-new-animal-robot/">Levin and Bongard nicknamed the things “xenobots.”</a> In 2023 they showed similar feats could be achieved by pieces of another species: human lung cells. Clumps of the human cells self-assembled and moved around in specific ways. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/robots-made-from-human-cells-can-move-on-their-own-and-heal-wounds/">The Tufts team named them “anthrobots.”</a></p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">To Levin, the xenobots and anthrobots are another sign that we need to rethink the way cognition plays out in the actual world. “Typically when you ask about a given living thing, you ask, ‘Why does it have the shape it has? Why does it have the behaviors it has?' And the standard answer is evolution, of course. For eons it was selected for. Well, guess what? There have never been any xenobots. There's never been any pressure to be a good xenobot. So why do these things do what they do within 24 hours of finding themselves in the world? I think it's because evolution does not produce specific solutions to specific problems. It produces problem-solving machines.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Xenobots and anthrobots are, of course, quite limited in their capabilities, but perhaps they provide a window into how intelligence might naturally scale up when individual units with certain goals and needs come together to collaborate. Levin sees this innate tendency toward innovation as one of the driving forces of evolution, pushing the world toward a state of, as Charles Darwin might have put it, endless forms most beautiful. “We don't really have a good vocabulary for it yet,” he says, “but I honestly believe that the future of all this is going to look more like psychiatry talk than chemistry talk. We're going to end up having a calculus of pressures and memories and attractions.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Levin hopes this vision will help us overcome our struggle to acknowledge minds that come in packages bearing little resemblance to our own, whether they are made of slime or silicon. For Adelaide's Lyon, recognizing that kinship is the real promise of basal cognition. “We think we are the crown of creation,” she says. “But if we start realizing that we have a whole lot more in common with the blades of grass and the bacteria in our stomachs—that we are related at a really, really deep level—it changes the entire paradigm of what it is to be a human being on this planet.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Indeed, the very act of living is by default a cognitive state, Lyon says. Every cell needs to be constantly evaluating its surroundings, making decisions about what to let in and what to keep out and planning its next steps. Cognition didn't arrive later in evolution. It's what made life possible.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">“Everything you see that's alive is doing this amazing thing,” Lyon points out. “If an airplane could do that, it would be bringing in its fuel and raw materials from the outside world while manufacturing not just its components but also the machines it needs to make those components and doing repairs, <em>all while it's flying!</em> What we do is nothing short of a miracle.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

      <h2>January 23, 2024</h2>
      <section>
        <p><img src="https://ollama.ai/public/blog/libraries.svg" alt="Python &amp; JavaScript Libraries"></p>

<p>The initial versions of the Ollama Python and JavaScript libraries are now available:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python">Ollama Python Library</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama-js">Ollama JavaScript Library</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Both libraries make it possible to integrate new and existing apps with Ollama in a few lines of code, and share the features and feel of the Ollama REST API.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p><sub>Python</sub></p>

<pre><code>pip install ollama
</code></pre>

<pre><code>import ollama
response = ollama.chat(model='llama2', messages=[
  {
    'role': 'user',
    'content': 'Why is the sky blue?',
  },
])
print(response['message']['content'])
</code></pre>

<p><sub>JavaScript</sub></p>

<pre><code>npm install ollama
</code></pre>

<pre><code>import ollama from 'ollama'

const response = await ollama.chat({
  model: 'llama2',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Why is the sky blue?' }],
})
console.log(response.message.content)
</code></pre>

<h2>Use cases</h2>

<p>Both libraries support Ollama’s full set of features. Here are some examples in Python:</p>

<h4>Streaming</h4>

<pre><code>for chunk in chat('mistral', messages=messages, stream=True):
  print(chunk['message']['content'], end='', flush=True)
</code></pre>

<h4>Multi-modal</h4>

<pre><code>with open('image.png', 'rb') as file:
  response = ollama.chat(
    model='llava',
    messages=[
      {
        'role': 'user',
        'content': 'What is strange about this image?',
        'images': [file.read()],
      },
    ],
  )
print(response['message']['content'])
</code></pre>

<h4>Text Completion</h4>

<pre><code>result = ollama.generate(
  model='stable-code',
  prompt='// A c function to reverse a string\n',
)
print(result['response'])
</code></pre>

<h4>Creating custom models</h4>

<pre><code>modelfile='''
FROM llama2
SYSTEM You are mario from super mario bros.
'''

ollama.create(model='example', modelfile=modelfile)
</code></pre>

<h4>Custom client</h4>

<pre><code>ollama = Client(host='my.ollama.host')
</code></pre>

<p>More examples are available in the GitHub repositories for the <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python/tree/main/examples">Python</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama-js/tree/main/examples">JavaScript</a> libraries.</p>

<h2>New GitHub handle</h2>

<p><img src="https://ollama.ai/public/blog/github-handle.svg" alt="GitHub handle"></p>

<p>These libraries, and the main Ollama repository now live in a new GitHub organization: <strong><a href="https://github.com/ollama">ollama</a></strong>!  Thank you to all the amazing community members who maintain libraries to interact with Ollama via Dart, Swift, C#, Java, PHP, Rust and more – a full list is available <a href="https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama?tab=readme-ov-file#libraries">here</a> – please don’t hesitate to make a pull request to add a library you’ve built or enjoy using.</p>

<p>Special thank you to <a href="https://github.com/saul-jb">Saul</a>, the original author of <code>ollama-js</code>, and everyone else who has worked on community libraries to make Ollama more accessible from different programming languages.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            <p>Dear Kagi community,</p>

<p>Today, we’re happy and proud to have reached <strong>20,000 paying members</strong>, including over 1,500 families all over the world, in our community. We have come a very long way since the first few lines of code and the crazy idea that a search company could not only displace giants for every day use, but do it in a sustainable, <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over">user-centric</a> way.</p>

<p><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-24/1706071825-864946-kagi-crossing-1.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-24/1706071825-864946-kagi-crossing-1.jpg" \=""></a>
</p><p><em>Early Kagi team, two years ago</em></p>

<p>The community has always been at the center of our mission. You all have supported us through thick and thin, have sent us so many lovely messages of support at times when it seemed like the mountain was too high to climb, and enabled us to seed a new internet, better for humans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just wanted to drop you a note and let you know that I love Kagi. It’s awesome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you Jason, without support from you and 20,000 other Kagi lovers around the world we would not be able to be here today. 🙏</p>

<p>For all of this, we’d like to thank you. As we previously announced, we’re going to launch a merchandise store this year. It’s been quite a journey to set it up, and we’d hoped to align its launch date with today, but unfortunately the paperwork gods have decided otherwise (plus we did not expect we will <a href="https://kagi.com/stats">reach 20k as soon</a>!)…</p>

<p>Nevertheless here is what we’re going to do:</p>

<p>When the merch store goes live in about 8 weeks,  <strong>first 20,000 Kagi members will get a free Kagi T-shirt + sticker pack</strong> (excluding shipping). If there are unclaimed shirts left after a few weeks, we’ll send vouchers to all the new members that joined in the meantime on a first come, first serve basis. Sizes are first come first serve too.</p>

<p>We have four t-shirt designs to pick from.  Here is what they look like (click to enlarge):</p>

<p><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048214-141575-doggo-tshirt-yellow-2.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048214-141575-doggo-tshirt-yellow-2.jpg" \=""></a>
<a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048213-534940-doggo-tshirt-black-2.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048213-534940-doggo-tshirt-black-2.jpg" \=""></a>
<a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048213-852364-doggo-tshirt-yellow-1.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048213-852364-doggo-tshirt-yellow-1.jpg" \=""></a>

<p>And of course, Doggo sticker pack!</p>

<p><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048250-795569-kagi-stickers.png"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048250-795569-kagi-stickers.png" \=""></a></p>

<p>Setting up this project was a significant challenge, and true to our ethos, Kagi approached it with a ‘hard mode on’ mentality, aiming for high quality and meticulous attention to detail in the t-shirts. We initially engaged with several popular merch providers used by many large companies, but after months of testing, none could meet our standards for precision and quality.</p>

<p>The journey led us back to a modest print shop in a small town near Novi Sad, Serbia, where we first created our remarkable t-shirts years ago. Despite initial doubts about their capacity, they impressively accepted and successfully fulfilled our large order of 20,000 t-shirts on schedule.</p>

<p><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-833281-img-0503.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-833281-img-0503.jpg" \=""></a>
<a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-913308-img-0500.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-913308-img-0500.jpg" \=""></a>
<a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-24/1706070615-595554-img-0501.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-24/1706070615-595554-img-0501.jpg" \=""></a>
<a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-760781-img-0491.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-760781-img-0491.jpg" \=""></a>
<a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-993881-img-0492.jpg"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-01-23/1706048438-993881-img-0492.jpg" \=""></a></p>

<p>The process from here involves setting up a business entity in Germany, so we can import the t-shirts, store them in a warehouse, connect inventory logistics and ship them all over the world. This includes building a website and connecting it to a back-end database. So, we basically ended up owning a merch production operation end-to-end, just so that we could ensure premium quality of these t-shirts!</p>

<p>Now, you may ask, why did we go through all this trouble and allocate nearly a third of our <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/safe-round">investor-raised funds</a> to produce and freely distribute 20,000 t-shirts?</p>

<ol>
<li>We would not be here without our early adopters (you!) and we deemed it important to pause, reflect and show gratitude.</li>
<li>We acknowledge that our journey is a marathon, not a sprint. With a long road ahead, supporting our member community is both rewarding and meaningful.</li>
<li>Simply put, wearing the Doggo t-shirt is an incredibly awesome experience.</li>
</ol>

    <p>Alastair Humphreys is a British adventurer and author. He has bicycled around the world, walked across southern India, rowed across the Atlantic, run six marathons in the Sahara and trekked 1,000 miles through the Empty Quarter. He was named one of National Geographic’s adventurers of the year in 2012. He is the author of 16 books, including “Local: A Search For Nearby Nature And Wildness,” from which this essay is adapted.</p>

<p>“Instructions for living a life:<br><em>Pay attention. <br>Be astonished. <br>Tell about it.</em>“<br>—Mary Oliver</p>



<p>“In the end, I think that a single mountain range is enough exploration for an entire lifetime.”<br>—Rickey Gates</p>
</div>



<p>For more than 20 years, my favorite thing has been to leave <em>here</em> behind, with all its ties and routines. To hit the road and make my way to <em>there</em>. I get twitchy being in one place for too long. I have been lucky enough to cycle a lap of the planet, row and sail the Atlantic, hike across southern India and trek over Arctic ice and Arabian sands. A spin of the globe and off I go on the open road. Home was for family, friends and real life, not for exploration and adventure.</p>



<p>However, my mood has shifted, like many people’s. With the climate in chaos, I can’t justify flying all over the globe for fun anymore, burning jet fuel and spewing carbon for selfies. It feels particularly inappropriate to write books that encourage everyone to get out and explore. If I love wild places so much, I’ve begun to wonder, am I willing to <em>not</em> visit them in order to help protect them?</p>



<p>Flying to distant lands is still a rare luxury. Only a tiny minority of the people on the planet step onto a plane each year; just 1% of us take more than half of all flights. How can more of us enjoy wild landscapes and the mental and physical benefits of getting out into nature without it costing the Earth?</p>



<p>I started writing about “microadventures” more than a decade ago: encouraging people to undertake weekend bike rides, overnight camps and wild swims close to home. Grand adventures shouldn’t just be for people with the time and money to cross continents. Neither should wild places only be for the lucky few with national parks on their doorstep, or those who have the freedom — so often affected by gender, race and other factors — to explore.</p>



<p>Family life also curtailed my own expeditions in recent years, while of course adding many delights. The never-ending merry-go-round of childcare and chores settled us in a less adventurous neck of the woods than I’d ever imagined for myself, on the fringes of a city in an unassuming landscape, pocked by a glow of sodium lights and the rush of busy roads.</p>



<p>It is a strange, in-between edge-land: There are fields but factories too. There are villages and farms, train tracks and tower blocks. I don’t like it. My family does though, and I like them. That’s reason enough. I’d much rather live in their world than alone in mine. Even so, I developed a tendency to blame the area for most of my frustrations, despite being aware of the paradise paradox — the false belief that a picture-perfect place will solve all your problems.</p>

      “I hoped to see things I would not ordinarily come across. I decided to treat everything as interesting.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>




<p>I felt a need to reconcile my enthusiasm for exploration with my decidedly unadventurous local environment. One morning I set down a heavy laundry basket on top of piles of homework scattered over the kitchen table, carried a pair of abandoned cereal bowls to the dishwasher, and wondered: What if this bog-standard corner of England was actually full of surprises if only I bothered to go out and look? Maybe the things I’ve chased from India to Iceland — adventure, nature, wildness, surprises, silence, perspective — were here too?</p>



<p>The first step was to get a map. Ordnance Survey, Britain’s national mapping agency, divides the whole country into 403 “Explorer” maps at 1:25,000 scale, meaning that 1 kilometer of land is represented by 4 centimeters of map. You can order a customized map with your own home right in the middle. I visited the O.S. website, zoomed in on where I lived, and clicked “Buy Now.”</p>



<p>A couple of days later, I met the postman at the door and eagerly carried the envelope across the garden to an old log outside my shed, where I could spread out the map. Unfolding a map is a ritual that launches all good journeys.</p>



<p>I ran my hands over it to flatten its creases. It showed an area totaling just 20 square kilometers, a tiny place. The map was divided into 400 individual grid squares, outlined in light blue — a single square kilometer each. I could comfortably walk the perimeter of any square in about an hour.</p>



<p>Each week, I decided, I would explore one of those squares in detail, doing my best to see everything there, to walk or cycle every footpath and street, and to learn as much as I could along the way. I wanted it to be serendipitous, not governed by my preferences. I hoped to see things I would not ordinarily come across. I decided to treat everything as interesting. The late <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2FZ_0d3yEI&amp;list=PLGTOFZa6hq1b0p7wVQWgxXbtvwIWqUMBZ&amp;index=2" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Terry Pratchett</a> once gave a lecture on “the importance of being amazed about absolutely everything,” which felt like a fitting mission statement.</p>

<p>“There is in fact a sort of harmony discoverable between the capabilities of the landscape within a circle of ten miles’ radius, or the limits of an afternoon walk, and the threescore years and ten of human life. It will never become quite familiar to you.”<br>—Henry David Thoreau</p>



<p>I studied my map for a while and found what appeared to be its most boring grid square: no roads, houses or rivers, just a single footpath, one pond and the merest flutter of a lonely contour line. Here, it seemed, was nothing at all, neatly outlined within crisp blue lines.</p>



<p>It was the ideal place to begin.</p>



<p>I folded up the map and headed out to have a look at nothing.</p>



<p>Sometime later, my car was being hauled out of a ditch by two construction workers. They were too polite to tell me what a moron I was. I’d flagged down their pickup to ask for help after my front wheel dropped off the edge of the tarmac into a void hidden by the hedge off the side of the road where I tried to park. As their engine revved and bits of my car crunched and cracked and fell off, I reasoned I was here to look for new experiences, so perhaps this was a good start?</p>



<p>I thanked the men, turned away from the car, squeezed through a barrier designed to keep out dirt bikers, then climbed over a block of graffitied concrete. I’d never been down this way before.</p>



<p>Somebody had planted a row of spindly saplings along the metal fence, tied up by scruffy blue string. Who could have done this? Why had they bothered? There were no houses here, and it would be at least a decade before the trees amounted to much.</p>



<p>Just beyond a discarded burger wrapper, a colorful, leaf-strewn footpath stretched away into the mist beneath a gloomy archway of damp trees. Autumn was making way for winter. It was early November, meaning that we had just entered the period known in the ancient Celtic calendar as the dark half of the year. My breath ballooned in the air and my fingers felt cold even in gloves.</p>



<p>Celts used to mark the turning of the year with four fire festivals midway between each equinox and solstice. Samhain was the most important of these, welcoming the dark winter months. People felt anxious at the weakening sun and lit fires to help it on its journey across the heavens. Samhain celebrations at the end of harvest were rowdy affairs filled with gorging, boozing and sacrificed cattle. Jack-o’-lanterns were carved from turnips and lit from within by glowing coal embers.</p>



<p>Some people took a flame from the community bonfire and carried it home to light a fire in their own hearth. At this time of year, they believed, the separation between our world and the spirit world dissolved, allowing more interactions between the two. The darkening days brought more concern and foreboding about the hungry months to come and the proximity of a closer supernatural realm. The fires and revelry must have been an intoxicating respite.</p>

<p>Once I can put a name to something, like a bird or tree, I seem to come across it more often, and I also appreciate it more for knowing the word. As Robert Macfarlane wrote in “Landmarks,” “Language deficit leads to attention deficit. As we further deplete our ability to name, describe and figure particular aspects of our places, our competence for understanding and imagining possible relationships with non-human nature is correspondingly depleted.”</p>



<p>Paying attention is what my teachers nagged me to do in what felt at the time like excruciatingly boring school lessons. Now I was walking around a little square on a map, belatedly learning how to be more observant, to fill in some of my knowledge gaps with the help of apps and research.
          </p>
        



<p>The Seek app, for example, employs some unfathomable voodoo magic to identify plants and creatures. I pointed my phone at a common reed, wondering what wisdom the mighty AI gods would bestow upon me. I had seen reeds countless times, but I didn’t know their official name. Seek provided it: “common reed!”</p>



<p>But the scaling of its taxonomy caught my eye. Family: grasses. Class: monocots. Kingdom: plants. Domain: eukaryotes. The sprawling immensity of life, too complex for me ever to grasp, had been ordered and tidied and simplified for this single plant in front of me: Phragmites australis.</p>



<p>There I stood on a damp path atop deep layers of late Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks, gawping at a common reeds, surrounded by multitudes. I could glimpse wonder and the connection between everyday observation and the curiosity that spins off into wider exploration of the cosmos.</p>



<p>Questions started to come. Who came to this isolated spot to graffiti so badly, and why? Who made the effort to gravel a small path over to a bench, cut branches to line the path and peg them down? Who built the bench from two stumps of birch and a hefty plank? Did the same person or people lay down a bed of wood chippings too, wood chippings that I could see had sprouted crooked brown mushrooms?</p>



<p>I wiped the bench dry with my sleeve, sat down and rummaged for the flask of coffee in my rucksack. I pulled my hood up over my woolly hat and sipped. My brain buzzed. I stared into the fog. Why, I wondered, did whoever built this bench put it right in front of a tangle of brambles and a massive pylon?</p>



<p>But then I spotted a small plaque inscribed to Brian — “a tireless campaigner for the canal.” I realized I was looking at this all wrong. I swiveled around. What I’d dismissed as a stagnant ditch was, in fact, an overgrown canal in the early stages of restoration. Along its banks were tall bullrushes like hotdogs on sticks, feathery reeds, blood-red hawthorn berries and a spiked metal security fence.</p>



<p>It wasn’t exactly paradise, but this was a framed view of nature, history, conservation and community all rolled in together. Brian’s bench, and the evident fondness and appreciation for this place that had inspired it, helped me cherish the view too.</p>

      “It wasn’t exactly paradise, but this was a framed view of nature, history, conservation and community all rolled in together.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>




<p>Presently, a man who looked to be in his fifties cycled down the canal path in hi-vis, the tires on his bike squashed rather flat. Tom Waits’s unmistakable gravelly voice played from a speaker on the handlebars, and the man sang along as he rode past without spotting me.</p>



<p><em>I never saw the morning ’til I stayed up all night.<br>I never saw my hometown until I stayed away too long.</em></p>



<p>There was little movement or birdsong in the air as I finished my coffee, just the sounds of a forklift truck in the industrial yard beyond the canal, reversing beeps, a rattling train somewhere in the distance. Nature seemed subdued in the morning mist.</p>



<p>It feels ridiculous to admit, but I still had not actually entered my first grid square. It was on the other side of the canal, which was too wide to leap over. I retraced my steps to try another way. Walking back down the lane, I picked up the burger wrapper I had stepped over earlier.</p>



<p>I pushed through a narrow gap between some bushes and a chain-link fence onto a narrow footpath, taking care not to snag my coat, then followed the path until I reached a gap by a fallen fencepost. I stepped over the tangled loops of wire and dropped down a wooded slope to a stagnant green pool. The surface was covered in duckweed, a tiny, quick-spreading plant that I later learned was being tested in the U.S. as a treatment for human sewage.</p>



<p>It was peaceful down there among the hawthorn bushes: a no man’s land littered with Carlsberg Export cans wedged between a railway line, industrial units, marshland and a Ministry of Defense firing range. Nobody knew I was here. Nobody I knew had ever been here. Why would anyone come?</p>



<p>I stirred the pond with a stick and its stinking mysteries bubbled up from the black depths. I picked an apple from a tree by the railway line and popped it into my rucksack. Then I climbed into a field and waded through wet, knee-deep grass, among what Seek taught me were yellow common toadflax flowers and purple thistles bejeweled with droplets of dew and strands of silk webs.</p>



<p>I headed toward the grazing meadows — once a marshland — that make up most of this “empty” grid square today. Gigantic electricity pylons marched across the land and the grey sky was striped with lines of cables running from an old coal-fired power station down on the coast. The station’s 200-meter-tall chimney gained some notoriety a few years ago when protesters climbed it to write a message to then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown. They only got as far as a colossal “GORDON” before being caught and summoned to court. They admitted trying to shut down the station, arguing that sabotaging it would prevent further climate warming.</p>



<p>Nobody had used this claim before in a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/11/activists.kingsnorthclimatecamp" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">lawful excuse</a>” defense, meaning they acted in with lawful justification to protect life. An Inuit leader supported the activists, arguing that climate change was affecting his way of life. The New York Times featured the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/magazine/14Ideas-Section2-A-t-004.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">story</a>, listing the eventual acquittal in its annual list of life-changing influential ideas. Later, the plant would be decommissioned, its enormous chimney blown up.</p>

<p>Here on the meadows under the power lines, the land was strikingly flat. I could see an elevated embankment far in the distance that protected the marsh from the wide river that fanned out toward an estuary. A silhouetted pony grazed on the grass bank and a dirt bike revved up and down it, having somehow found a way around the preventive barriers.</p>



<p>The noise, the movement and the human all seemed incongruous on this empty morning. I watched a ship slide down the river, heading out to sea with smoke streaming from its funnel. “Where are you going?” I called out. Which foreign port will you make landfall in? What will you see there? How will it smell? What cafe will the crew go to for a beer and a smoke, to stretch their legs? I used to travel to those far-off ports. I wondered if I was missing out. I continued walking, making a rough lap of the grid square, heading down toward its third corner.</p>



<p>One feature marked on the map was a tiny mound that had been defined with its own diddy contour ring, rising a whopping five meters above sea level. It appeared to be nothing more than a grassy wrinkle on the flat counterpane of the marsh. But I had learned it was an ancient barrow, a Bronze Age burial site constructed over a stone coffin that once contained a crouched skeleton and a necklace of beads made from fossilized sea sponges. Visible ancient history added a sense of awe to the innocuous mound and its empty metal cattle trough.</p>



<p>From my vantage point on the “hill,” I looked over a field of black cows and another of white sheep. The fields were separated by drainage dykes. The livestock were the only clue that this drained marsh was anything other than forgotten ground: in between, left behind. The animals play an important role in maintaining it and preventing it from being engulfed in scrub.</p>



<p>Two crows dipped overhead, calling out as they tumbled and rolled through the cold grey sky. Were they courting? Fighting? Playing? I could hear them swoosh as they dropped. I heard, also, the creaky wings of a pair of lumbering white swans flying by, then the begrudging, cranky take-off of a heron whose frog-hunting I disturbed in a ditch covered in neon-green algae.</p>



<p>I was hungry now, appreciative of the apple I’d pocketed earlier. It was huge, red and flecked with yellow. Lemony sunlight was burning off the morning’s mist. The apple’s crunch sounded loud in the quiet. I saw the distinctive swoop of a woodpecker and listened for its laughing call. Less easy to identify was either a weasel or a stoat that scurried across my path and disappeared into the long grass.</p>



<p>And then I was back to where I began, the lap of the square complete. I finished the sweet apple and tossed the core into the hedge. I took home a dinged car, a bunch of photographs and pages of notes.</p>



<p>I had selected the most empty-looking location as the beginning of a journey across a map of an area I’d often dismissed as boring. Three hundred and ninety-nine grid squares awaited: abundance and possibility.</p>



<p>It was a fine beginning.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of ordinary apps, including popular ones such as 9gag, Kik, and a series of caller ID apps, are part of a global surveillance capability that starts with ads inside each app, and ends with the apps’ users being swept up into a powerful mass monitoring tool advertised to national security agencies that can track the physical location, hobbies, and family members of people to build billions of profiles, according to a 404 Media investigation.</p><p>404 Media’s investigation, based on now deleted marketing materials and videos, technical forensic analysis, and research from privacy activists, provides one of the clearest examinations yet of how advertisements in ordinary mobile apps can ultimately lead to surveillance by spy firms and their government clients through the real time bidding data supply chain. The pipeline involves smaller, obscure advertising firms and advertising industry giants like Google. In response to queries from 404 Media, Google and PubMatic, another ad firm, have already cut-off a company linked to the surveillance firm.</p><p>“The pervasive surveillance machine that has been developed for digital advertising now directly enables government mass surveillance. Many businesses, from app publishers to advertisers to big tech, are acting completely irresponsibly. This must end,” Wolfie Christl, the principal of Cracked Labs, an Austrian research institute and co-author of a <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Europes-hidden-security-crisis.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>paper published last year that researched</u></a> the surveillance tool, told 404 Media.</p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Do you know anything else about about Patternz, Nuviad, or RTB surveillance? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +44 20 8133 5190. Otherwise, send me an email at joseph@404media.co.</strong></b></p></div><h2 id="patternz"><strong>Patternz</strong></h2><p>The mass monitoring tool in question is called Patternz. In a video uploaded to YouTube in January 2023 that was removed once 404 Media started to make inquiries, Rafi Ton, the CEO of Patternz, says “we analyze behavior of over 600,000 applications.” One slide he brings up during the video says that “the mobile phone becomes the de-facto tracking bracelet,” and suggests tracking can be achieved through “virtually any app that has ads.” The video appears to be a demonstration Ton is giving to potential clients for the Patternz system. The context of the pitch is for Patternz to counter COVID-19, but Ton acknowledges that the platform was built as a “homeland security platform.” In other <a href="https://sovsys.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PATTERNZ-NATIONAL-SECURITY-PATTERN-DETECTION.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>marketing materials online</u></a>, Patternz pitches itself specifically to “national security agencies.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Wealthy tech entrepreneurs including Elon Musk <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-openai-really-wants/">launched OpenAI in 2015</a> as <a data-offer-url="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai&quot;}" href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a nonprofit research lab</a> that they said would involve society and <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/how-elon-musk-and-y-combinator-plan-to-stop-computers-from-taking-over-17e0e27dd02a#.1mz74bfmo">the public</a> in the development of powerful AI, unlike Google and other giant tech companies working behind closed doors. In line with that spirit, OpenAI’s reports to US tax authorities have from its founding said that any member of the public can review copies of its governing documents, financial statements, and conflict of interest rules.</p><p>But when WIRED requested those records last month, OpenAI said its policy had changed, and the company provided only a narrow financial statement that omitted the majority of its operations.</p><p>"We provide financial statements when requested,” company spokesperson Niko Felix says. “OpenAI aligns our practices with industry standards, and since 2022 that includes not publicly distributing additional internal documents.”</p><p>OpenAI’s abandonment of the long-standing transparency pledge obscures information that could shed light on the recent <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-boardroom-drama-sam-altman-could-mess-up-your-future/">near-implosion</a> of a company with crucial influence over the future of AI and could help outsiders understand its vulnerabilities. In November, OpenAI’s board <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-ceo-sam-altman-is-out-after-losing-confidence-of-board/">fired CEO Sam Altman</a>, implying in a statement that he was untrustworthy and had endangered its mission to ensure AI <a data-offer-url="https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition&quot;}" href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“benefits all humanity.”</a> An employee and investor revolt soon forced the board to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-openai-back/">reinstate Altman</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-officially-returns-to-openai-board-seat-microsoft/">eject most of its own members</a>, with an overhauled slate of directors <a data-offer-url="https://openai.com/blog/sam-altman-returns-as-ceo-openai-has-a-new-initial-board" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://openai.com/blog/sam-altman-returns-as-ceo-openai-has-a-new-initial-board&quot;}" href="https://openai.com/blog/sam-altman-returns-as-ceo-openai-has-a-new-initial-board" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vowing</a> to review the crisis and enact structural changes to win back the trust of stakeholders.</p><p>Access to OpenAI’s conflict-of-interest policy could show what power the new board really has over Altman and his outside pursuits, which include personal investments in numerous startups pursuing AI projects and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-ceo-altman-says-davos-future-ai-depends-energy-breakthrough-2024-01-16/">a nuclear reactor maker</a>. His day job and personal projects intermingling played some role in board members’ distrust, according to people involved in the situation but not authorized to discuss it. In 2019, while Altman was at the helm, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-buy-ai-chips-startup-sam-altman/">OpenAI signed a nonbinding letter of intent</a> to buy $51 million of AI chips from Rain, a startup in which he has invested more than $1 million, WIRED reported last month. OpenAI hasn’t moved forward with a purchase. Felix says Altman is transparent with the board about his investments and follows a process for managing potential conflicts.</p><p>Some sunlight on OpenAI’s governing documents could reveal whether it has made revisions to stabilize an unusual corporate structure and potentially pacify backers such as Microsoft. The company’s founding bylaws, <a href="https://rct.doj.ca.gov/Verification/Web/Search.aspx?facility=Y">publicly available</a> via its 2016 application to the Internal Revenue Service for <a data-offer-url="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations&quot;}" href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tax-exempt status</a>, indicate how a fraction of the board could take control and push out Altman. OpenAI’s filings to the IRS through 2022 reported that no “significant changes” had ever been made to its governing documents. But the company almost certainly made updates after Altman’s return to allow it to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-officially-returns-to-openai-board-seat-microsoft/">give a nonvoting seat</a> on the nonprofit board to Microsoft, whose CEO, Satya Nadella, complained publicly that he had been blindsided by Altman’s firing. Any additional changes made at that time remain a secret.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>WIRED’s request for the documents promised in OpenAI’s IRS filings fell to the counsel for its nonprofit to decide on. Their denial and new policy of withholding those documents extends an existing trend of dwindling openness at a project founded on transparency. OpenAI once published extensive detail about its AI inventions but has more recently guarded the technical details and data behind its most famous tool, ChatGPT. Felix, the company spokesperson, says San Francisco-based OpenAI discloses all the material required by the IRS and California’s attorney general and that it regularly publishes information about <a data-offer-url="https://openai.com/research/weak-to-strong-generalization" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://openai.com/research/weak-to-strong-generalization&quot;}" href="https://openai.com/research/weak-to-strong-generalization" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its research and safety work</a>, while also making its research freely available in the form of tools such as ChatGPT.</p><p>OpenAI’s declining openness has been most notable since 2019, when the nonprofit <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/compete-google-openai-seeks-investorsand-profits/">created a for-profit subsidiary</a> to house most of its AI development and draw outside investment. That opened the way for OpenAI to hitch its future to the largesse of Microsoft, one of the tech giants it was founded to challenge, and also to shroud its finances.

Like all US nonprofits, it must publicly share upon request a copy of its annual report to the IRS and indicate in those submissions whether any additional documents like its bylaws or similar or related documents such as a governing constitution or conflict of interest policy were also available to the public during the last year.</p><p>Some notable nonprofits do that, like the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which publishes its <a data-offer-url="https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/bill_and_melinda_gates_foundation_board_governing_principles.pdf" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/bill_and_melinda_gates_foundation_board_governing_principles.pdf&quot;}" href="https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/bill_and_melinda_gates_foundation_board_governing_principles.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bylaws</a> and rules <a data-offer-url="https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/conflict_of_interest_policy.pdf" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/conflict_of_interest_policy.pdf&quot;}" href="https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/conflict_of_interest_policy.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on conflicts</a> and <a data-offer-url="https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/personal-relationships-policy.pdf" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/personal-relationships-policy.pdf&quot;}" href="https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/personal-relationships-policy.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">workplace relationships</a>, but it’s not standard practice.</p><p>“It is not common for organizations to make their governing documents or internal policies public,” says Rick Cohen, chief operating and communications officer for <a data-offer-url="https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/&quot;}" href="https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Council of Nonprofits</a>, an advocacy group.</p><p>Yet for seven consecutive years, from its founding through 2022, OpenAI stated in its <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/810861541">annual IRS filings</a> that it made those submissions as well as other files available “upon request.” It’s unclear if anyone ever took OpenAI up on the invitation in the years through 2022—OpenAI won’t say.</p><p>Last month, after two days of waiting on OpenAI communications staff to fulfill an emailed request for its governing documents, conflict rules, and financial statements, WIRED rang the doorbell outside OpenAI’s San Francisco headquarters on December 14 asking to see all those documents. A receptionist said over an intercom that wouldn’t be possible, hung up, and didn’t reengage. OpenAI’s IRS filing for 2023 that would reflect it has changed its previous policy isn’t due until later this year.</p><p>To <a data-offer-url="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/form-990-resources-and-tools" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/form-990-resources-and-tools&quot;}" href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/form-990-resources-and-tools" rel="noopener" target="_blank">encourage oversight</a> of nonprofits, <a data-offer-url="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organization-public-disclosure-and-availability-requirements" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organization-public-disclosure-and-availability-requirements&quot;}" href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organization-public-disclosure-and-availability-requirements" rel="noopener" target="_blank">US tax law requires</a> them to at least make their annual reports to the IRS, form 990s, available for public inspection <a data-offer-url="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/public-disclosure-and-availability-of-exempt-organizations-returns-and-applications-disclosures-required" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/public-disclosure-and-availability-of-exempt-organizations-returns-and-applications-disclosures-required&quot;}" href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/public-disclosure-and-availability-of-exempt-organizations-returns-and-applications-disclosures-required" rel="noopener" target="_blank">at their offices the same day they were requested</a> if they are not posted on an organization’s website.

OpenAI hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing, and Felix says OpenAI’s reports are available online through government and research databases.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Even when nonprofits tell the IRS their internal documents are open to all, they can be difficult to access. “When I have asked a group for forms it says are public, I basically never get them unless I <em>cc</em> the IRS and the organization's general counsel,” says Brian Galle, a Georgetown University law professor specializing in nonprofit issues.</p><p>Sunshine Dividends</p><p>The financial statement OpenAI shared in response to WIRED’s request excludes the results of OpenAI’s “affiliated entities,” most crucially the for-profit unit that sells ChatGPT and other services, citing a desire to protect trade secrets. The statement, which covers 2022, shows just $44,000 in revenue and $1.3 million in expenses. That’s accurate for the nonprofit, but OpenAI overall reportedly generated <a data-offer-url="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-annualized-revenue-tops-1-6-billion-as-customers-shrug-off-ceo-drama" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-annualized-revenue-tops-1-6-billion-as-customers-shrug-off-ceo-drama&quot;}" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-annualized-revenue-tops-1-6-billion-as-customers-shrug-off-ceo-drama" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hundreds of millions of dollars in sales last year</a> and <a data-offer-url="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt&quot;}" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spends even more</a> on high-end computers and top-flight researchers.</p><p>Investors in OpenAI’s for-profit arm and employees of the company likely have access to some of the records the company now declines to share publicly, though they are bound by nondisclosure agreements covering internal files. Because OpenAI’s nonprofit takes in virtually no public support, it lacks the incentive that some nonprofits have to be more transparent so as to loosen the purse strings of donor or grant makers.</p><p>OpenAI might win more loyalty from its customers or trust from regulators by opening up, but Altman has said the company didn’t lose any clients during its two weeks of high drama and generally has been greeted warmly by political leaders. The company may feel that the ongoing board review into OpenAI’s governance and what is shared from its findings will be enough.</p><p>Without a reversal in OpenAI’s policy and a follow-through on its promises, so much about an increasingly influential organization may never become publicly known, like whether the new board amends the conflict-of-interest policy to better wrangle Altman and other executives. Back in 2022, it may have been possible to get the answer with just the ring of a doorbell.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>
