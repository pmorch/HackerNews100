We’ve been doing this successfully through the efforts of our own legal team, external counsel, and the extraordinary efforts of people on the Internet looking for prior art (and getting rewarded for it) through our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-jengo/">Project Jengo</a>.</p><p>While we refuse to pay trolls for their meritless claims, we’ve been happy to <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-jengo-2-first-three-winners/">award</a> <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/arkansas-engineer-wins-round-3-of-project-jengo-and-cloudflare-continues-to-win-at-the-patent-office/">prizes</a> to Project Jengo <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/former-rd-engineer-wins-round-2-of-project-jengo-and-cloudflare-wins-at-the-patent-office/">participants</a> who help stop the trolls through prior art that invalidates their patents or claims. Project Jengo participants helped us in the past roundly beat the patent troll <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/winning-the-blackbird-battle/">Blackbird</a> (who subsequently went out of business).</p><p>Today, we’re back to talk about yet another win thanks to a lot of work by us, our external counsel, and Project Jengo participants.</p><h3 id="sable">Sable<br></h3><p>Last Thursday, on a clear, sunny morning in Waco, Texas, a jury returned a verdict after less than two hours of deliberation. The jury found that Cloudflare did not infringe the patent asserted against Cloudflare by patent trolls Sable IP and Sable Networks. </p><p>And while that would have been enough to decide the case by itself, the jury went further and found that Sable’s old and broadly-written patent claim was invalid and never should have been granted in the first place–meaning they can no longer assert the claim against anyone else. Since Sable first sued us, we’ve invalidated significant parts of three Sable patents, hamstringing their ability to bring lawsuits against other companies. </p><p>It’s worth noting that very few lawsuits ever reach a jury. Most non-lawyers are shocked to learn that only about 1% of civil cases make it to trial, because trials are generally what they see on TV or in film. But professional litigators know that almost all cases are resolved much earlier through procedures that are much less entertaining to watch on screen: written motions, delay, or settlement. A big reason for this is that taking a case to trial–even on simple matters–is extremely costly. In patent cases, that means millions of dollars.</p><p>As we described in our first <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-jengo">Project Jengo blog post</a>, these costs are the threat that patent trolls rely on to extract sizable settlements out of innovative technology companies. It’s often easier for technology companies to pay a settlement rather than pay millions more in litigation costs that likely can’t be recovered even if the technology company wins. Patent trolls usually don’t want to incur the costs of going to trial either, but they typically wait for the other side to blink first and pay up–especially because the company accused of infringement is the one that faces the risk of a bad verdict and damages award. </p><p>But every once in a while the target doesn’t blink. Cloudflare’s hard fought victory, the culmination of three years of litigation, is a strong warning to all patent trolls–we will not be intimidated into playing your game. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="background">Background<br></h3><p>Let’s recap how we got here. This case began in March 2021 when Sable Networks and Sable IP filed a complaint against Cloudflare in federal court. Sable asserted around <strong>100 claims</strong> spanning <strong>four patents</strong> against multiple Cloudflare products and features. The patents relied on by Sable were filed around the turn of the century, and they addressed the hardware-based router technology of the day. More specifically, they addressed a particular type of hardware focused on “flows'' composed of multiple linked packets. This approach is not used by modern-day software-defined services delivered on the cloud, particularly not services like Cloudflare that handle traffic on a packet-by-packet basis. But that didn’t stop Sable from arguing its broadly-worded patents covered essentially all router operations, including Cloudflare’s cutting edge technology–well beyond what the asserted patent claims were ever intended to cover. </p><p>As with many patent trolls, Sable IP has never made or sold products and doesn’t employ a single person to create or design actual technology. Sable IP was created as a shell entity in 2020 to monetize the patent portfolio of Sable Networks, which itself was formed in 2006 and allegedly acquired the assets–including the patents–of Caspian Networks, a router company that had shuttered its operations. Sable IP is one of many such shell entities formed to “monetize” patents through lawyer-driven litigation campaigns. &nbsp;</p><p>Cloudflare wasn’t Sable’s only target. Sable sued a number of other companies, including Cisco, Fortinet, Check Point, SonicWall, Juniper Networks, and others, each of which eventually resolved the lawsuit against them out of court. Cloudflare took a different approach.</p><p>To kick off our fight against Sable, we launched another round of Project Jengo, crowdsourcing submissions of prior art for all of Sable’s active patents–including patents not asserted against Cloudflare–and committing a $100,000 award to be split among winners that submitted strong prior art. Dedicated readers will remember Cloudflare’s <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-project-jengo-saga-how-cloudflare-stood-up-to-a-patent-troll-and-won">first round of Project Jengo</a>, which helped put the notorious patent troll Blackbird out of business. We’ve received dozens of submissions since we launched this Sable-focused round of Project Jengo, and have awarded \$70,000 since 2021. We will distribute the remaining \$30,000 to winners of the Final Awards which we will announce after the official conclusion of the case per the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/jengo/sable-rules/">Project Jengo Rules</a>. </p><p>Relying on prior art, we filed petitions for <em>inter partes </em>review to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) seeking to invalidate Sable’s patents. The <em>inter partes</em> process is an administrative proceeding that involves filing briefs for administrative patent judges at the USPTO to determine if a patent should have been issued in the first place. In many cases it's a helpful process available to try and limit the threat of patent trolls. In May 2022, to avoid responding to one of those petitions–and to avoid the risk that its patent would be canceled altogether–Sable voluntarily canceled all of the claims asserted against Cloudflare under one of its patents. And in January 2023, we were successful in invalidating the portions of a second Sable patent that had been asserted against us. &nbsp; </p><p>Two patents down, Sable refused to give up. By December 2023, through its petitions to the USPTO and related motions before the court, Cloudflare had successfully narrowed the number of patents and claims at issue from approximately 100 claims across four, to just five claims from two patents. Then, at the pretrial conference on December 13, 2023, the court issued summary judgment in our favor on a third Sable patent. Summary judgment is a process where the court determines that an argument is so clear that no reasonable jury could rule otherwise. This further narrowed the case to a single asserted claim on a single patent–claim 25 of U.S. Patent No. 7,012,919. </p><p>Through years of hard work, we’d successfully whittled down Sable’s case from about 100 claims across four patents to <strong>just one claim of one patent</strong>. But despite all that success, the fact remained…we were heading to trial, and it can be difficult to know what a jury will decide–and what damages they may award–on heavily technical issues.</p><h3 id="trials-and-tribulations-for-sable-ip-and-sable-networks">Trials and tribulations for Sable IP and Sable Networks<br></h3><p>We weren’t just heading to trial, we were heading to the Western District of Texas. Waco, Texas, to be precise, where Sable chose to file its lawsuit. The Western District of Texas has in recent years become <a href="https://www2.law.temple.edu/10q/how-the-west-became-the-east-the-patent-litigation-explosion-in-the-western-district-of-texas/">a popular venue for patent plaintiffs,</a> as it has a reputation for being a friendly jurisdiction for patent holders. </p><p>Sable’s trial story was not compelling. On the technical merits, Sable had the unenviable task of trying to map decades-old flow-based hardware router technology onto Cloudflare’s modern, software-defined packet-by-packet architecture. They attempted to do so through a series of hand waving exercises, equating the “line cards” required by the patent to various different software and hardware used by Cloudflare, and suggesting that any flow of packets across Cloudflare’s network could be construed as the specific “micro-flows” at the center of its patent. </p><p>Beyond the technical issues, Sable’s story was simple, though not very attractive–Sable wanted money. Having acquired rights to the patents of a failed hardware company, they were seeking to “monetize” those patents to the greatest extent possible. If that meant leveraging a patent related to decades-old router hardware to sue a cloud-based service provider, so be it. And if it required leaps of logic and untethered claims that might make a toddler blush, oh well. &nbsp; </p><p>When it was our turn, we told the jury <em>our </em>story. How Cloudflare was founded to help build a better Internet by moving past old, hardware-based solutions to new, cloud-based solutions delivered through our global network. We explained the hard work put into building our network, and all the services that sit on top of it. One of our outstanding engineers described what it’s like to create a new product, working with teams of engineers, product managers, and others to bring something exciting to the market for the first time. </p><p>We drilled down into Sable’s twenty-year old patent, explaining the many reasons why the patent does not describe anything that Cloudflare actually does. Among other things, the patent requires various steps to be performed at a “line card,” and Cloudflare’s accused edge servers don’t include a single such line card. And while the patent focused on flow-based routing, Cloudflare designed its system to perform packet-by-packet inspection to protect against malicious traffic. We also explained that the patent claim asserted against Cloudflare is invalid–and never should have been issued–because it was obvious in view of the prior art and lacked the required written description. In fact, Sable’s patent covered, at best, only technology that had already been described by inventors at Nortel Networks and Lucent Technologies–leading routing technology companies at the time. &nbsp;</p><p>During closing arguments, Cloudflare’s trial lawyer made one thing clear–this case was about more than Sable or Cloudflare. The patent system was designed to foster innovation and promote the progress of science, but what Sable was doing was exactly the opposite: bringing meritless cases in an effort to turn a buck, and stifling progress in the process. That distortion and abuse of the patent system has to stop and, ultimately, only the jury had the power to end it.</p><p>To our great satisfaction, the jury answered that call. The jury’s decision did not take long. Less than two hours after leaving the courtroom to deliberate, the jury returned with a verdict that sends a message far beyond the courthouse. No infringement by Cloudflare, <em>and<strong> </strong></em>Sable’s patent is invalid.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/02/E6A69D49-2943-4997-B0CA-98F98FB95A26_1_201_a.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2930" height="2198"><figcaption>The combined Cloudflare and external counsel team</figcaption></figure><h3 id="what%E2%80%99s-next">What’s next<br></h3><p>We’ll enjoy this verdict for a long time, but the hard work doesn’t stop here. Cloudflare is dedicated to rebalancing a system that is being distorted by trolls like Sable. As part of our efforts, we look forward to announcing the final awards for Project Jengo on this blog following the conclusion of the case. We’ll also plan to share additional thoughts and insights we’ve gleaned from facing down a troll at trial.</p><p>For now, we want to express our sincere gratitude to the judge and jury for the hard work they put in at trial, including the jury weighing the evidence and understanding the complex technology at issue in the case. Cloudflare is deeply grateful for the jury’s time and efforts over the past week, its careful consideration of all the facts, and for its verdict. We also again want to thank our amazing trial lawyers from Charhon Callahan Robson &amp; Garza PLLC, and The Dacus Firm. If you end up with a patent troll problem, we recommend them highly.</p></div></section><div><p>We protect<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/" rel="noreferrer">entire corporate networks</a>, help customers build<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/" rel="noreferrer">Internet-scale applications efficiently</a>, accelerate any<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/performance/accelerate-internet-applications/" rel="noreferrer">website or Internet application</a>,<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/" rel="noreferrer">ward off DDoS attacks</a>, keep<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-security/" rel="noreferrer">hackers at bay</a>, and can help you on<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/" rel="noreferrer">your journey to Zero Trust</a>.</p><p>Visit<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://one.one.one.one/" rel="noreferrer">1.1.1.1</a> <!-- -->from any device to get started with our free app that makes your Internet faster and safer.</p><p>To learn more about our mission to help build a better Internet,<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/" rel="noreferrer">start here</a>.

<p>While there have been efforts by AMD over the years to make it easier to port codebases targeting NVIDIA's CUDA API to run atop HIP/ROCm, it still requires work on the part of developers. The tooling has improved such as with HIPIFY to help in auto-generating but it isn't any simple, instant, and guaranteed solution -- especially if striving for optimal performance. Over the past two years AMD has quietly been funding an effort though to bring binary compatibility so that many NVIDIA CUDA applications could run atop the AMD ROCm stack at the library level -- a drop-in replacement without the need to adapt source code. In practice for many real-world workloads, it's a solution for end-users to run CUDA-enabled software without any developer intervention. Here is more information on this "skunkworks" project that is now available as open-source along with some of my own testing and performance benchmarks of this CUDA implementation built for Radeon GPUs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=radeon-cuda-zluda&amp;image=radeon_cuda_1_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=radeon-cuda-zluda&amp;image=radeon_cuda_1_med" alt="Radeon GPU running CUDA Blender"></a></p>
<p>From several years ago you may recall <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/ZLUDA">ZLUDA</a> that was for <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-ZLUDA-CUDA-For-GPUs">enabling CUDA support on Intel graphics</a>. That open-source project aimed to provide <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/ZLUDA-v2-Released">a drop-in CUDA implementation on Intel graphics</a> built atop Intel oneAPI Level Zero. ZLUDA was discontinued due to private reasons but it turns out that the developer behind that (and who was also employed by Intel at the time), Andrzej Janik, was contracted by AMD in 2022 to effectively adapt ZLUDA for use on AMD GPUs with HIP/ROCm. Prior to being contracted by AMD, Intel was considering ZLUDA development. However, they ultimately turned down the idea and did not provide funding for the project.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=radeon-cuda-zluda&amp;image=radeon_cuda_2_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=radeon-cuda-zluda&amp;image=radeon_cuda_2_med" alt="Radeon GPU with CUDA-Z on Linux"></a></p>
<p>Andrzej Janik spent the past two years bringing ZLUDA to Radeon GPUs and it works: many CUDA software can run on HIP/ROCm without any modifications -- or other processes... Just run the binaries as you normally would while ensuring that the ZLUDA library replacements to CUDA are loaded. For reasons unknown to me, AMD decided this year to discontinue funding the effort and not release it as any software product. But the good news was that there was a clause in case of this eventuality: Janik could open-source the work if/when the contract ended.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=radeon-cuda-zluda&amp;image=radeon_cuda_8" alt="Radeon ZLUDA Git commit"></p>
<p>Andrzej Janik reached out and provided access to the new ZLUDA implementation for AMD ROCm to allow me to test it out and benchmark it in advance of today's planned public announcement. I've been testing it out for a few days and it's been a positive experience: CUDA-enabled software indeed running atop ROCm and without any changes. Even proprietary renderers and the like working with this "CUDA on Radeon" implementation.</p>
<p>The ZLUDA implementation though isn't 100% fail-safe as NVIDIA OptiX support not being fully supported and some features such as software not using PTX assembly code isn't currently handled. But for the most part this implementation is surprisingly capable for being a single developer effort.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=radeon-cuda-zluda&amp;image=radeon_cuda_5_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=radeon-cuda-zluda&amp;image=radeon_cuda_5_med" alt="Radeon ZLUDA libraries"></a></p>
<p>For those wondering about the open-source code, it's dual-licensed under either Apache 2.0 or MIT. Rust fans will be excited to know the Rust programming language is leveraged for this Radeon implementation.</p>
<p>NOTE: In my screenshots and for the past two years of development the exposed device name for Radeon GPUs via CUDA has just been "Graphics Device" rather than the actual AMD Radeon graphics adapter with ROCm. The reason for this has been due to CUDA benchmarks auto-reporting results and other software that may have automated telemetry, to avoid leaking the fact of Radeon GPU use under CUDA, it's been set to the generic "Graphics Device" string. I'm told as part of today's open-sourcing of this ZLUDA on Radeon code that the change will be in place to expose the actual Radeon graphics card string rather than the generic "Graphics Device" concealer.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Smartphone Screens Are About to Become Speakers" data-elid="2667208046" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/piezoelectric-speakers" data-authors="Vineet Ganju" data-page-title="Smartphone Screens Are About to Become Speakers - IEEE Spectrum"><p><strong>Today’</strong><strong>s mobile-device speakers</strong> and haptic generators have several problems.
</p><p>
	The first is with the components themselves. The speakers in your smartphone and the system that gives your finger feedback when you touch a virtual button may be relatively small, but they are still big enough to limit how thin our mobile devices can get. These little components are also delicate, as you may have learned if you have dropped your phone. And they require openings in the enclosure that can admit moisture or debris.
</p><p>
	Then there is a problem with the way we perceive the sound they emit. Speakers usually sit on the sides or back of our devices. The sound is supposed to be coming from the image that our eyes see on the screen, but our ears know it’s coming from somewhere else. This perceptual dissonance limits our ability to immerse ourselves in the experience.
</p><p>
	We could solve all these problems at once if we could use the display panel itself as the source of sound and haptic feedback. The technology to do this is now available—it’s a thin piezoelectric transducer. And it’s going to be moving into mobile phones, laptops, and wearables by the end of this year.
</p><h2>Speakers today</h2><p>
	Traditional speakers function by running a current through a coil, creating a magnetic field that moves a magnet attached to the speaker cone, which in turn displaces air to create a sound wave. The speaker can be no smaller than is allowed by the size of the coil and the cone, which must be wide enough and long enough to displace a reasonable volume of air. Its mechanical durability is limited by the precision with which its small moving parts must be assembled.
</p><p>
	Haptic generators in handsets typically are linear resonant actuators, which are electrically and mechanically like speakers but are optimized to create low-frequency vibrations in a solid rather than sound waves in the air.

One labeled &quot;Traditional laptop speaker module&quot; and the other is &quot;Piezoelectric speaker.&quot;"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Replacing traditional speakers with piezoelectric transducers will allow devices to be much thinner.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">James Provost</small></p><p>
	It turns out that both sound and haptic generation can be wrung from the display of a mobile device. The display is a uniform, flat, semiflexible surface–If you tap on it with a fingernail, you can hear it vibrate. The technology to turn flat, semiflexible surfaces into loudspeakers dates to the early years of high fidelity.
</p><p>
	 In the 1950s, you could buy just the part of the speaker that converted electricity into motion—the coil and piston—and attach the piston to a wall or the panel of a cabinet. The wall or panel then vibrated—like a speaker cone—creating the air-pressure waves we perceive as sound. That idea remained a novelty, mainly because it was a do-it-yourself project with unpredictable results. Finding the right surface, mounting the driver in the right place, and powering it properly turned out to be about as easy as building a really good violin.
</p><p>
	More recently, some flat-screen TV developers have turned the screens of large-format TVs into speakers using a similar principle. They use powerful transducers to vibrate the whole display panel at audio frequencies. This delivers the goods: thin displays, no speakers. According to reviewers, the fidelity is great at midrange and high frequencies (if you want low frequencies, you’ll want a supplementary subwoofer). And the sound really does seem to be coming from the images on the screen. But these systems are expensive and require high-voltage amplifiers that consume considerable power, so they need to be shrunk before they can fit into a mobile device.
</p><h2>Enter Piezoelectrics</h2><p>
	To do the job in smaller devices you need piezoelectric transducers. These are made up of tiny single crystals, such as quartz or some ceramics, with two electrodes attached. When you apply a voltage across the electrodes, the material physically bends.
</p><p>
	That bending is called the converse piezoelectric effect. In 1880, physicists Pierre and Jacques Curie observed that when certain crystals were subjected to mechanical force, a voltage would appear between the faces of the crystal; they called this the piezoelectric effect (<em>piezo</em> is Greek for “to press”). This effect is due to the interaction between natural electric dipoles in the crystals and mechanical stresses in the crystals’ molecules. Roughly speaking, bending the crystal causes the dipoles to align, creating a bulk electric field.
</p><p>
	A year later the Curies demonstrated that the converse was true: If a voltage was applied between the faces of these crystals, the dipoles would bend the crystal as they try to align with the field. Work on piezoelectric materials subsequently expanded to include ceramics.
</p><p><img id="accfa" data-rm-shortcode-id="749833884fd6e14cb56819779faaf252" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-a-laptop-showing-traditional-speakers-and-piezoelectric-speakers.png?id=51430421&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-a-laptop-showing-traditional-speakers-and-piezoelectric-speakers.png?id=51430421&amp;width=980" width="2700" height="1890" alt="An illustration of a laptop showing traditional speakers and piezoelectric speakers."><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">When piezoelectric transducers vibrate the display itself to create sound waves, the sound seems to come directly from the image on the screen, a much more realistic effect.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">James Provost</small></p><p>
	So by applying an alternating voltage, you can make the transducer vibrate with rather considerable force. These vibrations can be slow—the kind needed for haptic feedback—or very fast, to the highest audio frequencies and beyond. While creating the effect with ceramic material requires relatively high voltages—in the range of 40 volts or more—it requires very little current and, hence, little power—far less than the power used by mobile device speakers today.
</p><p>
	Using piezoelectric transducers to generate sound isn’t a new idea. In fact, they’ve been used for decades to produce the unbearable shriek of a smoke alarm.
</p><p>
	Of course, using piezoelectrics to produce a full range of high-quality audio is a long way from making a smoke alarm screech. There are a number of challenges to making it work in a handheld device. There is the need for an amplifier able to step up the voltage that batteries can provide, with high efficiency to conserve energy, and with minimum noise, to preserve audio quality. And the audio signal needs some preprocessing before you send it to the transducer, to correct for the characteristics of the transducer and the display panel that the transducer will shake.
</p><h2>Driving the Transducers</h2><p>
	But we at <a href="https://www.synaptics.com/" target="_blank">Synaptics</a> think that we’ve met those challenges. We’ve developed a chip that incorporates a low-noise, high-voltage boost amplifier and a digital signal processor that sits on a device’s main board and drives a ceramic piezoelectric transducer attached to the back of the display. This does take up space, but then again, it eliminates the moving coil speaker. The exact placement and number of these amplifier-transducer sets depends on the mechanical design of the device and the desired audio modes—one set is enough to replace the handheld receiver functionality in a smartphone, but a second set will be needed to also replace the speakerphone function. That configuration will be the more typical one.
</p><p>
	We expect to see our chip in smartphones, wearables, and laptop computers by the end of 2024.

"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Traditional speaker modules sit among the other components of a computer or mobile device, taking up valuable real estate. When, instead, thin piezoelectric transducers vibrate the display to generate sound waves and haptic effects, that space is freed for other uses.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">James Provost</small></p><p>
	The immediate benefits of moving away from traditional magnetic coil speakers are many. The piezoelectric transducer material requires only one millimeter of enclosure thickness, compared to several millimeters for dynamic speakers or linear resonant actuators, enabling a new generation of thinner handheld devices. Yet such transducers can produce the sound quality and the loudness of the best miniature dynamic speakers. They are being made by a few companies, including <a href="https://www.tdk.com/en/index.html" target="_blank">TDK</a>; others have yet to be announced publicly.
</p><p>
	Since the transducers are bonded to the display panel inside the enclosure, they require no openings that could allow moisture or dirt inside.
</p><p>
	Most importantly, the transducers produce sound waves from the front of the display. This means the sound is directed at the user, not away from the user or off to the side. As the success of sound-generating displays in large-screen TVs has demonstrated, this does in fact provide a more immersive experience. When you see the T-Rex throw back its head and roar, your brain locates the source of the sound at the image of the beast, not somewhere off to the side.
</p><p>
	Many of today’s handheld devices do attempt to correct for this problem by what is called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-audio" target="_self">psychoacoustic processing</a>, using an algorithm to change the amplitude and phase of the sound waves coming from the speakers, mimicking some of the very complex things that your ears do as sound waves enter them from different directions. The success of these algorithms depends on the surroundings, and extra processor cycles take noticeable energy from the device’s battery. Having the sound physically originate on the display is a far simpler solution.
</p><p>
	As for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/haptx-inc-reveals-new-haptic-glove-for-virtual-reality" target="_self">haptic feedback</a>, using the same piezoelectric transducers that generate sound to generate haptic feedback eliminates the need for separate driver electronics and a motor to shake the display.
</p><h2>A Two-Way Street</h2><p>
	Also, recall that the piezoelectric effect works both ways. So when you touch the display panel, not only can a conventional touch sensor determine where you are touching, but the piezoelectric transducer can tell how hard you are pressing. This opens a whole new realm of feedback for interactive user interfaces and immersive touchscreen games.
</p><p>
	It also raises an interesting possibility that, frankly, has not been thoroughly explored yet. When a touch, or even reasonably loud ambient noise, flexes the display panel, it will also flex the transducer, generating a voltage. This electrical signal could be harvested to charge the device’s battery, providing a level of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7503403" target="_blank">energy harvesting</a> that might prolong the time between charges.
</p><p>
	So if your next phone is thinner, has a longer battery life, and more immersive sound, thank piezoelectrics for eliminating the traditional speakers and motor-based haptic generators from your device, and moving the sound up front, where it belongs <span></span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<div><p><strong>Short Answer</strong>: </p><p>
Quite a late answer, but I'm surprised no one here pointed this out before -- it is possible for a toggle switch to show its current state <em>and</em> the state to which it will change simply <strong>by having text <em>outside</em> the button, instead of on it.</strong></p></div>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VqPxk.png" alt="Real Life Switches"></p>

<div><p><strong>Long Answer</strong>: </p><p>
As dotancohen points out:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem is that in English "on" and "off" are both adverbs and adjectives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Buttons that have text outside of their body use this very fact to their advantage! Read on...</p>

<hr><p>
Take the iOS switch design: </p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LVcH6.png" alt="iOS On-Off Switch"></p>

<p>Let's focus on the state that's blue and says <strong>ON</strong> for example. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l3ozk.png" alt="iOS ON"></p>

<p>Can you tell if the switch is ON currently, or if it will go on if you move/click/tap the slider? Is the text obvious? Is "ON" here a state(adjective) or action(verb)? Unclear. Is the color of any use to help you decide this? Probably, but not certainly -- iOS users may be habituated to the states of this design, but there's no telling how non-iOS users would interpret this. To see what I mean, take this real life trip-switch, which has the same design as the iOS switch -- can you tell for sure if the trip switch is currently ON?</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eokjt.png" alt="Ambiguous Trip Switch"></p>

<p>The switch below is along the lines of the iOS design, but far worse...</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zlH4X.png" alt="Ambiguous On-Off Switch"></p>

<p>...it's not even clear which half the slide/click handle is!</p>

<hr><p>
On the other hand, the OS X switch design leaves no room for ambiguity:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sVmHL.png" alt="Unambiguous On-Off Switch"></p>

<p>The question from jensgram's quote...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>If the button says ON when the state is off, it is unclear what the setting is. If it is OFF when the state is off, however, where is the ON button?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...never arises here since the button neither says ON nor OFF -- it just stands by itself. Also, there's no confusion about the context of the words ON and OFF -- they are very clearly states (adjectives) since clicking on them (in the normal design) would do nothing!</p>

<p>It may be interesting to note that a modification to this design would allow for the text on the far side of the button to be made click-able/tap-able. If so, the word closer to the switch-handle is the state, while other one is the action, and the roles are reversed when the switch is toggled. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OHRbi.png" alt="Modded On-Off Switch"></p>

<p>Even so, the user's perspective of the switch isn't altered -- at no point is the user confused about the current state of the switch. In fact, the design could be further enhanced for user friendliness by highlighting the current state:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mp518.png" alt="Highlighted On-Off Switch"></p>

<hr><p>
The Windows Metro UI design for the switch goes a step further, and removes the "action" text from the button, and retains just the "state" text:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bh83l.gif" alt="Win8 On-Off Switch"></p>

<p>The color of the button indicates the current state (lit up = ON, as in real life), and the words On/Off underneath the option text reassure the user of the current state.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Minesto's fully operational Dragon 12 looks like some sort of futuristic military drone – but it behaves remarkably like a kite underwater. It uses lift generated by tidal flows to fly patterns faster than the currents, harvesting renewable energy.</p><p>Solar energy is the bedrock of most renewable energy grid plans – but lunar energy is even more predictable, and a number of different companies are working to commercialize energy generated from the regular inflows and outflows of the tides.</p><p>One we've completely missed is Minesto, which is taking a very different and remarkably dynamic approach compared to most. Where devices like <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/orbital-o2-floating-marine-turbine-grid-connection/" data-cms-ai="0">Orbital's O2 tidal turbine</a> more or less just sit there in the water harvesting energy from tidal currents, Minesto's Dragon series are anchored to the sea bed, and fly around like kites, treating the currents like wind. </p><div data-video-disable-history="" data-align-center="">

</div><p>Just as <a href="https://newatlas.com/fraunhofer-nts-kite-wind-power/24843/" data-cms-ai="0">land-based wind energy kites</a> fly in figure 8 patterns to accelerate themselves faster than the wind, so does the Dragon underwater. This, says Minesto, lets the Dragon pull more energy from a given tidal current than other designs – and it also changes the economic equations for relevant sites, making slower tidal flows worth exploiting. </p><p>These are by no means small kites – the Dragon 12 needs to be disassembled to fit in a shipping container. It rocks a monster 12-meter (39-ft) wingspan, and weighs no less than 28 tons. But compared to other offshore power options like wind turbines, it's an absolute minnow, and extremely easy to install using a single smallish boat and a sea bed tether. </p><p>As with any renewable energy project, the key figure here is LCoE (levelized cost of energy) – so what's it gonna cost?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


 

<p><img src="https://multicians.org/mulimg/andre-small.jpg" width="162" height="272" alt="Andre with coffee cup" title="click for a larger view" srcset="https://multicians.org/mulimg/andre-small.jpg 1x, https://multicians.org/mulimg/andre-small-2x.jpg 2x" onclick="showLightBox2('mulimg/andre-big.jpg','486','811','Andre with coffee cup','click for a larger view','André Bensoussan, CISL, 1975 [THVV]','mulimg/andre-big-2x.jpg')"></p>

<p>
  The late <a href="https://multicians.org/multicians.html#Bensoussan" title="Multician: Designer (GE/CISL): File manager, Initialization, AIM, NSS.">André Bensoussan</a> worked with me on the Multics operating system at Honeywell in Cambridge. 
  We were working on a <a href="https://multicians.org/mgn.html#NSS" title="glossary: New Storage System. MR 4.0 included a rewritten storage...">major change</a> to the file system, 
  which required a subsystem, the <a href="https://multicians.org/mgv.html#VTOC" title="glossary: Volume Table of Contents. Region of a physical volume...">VTOC</a> manager, 
  to manage file description information. 
  It had to transport the file information between disk and memory,
  manage a shared memory buffer pool, 
  and manage space on disk for the information. 
  In other words, it was a small virtual memory manager.
</p>

<p>
  André took on the job of design, implementation, and test of the VTOC manager.
  He started by sitting at his desk and drawing a lot of diagrams. 
  I was the project coordinator, 
  so I used to drop in on him and ask how things were going. 
  "Still designing," he'd say. 
  He wanted the diagrams to look beautiful and symmetrical as well as capturing all the state information.
  I was getting nervous about the schedule, 
  so I was glad when he finally began writing code.
  He wrote in pencil, at his desk, instead of using a terminal.
  He declined offers of typing help, and just kept writing away in pencil.
  He rewrote parts, copied things over, erased and rewrote.
</p>

<p>
  Finally André took his neat final pencil copy to a terminal and typed the whole program in.
  His first compilation attempt failed; he corrected three typos, tried again, and the code compiled. 
  We bound it into the system and tried it out, and it worked the first time.
</p>

<p>
  In fact, <a href="https://multicians.org/vtoc_man.html" title="PL/I source of the Multics storage system VTOC manager.">the VTOC manager</a> worked perfectly from then on.
  Only one bug was ever found in it, and that was my fault: 
  André had asked me the calling sequence for an error procedure, 
  and I'd guessed instead of looking it up, so it crashed the first time it hit an error. 
  Beyond that the program was perfect.
</p>

<p>
  How did André do this, with no tool but a pencil?

<h2 id="the-conference">The conference</h2>
<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/">FOSDEM (Free and Open source Software Developers’ European Meeting)</a> is a huge non-profit,
volunteer-organized conference that’s free of charge to attend thanks to sponsors and donations. It took place in
Brussels, Belgium at the ULB campus.</p>
<p>I heard about this conference from a friend who went there years ago, and after hearing about the experience and the
content there I knew I had to be there at least once in my life. But then a pandemic happened, so it was sort of in the
backlog for a while.</p>
<p><a href="https://concise.ee/">My current employer</a> provides a perk that allows developers to attend technical conferences. After
the FOSDEM 2024 schedule was available I put together an
initial set of talks to attend, presented it to my employer, and got a green light to attend (and
travelling/accommodation paid for).</p>
<h2 id="the-city">The city</h2>
<p>To make sure that I’m well-rested, I arrived the night before FOSDEM with my friend. After dropping my stuff off at the
hotel, we went to get something to eat and continued at the Delirium Beer Garden to sample some of the finest Belgian
beers. It was very crowded, but after the first beers and some walking around the many floors we found a place to chill.</p>
<p>We ended up with sampling a meter of beer which was a selection of ten small beers, laid out on a plank. It was a nice
way to try different tastes and honestly all of them were either good or great. Cherry, raspberry and the green cactus
option were the sweetest, like some good lemonade that has the potential to cause hangovers.</p>

<p><strong>Free tech tip:</strong> don’t underestimate the strength of Belgian beer. You won’t taste it, but that 8-9% alcohol per
volume really hits in the morning.</p>
<p>Brussels is allegedly very nice, however I’m not a big fan of the way trash is handled, there are bags everywhere and
some of them are broken, leaving small pieces of trash everywhere. You could also smell the lack of public restrooms
when walking down the streets in the city center.</p>
<p>There are some glimpses of good bicycle infrastructure, but they often don’t connect well or are simply lines on the
ground which doesn’t protect that well from cars. Based on the honks and the number of times they did not stop at
crosswalks, I can only assume that drivers in Brussels are both very aggressive and very incompetent at driving. In a
way it felt like home, especially since my hometown of Tallinn also uses red paint on some bicycle paths.</p>
<h2 id="the-dos-and-donts-of-fosdem">The dos and don’ts of FOSDEM</h2>
<p>I went to the ULB campus using a tram. If you’re not sure which one to take, then take the one with the most developers
headed towards it. Knowing when to get off is also easy as you can simply follow the crowd.</p>

<p>I arrived roughly 15 minutes before the keynote session. At that time there was plenty of room in the auditorium. By the
time the keynote started there were no seats available, so you might want to do the same and arrive a bit early.</p>

<p>There were <em>a lot</em> of people attending FOSDEM. Keep a map handy, because your next session might take place in a room
that might be tricky to find, especially as a
first-timer. <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/be.digitalia.fosdem/">The FOSDEM Companion app</a> is great for that, click
on the session you’re interested in and the room name, and you’ll have a good idea on where it’s taking place.</p>
<p>This FOSDEM was the 24th FOSDEM to take place, which is important because the 25th one is happening next year. If you’ve
been to any previous ones and are attending next year, then bring the oldest FOSDEM shirt with you, there will be a
special photoshoot taking place.</p>
<p>If you’re going to attend FOSDEM in-person, then definitely
read <a href="https://petersouter.xyz/fosdem-survival-guide/">the FOSDEM survival guide.</a> All the points there are still
relevant and helped me out tremendously during my trip.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>take an earlier bus/tram to get to FOSDEM to avoid crowds and get there on time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you want to guarantee getting a seat in a session, consider joining an earlier session in the same room</p>
<ul>
<li>you might also learn something about an area you had no clue about, which is a great bonus!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>don’t underestimate the strength of Belgian beer</p>
<ul>
<li>trust me on that one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>food lines can get very long, bring some light snacks and plenty of water with you</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>some places had water bottle refilling stations, such as the U building, but I had a hard time finding one in
others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there was plenty of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate">Club-Mate for sale</a> and based on the number of empty
bottles it was a crowd favourite</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There were 879 events taking place at FOSDEM 2024. That is a lot of talks to go through. My recommendation is to take an
evening at least a week from the event and go through the list of talks starting with main tracks and lightning talks,
and following it up with devrooms that align with your interests.</p>
<p>If you do it in the <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/be.digitalia.fosdem/">FOSDEM Companion</a> app, then you can bookmark
them and view your initial schedule. The app will show you where there are overlapping sessions by coloring the
start/end times red. The app can also show you if a room is too full to attend. Don’t forget that switching rooms might
take about 15 minutes in some cases due to the size of the campus, so leave some room for walking in your schedule.</p>
<p>In my experience, the most enjoyable FOSDEM experience is one where you attend at most 2-3 tracks during the day and
leave plenty of time for eating, resting and visiting all the stands. It’s going to be exhausting either way, so you
might as well make the most of the FOSDEM live experience. Talks are recorded and will be published soon after the event
so you’re not going to miss much if you take things easy (unless there are issues capturing the session).</p>
<p>Here are a few simple guidelines that I recommend following so that listening to talks in FOSDEM live is a great
experience for both you and those around you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>try to get to your next talk about 15 minutes before it starts, that allows you to queue up early and not miss your
session</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>don’t talk or whisper during the talk and the Q&amp;A session with the speakers</p>
<ul>
<li>there were so many cases where the speaker could not even hear the question being asked, which is disrespectful
to the speaker and the audience</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you really need to leave early, then be as quiet as possible</p>
<ul>
<li>the old desks at the seats make a lot of noise if you carelessly put them back up-right</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you really didn’t have time for a snack, then don’t bring something that makes a lot of noise or smells strongly to
the auditorium</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to get a FOSDEM t-shirt or hoodie in your favourite size, then the first half of the first day is the ideal
opportunity for that. At FOSDEM 2024 the t-shirts cost 25 EUR, hoodies cost 50 EUR.</p>
<p>Most payments you’ll make will likely be with contactless payments via your card or phone, but definitely bring some
cash with you in smaller denominations as there were a few cases at the start of the conference where the payment
systems were not working properly, likely due to network issues. Somewhere between 100-200 EUR will likely cover
anything you’d need at the conference itself.</p>
<p>With the food trucks I made an observation: the lines were longer for the more expensive and higher quality food
options. The cheaper ones are okay and are generally quite fast to get. The more “premium” trucks were not much slower
though so waiting in line might pay off.</p>
<p>During the keynote it was emphasized that some of the attendees will get sick as a result of this conference. They call
it <em>the FOSDEM flu</em>. I guess it’s a thing that happens at many big conferences, but in any case if you do visit FOSDEM
then please don’t do it while sick. If you fall sick at the event, then rest at the hotel and watch it on a livestream
instead. There’s always next year!</p>
<p>One pattern I noticed is that quite a few talks were used as a great marketing tool for highlighting issues that the
speaker would like some help with solving. What better way to improve FOSS than to involve people who might not even be
aware of the issues but have the technical know-how to help?</p>
<h2 id="the-stands-the-hallway-track">The stands (the hallway track)</h2>
<p>One of the highlights of the FOSDEM experience are the various stands in different buildings in the campus. You’ll find
all sorts of different projects being represented, ranging from big, established ones (Fedora, Debian, Nextcloud,
PostgreSQL etc.) all the way down to small projects and organizations (postmarketOS, Ubuntu Touch, CalyxOS and many
more).</p>
<p>Most stands offer free merch, such as stickers. A lot of stands sell merch, most accept card payments, some accept
payments via online credit card payments, and a few take cash only.</p>
<p>I visited most booths at the event and spoke briefly with many of the people present there. If you’re just curious about
what’s on display and have no background knowledge, then don’t be afraid to ask questions, no matter how simple you
think they are!</p>
<p>Here are my notes on the stands that I found the most interesting</p>
<h2 id="gnu-radiohttpswwwgnuradioorg"><a href="https://www.gnuradio.org/">GNU Radio</a></h2>
<p>This stand had a simple and effective demo of a device monitoring the 2.4 GHz spectrum, which is also where older Wi-Fi
standards operate in. The person hosting the booth was happy to explain what was going on, even bringing out details
such as signals bouncing around the room and how they show up on the spectrum visualizer.</p>
<p>Turns out that you can achieve this by putting together two blocks in a visual editor in GNU Radio, and this is why it’s
on my todo list now.</p>
<p><a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/02/12/fosdem-2024/media/gnuradio.mp4">There’s also a video clip of the visualization running.</a></p>

<h2 id="minetesthttpswwwminetestnet"><a href="https://www.minetest.net/">Minetest</a></h2>
<p>Minetest is an open source game engine and had a booth present at the event. They had the game running on a laptop. A
Steam Deck with the official dock was also present. I’ve previously heard about this project many years ago, at that
time it was a simple Minecraft-like game but a bit too basic in my opinion. The demo at the booth reminded me of
something more polished and yet familiar enough to remind me of Minecraft 1.8 Beta days.</p>
<p>Turns out that over the years the game engine has seen a lot of development and there are many creators who have mades
games based on this engine. I was also delighted and surprised to hear that Minetest has been used in educational
projects.</p>

<h2 id="ubuntu-touchhttpsubuntu-touchio"><a href="https://ubuntu-touch.io/">Ubuntu Touch</a></h2>
<p>Ah, Ubuntu Touch. I believe the first time I heard about Ubuntu Touch was when they introduced the convergence idea.
Your phone is the only computer you have, use it as a phone when out and about, and connect it to a dock when at home to
get a desktop experience.</p>
<p>The booth had a wide variety of devices present, including Fairphone 4 and 5 (this isn’t the first time you’ll see these
models mentioned). At the booth were people who actually daily drive Ubuntu Touch, and one person I talked to expressed
their interest in porting Ubuntu Touch to a Samsung foldable phone.</p>
<p>Ubuntu Touch isn’t probably something I’d run full-time, but perhaps it’s time to give it a go again. My Nexus 5 still
has the boot logo that Ubuntu Touch installer creates, so that will serve as a reminder for me to check it out.</p>

<h2 id="sailfishoshttpssailfishosorg"><a href="https://sailfishos.org/">SailfishOS</a></h2>
<p>I knew of SailfishOS, but had never tried a device out with that OS. At FOSDEM I finally had the chance to do it, and
out of all the custom OS options that aren’t Android-based, this one was the one with the smoothest and most polished
experience. When speaking to the person hosting the booth, I also learned that it is possible to even run Android apps
on it, although after doing some research on their website it seems like it’s a feature that you need to pay for.</p>
<p>The phones laid out on the booth were various Sony Xperia devices. I’ve not used or seen those devices, but they felt
really great in hand and were super small compared to modern phones. Seems like these models are also the ones that have
got the most polish and support, based on the materials on the website and my two minutes of fiddling with them.</p>
<p>Out of all the non-Android alternative operating systems, this one has the most potential to be a daily driver. The
person at the booth uses theirs as a daily driver so there must be potential on it. The corporate backing is likely what
allows the OS to feel usable and hopefully that will be enough to keep this project alive.</p>

<p>There were multiple booths where you could try out various versions of Linux-based phones that aren’t Android.</p>
<p>The phones were all sorts of older and newer devices that originally shipped with Android. The experience and support
was a combination of the hardware and the state of the mobile Linux distribution and UI. Some were quite okay, some were
rough, and some were just slow due to the age of the phone itself.</p>

<p>I really appreciate these types of efforts to give new life to old devices. Most Android devices lose software support
after a few years, but with projects that basically put Linux on a phone you can still find ways to make use of the
devices. They might not be stable enough yet to be considered a reliable daily driver as a smartphone, but you can do
all sorts of cool things with them, like running web servers or hosting encrypted remote backups of critical data.</p>
<p>One of the booths also had a Pinephone in a keyboard dock, which was neat as I’ve never seen a Pinephone in real life,
nor had the opportunity to try one with a keyboard. It wasn’t ergonomic trying to do it with two hands, but maybe I was
holding it wrong.</p>
<p>It was interesting to see GNOME or KDE-based user interfaces on phones. The gestures and navigating the UI was a bit
rough since there were slight differences on each OS. Still cool though!</p>
<p>Oh, and there was a visitor who had some cool gear with them. Other than a GPD portable computer, they also had a
mechanical keyboard with a wide display attached to it.
They tried connecting it to a phone that was on display at the booth, and it recognized it as a second display on the
first try. The model of the keyboard is <em>Ficihp K2</em> in case you’re interested in similar gear.</p>

<h2 id="calyxoshttpscalyxosorg"><a href="https://calyxos.org/">CalyxOS</a></h2>
<p>I had never heard of this Android-based OS before, but there they were, showcasing it on a freaking Fairphone 5 (and
also some other phones)!</p>
<p>The people at the booth were very friendly and helpful, answering any of the questions I had about app compatibility and
the OS itself.</p>
<p>The project seems to be backed by an US-based non-profit, <a href="https://calyxinstitute.org/">the Calyx Institute.</a></p>
<p>I’m a bit wary about using this on my daily driver Fairphone 5 running Android 13 as I just got it, but if I had a spare
one for testing
I’d definitely check out how well it fares as a privacy-focused OS. The potential is there and hopefully CalyxOS will
have a chance to prove itself as a long-term and stable project.</p>

<p>Side note: I’m planning on covering my Fairphone 5 experience as a separate post in the future, but one
takeaway from FOSDEM is that I’ve accidentally picked a tinkerer’s dream phone.</p>
<h2 id="automotive-grade-linuxhttpswwwautomotivelinuxorg"><a href="https://www.automotivelinux.org/">Automotive Grade Linux</a></h2>
<p>Like with many projects, I had never heard about this one before FOSDEM.</p>
<p>This booth was displaying various interfaces designed for cars. There was a demo vehicle dashboard which was simulating
a moving car. Next to it were two bigger displays that had infotainment and control panel functionality with all sorts
of buttons on it.</p>

<p>Between these two setups was a small control board with 9 keys and two dials. Some of the buttons popped up warning
lights on the digital dashboard, such as passenger airbag failure. Other buttons had various stickers on them: HTML5, Qt
and Flutter. Turns out that the intotainment display demo was built on top of containers and pressing a key would stop
the running one and start up a different one based on whichever button you clicked.</p>

<p>I first checked out the smartwatch named <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineTime">PineTime</a>. It comes in multiple
versions, one for daily use (the sealed model),
and one which is bulkier but easier to open and flash in case you mess up your firmware. I’m currently using a <a href="https://www.casio.com/us/watches/casio/product.F-105W-1A/">Casio
F105W</a> and haven’t been a big fan of smartwatches, but the
hardware on the sealed model felt premium and something I’d
pay good money for. The functionality was basic, but it had everything you’d want from a basic watch, plus a heart rate
monitor and even a Pong-like game. I’m seriously considering getting one now.</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineTab-V">The PineTab-V</a>, a RISC-V based tablet, was also present and running KDE Plasma.
The experience was unstable at the time
as I had the settings app crash on me once, but that’s likely down to driver support not being quite there yet. That’s
OK, since they advertise the device as an experimental device right now.</p>
<p>Something I wasn’t even aware of was the <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineNote">PineNote</a>, a Linux tablet with an e-ink
display. It was running an actual GNOME desktop on it so the interface was instantly familiar to me. As a test case I
opened up my blog on it and it worked just fine. Scrolling the
page to read the blog was a bit clunky due to the low refresh rate that an e-ink display has, that’s just a limitation
of the technology. <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/02/12/fosdem-2024/media/pinenote-scrolling.mp4">Here’s a clip demonstrating it.</a></p>

<p>One of the many FOSDEM fringe events was a party hosted at <a href="https://hsbxl.be/">Hackerspace Brussels</a>, a hackerspace
located in an old industrial building. The event had DJ-s playing music, a t-shirt making booth, a fancy projector
setup, a room with SuperTuxKart on a big screen and a small Raspberry Pi-based mini arcade box, and the room where I
assume work gets done since it had all the electronics equipment and workspaces.</p>

<p>The projector setup used in the party area was simple but elegant. It was positioned in a way that allowed various
surfaces to reflect the video at different levels, making it all feel
three-dimensional. <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/02/12/fosdem-2024/media/hsbxl-visuals.mp4">Here’s a video demonstrating it!</a></p>

<p>I loved how one of the hackerspace members was excited to show off the insides of the mini arcade cabinet and explain
the build process of it, including the design of the physical components. It’s cool seeing people get enthusiastic about
something they’ve built with their own hands. <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/02/12/fosdem-2024/media/hsbxl-arcade-doom.mp4">Here they are, playing DOOM (SNES version)!</a></p>

<p>At one point me and my friend ended up speaking to a group of people, one of whom was showcasing their Tamagochi and
offering it to others to interact with. I learned from them that there exists a self-hostable Snapchat-like app
called <a href="https://piqchat.net/">Piqchat.</a> My friend gave it a go on their instance and after fiddling with the sign-up
process (we were at least two beers in at this point) he got it working.</p>
<p>We arrived around 20:45ish at the location, and at that point the dancefloor was a bit empty, but after 23:00ish it
looked like a proper party. I wasn’t in the mood to party much because there was a whole second day of FOSDEM left and I
was already exhausted.</p>
<p>Interesting location, interesting vibe and probably a great place for raves.</p>
<h2 id="and-the-rest">And the rest…</h2>
<p>Here are some quick notes on other booths that I need to throw out there so that I don’t end up forgetting them.</p>
<p><strong>KDE</strong>: other than stickers or merch, they had small handmade plushies of the project mascot Konqi. I’m still a bit sad
that I didn’t get one at the first opportunity because they were all sold out during the first day.</p>

<p><strong>PostgreSQL</strong>: I got to play in a game of Kahoot and while I crashed and burned in the final standings, I learned a lot
about the PostgreSQL project details in the process. They also had cute hand-made (in Germany of all places!) elephant
plushes in PostgreSQL-blue so of course I bought one. Fun fact: the ones sold there were version 2 of the plush which
has the nice feature of not falling over on a flat surface. See, making PostgreSQL stable isn’t that hard!</p>

<p>You’re probably coming to FOSDEM for the vibe, the people and all the fun stands, but there are also hundreds of talks
that you can choose to attend.</p>

</figure>

<p>There were many talks covering interesting topics, but I could only attend a relatively small number of those live.
There’s simply too much interesting content out there.</p>
<p>Here are my notes on the ones I attended live.</p>
<h2 id="where-the--are-the-packets-goinghttpsfosdemorg2024scheduleeventfosdem-2024-2929--where-the-are-the-packets-going-"><a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2929--where-the-are-the-packets-going-/">“Where the !?*! are the packets going?”</a></h2>
<p>This was one of those sessions I decided to sit in on to catch one I really wanted to attend and it was a good decision
as the room was packed.</p>
<p>This talk gave a quick overview of a modified version of <code>traceroute</code> by Catchpoint and the enhancements they made to
it, involving QUIC support, functionality that bypasses firewalls and some shenanigans in Linux setups on Azure (the
Microsoft cloud services platform).</p>
<p><strong><em>techtipsy rating:</em> 6/10</strong>, it was alright.</p>
<h2 id="broom-not-included-curling-the-modern-wayhttpsfosdemorg2024scheduleeventfosdem-2024-1909-broom-not-included-curling-the-modern-way"><a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-1909-broom-not-included-curling-the-modern-way/">Broom not included: curling the modern way</a></h2>
<p>This talk was originally meant for a 40 minute session but due to limitations of the FOSDEM schedule, 20 minutes was all
he got.</p>
<p>This session was a rapid-fire presentation of curl development and all sorts of things that you could do with it. I’ve
used <code>curl</code> so far for simple requests, but after this session I know that you can do all sorts of shenanigans,
including parallel transfers and a lot of JSON mangling. <em>JSON, JSON, JSON!</em></p>
<p>I also learned about <a href="https://curl.se/trurl/">trurl</a> which is handy for working with URL-s. Parse them, modify them, do
whatever you desire without re-implementing all that complexity yourself. Neat!</p>
<p><strong><em>techtipsy rating:</em> 10/10</strong>, short, amusing and yet useful listen about curl, looking forward to a longer version in
the
future!</p>

<p>I initially didn’t plan on sitting in for this one, but since one of the WiFi networks hosted by FOSDEM itself was IPv6
only and I’m plagued by my ISP only working over IPv4 (<em>old-man-yells-at-Elisa.jpg</em>), I decided to listen to this one.</p>
<p>The speaker gave an overview of the situation with IPv6, which operating systems handle it well and which do not, and
how you can improve the IPv6 compatibility on your own machine.</p>
<p>In short: Android works, Linux/Windows mostly work, but all the Internet of Things garbage (smart <em>everything</em>) is
something you should simply avoid at all costs since those hastily thrown together pieces of crap only work over IPv4.</p>
<p>The rest of the session covered possible solutions for making sure that IPv4 and IPv6 both work nicely on your machine.
Turns out that there really isn’t one perfect solution for this problem, especially since you can’t just ignore that
part of the Internet that doesn’t support IPv6, yet.</p>
<p>This talk was also a way to ask for help from the FOSS community to help come up with a solution. If you’re into this
topic, then go ahead and reach out!</p>
<p><strong><em>techtipsy rating</em>: 8/10</strong>, learned a lot about IPv6 support and what’s going on in this area.</p>
<h2 id="an-engineers-guide-to-linux-kernel-upgradeshttpsfosdemorg2024scheduleeventfosdem-2024-3370-an-engineer-s-guide-to-linux-kernel-upgrades"><a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3370-an-engineer-s-guide-to-linux-kernel-upgrades/">An engineer’s guide to Linux Kernel upgrades</a></h2>
<p>Great presentation that included useful recommendations for rolling out Linux kernel upgrades and why you don’t want to
wait a long time to upgrade, backed up with data and nice visualisations, and memes.</p>
<p>Although this talk was about Linux kernel upgrades, the main idea is very much applicable in software development as
well. If you don’t release software as often as possible but keep making changes at the same pace, then your change
delta (or
the number of pending changes) increases, and so does the risk of something going wrong, either by releasing a buggy
change that’s now harder to troubleshoot due to the large number of changes deployed, or not releasing new versions of
software with security patches.</p>
<p>This talk also explained the Linux kernel development workflow, the meaning behind version numbers (it’s not
semantic versioning!), and how security patches get merged into “long-term support” versions.</p>
<p>In short: update often, deploy often, measure things.</p>
<p><strong><em>techtipsy rating</em>: 9/10</strong>, great listening for software developers and Linux newbies alike.</p>
<h2 id="soft-reboot-keep-your-containers-running-while-your-image-based-linux-host-gets-updatedhttpsfosdemorg2024scheduleeventfosdem-2024-3282-soft-reboot-keep-your-containers-running-while-your-image-based-linux-host-gets-updated"><a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3282-soft-reboot-keep-your-containers-running-while-your-image-based-linux-host-gets-updated/">Soft Reboot: keep your containers running while your image-based Linux host gets updated</a></h2>
<p>My day job uses Kubernetes for running our services. Have some pods (containers) running on a host that you need to
update? No problem, Kubernetes starts new pods on another host, directs traffic to those and you can now update that
host.</p>
<p>This talk shows another way of updating your host operating system and apparently this functionality is already present
on most modern Linux systems that run <code>systemd</code>.</p>
<p>In short, if your containers meet certain criteria, then you can utilize this soft reboot functionality to update
and reboot your base system without any noticeable interruptions to your containers. Your
kernel will still be the same version, so keep that in mind. And yes, the irony of this solution is not lost to me after
listening
to <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3370-an-engineer-s-guide-to-linux-kernel-upgrades/">the talk that emphasized the importance of updating your kernel as often as possible.</a></p>
<p>Although the customizations behind it are quite simple if you follow the guidelines, this talk still felt like magic to
me. I guess that only means that I should look into it further.</p>
<p><strong><em>techtipsy rating:</em> 9/10</strong>, interesting concept that has real world usages at big tech companies and yet felt like
something I could understand with my small brain.</p>
<h2 id="juggling-with-uids-and-gids-rootless-container-deployment-with-ansiblehttpsfosdemorg2024scheduleeventfosdem-2024-3412-juggling-with-uids-and-gids-rootless-container-deployment-with-ansible"><a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3412-juggling-with-uids-and-gids-rootless-container-deployment-with-ansible/">Juggling with UIDs and GIDs: rootless container deployment with Ansible</a></h2>
<p>Short but sweet talk about how the speaker manages their home server, including a neat workaround that most people who
have worked with containers have faced: permission issues between containers and the host.</p>
<p>I’m actually struggling with a similar issue right now in my home server setup and I’ll definitely have to reference
this talk once I get around to trying to fix it.</p>
<p>It was kind of odd how relatable this talk was to me: it’s related to self-hosting, the speaker has a home server
running, they mentioned <a href="https://www.linuxserver.io/">linuxserver.io</a> images, and they care about running containers
rootless. Even my friend made a
note about the similarities.</p>

<p>This was another session that I decided to attend because hey, I’ve already got a good seat and the session after that
is in the same room.</p>
<p>I had little knowledge about <a href="https://ebpf.io/">eBPF</a> before or what it does, but after listening to this one I have a
rough idea about it. In short: small programs in the kernel that are used for networking, security and
monitoring purposes.</p>
<p>This talk shed some light on deploying eBPF applications with <code>bpfman</code> and nuances around it.</p>
<p><strong><em>techtipsy rating:</em> 6/10</strong>, flew a bit over my head due to my knowledge gaps in eBPF, but it did raise my awareness
about this area.</p>

<p>During my self-hosting adventure I’ve used various setups, including running containers with <code>systemd-nspawn</code>. If you
don’t know what that involves, then it’s pretty much a container that acts more like a virtual machine when you interact
with it. I have also worked with out of date software projects so this one felt like it could be relevant to my
interests.</p>
<p>This talk was a quick overview of the troubles that the speaker faced with a horrifically out of date software stack
that was still actively used at a school.</p>
<p>The steps taken involved securing the system against basic attacks, then working out how to containerize it and run it,
including
ripping apart old Debian Docker images and having to work around such limitations as “there’s no systemd”.</p>
<p>Great reference for anyone facing similar situations. Wish the speaker had more time to go into the whole other category
of issues related to the software stack itself, including the MySQL related issues they faced during this migration.</p>
<p><strong><em>techtipsy rating:</em> 8/10</strong>, great topic and useful tips, would have loved more horror stories and pictures.</p>

<p>This session was a sequel to a previous talk that the presenter gave so I was worried a bit about having knowledge gaps,
but luckily that wasn’t that big of a problem.</p>
<p>This talk covered some common PostgreSQL queries and various operations that go on behind the scenes, supported by
illustrations on how exactly PostgreSQL performs those operations.</p>
<p>There were a lot of examples shown and it was genuinely interesting. At one point it became more difficult
to follow along, but I’ll mark that down to this being the first session of the second day of FOSDEM. I think my brain
quit on <em>parallel hash join</em> part. In a way I felt like I was back in school.</p>
<p>Given the background of the speaker, it’s no surprise that
they<a href="https://momjian.us/main/presentations/performance.html"> have lots of presentations</a> and resources on PostgreSQL.
Will definitely have to check those out.</p>
<p><strong><em>techtipsy rating:</em> 9/10</strong>, made my head hurt but I’m now aware of what to Google when dealing with PostgreSQL, and I
know which materials to reference to refresh my memory on this topic.</p>

<p>This talk started out well: forget what you know about SQL standards because those are apparently not correct in modern
SQL databases. Way ahead of you there, Mr. Pachot!</p>
<p>Turns out that life before MVCC (multi-version concurrency control) was rough and reading data involved locking it.
Unintentionally
locking tables is something that’s a common problem at my day job with <em>writes</em>, so I can’t imagine what type of hell
life would
be if that was still the reality.</p>
<p>This talk shed some light on how databases handle transactions, reads and writes. Good resource to refer back to.</p>
<p>Made me awfully paranoid about databases and data consistency now. Can I even <em>trust</em> databases any more? Or my
knowledge on this topic?</p>
<p>Sidenote on <a href="https://www.yugabyte.com/">YugabyteDB</a>: as someone who has been surprised
by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">Amazon Aurora</a> quirks at my day job (broken indices after a
minor version upgrade, anyone?), I find it interesting that there are other companies that provide a similar service

<p>Quick overview of why Linux load average is not an useful metric to follow, and can be incredibly misleading in some
scenarios, especially if you compare sync vs async I/O. I’ve been guilty of tracking that metric religiously myself,
so… <em>whoops.</em></p>
<p>Even the Linux kernel source code calls it a silly metric!</p>
<p>Look at Pressure Stall Information instead to understand where your system is bottlenecking.</p>

<p>This one was a run through various high-level tech tips to take into account when faced with the task of moving to a
on-premise cloud setup.</p>
<p>During my own professional career that officially begun in 2016, there has always been a push to move workloads into the
cloud, for all sorts of reasons, legitimate or misguided. Turns out that on-prem isn’t dead and some organizations are
moving back in that direction due to legal or technical requirements.</p>
<p>Here are my takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>avoid third party software because that’s usually a source of lock-in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if faced with <em>buy vs build</em> decisions, prefer build</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keep things super simple</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if faced with build-time or run-time complexity, prefer the former, otherwise more technical layers in run-time result
in more difficult troubleshooting due to added complexity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider using Kubernetes (and an open source distribution of it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>version control your infrastructure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you automate something, automate it 100% end-to-end, don’t half-ass it or include manual middle steps</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of ideas mentioned here are also applicable to those working with cloud platforms in any large company. If you
have competent engineers, then you’ll probably have no major problems if you move to a private cloud setup as a lot of
the tooling and knowledge should transfer over.</p>
<p><strong><em>techtipsy rating:</em> 7/10</strong>, would have loved to see case studies of public -&gt; private cloud migrations to illustrate
the process and highlight the pain points.</p>

<p>This was a fun one for me because I care about how much power my tech consumes, and the speaker put a new twist on it.
Ever wondered how much energy is spent loading your website? Now you can find that out!</p>
<p>This talk ties in with Mozilla’s vision for a better internet and their stated sustainability goals. Building new
computing hardware is very resource and energy intensive, and shoddy websites motivate people to upgrade sooner than
necessary.</p>
<p>The steps to take to measure the performance and power consumption of your webpage are quite simple. The power
measurement support is hardware and platform dependent, but even without that you can get a pretty good idea of how well
your website performs. The whole process was easy enough to do that I could follow it along on my laptop during the
talk.</p>
<p>The talk was simple to follow and yet covered a lot of details and nuance around power profiling on various platforms.
This should be mandatory for anyone working in web development, especially those that add animated full-page backgrounds
on websites or load in megabytes of JavaScript.</p>
<p>Give this talk a listen and start measuring website performance, I highly encourage it!</p>
<p><strong><em>techtipsy rating:</em> 10/10</strong>, I hate poorly performing websites and love my machines running as efficiently as
possible, and this talk brings those two topics together in a very nice way.</p>
<h2 id="postgres-vs-linux-filesystemshttpsfosdemorg2024scheduleeventfosdem-2024-3605-postgres-vs-linux-filesystems"><a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3605-postgres-vs-linux-filesystems/">Postgres vs. Linux filesystems</a></h2>
<p>My experience with hosting PostgreSQL has mainly been limited to one instance that is used by Nextcloud, and during my
professional career I’ve only observed migrations away from ZFS-based self-hosted PostgreSQL instances, so I was really
interested in seeing how different filesystems affect PostgreSQL performance.</p>
<p>This talk laid out some general guidelines for anyone running PostgreSQL, such as keeping your kernel up to date to get
the best performance and avoid old kernel bugs, and presented lots of graphs detailing the behaviour of different
filesystems under heavy workloads simulated using <code>pgbench</code>.</p>
<p>I recommend that you view the results, they might surprise you. As a <code>btrfs</code> user, they certainly made me think about
choosing it if I were to ever build a dedicated database server on raw hardware.</p>
<p>Benchmarking is very difficult to get right so I suspect that there might be other nuances at play here with the
results. Interesting presentation regardless.</p>
<p>Sidenote: the presenter was running <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">QubesOS</a>, which I’ve briefly played around with in the
past. I never expected to see anyone <em>actually</em> using it as their daily driver. Very impressive!</p>
<p><strong><em>techtipsy rating:</em> 9/10</strong>, I now have an urge to do my own benchmarks to verify these results (but my TODO list is
long enough already).</p>
<h2 id="are-project-tests-enough-for-automated-dependency-updates-a-case-study-of-262-java-projects-on-githubhttpsfosdemorg2024scheduleeventfosdem-2024-3029-are-project-tests-enough-for-automated-dependency-updates-a-case-study-of-262-java-projects-on-github"><a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3029-are-project-tests-enough-for-automated-dependency-updates-a-case-study-of-262-java-projects-on-github/">Are Project Tests Enough for Automated Dependency Updates? A Case Study of 262 Java Projects on Github</a></h2>
<p>I picked this one mainly due to being annoyed with Dependabot spam and the state of tests at my day job.</p>
<p>This talk covered the promise of automated dependency upgrades and ways you can avoid seemingly innocent upgrades
breaking things in production, covering tools like <a href="https://pitest.org/">PIT</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/jhejderup/uppdatera">Uppdatera</a>. If your tests suck, then adding mutation testing and/or static
analysis to your project might help catch problems before they make it to prod, find unused dependencies and tests that
do not properly verify that the service works.</p>
<p>The speaker also briefly mentions the age-old problem of balancing code reuse vs increasing operational costs. Maybe
don’t bring in thousands of dependencies so that you can avoid writing a few lines of code?</p>
<p>There’s a whole research paper on this topic as well (check presentation for more details).</p>
<p><strong><em>techtipsy rating:</em> 8/10</strong>, maybe a project where tests are in shambles can be improved after all…</p>
<h2 id="the-talks-i-didnt-make-it-to">The talks I didn’t make it to</h2>
<p>Due to scheduling conflicts, room capacity limitations and the fact that I can’t teleport, I could not attend everything
all at once.</p>
<p>Here are talks that I plan to watch from a recording (once the processing is done). If I do end up watching them, I’ll
try to add my notes below each one later on.</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>I <em><strong>loved</strong></em> FOSDEM 2024.</p>
<p>My expectations were high based on what I heard before, and it still exceeded them!
The occasional technical issues weren’t a dealbreaker, there was generally plenty of room in the sessions
(at least those I went to), and both the content and the people were great.</p>
<p>I felt at home, surrounded by people with whom I have similar interests. It’s not an environment I find myself in
often, even at work, which is why FOSDEM felt so special.</p>
<p>Next time I’ll try to take part in more community events if possible, talk to people and leave some time for sightseeing
in Brussels.</p>
<p>I’d like to thank my employer <a href="https://concise.ee/">Concise Systems</a> for paying for travel and accommodation.</p>
<p>Special thanks go to <a href="https://zirk.me/">my friend Arti</a> who introduced me to FOSDEM in the first place and helped make
my
first FOSDEM a memorable one.</p>

<p dir="auto">Orbit, the <strong>O</strong>pen <strong>R</strong>untime <strong>B</strong>inary <strong>I</strong>nstrumentation <strong>T</strong>ool is a
standalone <strong>native</strong> application profiler for Windows and Linux. It supports
native applications written in languages such as C, C++, Rust, or Go. Its main
purpose is to help developers identify the performance bottlenecks of a complex
application. Orbit can be also used to visualize the execution flow of such
applications.</p>
<p dir="auto">The key differentiator with many existing tools is that no alteration to the
target process is necessary. Orbit does not require you to change a single line
of code. It doesn't require you to recompile or even relaunch the application
you want to profile. Everything is done seamlessly, right when you need it. It
requires zero integration time and zero iteration time.</p>
<p dir="auto">Orbit combines sampling and dynamic instrumentation to optimize the profiling
workflow. Sampling can quickly identify interesting functions to instrument.
Dynamic instrumentation results in exact function entry and exit information
which is presented in the form of per-thread hierarchical call graphs.
Manual instrumentation markers can be added to the source code and further
allows for value-tracking. Scheduling events are also shown to visualize when a
thread was running and on what core. Furthermore, Orbit visualizes thread
dependencies, showing which thread got blocked or unblocked by which other
thread. For AMD GPUs, the submission, scheduling and hardware execution timings
of a job is visualized. Additional GPU data, such as Vulkan debug markers can be
retrieved using Orbit's Vulkan layer. Memory consumption and page-fault
information is visualized as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">An introduction to Orbit's key features can be found in the following YouTube
video:

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Dynamic Instrumentation (no code change required)</li>
<li>Callstack Sampling</li>
<li>Wine/Proton Mixed-Callstack Profiling</li>
<li>Thread Scheduling and Dependency Tracing</li>
<li>Memory Tracing</li>
<li>GPU Driver Tracepoints (AMD only)</li>

</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Note</h3>
<p dir="auto">Orbit's focus has shifted to the Linux version. Windows local profiling is
currently only supported partially and major features, such as dynamic
instrumentation, are not yet implemented. It is possible however to profile
Linux executables from a Windows UI instance. For Windows local profiling,
you can still use the released
<a href="https://github.com/google/orbit/releases">binaries</a>, but please note that
they are deprecated and mostly undocumented.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Build</h2>
<p dir="auto">Please have a look at the first three sections of our
<a href="https://github.com/google/orbit/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md">development documentation</a>. It describes how to build Orbit and
which compilers, platforms, and tools are supported and needed.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Workflow</h2>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> An extensive documentation of the usage of Orbit can be found in our
<a href="https://github.com/google/orbit/blob/main/documentation/DOCUMENTATION.md">usage documentation</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The following describes the basic workflow of Orbit:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Select a process in the list of currently running processes in the connection
setup dialog, and click <strong>Start Session</strong>.</li>
<li>The list of loaded modules will appear at the top of the <strong>Symbols</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Orbit tries to automatically retrieve debug information of the modules.
See <a href="https://github.com/google/orbit/blob/main/documentation/DOCUMENTATION.md#load-symbols">here</a> on how to load
symbols for modules Orbit failed to load. For successfully loaded module
symbols, the <strong>Functions</strong> tab will get populated.</li>
<li>Select functions you wish to dynamically instrument in the <strong>Functions</strong> tab
by <kbd>Right-Click</kbd> and choosing <strong>Hook</strong>.</li>
<li>Start profiling by pressing <kbd>F5</kbd>. To stop profiling, press
<kbd>F5</kbd> again. You can either zoom time using <kbd>W</kbd> and
<kbd>S</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + the scroll wheel. You can also
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Right-Click</kbd> and drag to zoom to a specific time
range. To scale the UI, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd>.
Press <kbd>SPACE</kbd> to see the last 2 seconds of capture.</li>
<li>You can select sections of the per-thread sampling event track to get a
sampling report of your selection.</li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Presets</h2>
<p dir="auto">Once you have loaded the debug information for your modules and have chosen
functions of interest to dynamically instrument, you can save your profiling
preset so that you won't have to do this manually again. To save a preset, go to
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save Preset</strong></p>

Ｂｉｔｗｉｓｅ 📼 Ｌｉｍｉｎａｌ
A Short Film in 256 Bytes of Code

Programmed by KilledByAPixel
Presented at Lovebyte Party 2024

...

I found an old VHS tape at a yard sale.
It was labeled "Bitwise Liminal" in sharpie.
But when I watched the video it was only static.

Then I started having vivid and... unsettling dreams.
Also I couldn't stop thinking about that weird VHS tape.
After researching I learned it was a digital backup.
Using some special software I recovered the data.
To my shock, it was a 256 byte program...

With trembling hands I opened it in a web browser.
Strange. This reminds me of the dreams I've been having.
Now I don't need to sleep anymore.
I just keep watching.

<p>OpenStreetMap will take a large leap forward with the introduction of vector tiles on&nbsp;<a href="http://openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">openstreetmap.org</a>&nbsp;this year. This is the first of a series of blog posts where we will share our progress.</p>



<p>Vector tiles represent a significant advancement in how map data is processed and presented. Unlike traditional raster tiles, which are&nbsp;<a href="https://tile.openstreetmap.org/0/0/0.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">static images</a>&nbsp;with pixels, vector tiles are like the ‘SVGs’ of the mapping world: you get lines and points. This stores geodata in a format that allows for dynamic styling and interactivity, enabling the user to adapt the visual appearance of the map without altering the data. If that sounds like what you’ve seen on other maps, you are right! Vector tiles have become industry standard in interactive maps that, unlike&nbsp;<a href="http://openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">openstreetmap.org</a>, don’t get updated often, and where you can simply recalculate your whole database occasionally.</p>



<p>But the map displayed on&nbsp;<a href="http://openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">openstreetmap.org</a>&nbsp;are quite uniquely different! They get updated incrementally and constantly, a minute after you edit; it’s a critical part of the feedback loop to mappers – and how the author of this blog post got hooked in the first place. This is why we have to invest in our own vector tile software stack.</p>



<p>In the direct future, for users, this will mean a new, modern-looking map style with seamless zoom on&nbsp;<a href="http://openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">openstreetmap.org</a>. Looking further ahead, the most exciting part is what this vector tile project will make easy for volunteers and tile users: 3d maps, more efficient data mixing and matching and integration of other datasets, thematic styles, multilingual maps, different views for administrative boundaries, interactive points of interest, more accessible maps for vision-impaired users, and I’m sure many other ideas that no one has come up with yet. This technology is not just a leap in aesthetics, but also in functionality, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>



<p>To lead our vector tiles project, the OpenStreetMap Foundation has hired Paul Norman, a renowned figure in cartography and open data, whose journey with OpenStreetMap began in 2010 with a chance encounter on the xkcd forums. His role in the community took off with his work on OpenStreetMap Carto in 2013. His volunteer involvement with the OSM Foundation, including contributions to several working groups and a tenure on the OSMF board, highlights his commitment to the project. Professionally, he has held various influential positions at MapQuest, CartoDB, Wikimedia Foundation, and Amazon. Billions have seen the products of his work. To read more from Paul, visit his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paulnorman.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a>&nbsp;for technical deep dives into vector tiles, follow him on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.osm.town/@pnorman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastodon</a>&nbsp;or on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/penorman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://osmfoundation.org/w/images/2/27/2021_survey_slides.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021 community survey</a>&nbsp;(page 15), there was no clear sentiment on what the foundation should do on vector tiles. We noticed a split in preferences: some advocated for volunteer-led development, others for professional engagement. The ecosystem has evolved since then, making it easier to build on top of existing software bricks. We see our project as a reasonable balance between the two most popular answers. Investing in core software is also&nbsp;<a href="https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Strategic_Plan#Strengthen_maintenance_and_feature_development_of_core_software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of our multi-year strategic plan</a>.</p>



<p>The OpenStreetMap Foundation depends on donations to finish this project. If you would like to support our year of vector tiles specifically, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://supporting.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">donate</a>&nbsp;and leave ‘vector tiles’ in the donation message. Every contribution, large or small, directly supports our ability to ensure that OpenStreetMap can be open, accessible and dynamic for all. Your support is not just a donation; it’s an investment in the future of open-source mapping.</p>



<p>We’re just at the beginning of this exciting journey. Stay tuned as we will delve deeper into the schema and style aspects in future blog posts.</p>

<p>There’s an old joke about a guy who murders his parents, then throws himself on the mercy of the court because he’s an orphan.&nbsp;</p> <p>A variant of this thinking is becoming an accepted strategy at major entertainment corporations like Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which adopted a scorched earth brand of accounting after its 2022 merger that sought to reduce debt by using drastic measures. One of WBD’s most notorious post-merger decisions was deleting an entire finished feature, “<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-batgirl-cancellation-why-it-happened-the-social-media-fallout-and-more">Batgirl</a>,” that had an estimated budget of $90 million, to claim a tax write-off, deeming it bad-to-the-point of un-releasability (how they could prove this when no one outside the production had seen it remains a mystery worthy of Benoit Blanc).&nbsp;</p>

 <p>The company seems determined to do it again with another one of their productions, the live-action/animation hybrid “Coyote vs. Acme,” a comedy based on a <em>New Yorker</em> humor piece about Wile E. Coyote suing the Acme corporation that reportedly cost $70 million, co-starring <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-cena">John Cena</a> and <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/will-forte">Will Forte</a>, directed by <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/dave-green">Dave Green</a>. The film was already done and had performed exceptionally with test audiences <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/coyote-vs-acme-crew-blindsided-by-warner-bros-killing-movie-1234873156/">(in the high 90s, according to a <em>Rolling Stone </em>article</a>) when it was earmarked for deletion last November so that the company could claim a tax write-off, as they had done with “Batgirl”.&nbsp;</p> <p>To my knowledge, the company has never given anyone a justification beyond debt reduction and a bit of vague gesticulation toward a corporate vision that the film supposedly didn’t sync with. Public outcry caused the company to <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/coyote-vs-acme-decision-reversed-warner-bros/">backpedal</a> in November 2023 and say that they would sell the movie elsewhere, but Drew Taylor of <em>The Wrap</em> <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/coyote-vs-acme-update-offers-warner-bros/">has reported</a> that the company never entertained any negotiations about their asking price, demanding not a penny less than $70 to $80 million for the privilege of owning a project that they would only gain $30 million by scrubbing from their own ledgers. The offer to sell the film was, to put it mildly, not undertaken in good faith. It appears that the company would rather take less money by writing off the movie than sell it for even a few dollars more than that, because they might risk having a rival turn it into a success, which would further embarrass them for never even having tried to market it themselves, even though it was built around “intellectual property” (i.e., adorable cartoon characters) that are as inextricably linked with Warner Bros. <a href="https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/france-facts/symbols-of-the-republic/article/marianne#:~:text=Marianne%20represents%20the%20permanent%20values,Liberty%2C%20Equality%2C%20Fraternity%22.&amp;text=The%20earliest%20representations%20of%20a,time%20of%20the%20French%20Revolution.">as Marianne is with the nation of France</a>.</p> <p>It’s not just the completed film that gets deleted in cases like this, but everything associated with the film, which means that nobody who did any sort of work on a project that consumed years of their lives will ever be able to point to it as evidence of what sort of work they’re capable of doing, and get more work. At least when a real estate company demolishes a completed building before anyone’s had a chance to move into it, there are photos of what it looked like. “With this write-off, everything gets deleted, not just what you see on screen, but everything that it took to make the film,” the film’s editor Carsten Kaparnek told <em>Rolling Stone</em> at the time. “A released movie is just the tip of a giant iceberg of love and labor. The talent and commitment of the people who bring a project to life should not go unnoticed … All of it is now lost but will never be forgotten by those lucky enough to have been there.” (<a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/warner-bros-discovery/shelving-movies-tax-write-off-coyote-vs-acme-warner-bros">As Jacob Oller pointed out in an article for <em>Paste</em></a>, in the old celluloid days, studios or filmmakers who tried to do this had to burn a negative.)</p>

Other decisions appear coldly pragmatic at first glance but reveal themselves as counterproductive after a closer look, like offloading formerly exclusive HBO productions like “Band of Brothers” to Netflix or cutting the number of available Looney Tunes and offering them to rivals (those characters are literal mascots for the company; imagine Disney+ doing the same with Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy cartoons, and the horrified reaction of devotees of that brand). Taken to extremes, the mentality is the equivalent of trying to get your weight down by slicing off fingers, toes and ears. The number on the bathroom scale is reduced, but the corporate body politic is traumatized from shock and blood loss, and nobody considered the long-term health ramifications.</p> <p>It has been pointed out to me that companies own things and therefore can do whatever they want with them. Being an American, I’m aware of that position.&nbsp;</p> <p>But I’m also aware that—in theory, at least—governments exist (in part) to regulate corporations, in order to stop them from doing things that are deleterious or destructive to the public good and to individuals who work for them. They have the means and motive to step in, whether declaring certain kinds of waste dumping to be illegal, trying to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Anti-Corruption_Act">prevent private companies from bribing or otherwise influencing public officials</a>, or mandating that TV networks cannot blast the volume of ads to make them audible to viewers who leave the room during commercial breaks. (Yes, that last thing is real; it’s legislation known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Advertisement_Loudness_Mitigation_Act#:~:text=2847)%20(CALM%20Act)%20requires,and%20Maintaining%20Audio%20Loudness%20for">CALM Act</a>.)&nbsp;</p> <p>They should do something similar for all types of media. The template could be the moral rights of artists in some European markets, which you can read about at length <a href="https://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1234&amp;context=pilr">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>A selective adaptation of that idea for the United States is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Artists_Rights_Act">Visual Artists Rights Act</a> of 1990, which smart lawyers might want to look into. Among other things, it grants artists “the right to prevent distortion, mutilation, or modification that would prejudice the author's honor or reputation.”</p> <p>Whatever the technical legality of writing off completed films and destroying them for pennies on the dollar, it’s morally reprehensible: Oller memorably calls it “an accounting assassination.” Defending it on grounds that it’s not illegal is bootlicking.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>The practice also has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/magazine/david-zaslav-warner-media-discovery.html">a whiff of the plot of Mel Brooks’s “The Producers</a>”. The original idea of Brooks’ hustler protagonists Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom was to mount a play so awful that it would close immediately, and they can live off the unspent money they raised from bilking old ladies. When the show unexpectedly becomes a hit, they blow up the theater.&nbsp;</p> <p>The biggest difference between the plot of “The Producers” and what happened to “Batgirl” and “Coyote vs Acme” is that in “The Producers,” the public got to see the play. </p>

Its technologies and best practices are getting more widely deployed, both to more companies and more broadly inside of companies.</p><p>This is the phase of any cycle where the real work gets done and where the real value gets created. It’s the phase for getting living in the trenches and solving real problems. The MDS was the future five years ago and it’s still the future today, but we actually have to roll up our sleeves to make the replatforming happen.</p></blockquote><p><span>Over the last month this has been bugging me. I don’t know if you’ve ever had that nagging feeling after writing something that </span><em>just doesn’t feel right</em><span>, but writing this knocked something loose in my head. Since then, I’ve become a little obsessed with the question: </span><strong>what’s going on with the modern data stack?</strong><span> </span></p><p><span>I became increasingly confident that </span><em>something</em><span> had changed. Sure, it was easy to point to the superficial changes. But I felt like there was a more interesting narrative to tell, and as both </span><a href="https://www.getdbt.com/blog/future-of-the-modern-data-stack" rel="">a historian of this technology wave</a><span> and a founder responsible for navigating it, I wanted to nail this down. I caught up with a bunch of folks I respect, from founders to practitioners to VCs, and want to use this newsletter as a way to share my current thinking. I can’t share all of my datapoints on the current state of the world (many of them are proprietary) but I’ll share as much as I can. </span></p><p>Let’s start at the beginning.</p><p>In 2016, the modern data stack was a well-defined idea. </p><p>It was never an industry or a software category or a Gartner Magic Quadrant. When the data community started using this term it simply meant a set of products that a) redesigned the analytics workflow to take advantage of the cloud and b) all interacted with one another via SQL. </p><p>Looker was one of the classic examples. BI built for Redshift, taking advantage of the inherent performance and scalability improvements native to that platform. The idea that you could have a mature BI solution without any local processing or caching was novel in 2013.</p><p>Fivetran and dbt are also classic examples. The cloud meant that ETL should be rebuilt as ELT, which created a dramatically new, lower-cost, lower-friction, more accessible way of doing this critical, but traditionally very painful, data work.</p><p><span>The MDS: </span><em>analytics products, designed to take advantage of the cloud, interacting via SQL</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>In 2016, when I </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-steps-tools-setting-up-modern-saas-based-bi-tristan-handy/" rel="">started talking about this</a><span>, the fact that a product had been designed to take advantage of the cloud was important. It created massive differentiation for those products—many ran circles around pre-existing products because they were built from scratch with totally different priors.</span></p><p>When I was a consultant, helping small companies build analytics capabilities, I would only work with MDS tooling. It was so much better that I simply wouldn’t take on a project if the client wanted to use pre-cloud tools. I, and others like me, needed a way to talk about this preference, to differentiate between these new products and all of the other ones that we didn’t want to use. The term actually conveyed important information.</p><p>Today, most data products are built for the cloud. Either they have been built in the past ten years and therefore baked in cloud-first assumptions, or they have been re-architected to do so. </p><p><a href="https://medium.com/fishtown-analytics/is-looker-the-right-business-intelligence-tool-for-my-company-afc1f750a0f9" rel="">Another of my posts from 2016</a><span> compares Looker and Tableau, and criticizes Tableau for not being able to effectively process certain types of data (particularly clickstream data). This was true…</span><em>in 2016</em><span>. Tableau’s Redshift integration back then was quite bad; the SQL that it wrote was not at all performant on large datasets. This should not be surprising because nearly all data processing in Tableau happened via local extracts at the time. Tableau on top of clickstream data wasn’t really a thing, as prior to Redshift </span><em>almost no BI tech </em><span>could handle clickstream data and users didn’t expect this. </span></p><p><span>So: in 2016, differentiating between Looker (MDS) and Tableau (pre-MDS) was useful. But 8 years later, with the explosion of data processing happening in the cloud, Tableau has evolved. I’m sure it wasn’t easy for the Tableau team to go on its cloud journey, but it is one that </span><em>most</em><span> pre-cloud data companies have gone through. I have talked to the founders of so many of these companies and “migrating to the cloud” is almost always this harrowing bet-the-company march through the desert. But it’s so existential that everyone does it anyway (or dies trying).</span></p><p>So—does that mean that Tableau “joined the modern data stack” once it improved its cloud-native capabilities? Not…really? I don’t think anyone would say “Tableau is a modern data stack company.” But then…what information is the MDS designation really conveying at this point? The useful information content that existed in 2016 is no longer present.</p><p>Of course, as with many ideas, we didn’t stop using the term just because it stopped conveying the same information content. Instead, the MDS morphed from a descriptive term into a meme. </p><p>I worried we had hit peak MDS when I went to big investment banker conference and a very senior banker said something like “the market can’t get enough of all of these modern data stack companies!” I was confused, because a) I was in the community that coined that term, and b) there were no publicly-traded MDS companies I knew of aside from Snowflake. So, I asked him what companies he was referring to. He mentioned Mongo, Datadog, and Confluent. </p><p>Now, all of these are great companies that I look up to and respect. But…these are not “modern data stack” companies as far as I understood the term.</p><p>What had happened here is that, circa 2021, the MDS had officially jumped the shark. From 2020 to 2022, the meteoric rise of Snowflake and Databricks and a few other companies had caused (mostly private market) investors to go all-in on this market trend in a way that very rarely happens. And so being a “modern data stack” company was valuable. Just like an index fund needs to hold a certain % in each stock in the index, every VC needed exposure to the MDS trend. And this euphoria bled into public market investors who sought out whatever exposure they could get.</p><p>But it wasn’t just about investor sentiment. Investor sentiment was driven by real adoption trends, and in turn drove press interest, and then further customer awareness and adoption. The number of enterprise CDOs who woke up to the MDS in that 3-year period was incredible, and it was driven by this cycle of early-adopters &gt; investors &gt; press coverage &gt; more adopters.</p><p>This is not a bad thing! This is just how enterprise tech works. But along the way, the phrase lost its attachment to the underlying information it was conveying. It was no longer describing some specific trait that products like Looker and Fivetran and dbt had and others didn’t, it was just…a meme. A market trend.</p><p>And once a trend gains momentum, it can become self-fulfilling.</p><p>Imagine it’s 2021, peak MDS, and you meet the CDO of a large bank. “Oh cool,” she says, “you’re the CEO of a tech company. What does your product do?” What do you say?</p><ol><li><p>“We build a tool that leverages the power of the cloud to apply standard SQL and software engineering best practices to the historically mundane (but critical!) job of data transformation.”</p></li><li><p>“We’re the standard for data transformation in the modern data stack.” </p></li></ol><p>I will tell you that, empirically, option #2 is more effective. And that wasn’t just true for me, it was likely true for every founder building products in the space. Investors and buyers both understand what you meant faster and better if you relate your product to trends they are already familiar with. </p><p><span>So once the MDS had become a part of the lexicon for VCs and CDOs and bankers, founders had every reason to claim the moniker for their own products. This isn’t a </span><em>problem </em><span>(or a conspiracy!), this is just how capitalism and ideas work.</span></p><p>This is when the vendor ecosystem in the modern data stack reached peak collaboration. The end-to-end problem was far too big for any one startup to solve, and so swim lanes were established and partnership ruled the day. </p><p>There was a lot of valuable co-marketing, partnership deals, co-sponsored events, and co-selling. This had real value for everyone involved—customers and vendors alike. Companies voluntarily integrated their products together, cross-promoted each other publicly, and built partnerships that made owning and operating these technologies far easier for customers.</p><p>And, with clearly defined swim lanes and a need to create ‘better together’ stories to sell a complete solution, companies had a real route to market for their products as a part of this industry trend. If you built something great that solved problems for both partners and customers, you could get initial traction with partner-led sales pretty easily.</p><p>This was a beautiful thing. Private capital fueling founders, who not only built their own products but were consciously coming together to build an ecosystem, leading to the rapid buildout of interoperable products all taking advantage of a new technology platform (the cloud). </p><p>But eventually the party stopped, and it stopped for two reasons:</p><ol><li><p>The changing market environment impacted both buyer and investor behaviors</p></li><li><p>AI crowds out the MDS as the primary industry trend in data</p></li></ol><p>The market shifted in two ways: investor behavior changed and buyer behavior changed. Simultaneously. One of these things changing is disruptive; both of them changing at the same time is enough to reshuffle the whole deck.</p><p><span>On investor behavior: modern data stack companies were getting epic valuations up through EOY2021 / into early 2022. dbt Labs was certainly a part of this! At the peak, valuations reached 100x forward ARR. Investors said: estimate what your annual recurring revenue will be in 12 months, multiply that by 100, and that’s how we’ll value the company. That is </span><em>historically</em><span> aggressive. It reflects not only the belief in the MDS market trend on the part of investors, but also the very real search for growth on the part of investors during the zero interest rate era (ZIRP).</span></p><p><span>As inflation climbed and interest rates adjusted upwards </span><em>very quickly</em><span> during 2022, the market reset. Private multiples are now more like 10-20x forward revenue, so dropping 80%+.</span></p><p>Basically all MDS companies were/are VC-backed. And when valuations are high, companies have the capital to invest in sales, marketing, R&amp;D, community teams, everything. With plenty of capital, partnership teams are large, everyone has bandwidth to do comarketing events, and there are engineers to build integrations. </p><p>As capital becomes scarce and efficiency is in the crosshairs, companies cut all but the most essential activities. Even if every MDS company were long-term healthy, much of the ecosystem dynamic dies without these investments. Companies put their heads down and focus on the fundamentals.</p><p>Changes in buyer behavior are at least as impactful. CFOs took a scalpel to data budgets, looking to save money on both headcount and software spend. The euphemism “cloud optimization” has been used extensively over the past ~18 months on earnings calls to describe this behavior, and it’s often the smallest companies with the most nascent products that get cut first. Even in customer relationships that lasted through this period, many experienced reduced contract sizes as layoffs impacted many, many data teams. </p><p>All of this hurt growth for all software companies, and it hurt the smallest ones the most. These companies had the smallest balance sheets, smallest customer lists, just generally the least resources to weather the storm. Some of these companies have gone away already; some live on but are shells of their former selves.</p><p>Companies in the top quartile are still significantly impacted. Where they may have all once felt they had a clear path to long-term independence, many are now questioning that. They’re doing fine, but wondering what their 5 year path looks like.</p><p>Even the most financially successful few companies in the MDS (and I’d count us as one of them) likely had a challenging year last year amidst all of these changes. All of us have retooled for growth in a different environment but are fortunate to have strong product-market fit in important categories—this has allowed us to make these adjustments and come out the other side strong.</p><p>Finally, as a result of all of this pressure on data spend, buyers developed a strong preference to buy integrated solutions rather than to buy many tools to construct a stack. Buyer willingness to construct a stack from 8-12 vendors has declined significantly. Companies are much more likely today to expect to buy 2-4 products as the core of their analytics infrastructure. This creates yet more pressure for consolidation, and will likely drive more M&amp;A activity and competition across the vendor landscape.</p><p>Overall: what once was a collaborative modern data stack ecosystem full of startups and growth and comarketing and event sponsorships has been supplanted by a bunch of companies focused on executing and where partnerships are still important but only when they have clearly-demonstrated ROI.</p><p><span>This is all very natural, and long-term for the best! But </span><em>the vibes, they are a-changin’</em><span>.</span></p><p>A market trend is only as relevant as the attention it commands and the investor behavior it drives. </p><p>The MDS was a big, important market trend. But AI is bigger. A lot bigger. And it’s hard for data investors and data buyers to focus on too many trends at once.</p><p><span>This means that, </span><strong>even though AI and the MDS are highly complimentary</strong><span>, the massive attention being paid to AI right now detracts from the MDS as an industry trend. This is just a fact. You can likely see this in your own experience over the last couple of years, and it shows up in a million ways in my day-to-day.</span></p><p>And you know what? I’m more than ok with that. It’s fun to be at the center of the world for a little while. But at the end of the day what matters isn’t your Google Trends ranking, it’s whether or not you’re impacting real people, whether you’re building a lasting business. Being out of the spotlight is helpful: it’s grounding, focusing. </p><p><span>Moreover, this ‘turning point’ is a core feature in the process of developing new technologies.

Today, IMHO, it’s no longer useful in any of those roles.

Many practitioners who have started their careers in the past decade (and many vendors!) have some very </span><em>pre-cloud</em><span> lessons to (re-)learn.

I’m not going to become some anti-MDS grump on Linkedin. The point isn’t the words, really, it’s the fact that the underlying reality has changed. So: whether or not you continue to say “modern data stack”—the world in which that phrase rose to prominence just doesn’t exist any more.</p><p>That’s ok! All of this is really a side story to the very real benefits that a set of technologies and workflows have created for very real practitioners and their employers.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  


  <p>I love my <a href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2">Remarkable 2</a>. I’ve been using it pretty heavily for almost a year now. It’s my every day companion device. Here’s some notes and ideas.</p>

<p><em>Note: this is all my personal opinion, I have no ties to Remarkable. Although they are <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/18/dream-clients/">one of my dream clients for 2024</a> so there’s that.</em></p>

<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>

<h2 id="the-remarkable-is-great-at-reading--writing-and-arithmetic">The Remarkable is Great at Reading &amp; Writing (and Arithmetic!)</h2>

<p>What do I use my Remarkable for? The three R’s - reading, writing and arithmetic.</p>

<p>Core, daily usage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Taking notes, capturing ideas, jotting down the day’s todo list. All of the kinds of things that a notebook does for you.</li>
  <li>Doodling, diagramming and constructing more involved elaborate ideas. The kind of thing that is hard to do on a notebook because it involves zooming in and out, erasing sections, using straight lines etc.</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1754690464156946652">Reading PDFs</a> (and annotating with notes) - what a perfect form factor for reading PDFs! I’ve read so many more academic papers over the last year directly because of my Remarkable.</li>
  <li>I’ve been working with a client to make a Monthly Business Review packet - it’s 50+ pages of charts and data, Amazon-style, and on a whim I loaded it onto my Remarkable as a PDF and it’s a great way to read all the data (and add little annotations!). Now I load each month on there and sit down and read it front to back.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fun, quirky uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Helping my daughter Roxy with her maths homework! I find that explaining things like mathematical concepts in a space where you can easily erase, switch pages etc is useful. Roxy and I did that last night as I was helping her understand place value for tens and hundreds.</li>
  <li>There are various game templates for the Remarkable that you can buy but I prefer to play something like <a href="https://athriftymom.com/pencil-wars-drawing-game/">drawing wars</a> with my kids!</li>
</ul>

<p>And here’s a recent usage that I’m really digging - constructing a custom project tracker for my book writing project:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomcritchlow.com/images/2024-02-09-11-09-19.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The base layer is a PDF I made in Figma that then lets me track editing progress as I work through my <a href="https://buttondown.email/winterwordcraft">Winter of Word Craft</a> book sprint.</p>

<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>



<p>I’ve also been playing around recently with some fun remarkable templates - things that work great on a drawing device. Like Wardly Maps:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomcritchlow.com/images/2024-02-09-11-17-56.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And <a href="https://smithery.com/2020/12/01/starting-with-zenko-mapping/">Zenko maps</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomcritchlow.com/images/2024-02-09-11-18-19.png" alt=""></p>

<p>One thing I want to do is load up some sheet music on it (well, first I have to learn how to read sheet music. Actually maybe I should put a piano key template on there and I can just color in the keys I need to play…)</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you can play this and tell me what song it is i have a project I want to work on together with you <a href="https://t.co/d30KMj0dKU">pic.twitter.com/d30KMj0dKU</a></p>— Toby (@tobyshorin) <a href="https://twitter.com/tobyshorin/status/1719857006608031884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2023</a></blockquote>


<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>



<p>Here’s some ideas I’d <em>love</em>:</p>

<p>I work with my Remarkable template right next to my laptop screen every day. It functions a lot like a second screen - except getting things onto my tablet is a slightly slow process. What if there was a “second screen mode” that could be a combination of live-data and note taking? Something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomcritchlow.com/images/2024-02-09-11-13-02.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>(I just faked this demo with a PDF but a live-calendar view imported from Google Calendar would be awesome - I’d like more room to scribble on my calendar pls)</em></p>

<p>Related to this idea - I’d also love a more formal diary / daily entry system. Kind of like Obsidian’s daily notes. Some kind of date-based notebook inside the Remarkable would be rad (even if it doesn’t sync with your actual calendar!). A daily journaling / diary / planning format would be great. (Yes, right now you can select a day-planner template, but you can’t then see them in a calendar view - the date isn’t a foundational element of the note).</p>

<p>Another thing I’d like - a quick-send feature. When you select an object on your tablet you can cut/copy/paste etc. I’d love one more quick-action to email it to yourself. Right now you have the option to send yourself a full page (as png or pdf etc) but often I have a single diagram/sketch that I want to send to myself - I don’t want the full page.</p>

<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>

<h2 id="giving-advice-is-hard-of-course">Giving Advice is Hard of Course</h2>

<p>As we know, <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/23/advice/">giving advice is tricky</a>. All these ideas are ignorant of the real challenges and focus areas that Remarkable is thinking about. Maybe Remarkable is gearing up to launch Remarkable 3? Maybe they’re trying to push into enterprise use cases? Maybe they’re trying partner with an ebook platform so you can buy and read books? I know at least that international seems to be a focus for them right now.</p>

<p>If I had to guess though, looking at the outside I think one of the core tensions for Remarkable is that they have their own software and they don’t run a stock android install. This is likely both a benefit (full control) and a curse because it makes things like ebooks, loading web pages, syncing with calendars etc much harder…</p>

<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>

<p>Anyway - if you’re a Remarkable user, what are your workflows and setups? I’d love to compare notes!</p>

						<p>The smell of fresh pine sawdust filled the air, with more floating up as I sanded the last rough corner of the stool. My toddler was happily sanding her own block off to the side.</p><p>Woodworking was a new hobby I'd picked up. My old ones, coding, reading, writing, had kept me stuck to my laptop, holed up by myself. Not very toddler friendly.</p><p>A surprise <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Decker-Junior-Workbench-Workshop-Realistic/dp/B0016DE80I?ref=zainrizvi.io">gift</a> laid the seeds of an idea. As a boy, the best summer days were when my dad and I would transform scratch wood into bird houses, planes, and eventually even rube goldberg devices. It was time to rekindle the flame.</p><p>A few youtube videos and a HomeDepot run later, it was time to pause my side coding projects and foray into a new world.</p><p>Except it wasn't that different from the old one! </p><p>Woodworking felt strangely familiar. Even its dopamine hits triggered the same spots that programming would.</p><p>Turns out, the best parts of woodworking aren't actually that different from software engineering:</p><p>The best software engineering moments are when you building your own tools. That's work with purpose.</p><p>Woodworkers do it too. They call such tools "jigs". &nbsp;Some jigs might be built to meet niche needs (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1tqN65yRaQ&amp;ref=zainrizvi.io">drilling straight holes</a>). Others, just to save money.</p><p>As always, you have to decide what's the value of your engineering time.</p><p>There are mind boggling varieties of woodworking tools out there, each optimized for a slightly different situation. Want to saw wood with the grain? Against the grain? Need a quick but ugly cut? Need a smooth cut and don't mind it taking longer? What about curved cuts?

<p>For the first time ever, I was laid off, and had to find a new software developer job. I managed to find a new one, but it took longer than I thought, and it was a lot of work. I was in contact with 30 companies, got a no from 8 companies, no reply from 6 companies, and offers from 3 companies. Here is what I learnt from the process.</p>

<h2>Laid Off</h2>



<p>At the end of October last year, I lost my job. I was completely surprised, but in retrospect, maybe I shouldn’t have been that surprised. The times were getting tougher, and many companies had been laying off people during all of 2023. If the company is not making enough money, eventually there will be layoffs. In my case, we were 17 people let go that day, including 8 developers.</p>



<p>A few minutes after I had the Zoom call with the CEO, my access to all company resources was cut off. Apart from not being able to finish what I was working on (I had several unpushed changes), it becomes harder to say goodbye to everybody. Many of my colleagues reached out on LinkedIn, which was great. Some even set up Zoom calls so we could talk about what had happened, and say a proper goodbye, which I really appreciated.</p>



<p>Being let go was a new experience for me. The closest I have been in the past is during the dot com bust, when the project I was working on at Ericsson was cut. They were not yet laying people off (that came a bit later), so we were offered other roles within Ericsson. But I decided to change to another company instead (they reached out directly to me, since I had worked with of them at Ericsson). All the other times I have changed jobs, it’s been on my own initiative, while still being employed. I typically stayed on for three months (the standard notice period in Sweden), finishing up what I was working on, before starting at the new company.</p>



<p>The upside of being cut off immediately is that I could immediately spend all of my time looking for a new job, while still getting paid for some time. Even though I was surprised that I was let go, I didn’t panic. <a href="https://henrikwarne.com/2017/03/12/programmer-career-planning/">My philosophy</a> has always been that I should be prepared to find a new job at any time, since you never know what will happen. So I keep a list of companies that I would like to work at. I also stay friendly with recruiters that contact me, in case I need to get back to them.</p>



<h2>Finding Roles</h2>



<p>I started looking for another job immediately. The best source for this was LinkedIn, but I found some jobs through other means.</p>



<h3>LinkedIn</h3>



<p><strong>Open to work.</strong> The first thing I did was to change my LinkedIn “open to work” status to <em>“Immediately, I’m actively applying”</em> (from <em>“Flexible, I am casually looking”</em>, which I normally use). I kept the visibility to recruiters only, not all LinkedIn members (which would set the green <strong>#OpenToWork</strong> photo frame). I have seen arguments for and against using <strong>#OpenToWork</strong> – it lets more people know you are looking, versus it makes you look desperate. It is hard to know which is better, but I decided to only let recruiters know.</p>



<p>As soon as I changed this setting, I got contacted by maybe five recruiters per day for the first week or so. I suppose the LinkedIn algorithm alerts recruiters to people that have just changed their status. The quality of the roles was about the same as I normally get (albeit at a much higher rate) – some I really liked, some were OK, and some were definitely not for me.</p>



<p><strong>Applying to known companies.</strong> Next, I went through my list of companies I would like to work for, and looked to see if they had any open developer roles. I first looked on the company page on LinkedIn, then clicked on the Jobs tab. Many of the companies were actively recruiting. A good thing when you click on an ad is that you can see how many people have applied, and how old the ad is. Sometimes I would also go to the company home page and look at their career page. But I found it convenient to go through LinkedIn, where the format is the same, and you can see if any of your contacts work there. Sometimes you can also see who has posted the ad.</p>



<p><strong>Job ads.</strong> I also looked through job ads on LinkedIn. There is a search function, and I tried different searches, for example “Golang Stockholm”. It works well enough, and I would click on anything that looked interesting. LinkedIn also has a “Recommended for you”-section and “Jobs where you’d be a top applicant”-section (only if you have Premium), and I guess they use your skills and previous searches to populate these. These also showed a good selection of job ads.</p>



<p>There are however two problems. The first is that searching for fully remote jobs is unreliable. Sometimes it turns up good ads, but sometimes it turns up roles that are e.g. remote only in the UK. It would be good to be able to search for fully remote roles in Sweden, fully remote in EU, or fully remote worldwide.</p>



<p>The second problem is that it is not possible to get only the latest ads, for example ads that are less than a week old. So I ended up having to page through a lot of ads I had already seen. After I had found a new job, I saw a good solution for this in a tweet: use Google, set the time interval to last week, and search for e.g. <em>“golang fully remote site:linkedin.com/jobs”</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Reaching out.</strong> I also reached out to around 15 recruiters that had contacted me on LinkedIn in the past, but nothing came out of that. I knew that the roles they contacted me for would not be open, but I thought that they might be recruiting for something similar. On a few occasions I sent a direct message (InMail) to managers that were recruiting (some encouraged you to do this in their bios), but I don’t think I got a single response. Perhaps I was not a good enough fit, but it was still disappointing.</p>



<h3>Other Sources</h3>



<p>In Sweden there is a site that is matching developers with employers called <a href="https://demando.io/sv">Demando</a>. You fill out a profile, listing your skills, and giving a minimum salary you will accept. Companies advertise jobs there too, and you get a message if there is a match. I already had an inactive profile there that I activated, setting a relatively high minimum salary. I got contacted by one company there, which I later got an offer from. I also found a job ad there for a company I would like to work for. I did not find that ad on LinkedIn. I applied to them, and got an offer from them too. So pretty good payoff from using that site.</p>



<p>I also briefly looked at a site called <a href="https://remoteok.com/">RemoteOK</a>, but didn’t find anything that I applied to there. My general sense was that the quality of job ads there was much lower than on LinkedIn. I also had a look at <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/">Efianancialcareers</a>, but there are almost no fully remote roles there (and they are hard to search for). On the first of every month, there is Hacker News thread called <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=pastMonth&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=Who%27s%20hiring&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=story">Who’s hiring</a>. I looked there briefly too, but I found it too hard to find something relevant there.</p>



<p>I later found another good way of finding companies to check to see if they have any open roles: google “competitor to” or “alternative to” and a company name, to find similar companies.</p>



<h3>Applying and Tracking</h3>



<p>All recruiters I was in contact with asked for my CV, even though it is mostly the same information that is already on my LinkedIn profile. It is almost as if it is a sign that you are serious. This is fine with me, since once I had an up-to-date CV, I just attached that one. When applying to companies directly, most companies ask for a CV (even when including your LinkedIn profile), and many also asked for a cover letter. I saved all the cover letters I wrote, and when I needed to write a new one, I copied the most similar previous one I had, and modified it to fit the new application.</p>



<p>Soon after I started to send out applications, I created an Excel sheet to keep track of my applications. I included company name, date the application was sent, recruiter or contact person, and a column for general notes. Looking at it now, it has 30 entries, but I didn’t send applications to all of them. In some cases, I added an entry after speaking to a recruiter, but then nothing came of it.</p>



<p>6 companies I applied to never responded at all. In some cases, the ad was more than a month old. But if the ad is no longer relevant, they should take it down instead of leaving it up and not responding. In some cases, I tried to contact the recruiter that had posted the ad, but I didn’t get a response that way either.</p>



<p>Ideally, all companies should respond. But I don’t mind too much if I don’t get a response if I haven’t been in contact with a person at the company. However, if I have had an interview with them, I think they should at least let you know if they are not interested. At one company, I had an initial interview with a recruiter at the company. She said she would set up an interview with a manager. Then crickets. I mailed her after two weeks, asking what was happening, but didn’t get a response. Two weeks later, I sent another mail saying I was no longer interested, and got an half-hearted apology back (but no reason for why she never got back to me). So this exchange now colors my view of that company. </p>



<h3>Tools I Paid For</h3>



<p>I have never had <strong>LinkedIn Premium</strong> before, but I decided this was a good time to try it, so I paid for a month. However, it was quite disappointing. Maybe I could see more profile viewers, I am not sure, but it is definitely not showing who all of them are. And even if it had been, it has limited value in a job search. I also got a number of InMails to send each month (maybe 5?). I sent a couple, but they were not very useful for me either. Then there was the “Jobs where you’d be a top applicant”, but that too wasn’t very useful for me. So I cancelled after one month. Before cancelling, I had the option of extending it for two months for the price of one.</p>



<p>I also paid for a GoLand license for two months (quite expensive), since I was looking for Go jobs and wanted to practice in an environment I am used to. I signed up for <strong>Github CoPilo</strong>t too, because I wanted to try it. It’s quite good, but I didn’t use it much, because I wanted to make sure I did all coding by myself at interviews. I already had a subscription to <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, and that came in very handy for many take-home assignments.</p>



<p>I signed up for <strong>Leetcode </strong>too, as I have done in the past when preparing for interviews. Mostly I like the paid version because you can get the editorial explanation for the solutions. I practiced a bit in Leetcode, so it was worth the expense. One company used an IQ test from Alva labs, so I paid for a practice course called <strong>Alva Logic Cram Course</strong> from 12minprep (there were lots of vendors, but this was relatively cheap). It was definitely worth it, I did much better on the test than I would have, had I not practiced beforehand. </p>



<h3>Reflections</h3>



<p>Times are definitely harder now compared to the previous decade. There were still many open positions to apply for, but it looked like there were many more applicants for each role than in the past. On LinkedIn, where you can see how many applicants there are, many job ads would have more than a hundred applicants. Further evidence of times being tougher is the number of companies that I never heard back from, even though I believe I would be great for the role.</p>



<p>There is also a big focus on having experience in a given language. In the past, I have started a job developing in Python without any Python experience. The same for Golang. It didn’t take me long to get productive in each language. Partly this is because many imperative languages are very similar. Of course, knowing the libraries and ecosystems is good, but in my experience not strictly necessary. But many recruiters now told me that it was a hard requirement from the hiring companies to have at least two or three years’ experience in the given language.</p>



<h2>The Interview Process</h2>



<p>For a typical job there were four or five interviews: an initial interview with a recruiter, an interview with a hiring manager, one or two technical interviews (either live coding, or going through a take-home assignment). There could also be an interview with a product manager, and/or one with a CTO or founder. All in all, quite a time commitment.</p>



<p>I was applying for both local and remote roles. For the remote ones, all interviews were naturally on Zoom/Meet/Teams. For local jobs in Stockholm, most companies wanted in-person interviews. This caused some problems, because it takes time to travel into the city. I could easily do many remote interviews in a day, but one in-person interview would take half a day with commuting. Mostly I managed to schedule in-person interviews on the same days, which helped. The advantage of the in-person interviews is that you get a better feel for the other person, and you can see what the office looks like.</p>



<h3>Preparations</h3>



<p>Since before, I had a Word document that I called <em>Interview Tips</em>. In it I wrote down things to think about before an interview, in a format that is easy to review quickly. One section I added now was <strong>Behavioral Questions</strong>. These are questions of the form <em>“Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a coworker. How did you resolve it?”</em>. Typically, you should answer them using the STAR framework: Situation, Task, Action, Result, Reflection. In the past, I have failed interviews because of these questions – I hadn’t prepared, and couldn’t come up with good examples on the spot in the interviews.</p>



<p>This time I went through a good list of such questions (<a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leapai/">Rock the Behavioral Interview</a>) from Leetcode, and thought about examples to use. Once I had good examples, I wrote the question and my answer down in the document. Before an interview, I would review what I had written down, so I would be able to come up with good examples. This worked well, I didn’t fail any interviews because of behavioral questions.</p>



<p>In the document I also wrote down little snippets of code in both Python and Go. I tried to cover many common patterns and idioms. I did this so I could refresh my memory and quickly come up with the right syntax in a coding interview. I ran all the snippets first, to see that I hadn’t made any mistake, and included relevant output. Reviewing these snippets before an interview made me feel calmer and more prepared.</p>



<p>I also watched a good video by Gergely Orosz, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFOw_m5zNCs">Confessions from a Big Tech Hiring Manager: Tips for Software Engineering Interviews</a>, on technical interviews in general. Some takeaways: be curious and collaborative, and ask questions.</p>



<h3>Interviews</h3>



<p>In all my initial interviews, I was open with the fact that I had been let go from my previous job due to cut backs. I didn’t seem like disclosing this was to my disadvantage. I was never nervous talking to recruiters or managers – I always knew what to say, since I had done it many times, both in the past and for this round of interviews. It is easy for me to articulate what I am looking for in a job, and what my strengths are, because it is very clear in my mind. I was also not nervous before non-coding technical interviews, since I feel I know most technologies I have worked with quite well.</p>



<p>However, I was nervous when I had coding interviews. I don’t exactly know why, but my brain seems to work at only 50% capacity every time I have to do live coding. So, it can be hard for me to come up with a solution, or remember some syntax, when trying to solve a problem. Luckily, all live coding interviews went well this time, but probably mostly because I had prepared a lot.</p>



<p>Of all non-coding interviews, I failed only one (I failed several coding and take-home assignments though). For the one I failed, I was asked what timeout I would set on a database connection. I was more thinking about how long an individual user could be prepared to wait for a page to render, so blurted out too high of a number. This was enough to fail an interview that otherwise went pretty well.</p>



<h3>Coding Tests</h3>



<p>Compared to when I last interviewed a few years ago, there were more take-home assignments this time. Take-home assignments are a lot less stressful than live coding, but they also take much more time. Regardless of what the companies claim, I would say each assignment took at least six hours. There is an unfortunate asymmetry here: it is easy for a company to demand that you do a take-home assignment early on in the process, with almost no cost in effort to them. For the job-seeker, it is at least six hours of work that may or may not pay off. Even so, I noticed that each time I got going with an assignment, I <em>loved </em>the programming – being immersed in a task, structuring the code well, finding good names etc. It was extra obvious because I wasn’t programming as much as when I had a developer job.</p>



<p>I did five take-home assignments, two in Java, two in Python, and one in Go. I failed one and a half. For the Go assignment, I wrote a working solution, but did not include tests. This wasn’t stated as a requirement, but I should have included some even so (when developing the solution, I used a more interactive approach, which meant running the code a lot as I developed). That assignment was also failed because I did not include caching to speed it up (to me it was not clear that it would be run more than once though).</p>



<p>The other assignment, I failed because of hidden test cases and sloppy coding from me. The task was really good – I was given test cases, but no implementation. I implemented enough of the system to pass all the existing test cases. My instinct told me that I should add more test cases on my own (that’s what I would have done if this was on the job). However, I thought that I had already spent a lot of time on it, so I didn’t. When we went through my solution in the interview afterwards, they had run some extra (hidden) test cases on my solution, and discovered two errors in my code. Both had to do with cases with empty input. I felt really stupid for not being more careful implementing the solution. In the end, I still got an offer from that company, and that’s why I am counting it as only half a failure.</p>



<p>For the take-home assignments, it was quite helpful to have access to ChatGPT. Getting a working framework up for what I wanted to do was a lot quicker that way. </p>



<p>Of the live coding assignments, I passed three and failed two. In the first one I failed, I had to write a limited chess program, that only supported two kinds of pieces. It needed a project structure, a data model, valid movements for the pieces, and tests. I started from nothing, and had to be send the solution in within two hours. It was very tight and stressful. I got most of it working, but not all functionality. I also had a bug in the movement code. That combination made it a fail.</p>



<p>The other live coding was less well prepared from the company. I downloaded a repo from Github with some initial code. But there were no working tests, and it took a while to set up an environment to work in. I also had to ask many questions on how the logic was supposed to work (with 50% of my brain capacity), and in the end I took too long. For all live coding tests, I used the IDE on my computer, and shared the screen over Zoom.</p>



<h2>Salary</h2>



<p>A couple of times in the beginning, I gave too high of a salary number, resulting in cancelled interviews. So I changed my tactics to instead tell them what my salary had been each year for the past four years, to give them a sense of what I was ideally looking at (I had had quite good salaries). Often, they would say “well, we can’t pay that”. To this I would respond that since I currently don’t have a job, I don’t really have a minimum acceptable salary, it will depend on what they (and others) can offer. This would often mean that we could continue the process. Sometimes it also meant that I had a chance to show what I had to offer, which might later translate to a better offer than they initially intended.</p>



<p>Once I had my first offer, it became easier. Surprisingly often when I asked the companies what the salary range for the role was, I would get an answer. This was really good, because I could say no to the ones that offered less than I was prepared to accept. In one case, it didn’t check what salary they were prepared to pay. I only found out when I got an offer from them (after a lot of interviews and a take-home assignment). I did this because I really liked the company, but their offer was very low. In hindsight, I should have checked upfront, instead of wasting a lot of time and effort on them.</p>



<p>Even before this job-hunting round, I had quite a good sense of what salaries companies in Stockholm pay developers. It got even better after talking to many companies. In Sweden, you think in terms of the monthly salary. You also have to consider if pension contributions are included or not (in most cases they are included, and can be an additional 10 to 15 percent, which is implicitly included). A very average developer salary would be 55K – 65K SEK per month. Almost all companies are prepared to pay that. Getting a salary of 80K a month and over is more difficult, but definitely not impossible, even in a tight market. In addition to salary, many companies can offer options or equity, and/or a bonus.</p>



<p>In the end, you also have to weigh other aspects of the job. How interesting is the product and company? What language will you work in? What will you learn? Who will your colleagues be?</p>



<h2>Choosing</h2>



<p>One company I interviewed with was very positive, and ended up asking for two references, which I provided. But the next day, they announced that they would go with another candidate. I was quite surprised, since I thought I would get an offer from them. It’s ok if they find somebody else, but I was upset that they wasted the time of two of my references. The recruiter later apologized and said that she was convinced they wanted to give me an offer, but the manager had picked somebody else. I don’t know what to think, but it was quite a disappointment.</p>



<p>Even if you fail to get offers at most companies you apply to, you only need to have one where you are successful. In a sense it is a numbers game – go through enough processes so that you get at least one offer.</p>



<p>In the end, I had three and a half offers to choose from (I didn’t formally get an offer from one of the companies, mostly because I knew it would pay less than two of the offers I already had, so I am only counting it as a half). I managed to get them more or less at the same time. I tried to slow some companies down, and speed other ones up, by delaying interviews, or being able to have interviews as soon as possible.</p>



<p>I was lucky to have more than one offer, because then I was in a much better negotiating position. The top two offers were both very good, and I could see my self taking either. In the end I got everything I was looking for – a very interesting job, and a good salary.</p>



<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>



<p><strong>Stressful.</strong> Looking for a new job is a lot of work. It is hard to relax, even on weekends, because there is always some interview preparation you can do. It wasn’t until I had a firm job offer that I could enjoy my time off (I had a few weeks off before I started).</p>



<p><strong>Takes time.</strong> I thought it would be quicker to find a new job. But there are four or five interviews to schedule, and often a take-home assignment to do. You also want to read up on the company and product. Then the companies usually can’t schedule the interviews as fast as you would like. Add that you will fail interviews, and the process can easily take months.</p>



<p><strong>A numbers game.</strong> Even if you fail a lot of interviews, it only takes one company where you are successful for you to have a new job. So apply to many. I also realized that I am bad at judging if I did well or not. Almost every time I was rejected, I was surprised.</p>



<p><strong>People to discuss with.</strong> I have two former colleagues, Patrik and Peter, that I discussed my jobhunting process with. These discussions were really useful. There are so many aspects to consider, and having somebody who understands to talk to helps immensely!</p>



<p><strong>Responsive recruiters.</strong> Recruiters that consistently get back to you quickly are great! It is such a simple way to build confidence in the company they represent, yet so many recruiters really are bad at it.</p>



<p><strong>Reach out.</strong> If a colleague of yours is let go, reach out to them (through LinkedIn or other means) to say goodbye. It meant a lot to me, and I think most people would appreciate it.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I am lucky. I love programming, and I have a lot of experience. Even in a tougher market it was  comparatively easy for me. It still took a lot of work, but I ended up with a great new job as a senior developer at <a href="https://swissblock.net/">Swissblock</a>. I hope my jobhunting experience can be helpful to other developers looking for their next jobs.</p>

And recently, I’ve opened Armstrong’s Handbook of Human Resource Management Practice to read a few chapters on a problem I’m facing at work.<p>And WOW a proper book on the topic is SOOO much better than any random article that I find, be it from SWLW, HN, Reddit, or any other source. Articles and posts are easy to like when I already agree with their premise. But the depth of a proper book, from a real source of authority and not some random person online, looking at the problem from multiple points, that’s so much more insightful and useful.</p><p>So instead of hunting for best articles, I would 100% recommend getting Armstrong, or some textbook. Or at least High Output Management as other comment suggested, or some other well known and well regarded book. But Armstrong in particular can give you very deep understanding of most aspects of people management, plus it’s up-to-date.

I think when there's a power imbalance it's easy to ascribe every non-perfect action by people above you to be some act of self-interest, when in reality it isn't always true that everyone has a secret ulterior motive.<p>&gt; From the founders's perspective the org is basically an overactive genie. It will do what you say, but not what you mean. Want to increase sales in two quarters? No problem, sales increased. Oh, and we also subtly destroyed our customers's trust. Once the stakes are high, founders basically have to treat their org as an adversarial agent. You might think -- but a good founder will notice!

Find them and ask them tough questions. Compare yourself to your managerial peers to determine if you are developing appropriately or if you are sucking. Do not look to your peers or the public for leadership guidance as they will set you up to fail, especially in software.

The other big ones were humility/thoughtfulness, honesty, and grace under pressure.  (Perhaps the original lecture addresses those, as well.)<p>I don't know the research on this (and would be hesitant to believe anything out of the business press about management).  I only have anecdata, intuition, and speculation.</p><p>I'm not perfect at any of these, but they seem to be a really good guide.</p><p>Note that not everyone has picked up the same influences in the past, so they might not have seen all of these, and they might've learned a lot of other ideas.</p><p>For examples of other influences (not just managers, but execs including startups): Many seem to prioritize projecting confidence, over everything else.  Others seem wired to persuade, to doing what they want or to having a positive impression of them, at all costs.  Others seem to think they must assert authority, first and foremost.</p><p>The difference in past experiences, and the reality of industry conventions in practice, means you sometimes have to explain something that seems obvious to you.</p><p>One time I failed to communicate well, I was characterizing to a startup CEO how I'd run a forthcoming engineering team, and I added something at the end, "and they'll be my people".  I intended it as shorthand for a style of conscientiously looking after their needs, and fostering a culture of loyalty to the team/project/company.  Of course that was ambiguous, especially in a business context, where aggressive self-interest is the most likely explanation for any behavior.  Later, I realized that he was looking to be the leader of more of a lifestyle company, with the entire company <i>his</i> people in a somewhat different sense (which was an influence he'd seen in his own career).  So I'd maybe sounded like I was saying I'd silo off a fiefdom of loyalists to me rather than to him or the company, shape part of the company in my image, or otherwise get between him and the people.

Everyone in a corporate structure is a servant.  How you advance is by demonstrating that you are helping solve the problems deemed important by your chain of command.  Theoretically this should be aligned from top to bottom; in practice competing priorities, communication overhead, and incompetence in the wrong places can greatly distort things.  This reality leads a lot of folks into learned helplessness, and social climbers gaming the chaos to gain power they are not equipped to handle.<p>The mentality "what's in it for me" is toxic and shows one is not ready for higher level management in a large org where cooperation is necessary to do anything interesting.  Better questions are "is my team working on the right thing?", "does my team have the right skills to deliver on that thing?", "what relationships do we need to succeed?", and last but definitely not least "is my manager competent enough to provide the support I need for my team to be successful?".  The last question is the key one: you won't grow if you are reporting to a muppet.

You're right that it's not inherently toxic to think of yourself.  The reason I reacted that way is because that mentality (whether explicit or not) is what leads to operating in a very transactional way or empire-building fashion that works against good outcomes in the long-term.<p>I honestly don't think being too selfless is an adequate explanation for career stagnation though.  Selfless behavior will generally help you get ahead in life and in your career, because good relationships matter a lot.  However you won't get promoted just because you help everyone.  What if you are just servicing the squeaky wheels rather than solving the biggest problem on your plate?  A good manager will only look to promote you because you have demonstrated you are capable of solving larger problems.  There are other things too: like the business actually has the need for a higher level role.  If that's the case, then your behavior is irrelevant—you just need to leave to someplace that <i>does</i> have the growth opportunity.</p><p>Overall the reason I said your comment was strange is because it clearly comes from some personal experience you had, but it lacks enough context to be actionable to anyone who reads it.  I can think of a dozen different ways I've seen a "servant leader" mentality succeed or fail, but it all depends very much on context.  Ultimately if you want to succeed you need to understand what game is being played and not fallback to abstract platitudes.

In a healthy engineering culture, a management goal should be enabling the maximum number of people to exercise their own leadership. Even the newfangled concept of "servant leadership" is premised on a separation of agency between those who "serve/lead" and those who "are served/led".<p>Effective management --- do not groan before I finish this sentence --- tends to look a lot more like adminship on Wikipedia than it does, like, war leadership. It's about picking up a mop and a bucket and making the way clear for people to do their best work. And, in our field, doing one's best work often means <i>making and communicating big decisions</i>, which is what leadership is.</p><p>There's also a distinction between the kind of leadership the whole company needs --- hard decisions about where to allocate resources and what bets to make --- and the day-to-day "leadership" involved in getting things done as a team. I term I hear a lot is "vibes based management", which is a recognition that somebody (probably not engineering management!) is making these kinds of decisions and communicating them just well enough for line engineers to make good choices.</p><p>If you're looking for management advice because you're running a whole company, that kind of leadership is in scope! But if you're looking to learn how to be a good engineering manager, I'm not sure how much "leadership" has to do with doing a good job.

Yes, an EM should be empowering as many IC leaders as possible, but that can't be done if the EM does not recognize true leadership.  While it's theoretically possible to succeed as a manager leveraging others without having your own true tech lead chops, the majority of managers like this end up either putting too much trust in the wrong ICs or (worse) devolve into cover-your-ass "agile" process bullshit.

          <p><time datetime="2024-02-10T00:00:00+00:00">February 10, 2024</time> · <span title="Estimated read time">1 minute read</span>
          </p>

          <p>Why <a href="https://stephango.com/obsidian">Obsidian</a> is 100% user-supported and not backed by VC investors:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We want to stay small, we don’t need to hire lots of people</li>
  <li>We follow strict principles that we do not want to compromise</li>
  <li>Our users are happy to support us, we don’t need VC money</li>
</ol>

<p>Obsidian will not exist forever, no app will. However, the <a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app">files you create</a> in Obsidian are yours, and can hopefully last for generations. VCware is built with a five year horizon, it is not built to live on for decades.</p>

<p>Many startup founders raise VC money because they need the upfront capital to build their product, or they see it as a shortcut to growth. For some products the capital truly is necessary, but too often it’s fueled by impatience and the inertia of Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>In the short term, VCware tends to <a href="https://stephango.com/quality-software">subsidize pricing</a> to acquire users. It’s easier to grow if your product is cheap or free. But this generally comes at the cost of hoarding user data, and locking in customers. Once you’re in you can’t get out.</p>

<p>To keep raising money, VCware must paint an increasingly enormous vision of their future, which becomes impossible to live up to. This leads to increasingly disparate priorities that gradually make the product worse. What starts off as a useful app becomes burdened with crap.</p>

<p>Eventually all VCware must exit. That means being acquired or going public to pay back investors. It’s expected that 9 out 10 startups will fail. That’s just part of the math in a VC portfolio. The startups that have big exits pay for the ones that fail.</p>

<p>It is now possible for tiny teams to make principled software that millions of people use, unburdened by investors. Principled apps that put people in control of their data, their privacy, their wellbeing. These principles can be irrevocably built into the architecture of the app.</p>

<p>Principled people have always been able to make principled software. The difference is that now you need far less money and far fewer employees to reach far more customers. That wave is only just beginning.</p>

<p>If you have principles and enough patience, being 100% user-supported is by far the most fun way to build.</p>

	<div>
<p>This cube manages to balance itself on a corner, and can simultaneously rotate around its axis in a controlled manner. It does so using clever controls and a set of three reaction wheels.</p>



<p>The original idea for this device comes from researchers at ETH Zürich, who demonstrate their “Cubli” in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_6p-1J551Y" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_6p-1J551Y">this video</a>. Its design has been improved in some ways in later years. Notably, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWEWNBDW6CM" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWEWNBDW6CM">Bobrow et al</a> (University of São Paolo) introduce an improved controls concept, reducing the number of required IMUs (inertial measurement units) to just one instead of six.</p>



<p>I decided to pursue the challenge of building one myself. Even though the idea isn’t new, previous works are largely closed-source. I plan to change that. This means that I had to reverse-engineer and draw everything from scratch. The result of my work, which is completely open source (<a href="https://github.com/willem-pennings/balancing-cube">GitHub</a>), is shown in the video below.</p>

<p>You might think: <strong>ANOTHER USELESS MACHINE?!</strong> When I published my <a href="https://willempennings.nl/mms-and-skittles-sorting-machine/" data-type="post" data-id="95">M&amp;Ms sorting machine</a>, I received lots of similar remarks. Indeed, it has no practical value, but similar applications such as sorting of fruits, vegetables and nuts based on colour do. For this cube, the situation is similar: while this is mostly a great learning experience and research project, reaction wheels are often used in satellites (such as the James Webb telescope) for attitude control purposes.</p>


<div>

<h2>Mechanical design</h2>



<p>The mechanical design of this cube is mostly the same as that of the original Cubli, but it has some subtle differences. The main structure consists of eight “cornerstones” and six face plates. Three of these face plates have additional features to support a motor and reaction wheel assembly. All parts were drawn in (con)Fusion 360. My student days are over, so I had to say farewell to Siemens NX. The latter isn’t used much (if at all?) in the DIY community anyway, so I can share my designs with others more easily now.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="680" height="768" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cad-assembly-mechanical.png" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cad-assembly-mechanical.png 680w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cad-assembly-mechanical-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"></figure></div>


<p>Most structural parts are made of stainless steel for its excellent strength. The faceplates are made of aluminium to save weight. These don’t need to be made of steel since the assembled structure will be more than stiff enough when made of aluminium anyway.</p>



<p>All metal parts in this project have been manufactured by <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pcbway.com/">PCBWay</a>. I’ve used their PCB prototyping service before and was interested in their CNC capabilities. Part of the cost for these parts was sponsored by PCBWay. The ordering process was straightforward and I like that a quote was automatically calculated directly after uploading the part and specifying the material type. I’m satisfied with the parts and their quality: a small production issue was quickly resolved and all parts fit together without issue. Pictures below: judge for yourself.</p>



<p>I had fun with the design of the motor and flywheel assembly. I was looking for a robust design – after all, the wheels can reach speeds up to 6000 rounds per minute – while also keeping it lightweight. Even though I’m a mechanical engineer by education, construction principles aren’t my main strength, but after all that’s the reason for projects like these: to learn! I finally came up with the following.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>The motor is connected to a stainless steel bridge using three countersunk screws. The bridge eventually connects to one of the aluminium faceplates.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>A small hub is mounted onto the shaft of the motor and secured using three set screws. This hub is critical: if the center hole is not perpendicular with respect to the flat triangular face, the wheel will not be aligned with the motor shaft, causing vibrations and wear.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>A reaction wheel is mounted onto the hub using three countersunk screws. This step requires a bit of trial and error to correct for imperfections in the hub and wheel, which may cause the misalignments I mentioned earlier. I resolve these by placing tiny pieces of paper between the horizontal contact surface of the hub and wheel and this provides satisfactory results. After all, these parts aren’t taken apart very often.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>A small radial ball bearing is inserted into one of the faceplates and secured using cyanoacrylate (“super”) glue. This ball bearing will support one end of the motor shaft. The other end of the shaft is also supported by a bearing within the motor itself.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>Finally, the motor shaft is inserted into the bearing and the bridge is connected to the faceplate using four bolts. This process is repeated two more times.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>This result in half a cube. The remaining faceplates don’t require any special assembly steps and can be directly assembled. Notice how one of the motors is oriented differently with respect to the bridge to which it attaches? That is done on purpose: it simplifies the cabling work later on.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>The result is a strong yet relatively lightweight structure. The aluminium faceplates are relatively weak by themselves, but won’t budge when assembled together.</p>



<h2>Electromechanical design</h2>



<p>For the motor and motor controllers, other balancing cubes use Maxon motors from the “<a href="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/content/ec-flat-motors" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/content/ec-flat-motors">EC flat</a>” series. While it’s possible to find cheaper alternatives, the motors and their controllers are critical parts and I don’t want to skimp on them. The cube will balance by applying torques to the motors. Many DC motors do not even come with datasheets that specify the torque constant (which defines the relationship between torque and current), and many brushless motor controllers such as ESCs only offer speed control, but not current control. Both are essential in making this project a reality, so the choice for components of high quality is obvious here.</p>

<p>I selected a 60 W <a href="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/591477" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/591477">motor</a> and a compatible 4-quadrant <a href="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/control/4-Q-Servokontroller/466023" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/control/4-Q-Servokontroller/466023">motor controller</a> which can deliver currents up to 6 A. At 24 V, this corresponds to almost 150 W. While this is well beyond the nominal power rating of the motor, it is no problem to briefly overload the motor. Moreover, the controller has a built-in I2t algorithm which limits current to the motor if the winding temperature is estimated to become too high. It is unlikely that the cube hits these limits in normal operation anyway, because currents are generally very low while balancing.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="940" height="499" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon.png" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon.png 940w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon-300x159.png 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon-768x408.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></figure></div>


<p>The software that comes with the Escon motor controllers is pretty great. There are motor commissioning and tuning tools and a nice dashboard showing the status of the motor and its inputs/outputs during operation (shown in the screenshot above).</p>



<p>For the battery, I chose a 6S1P lithium-polymer battery. The motors are rated for 24 V so a six-cell LiPo battery (nominal voltage 22.2 V) is a good fit here. The battery has a capacity of 1300 mAh (29 Wh) which is enough to run the cube for at least an hour, normally.</p>

<p>The motherboard is a custom design and integrates the three motor controllers, IMU (hidden), ESP32-S3 development board, and some supporting components such as protection circuits and voltage regulators. The board also anticipates adding mechanical brakes to the cube, by providing outputs for RC servo motors. Mechanical brakes will enable the cube to jump up to the balancing position by itself. I haven’t finished the development of the brake design yet.</p>

<p>Assembling the circuit board was fun. I started by applying solder paste and placing the surface-mount parts. After reflowing it in a small toaster oven (more details about how this works <a href="https://willempennings.nl/miniature-3456-led-cube/" data-type="post" data-id="48">here</a>), I soldered all the through hole parts by hand.</p>

<p>Later, during integration and testing of the various components, I found that I had made a few small routing errors which I quickly corrected using bodge wires. It turns out that only one digital input on the motor controller supports PWM and I routed the PWM signal to another (unsupported) input.</p>



<p>I also designed a board to mount the battery onto. It’s much simpler: it has two XT60 connectors and two switches (wired in parallel because of currents up to 18 A) to turn the cube on and off.</p>



<h2>Controller design and tuning</h2>



<p>I didn’t actually design the controller the cube myself, but ported the <a href="https://github.com/fbobrow/cubli-firmware" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/fbobrow/cubli-firmware">work</a> by Fabio Bobrow from Arm Mbed to Arduino. I’m also using an ESP32 instead of an STM32 Nucleo. Nevertheless, rewriting the code was a good chunk of work. Also, since I’m using a different IMU (the ICM20948 by TDK Invensense), I had to rewrite the corresponding “driver”. I still spent quite some time studying the design of this controller and will spend a few words to highlight some nice things about it.</p>



<p>The design of the main attitude controller is most interesting. It is perhaps best explained as a negotation between two <em>contradictory </em>objectives. The first objective is to keep the cube in its desired orientation, that is, at its unstable equilibrium position. A second goal, however, is to keep the wheel velocities to a minimum. Not considering this second objective could lead to wheels speeds getting out of control, saturing the motors, and thereby effectively rendering it unable to exert torques on the cube.</p>



<p>The two objectives are in conflict: if the ‘desire’ to keep wheel velocities close to zero is too great, the cube simply falls over. Like mentioned before, if it is too weak, the wheels might literally spin out of control. The trick therefore is to find gains that result in good balancing performance and disturbance rejection while keeping wheel velocities somewhat low.</p>

<p>There is another elegant mechanism in the controller to deal with constant errors. What are constant errors? For example, there might be a small difference between the configured equilibrium position and the actual equilibrium due to imperfections in the weight distributions of the cube. In a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller, the integral part deals with these kinds of errors. This controller uses the <em>position</em> (in degrees) of the wheel as the integral! In my opinion, this is actually a very intuitive way of visualizing an integral controller. When I modify the weight distribution of the cube (in the video: by placing a tomato on it), you can see the reaction wheels increase and then decrease in speed: they are moving to a new <em>position </em>to compensate for the increased error!</p>



<p>Commissioning and tuning the controller was, by far, the largest piece of code-related work. Like any experienced controls engineer, I spent a few days flipping the signs of various signals before I got them right. Then, I had to find the right gains for the controller. The tuning methodology as described in Bobrow’s <a href="https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/3/3139/tde-20102022-084937/publico/FabioBobrowCorr22.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/3/3139/tde-20102022-084937/publico/FabioBobrowCorr22.pdf">dissertation</a> didn’t work for me, so I resorted to tuning the gains by hand. Note that my cube uses different wheels compared to Bobrow’s cube, so reusing the gains was not possible. Using an iterative procedure, I finally obtained the gains that result in the stabilizing performance as shown in the video (which is very good, in my humble opinion).</p>

<p>That’s it! A balancing cube. It’s the only fully open-source cube in the world which achieves a balancing performance similar to that of Cubli, as far as I know. I hope that others will now also be inspired to build this cool device.</p>



<p>Here are some links to similar cubes which are at least somewhat documented (more than just a video or photo):</p>

<h2>Next steps: jumping up</h2>



<p>I plan to add mechanical brakes to the reaction wheels. These will enable the wheels to be braked rapidly, resulting in much larger torques than the motors can deliver. This enables jump-up manoeuvers which in turn enable the cube to get to its equilibrium position on its own. This feature is currently unique to the original Cubli, as far as I know. I don’t particularly like the braking mechanism that Cubli uses for various reasons, so I’m going to use a different approach. I’ll share results in a future post!</p>
