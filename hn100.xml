  <div>
    
<p>On Wednesday <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-news/firefox-terms-of-use/">we shared</a> that we’re introducing a new Terms of Use (TOU) and Privacy Notice for Firefox. Since then, we’ve been listening to some of our community’s concerns with parts of the TOU, specifically about licensing. Our intent was just to be as clear as possible about how we make Firefox work, but in doing so we also created some confusion and concern. With that in mind, we’re updating the language to more clearly reflect the <em>limited </em>scope of how Mozilla interacts with user data.</p>



<p>Here’s what the new language will say:</p>



<p><em>You give Mozilla the rights necessary to operate Firefox. This includes processing your data as we describe in the Firefox Privacy Notice. It also includes a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license for the purpose of doing as you request with the content you input in Firefox. This does not give Mozilla any ownership in that content.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>In addition, we’ve removed the reference to the Acceptable Use Policy because it seems to be causing more confusion than clarity.</p>



<p><strong>Privacy FAQ</strong></p>



<p>We also updated our <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/faq/">Privacy FAQ</a> to better address legal minutia around terms like “sells.” While we’re not reverting the FAQ, we want to provide more detail about why we made the change in the first place.</p>



<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Mozilla doesn’t sell data about you (in the way that most people think about “selling data”), and we don’t buy data about you. We changed our language because some jurisdictions define “sell” more broadly than most people would usually understand that word. Firefox has built-in privacy and security features, plus <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-options-preferences-and-settings#w_privacy-security">options</a> that let you fine-tune your data settings.</p>







<hr>







<p>The reason we’ve stepped away from making blanket claims that “We never sell your data” is because, in some places, the LEGAL definition of “sale of data” is broad and evolving. As an example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) defines “sale” as the “selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by [a] business to another business or a third party” in exchange for “monetary” or “other valuable consideration.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar privacy laws exist in other US states, including in Virginia and Colorado. And that’s a good thing — Mozilla has long been a supporter of data privacy laws that empower people — but the competing interpretations of do-not-sell requirements does leave many businesses uncertain about their exact obligations and whether or not they’re considered to be “selling data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to make Firefox commercially viable, there are a number of places where we collect and share some data with our partners, including our optional ads on New Tab and providing sponsored suggestions in the search bar. We set all of this out in our <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/">Privacy Notice</a>. Whenever we share data with our partners, we put a lot of work into making sure that the data that we share is stripped of potentially identifying information, or shared only in the aggregate, or is put through our privacy preserving technologies (like <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/ohttp-explained">OHTTP</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>We’re continuing to make sure that Firefox provides you with sensible default settings that you can review during onboarding or <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-options-preferences-and-settings#w_privacy-security">adjust</a> at any time.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://kibty.town/blog/todesktop/">https://kibty.town/blog/todesktop/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43210858">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>this started when i was looking into <a href="https://cursor.com/">cursor</a>, an ai text editor. also, i use <a href="https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html">lulu by objective-see</a> on my laptop, so when i downloaded the cursor installer, i got this pop-up:</p>
<p><img src="https://kibty.town/files/img/posts/todesktop/lulu-alert.png" alt="A LuLu alert, showing that &quot;Install Cursor&quot; was trying to connect to &quot;download.todesktop.com&quot;"></p>
<p>now, what the hell is todesktop? i thought i was downloading cursor? well, looking at their website, they seem to be an electron app bundler service alongside providing a SDK for electron apps. so it appears the installer i downloaded is actually managed by todesktop, not cursor.</p>
<p>this made me curious and i made an account on todesktop to look into it, and when i clicked the github login button, i saw my calling: <strong>firebase</strong></p>
<h2>basic firebase recon</h2>
<p>realising the app used firestore (firebase's no-sql database that is often used in frontend), i quickly opened my devtools and began doing basic recon on the firebase.</p>
<p>i realised that the site has sourcemaps, which made searching for all of the firestore paths used in the app even easier (its still easy without sourcemaps, usually)</p>
<p>then i found an insecure collection, <code>temporaryApplications</code>, which seemed to give me an name list of some applications (edit: todesktop has clarified this collection has no sensitive data and hasnt been updated since 2022), but not much other than that, everything seemed secure on the firebase other then this.</p>
<p>i then noticed that most of the deployment and general logic happens in the terminal, with the npm package <code>@todesktop/cli</code>, so i installed that and started looking into it</p>
<h2>looking into the todesktop cli</h2>
<p>the cli manages deployments, source code uploads, and much more. the website just seems to be a shell to create applications, view deployments, etc etc</p>
<p>i was once again lucky that the cli also had sourcemaps, so i used <a href="https://github.com/denandz/sourcemapper">sourcemapper</a> to extract them into a source tree.</p>
<p>looking in there, i found an arbitrary s3 upload vulnerability via a firebase cloud function called <code>getSignedURL</code>, but i didn't really have an s3 key (file path) to upload to that would do something interesting, so i kept looking.</p>
<h2>hijacking the deployment pipeline via a postinstall script</h2>
<p>i wanted to get on the machine where the application gets built and the easiest way to do this would be a postinstall script in <code>package.json</code>, so i did that with a simple reverse shell payload</p>
<p>this worked. navigating around the container, i figured out where the actual code-building application lives, and found this:</p>
<p><img src="https://kibty.town/files/img/posts/todesktop/config-encrypted.png" alt="A screenshot showing a file called &quot;config.json.encrypted&quot;"></p>
<p>oh fuck, this usually means something bad. i found the code for decrypting this file, and this is what i got after decrypting it myself:</p>
<p><img src="https://kibty.town/files/img/posts/todesktop/config-json.png" alt="A file called &quot;config.json&quot;, with 2 apple id, remote sign and a hsm's credentials"></p>
<p><strong>fuck. this container stores secrets</strong></p>
<p>looking around in the container more, i found a hardcoded firebase admin key (which was full-scoped).</p>
<h2>post-exploitation</h2>
<p>i quickly realized that with the credentials i have, i could deploy an auto update to any app of my liking, having clients receive it immediately when they restart the app.</p>
<p>i then made some code to use my credentials to deploy an update to my app, and it worked. i immediately got a update on my client and got RCE.</p>
<h2>lets talk about impact</h2>
<p>with this, i could push auto updates to all applications using todesktop, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>clickup (https://clickup.com)</li>
<li>cursor (https://cursor.com)</li>
<li>linear (https://linear.app)</li>
<li>notion calendar (https://calendar.notion.so)</li>
</ul>
<p>(<strong>please do not harass these companies or make it seem like it's their fault, it's not. it's todesktop's fault if anything</strong>)</p>
<p>which, if i were to estimate, is probably in the range of hundreds of millions of people in <strong>tech environments</strong>, other hackers, programmers, executives, etc. making this exploit <strong>deadly</strong> if used.</p>
<h2>the fix</h2>
<p>i immediately used my contacts to get in reach with the owner of todesktop, we were chatting via signal and the fix came almost immediately. they were nice enough to compensate me for my efforts and were very nice in general.</p>
<p>the build container now has a privileged sidecar that does all of the signing, uploading and everything else instead of the main container with user code having that logic.</p>
<p>security incidents happen all the time, its natural. what matters is the company's response, and todesktop's response has been awesome, they were very nice to work with.</p>
<p>check out todesktop's incident report <a href="https://www.todesktop.com/blog/posts/security-incident-at-todesktop">here</a></p>

<p dir="auto">Merlion consists of two sub-repos: <code>merlion</code> implements the library's core time series intelligence features,
and <code>ts_datasets</code> provides standardized data loaders for multiple time series datasets. These loaders load
time series as <code>pandas.DataFrame</code>&nbsp;s with accompanying metadata.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can install <code>merlion</code> from PyPI by calling <code>pip install salesforce-merlion</code>. You may install from source by
cloning this repoand calling <code>pip install Merlion/</code>, or <code>pip install -e Merlion/</code> to install in editable mode.
You may install additional dependencies via <code>pip install salesforce-merlion[all]</code>,  or by calling
<code>pip install "Merlion/[all]"</code> if installing from source.
Individually, the optional dependencies include <code>dashboard</code> for a GUI dashboard,
<code>spark</code> for a distributed computation backend with PySpark, and <code>deep-learning</code> for all deep learning models.</p>
<p dir="auto">To install the data loading package <code>ts_datasets</code>, clone this repo and call <code>pip install -e Merlion/ts_datasets/</code>.
This package must be installed in editable mode (i.e. with the <code>-e</code> flag) if you don't want to manually specify the
root directory of every dataset when initializing its data loader.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note the following external dependencies:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Some of our forecasting models depend on OpenMP. If using <code>conda</code>, please <code>conda install -c conda-forge lightgbm</code>
before installing our package. This will ensure that OpenMP is configured to work with the <code>lightgbm</code> package
(one of our dependencies) in your <code>conda</code> environment. If using Mac, please install <a href="https://brew.sh/" rel="nofollow">Homebrew</a>
and call <code>brew install libomp</code> so that the OpenMP libary is available for the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Some of our anomaly detection models depend on the Java Development Kit (JDK). For Ubuntu, call
<code>sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk</code>. For Mac OS, install <a href="https://brew.sh/" rel="nofollow">Homebrew</a> and call
<code>brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk &amp;&amp; brew install --cask adoptopenjdk11</code>. Also ensure that <code>java</code> can be found
on your <code>PATH</code>, and that the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable is set.</p>

time series.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting Started</h2><a id="user-content-getting-started" aria-label="Permalink: Getting Started" href="#getting-started"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The easiest way to get started is to use the GUI web-based
<a href="https://opensource.salesforce.com/Merlion/merlion.dashboard.html" rel="nofollow">dashboard</a>.
This dashboard provides a great way to quickly experiment with many models on your own custom datasets.
To use it, install Merlion with the optional <code>dashboard</code> dependency (i.e.
<code>pip install salesforce-merlion[dashboard]</code>), and call <code>python -m merlion.dashboard</code> from the command line.
You can view the dashboard at <a href="http://localhost:8050/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8050</a>.
Below, we show some screenshots of the dashboard for both anomaly detection and forecasting.</p>

<p dir="auto">We can then initialize and train Merlion’s <code>DefaultDetector</code>, which is an anomaly detection model that
balances performance with efficiency. We also obtain its predictions on the test split.</p>

<p dir="auto">One of Merlion's key features is an evaluation pipeline that simulates the live deployment
of a model on historical data. This enables you to compare models on the datasets relevant
to them, under the conditions that they may encounter in a production environment. Our
evaluation pipeline proceeds as follows:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Train an initial model on recent historical training data (designated as the training split of the time series)</li>
<li>At a regular interval (e.g. once per day), retrain the entire model on the most recent data. This can be either the
entire history of the time series, or a more limited window (e.g. 4 weeks).</li>
<li>Obtain the model's predictions (anomaly scores or forecasts) for the time series values that occur between
re-trainings. You may customize whether this should be done in batch (predicting all values at once),
streaming (updating the model's internal state after each data point without fully re-training it),
or some intermediate cadence.</li>
<li>Compare the model's predictions against the ground truth (labeled anomalies for anomaly detection, or the actual
time series values for forecasting), and report quantitative evaluation metrics.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">We provide scripts that allow you to use this pipeline to evaluate arbitrary models on arbitrary datasets.
For example, invoking</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python benchmark_anomaly.py --dataset NAB_realAWSCloudwatch --model IsolationForest --retrain_freq 1d"><pre>python benchmark_anomaly.py --dataset NAB_realAWSCloudwatch --model IsolationForest --retrain_freq 1d</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">will evaluate the anomaly detection performance of the <code>IsolationForest</code> (retrained once a day) on the
"realAWSCloudwatch" subset of the NAB dataset.  Similarly, invoking</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python benchmark_forecast.py --dataset M4_Hourly --model ETS"><pre>python benchmark_forecast.py --dataset M4_Hourly --model ETS</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">will evaluate the batch forecasting performance (i.e. no retraining) of <code>ETS</code> on the "Hourly" subset of the M4 dataset.
You can find the results produced by running these scripts in the Experiments section of the

Oval Office today reflected what's at stake for Zelensky and his

just about minerals or money; it's about making sure three years of bloody
fighting hasn't been for nothing. It’s about the future existence of Ukraine in
the face of an existential war.</p><p>Should
he have stayed calmer? Perhaps, but Ukraine’s leader wears this war, it is part
of his political being. Clearly this mineral proposal was not as enticing for
Kyiv as Washington made out.</p><p>Ukrainians
feel any ceasefire - without a guarantee from the US that it would step in if
war reignited - would not be worth the paper it was written on.</p><p>The
worrying signs were there when Zelensky folded his arms in a defensive way as
he came under an almost coordinated shouting assault from US president and
vice-president.</p><p>That is a
worrying symptom of a White House not really fixating on the realities of the
war and the cost Ukraine has paid, especially when Zelensky had to remind Trump
of the year it started.</p><p>Such a visible deterioration
between two allies has been a difficult and shocking sight here. Donald Trump
could yet come to Ukraine’s aid, or today could have been the moment he cut
ties with it, to Russia’s delight.</p></article></div></li><li><div><article data-testid="content-post" id="asset:234c9292-ac67-43d3-8f1e-d47a978ea10b"><header><span><h3 type="normal"><span role="text"><span>Zelensky told to leave White House after heated exchange</span><span><span data-testid="timestamp"><span data-testid="accessible-timestamp">published at 20:14 Greenwich Mean Time</span></span></span></span></h3></span></header><p>We can now bring you more detail about the moments just after Zelensky and Trump's tense meeting in the Oval Office.</p><p>According to our US partner CBS, the Ukrainian delegation left the Oval Office to a "separated room". </p><p>There, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them to leave the White House.</p><p>As we reported earlier, a scheduled press conference with Zelensky and Trump was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c625ex282zzt?post=asset%3Aba1b7edc-d79b-4ce0-8f9f-c8722ebd8ddb#post">cancelled shortly</a> after the Oval Office meeting.

    ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>I make a quick conclusion about this and thought to look at BusinessLogic:29 based
on the stack trace and it looked like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>someFunction</span><span>(</span><span>SomeType</span> <span>relatedObject</span><span>,</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SomeOtherType</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>unrelatedObjects</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>SomeOtherType</span> <span>unrelatedObject</span> <span>:</span> <span>unrelatedObjects</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>treeMap</span><span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>relatedObject</span><span>.</span><span>a</span><span>(),</span> <span>relatedObject</span><span>.</span><span>b</span><span>());</span> <span>// line 29</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That code is odd.
Notice we’re iterating over <code>unrelatedObject</code>, but the body of the loop only used <code>relatedObject</code>.
The code can be reduced to simply:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>someFunction</span><span>(</span><span>SomeType</span> <span>relatedObject</span><span>,</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SomeOtherType</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>unrelatedObjects</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>treeMap</span><span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>relatedObject</span><span>.</span><span>a</span><span>(),</span> <span>relatedObject</span><span>.</span><span>b</span><span>());</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>// unrelatedObjects is used later on in the function so the parameter cannot be removed</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There must have been some refactoring in the area and unrelatedObject wasn’t used anymore. 
I prepared my unit test and ran the test before and after the fix.
I tried <code>treeMap</code> and <code>unrelatedObjects</code> with 1,000,000 entries, well exceeding what the application ever saw and was not able to reproduce the problem.
Assuming unrelatedObjects is size N and treeMap is size M, the complexity is O(N lg(M)).
So it makes sense that I was unable to reproduce the problem.
<a href="https://josephmate.github.io/PowersOf2/">You wouldn’t really see one minute of execution time until 100 million to 1 billion entries.</a>.</p>

<p>It must be something else.
I was certain treeMap and unrelatedObjects never exceed 1,000 entries.
It’s not even close enough to cause an issue with an O(N lg(M)) algorithm.</p>

<p>I wasn’t very familiar with the class so I started to look around,
focusing on <code>treeMap</code> and <code>unrelatedObjects</code> to see if my assumption that they
never exceed 1,000 holds. Could they be in the millions or even billions?</p>

<p>Then I noticed the definition of the TreeMap as :</p>
<div><pre><code><span>// The field wasn't actually named treeMap.</span>
<span>private</span> <span>final</span> <span>Map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>K</span><span>,</span><span>V</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>treeMap</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>TreeMap</span><span>&lt;&gt;();</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s scary.
There were multiple threads accessing the TreeMap, and it was unguarded.
At this point, I had an aha moment.
Could an unguarded TreeMap cause 3,200% utilization?</p>

<h2 id="experiment">Experiment</h2>

<p>I put together a simple experiment to try to reproduce the problem.
I created a bunch of threads randomly updating a shared TreeMap.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>numThreads</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++)</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>for</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>j</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>j</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>numUpdates</span><span>;</span> <span>j</span><span>++)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>treeMap</span><span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>random</span><span>.</span><span>nextInt</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>),</span> <span>random</span><span>.</span><span>nextInt</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>));</span>
            <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>NullPointerException</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>// let it keep going so we can reproduce the issue.</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That try catch was key.
If no try catch, I wasn’t able to reproduce the problem.
Some threads would crash with the above output:</p>
<div><pre><code>Exception in thread "Thread-0" java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot read field "right" because "l" is null
        at java.base/java.util.TreeMap.rotateRight(TreeMap.java:2562)

        at SimpleRepro.lambda$main$0(SimpleRepro.java:28)
        at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:833)
</code></pre></div>
<p>but the program would still halt.</p>

<p>Probably only languages that allow you to catch NPEs will encounter this issue.
Other languages will just crash.
After a few runs, I saw 500% cpu utilization.
That’s crazy!
I always thought of race conditions as corrupting the data or deadlocking.
I never though it could cause performance issues.
But it makes sense, you could corrupt the data in a way that creates an infinite loop.</p>

<p>You can check out the java experiment from my GitHub java-by-experiments repo
<a href="https://github.com/josephmate/java-by-experiments/blob/main/tree_map_corruption/java/src/main/java/SimpleRepro.java">SimpleRepro.java</a></p>

<p>To make extra sure, I created another experiment that uses reflection
against the TreeMap to dump the nodes and their colours.
(In Java, a TreeMap is implemented using a Red-Black tree.)
The cycle in the TreeMap is highlighted in blue.
<img src="https://josephmate.github.io/assets/2023-08-20_cpu_util_3200/red_black_tree_cycle.gv.svg" alt="example cycle generated from TreeMap experiment"></p>

<p>So if you’re searching or putting something not already in the map,
it could get stuck in that infinite loop.</p>

<p>To reproduce the above graph you need to use reflection to access the root, 
and the left and right fields of the <code>TreeMap.Entry</code>.
You recursively traverse the <code>TreeMap.Entry</code>s starting from root, keeping
track of the Entries you visited.
If you visit an entry you already visited, you know you’ve hit a loop.
Print all the nodes from visited to show the cycle.</p>

<h2 id="that-code-is-not-realistic">That code is not realistic</h2>

There are two practical ways: uncaught exceptions in executors and services backed by a thread pool.</p>

<p>It’s stuck on the TreeMap and really high CPU utilization.</p>

<p>However, when looking at standard out there is nothing!
The thread pool swallowed all the NPEs not giving any indication of problem. 
Unfortunately, this was the case in my situation.</p>

<p>When managing your own thread pools, you need to make sure you:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Register an uncaught exception handler on the thread through a thread factory</li>
  <li>Operate on the futures it return. If you do <code>future.get()</code> you will get an <code>ExectionException</code> wrapping the NPE!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="again-with-grpc">Again with gRPC</h2>

<p>Another way is to have some sort of service back by a thread pool like a gRPC service.
Here I recreate a realistic scenario in gRPC that reproduces the problem.
The service is powered by an unguarded TreeMap.</p>

<p>showing that TreeMap.put() got stuck on an infinite loop.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-it-happen-rotations">How did it happen? Rotations</h2>

<p>My suspicion is that two threads independently rotate the tree 
in opposite directions, resulting in a cycle.
Or maybe, two overlaping rotations interleave their writes in a way that produces the
cycle.
However, I do not have proof of an interleaving between threads that shows this.</p>

<p>I also suspect that the NPE is necessary.
The problem will not reproduce without hitting an NPE as I saw with my Java experiments.</p>

<h2 id="other-languages">Other languages</h2>

<p>I explore this idea that only languages with NPEs can exhibit this problem by
trying to reproduce this problem in as many languages as I’ve programmed in
before.
If this claim is true, I expect it to only reproduce in
Java, Kotlin, C#, Ruby, Typescript, and Python.
I expect to not be able to reproduce the problem in Go, C++, Rust, and Elixir.</p>

<p>From the table, the most interesting one is C++ because I was not expecting to be able to reproduce the problem due to my hypothesis from the last section.
As a result, I include the details from the experiment here. Similarly, go as unexpected, but trim the article, I left it out. You can see <a href="https://github.com/josephmate/java-by-experiments/tree/main/tree_map_corruption/golang/">Go here</a>.</p>

<p>The code is essentially the same as the Java one, only using C++ standard libraries.
I also added extra printing since I was so shocked that the problem reproduced,
I just wanted to make extra sure.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the program segfaults and crashes like before.
This is what I was expecting the worst failure to look like.</p>
<div><pre><code>./SimpleRepro
zsh: segmentation fault  ./SimpleRepro
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, very rarely the output would look like below, indicating the threads got
stuck.
After waiting 10 minutes, the threads never completed.
I did not expect this to happen because I thought it requires a thrown and
swallowed exception. That is not happening here.</p>
<div><pre><code>./SimpleRepro

&lt;nothing output for 5 minutes&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>From the tool <code>top</code> we can see that the problem reproduced because of the high cpu
utilization.</p>
<div><pre><code>top
PID    COMMAND      %CPU  TIME     ...
59815  SimpleRepro  170.8 08:49.61 ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>This shows my claim is false.
I was able to reproduce the problem in Go and C++.
Although they sometimes segfaulted, there were times when they got stuck in the
infinite loop.
In a language like C++, when you reference a null pointer it always segfaults,
so there must be an interleaving of the threads that does not hit a null!
I have no idea why.
I was expecting them to crash given how often I saw NPEs in the Java experiment.</p>

<p>With this knowledge, I went back to my SimpeRepro java experiment and stopped catching the NPE.
After re-running it 12 times, I was still able to reproduce the problem despite not catching the NPE:</p>
<div><pre><code>"Thread-4" #17 prio=5 os_prio=31 cpu=18597.02ms elapsed=23.79s tid=0x00007f81051ac200 nid=0x6a03 runnable  [0x000070000bcb5000]

        at java.lang.Thread.run(java.base@17.0.3/Thread.java:833)
</code></pre></div>

<p>The other thing that surprised me was languages like Ruby, despite letting you
catch NPEs did not let you reproduce the problem. The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
somehow prevented all execution interleavings that would reproduce the problem.</p>

<h2 id="easy-fix-guard-against-concurrent-modification">Easy Fix: Guard against concurrent modification</h2>

<p>The easiest way to fix this was to wrap the TreeMap with <code>Collections.synchronizedMap</code> or switch to <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> and sort on demand.
However, those fixes are boring and did not prevent us from making that mistake and taking down our host.</p>

<h2 id="controversial-fix-track-visited-nodes">Controversial Fix: Track visited nodes</h2>

<p>What if you could safely make the mistake, but not have a cycle?</p>

<p>I modified the red-black tree to record the nodes it has already visited.
The only requires an additional O(lg(n)) memory since it’s limited by the height of the tree.
The height of a red-black tree is guaranteed to be O(lg(n)).
If we encounter a node that we already visited, we throw a <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code>.
This will not prevent the data corruption,
but will prevent 100% cpu utilization from the infinite loop if someone makes that mistake again in the future.
This would require standard libraries to adopt this technique though which I
don’t think is likely to happen given the extra memory needed.</p>

<p>In the above code, you can see that I modified both the get and put methods to
maintain the set of visited nodes and throw a <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code>
when an already visited node is in the set.</p>

<h2 id="mistakes-happen-make-swiss-cheese">Mistakes Happen: Make Swiss Cheese</h2>

<p>Mistakes happen so it’s important that multiple layers are in place to detect the issue.
Imaging a slice of Swiss cheese, each slice taken from a different block of cheese.
Stacking enough of those slices would result in nothing being able to pass through.</p>

<h2 id="alerts-on-npes">Alerts on NPEs</h2>

<p>We lacked an alarm on any instance of an NPE.
We only had error rate alarms.
This NPE only occurs once per API handler worker thread before which was not enough to trigger our error rate alarms.
On top of that, none of the NPEs were logged because we had an unhandled exception in our Executor.</p>

<h2 id="alerts-on-utilization-anomalies">Alerts on utilization anomalies</h2>

<p>We monitor the cpu utilization and use a naive threshold based approach to alarming.
When the cpu utilization exceeds that threshold, we fire an alarm because it indicates abnormal behaviour.
This is how we discovered the issue.</p>

<p>Without a handler, the exception will be swallowed and none of your log monitoring will be able to detect the issue.</p>

<h2 id="code-reviews">Code reviews</h2>

<p>Sometimes, a detail oriented developer will notice the combination of threads
and TreeMap, or even suggest to not use a TreeMap if ordered elements are not
needed. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen in this case.</p>

<h2 id="static-code-analysis">Static code analysis</h2>

<p>Static code analysis tools like SpotBugs (used to be called FindBugs), JLint, and Chord can detect these kinds of issues at build time. See the paper <a href="https://www.sqrlab.ca/papers/SCAM2010.pdf">How Good is Static Analysis at Finding Concurrency Bugs?</a>.
Unfortunately, we didn’t start using them until after the bug.</p>

<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>

<p>Ensure your tests handle the multithreaded case!
In my case, we did not have multithreaded tests for that part of the code.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Mistakes happen.
Watch out, unprotected concurrent modification data corruption can present itself as infinite loops!
Despite making multiple mistakes, that hid the problem at multiple layers but not all.
As long as you adopt a layered approach, you will be able to respond quickly or
prevent it entirely.</p>

		 <p>In 1982, the Syrian government besieged the city of Hama, killing tens of thousands of its own citizens in sectarian violence. Four decades later, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/syria-aleppo-hama-massacre-assad-799f37fd2608532a253cccb48df4e613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebels used the memory of the massacre</a> to help inspire the toppling of the Assad family that had overseen the operation.</p>
<p>But there is another lasting effect of the attack, hidden deep in the genes of Syrian families. The grandchildren of women who were pregnant during the siege — grandchildren who never experienced such violence themselves — nonetheless bear marks of it in their genomes. Passed down through their mothers, this genetic imprint offers the first human evidence of a phenomenon previously documented only in animals: The genetic transmission of stress across multiple generations.</p>
<p>“The idea that trauma and violence can have repercussions into future generations should help people be more empathetic, help policymakers pay more attention to the problem of violence,” said <a href="https://people.clas.ufl.edu/cmulligan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connie Mulligan</a>, Ph.D., a professor of Anthropology and the Genetics Institute at the University of Florida and senior author of the new study. “It could even help explain some of the seemingly unbreakable intergenerational cycles of abuse and poverty and trauma that we see around the world, including in the U.S.”</p>
<p>While our genes are not changed by life experiences, they can be tuned through a system known as epigenetics. In response to stress or other events, our cells can add small chemical flags to genes that may quiet them down or alter their behavior. These changes may help us adapt to stressful environments, although the effects aren’t well understood.</p>
<p>It is these tell-tale chemical flags that Mulligan and her team were looking for in the genes of Syrian families. While lab experiments have shown that animals can pass along epigenetic signatures of stress to future generations, proving the same in people has been nearly impossible.&nbsp;</p>

		 <p>Mulligan worked with <a href="https://staff.hu.edu.jo/CV_e.aspx?id=0gnQeXkZsCc=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rana Dajani</a>, Ph.D., a molecular biologist at Hashemite University in Jordan, and anthropologist <a href="https://anthropology.yale.edu/profile/catherine-panter-brick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catherine Panter-Brick</a>, Ph.D., of Yale University, to conduct the unique study. The research relied on following three generations of Syrian immigrants to the country. Some families had lived through the Hama attack before fleeing to Jordan. Other families avoided Hama, but lived through the recent civil war against the Assad regime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team collected samples from grandmothers and mothers who were pregnant during the two conflicts, as well as from their children. This study design meant there were grandmothers, mothers and children who had each experienced violence at different stages of <img src="https://news.ufl.edu/media/newsufledu/images/2025/02/exp-design-566x437.jpg" alt="">development.</p>
<p>A third group of families had immigrated to Jordan before 1980, avoiding the decades of violence in Syria. These early immigrants served as a crucial control to compare to the families who had experienced the stress of civil war.</p>
<p>Herself the daughter of refugees, Dajani worked closely with the refugee community in Jordan to build trust and interest in participating in the story. She ultimately collected cheek swabs from 138 people across 48 families.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The families want their story told. They want their experiences heard,” Mulligan said.</p>
<p>Back in Florida, Mulligan’s lab scanned the DNA for epigenetic modifications and looked for any relationship with the families’ experience of violence.</p>
<p>In the grandchildren of Hama survivors, the researchers discovered 14 areas in the genome that had been modified in response to the violence their grandmothers experienced. These 14 modifications demonstrate that stress-induced epigenetic changes may indeed appear in future generations, just as they can in animals.</p>
<p>The study also uncovered 21 epigenetic sites in the genomes of people who had directly experienced violence in Syria. In a third finding, the researchers reported that people exposed to violence while in their mothers’ wombs showed evidence of accelerated epigenetic aging, a type of biological aging that may be associated with susceptibility to age-related diseases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of these epigenetic changes showed the same pattern after exposure to violence, suggesting a kind of common epigenetic response to stress — one that can not only affect people directly exposed to stress, but also future generations.</p>
<p>“We think our work is relevant to many forms of violence, not just refugees. Domestic violence, sexual violence, gun violence: all the different kinds of violence we have in the U.S,” said Mulligan. “We should study it. We should take it more seriously.”</p>
<p>It’s not clear what, if any, effect these epigenetic changes have in the lives of people carrying them inside their genomes. But some studies have found a link between stress-induced epigenetic changes and diseases like diabetes. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/science/dutch-famine-genes.html">One famous study</a> of Dutch survivors of famine during World War II suggested that their offspring carried epigenetic changes that increased their odds of being overweight later in life. While many of these modifications likely have no effect, it’s possible that some can affect our health, Mulligan said.</p>
<p>The researchers published their findings, which were supported by the National Science Foundation, Feb. 27 in the journal Scientific Reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While carefully searching for evidence of the lasting effects of war and trauma stamped into our genomes, Mulligan and her collaborators were also struck by the perseverance of the families they worked with. Their story was much bigger than merely surviving war, Mulligan said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In the midst of all this violence we can still celebrate their extraordinary resilience. They are living fulfilling, productive lives, having kids, carrying on traditions. They have persevered,” Mulligan said. “That resilience and perseverance is quite possibly a uniquely human trait.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-node="ch78d0t3zn46">
		<p>For those of us with woefully average gray matter, <a href="https://kupajo.com/eliminate-noise-in-your-mental-bandwidth/">our minds have limited reach</a>. For the past, they are enthusiastic but incompetent archivists. In the present, they reach for <a href="https://kupajo.com/beware-of-black-butterflies/">the most provocative fragments of ideas</a>, often preferring distraction over clarity.</p>
<p>Writing provides scaffolding. Structure for the unstructured, undisciplined mind. It’s a practical tool for thinking more effectively. And sometimes, it’s the best way to truly begin to think at all.</p>
<p>Let’s call your mind’s default setting ‘perpetual approximation mode.’ &nbsp;A business idea, a scrap of gossip, a trivial fact, a romantic interest, a shower argument to reconcile something long past. <a href="https://kupajo.com/grow-inherently-not-apparently/">We spend more time mentally rehearsing activities than actually doing them</a>. You can spend your entire life hopping among these shiny fragments without searching for underlying meaning until tragedy, chaos, or opportunity slaps you into awareness.</p>
<p>Writing forces you to tidy that mental clutter. To articulate things with a level of context and coherence the mind alone can’t achieve. Writing expands your working memory, lets you be more brilliant on paper than you can be in person.</p>
<p>While some of this brilliance comes from enabling us to connect larger and larger ideas, much of it comes from stopping, uh, non-brilliance. Writing reveals what you don’t know, what you can’t see when an idea is only held in your head. <a href="https://kupajo.com/fear-and-loneliness-cause-people-to-act-in-self-contradictory-ways/">Biases, blind spots, and assumptions</a> you can’t grasp internally.</p>
<p>At its best, writing (and reading) can reveal the ugly, uncomfortable, or unrealistic parts of your ideas. It can pluck out parasitic ideas burrowed so deeply that they imperceptibly steer your feelings and beliefs. Sometimes this uprooting will reveal that the lustrous potential of a new idea is a mirage, or that your understanding of someone’s motives was incomplete, maybe projected.</p>
<p>If you’re repeatedly drawn to a thought, feeling, or belief, write it out. Be fast, be sloppy. Just as children ask why, why, why, you can repeat the question “why do I think/feel/believe this?” a few times. What plops onto the paper may surprise you. So too will the headspace that clears from pouring out the canned spaghetti of unconnected thoughts.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Writing about yourself seems to be a lot like sticking a branch into clear river-water and roiling up the muddy bottom.”</p>
<p>~Stephen King, Different Seasons (Book)</p></blockquote>

          <p>After more than 21 years, Skype will soon be no more. Last night, some users (including Ars readers) poked around in the latest Skype preview update and noticed as-yet-unsurfaced text that read "Starting in May, Skype will no longer be available. Continue your calls and chats in Teams."</p>
<p>This morning, Microsoft has confirmed to Ars that it's true. May 5, 2025, will mark the end of Skype's long run.</p>
<p>Alongside the verification that the end is nigh, Microsoft shared a bunch of details about how it plans to migrate Skype users over. Starting right away, some Skype users (those in Teams and Skype Insider) will be able to log in to Teams using their Skype credentials. More people will gain that ability over the next few days.</p>
<p>Microsoft claims that users who do this will see their existing contacts and chats from Skype in Teams from the start. Alternatively, users who don't want to do this can export their Skype data—specifically contacts, call history, and chats.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>While Elon Musk <a href="https://www.theverge.com/elon-musk/617427/musk-trump-doge-recession-unemployment">hacks away at the federal bureaucracy</a> in the name of “efficiency,” his company Starlink appears poised to steal a multibillion-dollar government contract from Verizon.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration is on the cusp of canceling a $2.4 billion contract to overhaul the communication system for the nation’s air traffic control system and handing it to the SpaceX subsidiary instead, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/26/musk-starlink-doge-faa-verizon/"><em>The</em> <em>Washington Post</em> reports</a>, citing two unnamed sources briefed on the plans. The news was also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-27/faa-weighs-canceling-verizon-deal-amid-starlink-terminal-tests">confirmed by <em>Bloomberg</em></a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-starlink-spacex-faa-bbe9495978cac61b60c2971168e2921f">and <em>The Associated Press</em></a>.</p><p>It’s unclear exactly how this would unfold — whether the FAA would hand some of the work to Starlink while allowing Verizon to continue its own effort or simply cancel the contract with Verizon and award it to Starlink. Whatever the outcome, it is sure to raise accusations of favoritism, cronyism, and conflicts of interest, as Musk continues to serve as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619412/doge-acting-administrator-amy-gleason-named">the face of the Department of Government Efficiency-run effort</a> to slash spending and lay off federal workers, despite the structural damage that causes.</p><div><p>It is sure to raise serious accusations of favoritism and conflicts of interest</p></div><p>Musk has been sowing doubt about the Verizon system for several days, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1894202642639061144">claiming without evidence</a> that it’s “not working and so is putting air travelers at serious risk.” Earlier today, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1895129237478162621">he posted on X</a> that the Verizon communication system is “breaking down very rapidly” and that the “FAA assessment is single digit months to catastrophic failure, putting air traveler safety at serious risk.” He also claimed that Starlink terminals would be provided at “NO COST to the taxpayer on an emergency basis to restore air traffic control connectivity.”</p><p>This, of course, follows a pattern, in which Musk posts on X about something regarding the FAA and then seems to will it into existence. Previously, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603113/faa-chief-musk-dc-plane-crash-crisis">the billionaire called for FAA administrator Michael Whitaker’s resignation</a>, after the agency fined SpaceX for failing to get approval for rocket launch changes. After his repeated comments, Whitaker resigned on the day of Donald Trump’s inauguration.</p><p>A team from SpaceX, Starlink’s parent company, has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614078/faa-air-traffic-control-spacex-elon-musk-layoff-staff-shortage">working within the FAA in recent weeks</a> to help modernize the agency’s aging technology system. US Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said they were tasked with developing “a new, better, modern and safer system.”</p><p>Several SpaceX employees now have FAA email addresses, the <em>Post </em>reports. One SpaceX employee posted a photo of the team on X, with the statement, “Working to improve the safety of the national air space system.”</p><p>The FAA was scheduled to make a decision to start paying out the Verizon contract next month. But the SpaceX team reportedly recommended it be awarded to Starlink instead, the <em>Post</em> reports, citing an unnamed source with knowledge of the plans. So far, the formal process of unwinding one contract and awarding it to another company has reportedly not been followed. Several senior FAA officials have refused to sign the contract, leading Musk’s team to seek help from a Trump appointee within the agency.</p><p>Much of Musk’s wealth comes from government largesse. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2025/elon-musk-business-government-contracts-funding/">According to the <em>Post</em></a>, his companies have received approximately $38 billion in government contracts, loans, subsidies, and tax credits over the years.</p><p>There have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/planes/617438/plane-crash-air-safety-faa-layoffs">four commercial aircraft crashes globally</a> in the last 11 weeks, as well as a handful of private plane crashes and several near misses. Meanwhile, the air traffic control system appears to be in chaos, with hundreds of employees cut. Despite air travel being safer than it has ever been before, many people are left with the perception of a global aviation system that’s coming apart at the seams.</p></div></div>]]></description>

The text is titled &quot;Permanent Suspension&quot; and reads &quot;Your account has been permanently suspended due to the use of unauthorized Operating Systems or unauthorized virtual machines. This type of behavior causes damage to our community and the game's competitive integrity. This action will not be reversed.&quot;"></a><figcaption><h4>Purposefully ambiguous and fictious permanent ban.</h4><p>(created with <a href="https://digipres.club/@foone">@foone</a>’s <a href="https://deathgenerator.com/">The Death Generator</a>)</p></figcaption></figure><p>My primary operating system is Linux: I have it installed on my laptop and desktop. Thanks to the amazing work of the <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">WINE</a>, <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/">CodeWeavers</a>, and <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/">Valve</a> developers, it’s also where I do PC gaming. I can spin up Windows in a virtual machine for the rare times I need to use it, and even pass through a GPU if I want to do gaming.</p><p>There is one pretty big exception: playing the AAA game ████████████████ with friends. Unfortunately, the developer only allows Windows. If you attempt to run the game on Linux or they detect you’re running in a virtual machine, your device and account are permanently banned. I would prefer not to be permanently banned.</p><p>For the past several years my desktop has also had a disk dedicated to maintaining a Windows install. I’d prefer to use the space in my PC case<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for disks for Linux. Since I already run a home NAS, and my Windows usage is infrequent, I wondered if I could offload the Windows install to my NAS instead. This lead me down the course of netbooting Windows 11 and writing up these notes on how to do a simplified “modern” version.</p><h2 id="ipxe-and-iscsi">iPXE and iSCSI</h2><p>My first task was determining how to get a computer to boot from a NAS. My experience with network block devices is with Ceph RBD, where a device is mounted into an already running operating system. For booting over an Ethernet IP network the standard is iSCSI. A great way to boot from an iSCSI disk is with <a href="https://ipxe.org/">iPXE</a>. To avoid any mistakes during this process, I removed all local drives from the system.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>I didn’t want to run a TFTP server on my home network, or reconfigure DHCP to provide TFTP configuration. Even if I did, the firmware for my motherboard is designed for “<span>gamers</span>”, there’s no PXE ROM. I can enable UEFI networking and a network boot option appears in the boot menu, but no DHCP requests are made<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Fortunately, iPXE is available as <a href="https://boot.ipxe.org/ipxe.usb">bootable USB image</a>, which loaded and started trying to fetch configuration from the network.</p><p>Hitting <code>ctrl-b</code> as directed on screen to drop to the iPXE shell, I could verify basic functionality was working.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>iPXE 1.21.1+ (e7585fe) -- Open Source Network Boot Firmware -- https://ipxe.org

</code></pre><p>I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/fujita/tgt">tgt</a> as the iSCSI target daemon on my NAS<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> as the configuration seemed the least complicated. In <code>/etc/tgt/targets.conf</code> I configured it with two targets: one as the block device I wanted to install Windows onto and the other being the installation ISO.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sgml">&lt;target iqn.2025-02.com.example:win-gaming&gt;
    backing-store /dev/zvol/zroot/sans/win-gaming
    params thin-provisioning=1
&lt;/target&gt;

    device-type cd
    readonly 1
&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre><p>Back on the PC, I could tell iPXE to use these iSCSI disks, then boot onto the DVD. As multiple network drives are being added, each must be given a different drive ID starting from <code>0x80</code>.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>iPXE&gt; sanhook --drive 0x80 iscsi:nas.example.com:::1:iqn.2025-02.com.example:win-gaming

Registered SAN device 0x81
iPXE&gt; sanboot --drive 0x81
Booting from SAN device 0x81
</code></pre><p>After a minute of the Windows 11 logo and a spinner, the Windows 11 setup appears. In an ideal situation, I could immediately start installing. Unfortunately, the Windows 11 DVD does not ship drivers for my network card, and the iSCSI connection information passed to the booted system from iPXE couldn’t be used. I’m a bit impressed the GUI loaded at all, instead of just crashing.</p><h2 id="chainloading-winpe">Chainloading WinPE</h2><p>To rectify this, I would need to build a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/winpe-intro">Windows PE</a> image that included my networking drivers. WinPE is the minimal environment used when installing Windows. Fortunately, Microsoft has made this pretty easy nowadays. I downloaded and installed the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install">Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit</a> and the Windows PE add-on. After running “Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment” as an administrator, I could make a folder containing a base WinPE image.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; mkdir C:\winpe
&gt; copype amd64 C:\winpe\amd64
</code></pre><p>After mounting the image, I was able to slipstream the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/727998/intel-network-adapter-driver-for-microsoft-windows-11.html">Intel drivers</a>. I searched through the inf files to find the folder that supported my network card.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; imagex /mountrw C:\winpe\amd64\media\sources\boot.wim C:\winpe\amd64\mount
&gt; dism /image:C:\winpe\amd64\mount /add-driver /driver:C:\temp\intel\PRO1000\Winx64\W11\
&gt; imagex /unmount /commit C:\winpe\amd64\mount
</code></pre><p>This new image is what we need to boot into to install Windows. As my NAS is also running an HTTP server, I copied over the files relevant to netbooting: from “C:‍\winpe\amd64\media” I copied “boot/BCD”, “boot/boot.sdi”, and “sources/boot.wim”, preserving the folders. I also downloaded <a href="https://github.com/ipxe/wimboot/releases">wimboot</a> to the same directory.</p><p>You can use iPXE to execute a script fetched with HTTP, which I took advantage of to reduce the amount of typing I’ll need to do at the shell. I saved the following script as “install.ipxe” in the same HTTP directory.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ipxe">#!ipxe

sanhook --drive 0x80 iscsi:nas.example.com:::1:iqn.2025-02.com.example:win-gaming

</code></pre><p>Rebooting back to the iPXE prompt I could then boot using this script.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>iPXE&gt; dhcp
iPXE&gt; chain http://nas.example.com/ipxe/install.ipxe
</code></pre><p>After a few seconds I was booted into WinPE with a Command Prompt. The command “wpeinit” ran automatically, configuring the network card and mounting the iSCSI disks. I found the DVD had been mounted as drive “D”, and could start the Windows Setup with “D:‍\setup.exe”.</p><p>However, after reaching the “Searching for Disks” screen the installer closed itself without any error. This seems to be a bug with the new version of setup, as restarting it and selecting the “Previous Version of Setup” on an earlier page used a version of the installer that worked.</p><p>The installation was spread across several restarts. Fortunately, once the installation files are copied over, nothing but the main disk image is required, reducing what I needed to type in the iPXE shell. The HTTP server could also be cleaned up at this point.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>iPXE&gt; dhcp
iPXE&gt; sanboot iscsi:nas.example.com:::1:iqn.2025-02.com.example:win-gaming
</code></pre><p>After several more minutes, and a forced installation of a Windows zero-day patch, I was greeted by a Windows 11 desktop, booted over iSCSI. Task Manager even reports the C drive as being “SDD (iSCSI)”.</p><h2 id="automating-boots">Automating Boots</h2><p>Booting from a USB stick and typing into an iPXE prompt every time I want to boot into Windows isn’t a great user experience. Fortunately, iPXE is also available as an <a href="https://boot.ipxe.org/ipxe.efi">EFI application</a> which can be installed to the local EFI System Partition. I also discovered that iPXE will execute commands provided on the command line.</p><p>I reinstalled the disks used for Linux, copied over ipxe.efi to the EFI System Partition, and added a new entry to systemd-boot by creating “$ESP/loader/entries/win11.conf”</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>title Windows 11 (iPXE)
efi /ipxe/ipxe.efi
options prompt &amp;&amp; dhcp &amp;&amp; sanboot iscsi:nas.example.com:::1:iqn.2025-02.com.example:win-gaming
</code></pre><p>There seems to be a bug where the first word in the options field is ignored.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> I used a valid iPXE command <code>prompt</code>, which also provides a clear signal should it ever start being interpreted in the future version.</p><h2 id="lets-game">Let’s Game</h2><p>After a little bit of extra setup (installing Firefox and switching to dark mode), I was able to install Steam and the game. The game took a little bit longer to install due the slower disk speed over my network (time to upgrade to 10GbE?), but there was no noticeable delay during normal gameplay. I didn’t see any network saturation or high disk latencies in Task Manager during loading.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">WebShield draws inspiration from privacy and performance-focused projects like uBlock Origin. This project wouldn't be possible without the dedication of filter list maintainers who work tirelessly to keep the web clean. I'm deeply grateful to stand on the shoulders of these projects and their contributors. Special thanks to AdGuard, whose tools — particularly SafariConverterLib and Scriptlets/ExtendedCSS — have been instrumental to WebShield's development. I'd also like to thank @0xCube for our ongoing collaboration and the valuable connection between our projects.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Donate</h2><a id="user-content-donate" aria-label="Permalink: Donate" href="#donate"></a></p>

</ul>
<p dir="auto">WebShield is and will always remain free, with all core ad-blocking functionality available to everyone. We believe in keeping the web clean and accessible, without hiding essential features behind paywalls.</p>
<p dir="auto">As an independent, self-funded project, WebShield relies exclusively on user donations to sustain its development. This funding model is intentional—it ensures our incentives align perfectly with our users' interests. By choosing this path over revenue from ads, tracking, or deals with ad companies, we maintain our independence and stay true to our privacy-first principles.</p>
<p dir="auto">WebShield+ offers a tiered support system: the more you contribute, the greater your influence on WebShield's future development. Your level of support directly correlates with the weight your voice carries in shaping our roadmap and future features.</p>
<p dir="auto">For a modest contribution (starting at $1 either monthly or as a one-time payment), WebShield+ offers:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Early access to release candidate versions and experimental features</li>
<li>Direct communication with the development team</li>
<li>Influence on WebShield's roadmap (scaled with contribution level)</li>
<li>A special badge on Discord</li>
<li>The satisfaction of supporting a truly independent ad-blocker</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I develop WebShield as a full-time student, dedicating and paying with my free time to create the best possible ad-blocking experience for Safari users. While supporting the project is entirely optional, every donation directly funds our continued development and independence. This user-supported model allows us to maintain our unwavering focus on privacy and performance, free from the compromises that come with alternative funding sources.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our commitment to providing a powerful, free ad-blocker for all Safari users remains unchanged. We believe in creating a product valuable enough that users choose to support it, rather than forcing their hand through paywalls or compromising with "acceptable ads."</p>
<p dir="auto">Together, we can redefine ad-blocking for Safari, prioritizing user privacy, performance, and a cleaner web experience for everyone.</p>

<p dir="auto">Happy browsing! 🛡️</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.waterfox.net/blog/a-comment-on-mozilla-changes/">https://www.waterfox.net/blog/a-comment-on-mozilla-changes/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43204376">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>   <h2 id="the-recent-policy-changes">The Recent Policy Changes</h2>
<p>As you may have read in <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-terms-of-use/">Introducing a terms of use and updated privacy notice for Firefox</a>, there has been significant confusion and commentary surrounding Mozilla’s recent policy updates. The reaction from the tech community has been mixed, with many expressing concerns about potential privacy implications.</p>
<p>I think it’s important to highlight a clarification Mozilla later added to their announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: We’ve seen a little confusion about the language regarding licenses, so we want to clear that up. We need a license to allow us to make some of the basic functionality of Firefox possible. Without it, we couldn’t use information typed into Firefox, for example. It does NOT give us ownership of your data or a right to use it for anything other than what is described in the Privacy Notice.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-communication-disconnect">A Communication Disconnect</h2>
<p>This situation reveals a recurring issue in how Mozilla communicates with its user base. I believe this represents a fundamental disconnect in communication strategy. Internally at Mozilla, I’m certain there were extensive discussions, agreements, disagreements, and careful consideration about how to phrase and present these changes. The team likely developed a clear understanding of the what, where, and why behind these policy updates.</p>
<p>However, when it came time to present this information to users, Mozilla seems to have forgotten that we—the external community—were not privy to those internal discussions. Critical context, nuance, and rationale that informed their decision-making process were missing from the initial announcement. What may have seemed perfectly clear to those inside Mozilla appeared ambiguous and concerning to those of us on the outside.</p>
<h2 id="waterfoxs-approach-to-privacy-policy-stability">Waterfox’s Approach to Privacy Policy Stability</h2>
<p>For Waterfox, the policy has remained consistent and straightforward, with minimal changes over time.</p>
<p>I’ve done my best to be transparent about if and when Waterfox communicates with remote servers, giving users control over these interactions whenever possible. This philosophy reflects my belief that a browser should be predictable in its behavior and respectful of user choices regarding privacy.</p>
<h2 id="forks-different-approaches-to-user-privacy">Forks: Different Approaches to User Privacy</h2>
<p>The ecosystem includes several forks that take different approaches to user privacy and interaction. Some make more aggressive privacy choices by default, while others like Waterfox aim to balance privacy with functionality in a transparent way. These forks serve an important role in the browser ecosystem by providing options for users with specific requirements.</p>
<p>But -critically- what’s often overlooked in discussions about browser privacy is the importance of formal governance structures and accountability mechanisms. While Firefox and forks like Waterfox operate within established legal and organisational frameworks, there are numerous browser projects without any formal governance documents, legal entities, or accountability structures.</p>
<p>Open source software is fundamentally about freedom—the freedom to modify, distribute, and use software as one sees fit. However, when it comes to something as security-critical as a web browser—software that mediates our most sensitive online interactions—the existence of a responsible organisation with clear policies becomes a crucial differentiator.</p>
<p>Browsers without formal governance may offer appealing features or privacy claims, but users have little recourse if those promises are broken. There’s no entity to hold accountable, no legal framework within which to address grievances, and often no transparency about decision-making processes.</p>
<h2 id="balancing-freedom-with-responsibility">Balancing Freedom with Responsibility</h2>
<p>This is what I think makes Waterfox fundamentally different from many alternatives. The very fact that we maintain clear policies, respond to user feedback, and operate within legal frameworks creates an accountability that many browser projects simply don’t have.</p>
<p>As the browser landscape continues to evolve, I think that having a clearly defined governance structure and transparent policies isn’t just good practice—it’s an essential component of user trust. While open source gives developers the freedom to fork code and create new projects at will, users deserve to know who is responsible for the software they rely on daily and how decisions about their privacy are made.</p>
<p>The existence of formal policies, even imperfect ones, represents a commitment to users that their interests matter.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

            <p>While looking through the articles on a "social engineering" themed forum I discovered a relatively new scam scheme that shocked me.<br>People create thousands of GitHub repositories with all sorts of things - from Roblox and Fortnite mods to "cracked" FL Studio and Photoshop.</p><p>As soon as you download and launch any of these, all the data from your computer is collected and sent to some discord server - where hundreds of people crawl through the data searching for crypto wallet private keys, bank accounts and social media credentials, and even Steam and Riot Games accounts.</p><h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3><ol><li>I found a step-by-step guide to creating these scam repositories, broke it down and eventually found a couple of the repositories potentially created by the guide author. </li><li>Wrote a script that helped me find <strong>1115</strong> repositories built based on the instructions from the guide. <br>Less then 10% of them have open issues with complaints - others look just fine.<br>I collected all of them in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTyQYoWah23kS0xvYR-Vtnrdxgihf9Ig4ZFY1MCyOWgh_UlPGsoKZQgbpUMTNChp9UQ3XIMehFd_c0u/pubhtml?ref=timsh.org#" rel="noreferrer">single spreadsheet</a>.  </li><li>Found the unpacked version of the malicious code and analysed each of the 1000+ rows. The obfuscated code is a version of Redox stealer that searches for all valuable things on victims` computer and silently sends them to some Discord server. </li></ol><hr><h3 id="some-background">Some background</h3><p>Recently I visited my "Archive" folder on Telegram to find an annoying channel I didn't want to unsubscribe from - and a message from a bot I used to use popped up at the top of the list with an eye-catching heading:</p><figure><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.32.26.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1692" height="854" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.32.26.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.32.26.png 1000w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.32.26.png 1600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.32.26.png 1692w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span> Translation: "our theme on [redacted]: link deposit on [redacted]: $10k"</span></figcaption></figure><p>A couple things before we start: </p><ol><li>This is a bot for ... checking TikTok videos for shadow bans (yes, they exist). <br>I had a startup focused on promoting musicians on TikTok back in the day, and this bot was helpful when TikTok updated their anti-bot algorithms. <br>But, as I learned recently, it's mostly used by people who "arbitrage traffic" on TikTok to... well, to some dark and illegal things, like fake crypto exchanges or fake gambling, as you can see in the screenshot. <br>But this post is not about them! </li><li>All the content in it is mostly in Russian, as well as lots of sources for this post. <br>I'm sure that such schemes exist all over the world and it's just that I looked into this Telegram Bot first. </li><li>I decided to redact some screenshots and not provide direct links to some sources because they contain highly immoral information and I don't want to spread it. Anyone curious enough can find all mentioned things by themselves. </li></ol><p>By the way, I think this is a very clever kind of promo for a very specific audience that can't be easily seen from the outside.<br>Since it's a message from the bot, you must already be subscribed to it to see it, and it will also send all users that didn't mute it a notification. <br>I think the conversion rates of these ads (each one costs 150$) are quite high. </p><p>Let's get back to the message on the screenshot - as well as other promotions of various scam "teams", it had a mention of a [redacted] forum that was acting as some sort of authority platform in this niche - the message implies that this specific "team" has deposited $10k to the forum in order to prove that they're legit or something. I decided to look into the forum and was shocked by what's out there in the clear web. </p><p>No .onion, no KYC, no "contact us to join" - I just created an account with email + password and was able to view all of the contents. </p><p>Inside - a panel for selling basically anything: accounts on all sorts of platforms, starting from TikTok and up to "old verified $100k+ spent Facebook Ads accounts" for... well, it's a theme for another post. </p><figure><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.55.06.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1638" height="336" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.55.06.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.55.06.png 1000w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.55.06.png 1600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.55.06.png 1638w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>US-based 6+ months old instagram accounts for 50 cents</span></figcaption></figure><p>What turned out to be far more interesting is the <strong>Articles</strong> section. <br>The topics cover almost everything there is in the "<em>affiliate</em>" world - which is a fancy name for all sorts of scams that involve some tech "provider" and a "team" of people who attract "mammoths" to their website and share profits with the provider. <br>A good example is RaaS (ransomware as a service) - check out <a href="https://www.group-ib.com/resources/knowledge-hub/raas/?ref=timsh.org" rel="noreferrer">this article</a> if you're interested, or a crypto drainer like <a href="https://cryptograb.io/?ref=timsh.org" rel="noreferrer">CryptoGrab</a> which is literally a scam platform that has a <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/15422095?ref=timsh.org" rel="noreferrer">registered company in the UK</a> - which they brag about in their <a href="https://read.cryptograb.wiki/cryptograb-affiliate?ref=timsh.org#we-are-an-official-company" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a>. </p><p>But we're not here to talk about these "famous" schemes – lots of researchers and cybersecurity agencies have investigated them.<br>As an example, Abnormal <a href="https://abnormalsecurity.com/blog/cryptograb-cryptocurrency-fraud-scam-websites-phishing?ref=timsh.org" rel="noreferrer">posted an investigation about CryptoGrab</a> less then a week ago.  </p><p>What appeared as a complete surprise and novelty to me was the article titled: </p><h2 id="how-to-pour-traffic-on-github-from-a-to-z">How to pour [traffic on] Github from A to Z</h2><figure><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-21-at-00.12.43.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1452" height="340" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-21-at-00.12.43.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-21-at-00.12.43.png 1000w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-21-at-00.12.43.png 1452w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>This post is a very long and detailed step-by-step instruction for creating and spreading hundreds of malicious GitHub repos masked as almost anything "juicy": popular game mods, "free" cracked apps like Adobe Photoshop and FL Studio, and lots of other things. </p><figure><div><p><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/image-1.png" width="755" height="397" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-1.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/image-1.png 755w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/image-2.png" width="683" height="831" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-2.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/image-2.png 683w"></p></div><figcaption><p><span>some of the placeholder images created by the author of that article and an example of a "Cracked" FL Studio repository readme </span></p></figcaption></figure><p>The main goal of malicious scripts under the hood is to collect so-called "logs".</p><blockquote>"Log" is a file with data from victim's computer, including cookies, passwords, IP and sensitive files.

    OtherZip.append([

        lnik])</code></pre><p>This function kills Telegram process if it's running, collects the associated files (chat history, media, settings, tokens etc) and sends it to Anonfiles - a free and anonymous file sharing site, <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/anonfiles-com-2?ref=timsh.org" rel="noreferrer"><u>reported by some antivirus and malware detection</u></a> products as abused by criminals.</p><p>Next we have the ZipFiles - it's a long function that looks for specific things like Metamask wallet extension associated files, Steam loginusers.vdf file, containing user stream account info, Riot games accounts and more. </p><pre><code>if 'nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn' in arg:

I quote: </p><blockquote>If you're motivated enough, you should create more topics and upload them. As you reach 300-500 uploaded repositories, 10-30 of which are on top - they will generate <strong>50-100+ logs daily</strong>. <br>Check your topics once in a while - if any of them got banned, re-upload all affected repos with new tags. <br>Good luck! </blockquote><p>So there should be hundreds of these uploaded just by a single person - so, potentially, thousands or more in total. <br>I could've stopped at this point since this is already an indicator of a wide-spread problem. But I decided to try a few things in order to estimate the amount of repos out there. </p><h3 id="searching-on-github">Searching on Github</h3><p>I almost immediately came up with an idea - since I have an instruction for creating and choosing the topics provided by the author, I could try and search each of them and see if there are any repositories with such topics. </p><p>I tried it manually with 10 topics and was very excited to see that 10/10 included similar-looking repos with either README + .rar or just README with "download" link, leading to some shady file sharing service. <br>At this point I found out that this scam scheme must also be popular on Chinese "social engineering" forums,  since there are lots of the identical repos with readme  in Chinese. <br>Here's <a href="https://github.com/stillweasyh/CS2-imstar3.5?ref=timsh.org"><u>one example</u></a> with a couple open issues - I translated it with google translate:</p><figure><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-22.10.51.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1882" height="1866" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-22.10.51.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-22.10.51.png 1000w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-22.10.51.png 1600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-22.10.51.png 1882w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="scraping-github">Scraping Github</h3><p>After just 30 minutes of manual searching I felt like it was an effective method, meaning that the possibility that a repository is / looks malicious if it has one of the mentioned topics is quite high. Which is why I decided to write a simple script that:</p><ol><li>Generates some simple topics using an instruction provided by the author - 1 base_keyword like csgo or fortnite + 1 topic_keyword like "cheat", "hack", "aimbot", then 1 base + 2 topic_keyword, e.t.c</li><li>Searches for each of them on Github using a <code>topic:{topic}</code> query and saves all found repos to a single .csv. </li><li>Checks each found repository structure for being suspicious - even a single README or README + some files + .rar/.exe./.zip. <br>Again, those that don't match the file structure pattern are still very likely to be malicious - but maybe using a slightly different approach.  </li></ol><p>For both base_keywords and topic_keywords I used lists  from the examples from the guide - as you can imagine, both of these could be expanded quite a lot, but I left them intentionally to see if even the simplest PoC would work:</p><pre><code>base_keywords = [
    "Apex Legends", "CODMW", "cod warzone", "cs2", "dayz", "escape from tarkov",
    "five m", "fortnite", "genshin impact", "gta v", "lol", "league of legends",
    "minecraft", "overwatch", "pubg", "rainbow six siege", "roblox", "rust",
    "valorant", "fl studio", "fruity loops"
]

modifiers = [
    "download", "free", "crack", "cracked", "for pc", "pc crack",
    "cheat", "cheats", "hack", "hacks", "wallhack", "aimbot"
]</code></pre><p>At first when I generated topics of length &lt;= 4 words I got <strong>38k</strong> possible options. Since GitHub API search endpoint has a rate limit of 30 requests / minute, looking through all of them would take the script almost a full day. <br>I decided to limit the list of keywords to have 100 keyword combinations per app - for 21 apps, that gave me 2100 topics - more than enough for the PoC purposes. </p><h3 id="even-with-the-simple-poc-script-heres-what-i-got">Even with the simple PoC script, here's what I got:<br></h3><blockquote>All repositories:<br>  Total rows: <strong>1155</strong><br>  Rows with open_issues &gt;= 1: 115<p>Malicious repositories (based on file structure):<br>  Total rows: <strong>351</strong><br>  Rows with open_issues &gt;= 1: 11</p></blockquote><p>115 have at least 1 open issue. I checked a few manually - all of the issues are either "this is not working" (and it shouldn't, by the way - it just needs to waste some of your time while it's looking for your data) or/and "this is a scam / malware / rat / virus / ...". <br>It's just 10% of the found repos.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="top-content-area">
                        

<p>Borís Vasíl'yevich Spásskiy&nbsp;was born on January 30, 1937 in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). The two-time Soviet Champion and ex-World Champion&nbsp;immigrated to&nbsp;France in 1976, and became a French citizen. He&nbsp;returned to Russia in 2012, where <a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/boris-spaky-in-grave-condition">he suffered a major stroke</a> that left him&nbsp;bound to&nbsp;a wheelchair for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Arkady Dvorkovich, the president of FIDE, said: “He was not only one of the greatest players of the Soviet era and the world, but also a true gentleman. His contributions to chess will never be forgotten.”</p>
<p>The general newspapers and chess news outlets will be full of the news of Spassky's passing, with copious descriptions of his career.&nbsp;Read for instance&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/world/europe/boris-spassky-dead.html">Dylan Loeb McClain's article</a> in the New York Times, published just hours after the news broke. In any case, there are many comprehensive biographical articles, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Spassky">like this one in Wikipedia</a>. I do not want to add to these, but instead describe the Spassky I knew.</p>
<h3>On a personal note</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://en.chessbase.com/portals/all/2024/ff/Chess-stories01.jpg">In the book&nbsp;<em>Chess Stories,</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/chess-stories-now-in-english">now available in English</a>, there is a chapter by me on my decades-long friendship with Boris Spassky. I will link to it at the bottom of this article. Here's a short summary.</p>
<p>I first met Boris Spassky in the late 1970s, in Hamburg, where he was part of the commercial presentation of a new chess playing computer. Then in Munich in 1979, where Boris was playing in a GM tournament. My friend Helmut Pfleger, who is a medical doctor, was conducting an experiment to monitor the blood pressure and heart rates of players during a game. Spassky was one of the volunteers, and I assisted in attaching the monitors to his arm each day. We slowly became friends.</p>
<p>In 1988, I travelled to the Candidates Tournament in Saint John, Canada. When the plane landed in Toronto they said we had missed the onward flight, and gave me a very nice room, in a very nice hotel. There I went down to dinner, and suddenly Boris Spassky walks up to me and says, “Excuse me, Mr. Frederic, I recognized you on the plane, but I did not want to disturb you. Maybe we could now have dinner together?” I was stunned that one of the greatest chess players in the world would come to me in such a courteous way. We had a sumptuous dinner, with an endless supply of good Canadian wine. We sat there till four in the morning, and Boris told me eighty percent of everything I know about chess history.</p>
<p>After that night in the hotel restaurant, every time we met, we always spoke at length, and often had dinner together. Twice a year I would get a phone call from him: "I need you to fill my samovar," he'd say. That meant I had to send him new games for his Mega Database.</p>
<p>The next major encounter came many years later, when there was a Candidates Tournament in Elista, Russia. Boris was there doing commentary. We usually took lunch and dinner at the same table, and I witnessed something quite extraordinary: many young players crowded around us, listening to Boris. He was an old man, but everyone was interested in talking to him. He was charismatic and charming, full of stories!</p>
<p>After Boris moved back to Moscow, he became very frail. When I saw&nbsp;pictures or videos of him, I felt sad, because the man with whom I roamed the steppe was so vigorous and healthy. Not so long ago, somebody asked him what he did for his chess preparation. He replied: “I do not prepare for chess. I am preparing for – death! It is a long and difficult endgame.”&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>I have described the weeks we spent together in Elista, and my friendship with Boris Spassky, <strong><a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/frederic-s-mates-how-i-met-boris-spassky">in this article</a></strong>, which contains pictures and a 16-minute video interview conduced in&nbsp;Arne Kaehler's series <em>Frederic's Mates.<br>&nbsp;</em> 
</li><li>You can also read <strong><a href="https://en.chessbase.com/portals/all/2025/ff/Encounters_%20Boris%20Spassky.pdf">the full chapter I wrote in <em>Chess Stories</em></a></strong>. </li></ul>

<section id="pagebody" role="main">
<p>So there are only 2 web browser engines, and it seems likely there will
soon only be 1, and making a whole new web browser from the ground up is
effectively impossible because the browsers vendors have weaponized web
standards complexity against any newcomers. Maybe eventually someone will
succeed and there will be 2 again. Best case. What a situation.</p>

<p>So throw out all the web standards. Make a browser that just runs WASM
blobs, and gives them a surface to use, sorta like Wayland does. It has
tabs, and a throbber, and urls, but no HTML, no javascript, no CSS.
Just HTTP of WASM blobs.</p>

<p>This is where the web browser is going eventually anyway, except in the
current line of evolution it will be WASM with all the web standards
complexity baked in and reinforcing the current situation.</p>

<p>Would this be a mass of proprietary software? Have you looked at any
corporate website's "source" lately? But what's important is that this
would make it easy enough to build new browsers that they would stop
being a point of control.</p>

<p>Want a browser that natively supports RSS? Poll the feeds, make a UI,
download the WASM enclosures to view the posts. Want a browser that
supports IPFS or gopher? Fork any browser and add it, the mantenance load
will be minimal. Want to provide access to GPIO pins or something? Add an
extension that can be accessed via the WASI component model. This would
allow for so many things like that which won't and can't happen with the
current market duopoly browser situation.</p>

<p>And as for your WASM web pages, well you can still use HTML if you like. Use
the WASI component model to pull in a HTML engine. It doesn't need to
support <em>everything</em>, just the parts of web standards that you want to use.
Or you can do something entitely different in your WASM that is not HTML
based at all but a better paradigm (oh hi Spritely or display postscript
or gemini capsules or whatever).</p>

<p>Dual innovation sources or duopoly? I know which I'd prefer. This is not my
project to build though.</p>

<p>In a move that will likely surprise no one, it appears Microsoft is gearing up to shut down Skype in the coming months. Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-killing-skype/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-killing-skype/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><em>XDA Developers</em></a>, the latest Skype for Windows preview reportedly includes a hidden string that reads <em><strong>"Starting in May, Skype will no longer be available. Continue your calls and chats in Teams." </strong></em>No other details are provided, but it certainly sounds like Skype's days are numbered.</p><p>Skype first launched in 2003 and was a very popular VOIP messaging platform in its heyday. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-close-buying-skype-7-billion-updated-its-official" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-close-buying-skype-7-billion-updated-its-official">Microsoft would later acquire Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion</a>, and in the years since has attempted to integrate it across many products, including Windows, Windows Phone, and even Xbox.</p><p>The company has updated and redesigned Skype a number of times in the last decade, including splitting the app up in an attempt to integrate the service into Windows 10 Mobile's Phone and Messaging apps to position it as a viable iMessage competitor.</p><p>in the last handful of years, Skype has been seriously neglected. Microsoft failed to position Skype as a viable option during the pandemic, and the service has largely fallen by the wayside in the eyes of consumers. Most people have moved to more modern platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, and Discord.</p><p>Microsoft did use Skype as a backbone to build out its popular Teams service for enterprise customers, but the experiences between the Teams and Skype apps are very different. Interestingly, it looks like Microsoft will encourage the remaining Skype users to switch to Teams, though this is likely referring to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-teams-consumer-announcement" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-teams-consumer-announcement">Teams for Consumers.</a></p><p>Skype in its current form is a sorry excuse for a messaging platform. It's a web-based app on Windows, which is very slow and does a terrible job at syncing conversations and notifications across devices. The app also doesn't even support Windows on Arm, which is something Microsoft has been pushing to adopt over the last half a decade.</p><p>In the last few years, Microsoft has tried to revive Skype with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/skype-text-messages-can-now-show-short-movie-and-tv-show-based-mojis-clips" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/skype-text-messages-can-now-show-short-movie-and-tv-show-based-mojis-clips">experiments such as Skype Clips</a>, which let users send short video messages to each other without calling them. In 2024, it also gained access to Copilot, self messaging, and a revamped mobile experience designed to compete with rival platforms.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qbDJD7W5VwBdPpCoqrqAfE"><section><p>All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.</p></section></div><p>Nothing seems to have worked, as the service still hasn't seemed to have gained much traction. The last time Skype received a notable update was in May 2024. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/skype-credit-no-longer-available-for-purchase-moving-millions-toward-subscriptions-as-their-only-option" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/skype-credit-no-longer-available-for-purchase-moving-millions-toward-subscriptions-as-their-only-option">Microsoft recently shuttered its Skype Number service</a>, which let you buy a real phone number that could be used to call other phone numbers not on the Skype service.</p><p>So, it seems Skype's days are numbered. Microsoft is yet to officially confirm that Skype is being shut down, but we'll be sure to update this article when the official announcement arrives. We've reached out to Microsoft for comment and will update accordingly.</p>

<p>If you use the uBlock Origin extension in Google Chrome or Edge, you should probably start looking for alternative browsers or extensions—either way. A few days ago, users noticed that Google had begun disabling uBlock Origin and other Manifest V2-based extensions as part of the migration to Manifest V3. Now, Microsoft Edge <em>appears</em> to be following suit.</p>

<p>The latest Edge Canary version started disabling Manifest V2-based extensions with the following message: "This extension is no longer supported. Microsoft Edge recommends that you remove it." Although the browser turns off old extensions without asking, you can still make them work by clicking "Manage extension" and toggling it back (you will have to acknowledge another prompt).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/02/1740579546_ublock_origin_dead.jpg"><img alt="uBlock Origin was turned off message in Edge" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/02/1740579546_ublock_origin_dead.jpg"></a></figure>                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <p>At this point, it is not entirely clear what is going on. <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/google-to-begin-phasing-out-manifest-v2-extensions-in-chrome-on-june-3/">Google started phasing out Manifest V2 extensions</a> in June 2024, and it has a clear roadmap for the process. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/developer-guide/manifest-v3">Microsoft's documentation</a>, however, still says "TBD," so the exact dates are not known yet. This leads to some speculating about the situation being one of "unexpected changes" coming from Chromium. Either way, sooner or later, Microsoft will ditch MV2-based extensions, so get ready as we wait for Microsoft to shine some light on its plans.</p>

<div data-oembed-url="https://x.com/Leopeva64/status/1894035389033103765">
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1/2 A message stating that some extensions have been disabled because they are no longer supported has appeared after installing the latest Edge Canary build, but I THINK this is one of those unexpected changes coming from upstream Chromium:<a href="https://t.co/NME5AvLUvg">https://t.co/NME5AvLUvg</a> <a href="https://t.co/BLWPI5onYh">pic.twitter.com/BLWPI5onYh</a></p>

</blockquote>

</div>

<p>Another thing worth noting is that the change does not appear to be affecting Edge's stable release or Beta/Dev Channels. For now, only Canary versions disable uBlock Origin and other MV2 extensions, leaving users a way to toggle them back on. Also, the uBlock Origin is <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ublock-origin/odfafepnkmbhccpbejgmiehpchacaeak">still available</a> in the Edge Add-ons store, <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-rolls-out-revamped-edge-add-ons-website/">which recently received a big update</a>.</p>

<p>In August 2024, when Google started flagging uBlock Origin as unsupported, the extension's maker stepped in and <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/ublock-origin-developer-recommends-switching-to-ublock-lite-as-chrome-flags-the-extension/">recommended users switch to uBlock Origin Lite</a>, a Manifest V3-based extension, and accept some of its limitations. Another option is to switch to Firefox. Mozilla recently <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-manifest-v3-adblockers/">announced</a> its plans to keep Manifest V2 extensions working, including uBlock Origin, based on Mozilla Manifesto, which claims that "individuals must have the ability to shape the internet and their own experiences on it."</p>

<p>Now, users can either switch to a browser that still supports MV2 extensions or move to MV3-based ad blockers. Of course, not all MV2 extensions have "more modern" versions, so for many, switching to Firefox or another browser with MV2 support will be the only option to keep old extensions working.</p>

I have defended things like the acquisition of Pocket (I actually use it extensively!), the addition of the AI chatbot sidebar, and the refocusing of energies on advertising and data collection as things that Firefox needed to do in order to stay relevant, grow their market share, and keep people employed.</p><p>And now, in this moment of glimmering opportunity, as Google is taking away a feature and telling Chrome users, "No, this is <em>our</em> browser, and you can't have any privacy either," <strong>Firefox had the opportunity to present itself as the refuge from everything that Chromium takes away from users.</strong> You could've said, "our terms of use: use the browser for good! Our privacy policy: your data remains private because we don't collect it at all." It could've been a remarkable distinctive for your user share. It could've positioned Mozilla as a paladin for the open web.</p><p>But instead, you're instituting a terms of use and a privacy policy that are vague and full of platitudes but represent a shift from your mission. <strong>This is a massive unforced error on Mozilla's part.</strong> If it was a EULA, that would be one thing. But this is not a EULA for an application. It's a TOS for a data collection service.</p><blockquote><strong>Transparency matters.</strong><span> We’re introducing a Terms of Use to provide clarity on what users agree to before starting to browse.</span></blockquote><p>For twenty years, the agreement has been very simple: you don't take any data from us unless we explicitly agree to it. But your new TOU has a "nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license" clause, the very same clause that's been used for decades to excuse horrible abuses of privacy by the worst that Big Tech has to offer.</p><p>While a TOU makes sense when someone makes use of the features you mention, the blanket application to all browsing data makes it feel like you're preparing us for a rug pull, after which you're going to start using our data for AI training or ad targeting (something which the Privacy Policy specifically allows).</p><p><strong>You shouldn't need a Terms of Use if all of the data remains on our device and we haven't opted-in to sending you any.</strong> You certainly don't need one to download and render a website. You only need one if Firefox isn't going to be a browser anymore, but a web service.</p><p>It's like Randall Munroe said in xkcd #463, many years ago: "Imagine you're at a parent-teacher conference, and the teacher reassures you that he always wears a condom while teaching. Strictly speaking, it's better than the alternative, yet someone is clearly doing their job horribly wrong." We chose Firefox because we wanted a browser, not a platform.</p><blockquote><strong>Privacy remains a priority.</strong><span> Our updated Privacy Notice gives a more detailed, easy-to-read explanation of our data practices.</span></blockquote><div><p>But this privacy policy is only necessary for certain parts of the browser, where data is actually sent to Mozilla's servers, and applying it in a blanket manner (as noted before) seems like the precursor to a rug pull.</p></div><blockquote><strong>You stay in control.</strong><span> Firefox is designed to respect user choice, with responsible defaults and simple tools to manage your data.</span></blockquote><p>For now. How long until you update the terms of use to prohibit the deactivation of ad targeting on the New Tab page? Or allow you to sell browsing data to third parties? Or train large language models on the things I type into the fields I browse to?</p><p>Please cancel these broad policies and apply them only to the features that need them, agreed to only when we use them. <strong>The only way for us to truly "stay in control" is if the policies don't apply to us unless we choose to use the features that require giving you that protection.</strong></p><p>The thing is, I don't know how you fix this breach of trust in a way that anyone can count on. Once you've presented yourself as willing to do this sort of thing, I just don't see a way to get that back. From being a bastion of the open web, poised to provide a product that people want and desperately need, you've now become a thin shadow of the thing that you claim to stand against.</p><p>I was a member of mozilla.social, and was very sad when that closed down. While a lot of people said this was a bad sign of the new direction Mozilla was moving in, I didn't take it as a red flag. Little did I know how much of a red flag it was; you could've chosen to promote that version of the next iteration of the web, but instead you went with AI.</p><p>I know that forks of Firefox await, versions of the browser that keep its old spirit alive. But I don't want to have to leave this browser or this community. Please reconsider.</p>

<p>Imagine a government that knows what you do each day — the people you talk to, the news you read, the places you go. You might think of North Korea or a similar totalitarian regime.</p>



<p>But the US government also has access to such a chillingly clear picture of your life, even without the apparatus of a surveillance state. All it needs to do is ask Big Tech.</p>



<p>And because giants like Meta, Google, and Apple must collect as much of your personal data as possible, there’s little they can do to protect your privacy.</p>

<p>US law enforcement has been increasingly quick to enlist Big Tech’s help in recent years. From late 2014 to early 2024, the number of accounts shared by Google jumped 530%; at Meta (formerly Facebook), it surged 675%; and at Apple, it climbed 621% (fed by an outlier second half of 2022, when they shared over 300,000 accounts). </p>

<p>Collectively, <strong>these three companies handed over the details of 3.16 million accounts in just under a decade</strong>. This number doesn’t even include data requests made under the <a href="https://proton.me/blog/us-warrantless-surveillance#fisa-court">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA), which are largely kept secret.</p>

<p>In the last six months of 2023 and the first six months of 2024 (the last 12 months there’s data for), the US government made nearly 500,000 data requests to Google and Meta — more than all the other members of the so-called 14 Eyes Alliance combined.</p>



<h2>Google, Meta and Apple form the world’s largest surveillance machine</h2>



<p>The US government has recognized three things about the tech giants:</p>



<ul>
<li>They all rely on tracking their users to generate revenue — and have become exceptionally good at it.</li>



<li>They are almost impossible to avoid if you spend any time online.</li>



<li>Most important, they cannot adopt encryption without undermining their business models.</li>
</ul>



<p>In 2024, a journalist for The Times of London <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/meta-user-data-collection-facebook-instagram-whatsapp-9klqhzlq9">requested her data from Meta<span>(new window)</span></a> to see exactly how much information it had on her. She got back 20,000 pages, including 20,000 interactions with websites and apps that weren’t even directly connected to her Meta accounts. Thanks to the Meta pixel and data-sharing agreements with banks, health apps, local governments, grocery stores, countless websites, and more, there was no window of her life Meta couldn’t see into — and rarely a day it didn’t receive her data.</p>



<p>This is just one service. <a href="https://proton.me/blog/apple-ad-company">Apple</a> and <a href="https://proton.me/blog/google-shows-more-ads">Google</a> hold similar amounts of data — if not more. These companies monitor your entire digital life, compiling a detailed profile that can be handed over at the government’s request or shared with a third party. Essentially, once one of these companies collects your information, you’ve completely lost control of who can see it.</p>



<p>Proponents argue that this is simply standard police work in the 21st century. Most data requests require a judge to approve a subpoena, and Big Tech companies can and do fight overly broad or unjustified requests when they can. However, even if you say that the 500,000 data requests made by the US government all followed due process, there are still hundreds of thousands of requests that were never reviewed by a judge that companies cannot fight at all.</p>



<h2>The US government can access this info with no oversight</h2>



<p>The FISA allows US intelligence agencies to request user data for national security purposes. These requests are issued with little oversight and cannot legally be refused. Some FISA requests, such as ones made using the <a href="https://proton.me/blog/us-warrantless-surveillance#section-702-loophole">Section 702</a> loophole, are never individually reviewed by a judge at all.</p>

<p>Since 2014, FISA content requests to Meta have increased 2,171%, while those to Google have risen 594%. Apple, though less transparent with its records, reported a 274% increase in such requests between 2018 and 2023.</p>



<h2>Big Tech is government’s partner<strong> </strong>in surveillance</h2>



<p>To be clear, we are not faulting Big Tech companies for complying with lawful, limited data requests. Every company must comply with the laws of the land that governs them. However, there are several issues at play. First, law enforcement agencies can use overly broad warrants to get access to reams of sensitive data. These “reverse warrants” (so named because law enforcement doesn’t need to specify a suspect), like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/google-is-giving-data-to-police-based-on-search-keywords-court-docs-show/">geofencing<span>(new window)</span></a> or <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/google-is-giving-data-to-police-based-on-search-keywords-court-docs-show/">search term warrants<span>(new window)</span></a>, let law enforcement see anyone who was in a specific area or who searched for a specific term in a given time period. Investigations that rely on this data routinely end up falsely identifying suspects, with innocent people being charged with crimes, including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/google-tracked-his-bike-ride-past-burglarized-home-made-him-n1151761">burglary<span>(new window)</span></a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/google-geofence-location-data-avondale-wrongful-arrest-molina-gaeta-11426374">murder<span>(new window)</span></a>. And certain FISA requests and <a href="https://proton.me/blog/us-warrantless-surveillance#national-security-letters">national security letters</a> let intelligence agencies or the FBI access data without any judicial oversight.</p>



<p>This brings us to the second problem. Big Tech companies know these abuses happen. Several of them even claim to care about your privacy. However, they cannot apply end-to-end encryption or even minimize user data collection without destroying their business models. In 2023, ads made up almost 98% of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/c7318154-f6ae-4866-89fa-f0c589f2ee3d.pdf">Meta’<span>(new window)</span></a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/c7318154-f6ae-4866-89fa-f0c589f2ee3d.pdf">s revenue<span>(new window)</span></a> and 77% of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abc.xyz/assets/52/88/5de1d06943cebc569ee3aa3a6ded/goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf">Alphabet<span>(new window)</span></a><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/c7318154-f6ae-4866-89fa-f0c589f2ee3d.pdf">’<span>(new window)</span></a>s (specifically Google Ads). While Apple’s ad revenue is relatively small, it’s already <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-advertising-google-search-services-filings-2024-5">larger than Snap or X’s ad revenue<span>(new window)</span></a>, and growing fast. To protect their users’ privacy, these companies would have to fundamentally change how they make money, which is not something they have ever shown any appetite for.</p>



<p>Until this happens, they’ll continue monitoring you, collecting tens of thousands of pages of your information each year. And governments will continue to help themselves to this information.</p>



<h2>Want to take control of your privacy?</h2>



<p>As ubiquitous as Big Tech is, there is another way. Proton is based in <a href="https://proton.me/blog/switzerland">Switzerland</a>, a country with strict privacy laws. We cannot act on a data request unless it has been approved by the Swiss authorities. Moreover, Proton’s <a href="https://proton.me/blog/what-is-end-to-end-encryption">end-to-end encryption</a> ensures that even if we receive a valid request, we cannot access the content of your messages, files, or other sensitive information.</p>



<p>Our mission is to build a better internet where privacy is the default. We require minimal data to set up an account and offer anonymous payment options. Transparency is key to our approach — we make all our apps <a href="https://proton.me/community/open-source">open source</a>, share who makes up our team, and publish all government data requests in our <a href="https://proton.me/legal/transparency">Transparency Report</a> (we update this annually in March).</p>



<p>Proton provides a safer alternative, ensuring that your data is protected by design. At a time when marginalized groups and individuals face increasing threats, choosing privacy-focused services has never been more important.</p>
