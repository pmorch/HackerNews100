<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="4189490c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					<p>A major political confrontation over online privacy is approaching as European governments prepare to decide on “<a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/eu-chat-control-2-0-experts-warn-against-encryption-surveillance-law">Chat Control 2.0,</a>” the European Commission’s revised proposal for monitoring private digital communications.</p>
<p>The plan, which could be endorsed behind closed doors, has drawn urgent warnings from Dr. Patrick Breyer, a jurist and former Member of the European Parliament, who says the draft conceals sweeping new surveillance powers beneath misleading language about “risk mitigation” and “child protection.”</p>
<p>In a release sent to Reclaim The Net, Breyer, long a defender of digital freedom, argues that the Commission has quietly reintroduced compulsory scanning of private messages after it was previously rejected.</p>
<p>He describes the move as a “deceptive sleight of hand,” insisting that it transforms a supposedly voluntary framework into a system that could compel all chat, email, and messaging providers to monitor users.</p>
<p>“This is a political deception of the highest order,” Breyer said.</p>
<p>“Following loud public protests, several member states, including <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/germany-rejects-eu-chat-control-law">Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Austria, said ‘No’</a> to indiscriminate Chat Control. Now it’s coming back through the back door disguised, more dangerous, and more comprehensive than ever. The public is being played for fools.”</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://docs.reclaimthenet.org/council-presidency-lewp-csa-r-presidency-compromise-texts-14092.pdf">new text</a>, providers would be obliged to take “all appropriate risk mitigation measures” to prevent abuse on their platforms. While the Commission presents this as a flexible safety requirement, Breyer insists it is a loophole that could justify forcing companies to scan every private message, including those protected by end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>“The loophole renders the much-praised removal of detection orders worthless and negates their supposed voluntary nature,” he said.</p>
<p>He warns that it could even lead to the introduction of “client-side scanning,” where users’ devices themselves perform surveillance before messages are sent.</p>
<p>Unlike the current temporary exemption known as “Chat Control 1.0,” which allows voluntary scanning of photos and videos, the new draft would open the door to text and metadata analysis. Algorithms and artificial intelligence could be deployed to monitor conversations and flag “suspicious” content.</p>
<p>Breyer notes that such automated scrutiny cannot interpret context and risks sweeping up ordinary exchanges. “No AI can reliably distinguish between a flirt, sarcasm, and criminal ‘grooming’,” he said. “Imagine your phone scanning every conversation with your partner, your daughter, your therapist, and leaking it just because the word ‘love’ or ‘meet’ appears somewhere. This is not child protection, this is a digital witch hunt.”</p>
<p>According to Breyer, the existing voluntary system has already proven flawed, with German police reporting that roughly half of all flagged cases turn out to be irrelevant.</p>
<p>The proposal also carries major implications for identity and anonymity online. A new requirement would force users to verify their age before creating accounts on messaging or email platforms, an obligation that would likely require official ID or biometric checks.</p>
<p>Breyer argues that such measures effectively abolish anonymous communication. “This is the de facto end of anonymous communication online, a disaster for whistleblowers, journalists, political activists, and people seeking help who rely on the protection of anonymity,” he said.</p>
<p>He also condemned the provision restricting minors under 16 from using messaging and social media platforms with chat functions. “Digital isolation instead of education, protection by exclusion instead of empowerment, this is paternalistic, out of touch with reality, and pedagogical nonsense,” he warned, saying the measure risks cutting young people off from key channels of social and educational interaction.</p>
<p>Breyer is calling on EU governments that previously resisted mass surveillance, among them Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Czechia, Luxembourg, Finland, Austria, and Estonia, to block the regulation in its current form.</p>
<p>“Now, these governments must show some backbone!” he urged. “Block this sham compromise in the Council and demand immediate corrections to save the fundamental rights of all citizens.”</p>
<p>He proposes a series of specific changes before any agreement should move forward: a guarantee that “risk mitigation” cannot be used to mandate scanning, a prohibition on AI-driven monitoring of text conversations, strict judicial oversight for targeted investigations, and the preservation of anonymous access to communication tools.</p>
<p>“They are selling us security but delivering a total surveillance machine,” Breyer concluded.</p>
<p>“They promise child protection but punish our children and criminalize privacy. This is not a compromise; this is a fraud against the citizen. And no democratic government should make itself an accomplice.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Bitchat is a new messaging app that allows users to chat securely with or without internet access. Download it today via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bitchat-mesh/id6748219622?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>App Store</u></a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitchat.droid&amp;ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>Google Play store</u></a> to begin communicating safely, even when connectivity disappears.</p><p><strong><u>Why Bitchat is needed</u></strong></p><p>Palestinians are dependent on Israel for their access to electricity, telecoms, and internet routing. Israel has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/world/middleeast/gaza-electricity.html?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>weaponized</u></a> this dependence in Gaza by deliberately causing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-says-full-internet-blackout-gaza-paralyzing-aid-operations-2025-06-12/?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>blackouts</u></a> that have left Palestinians cut off from communicating with each other or with the outside world. The relentless bombing campaign has also destroyed or severely crippled any remaining communication infrastructure.</p><p>Even when Palestinians use regular communication methods, their conversations and messages can be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>monitored and recorded</u></a>, leaving them exposed to surveillance and potential targeting.</p><p>The basic human right to communicate freely, and without interruption, has been denied to the Palestinian people.</p><p><strong><u>The solution</u></strong></p><p>Bitchat lets you keep messaging even when the internet or power is down. It connects phones directly through Bluetooth, and each phone helps pass messages along, allowing communication to stretch much farther than just your immediate area. Everything is fully encrypted so your conversations stay private.</p><p>When you do have internet or cell service, Bitchat can send your messages anywhere in the world using a network of relays. There is no central server that stores any of your data. You don’t need to create an account, share your phone number or email, or even have a SIM card to use it.</p><p><strong><u>Staying connected when all else fails</u></strong></p><p>Bitchat is an Israel-proof messaging alternative that continues to work even when traditional networks are shut down. The app also has “Geohash” channels that allows users to join location-based chats, so Palestinians can stay connected to their neighbors down the street or to the larger community in cities across the region.&nbsp;</p><p>This lets Palestinians check on the safety of loved ones, organize and coordinate within their communities, and share critical news and updates.</p><p><strong><u>Validated by T4P</u></strong></p><p>T4P has evaluated the app, testing it in various conditions, and looked at the technology and governance of the application. After this evaluation, T4P recognizes it as a secure and resilient communication tool for Palestinian communities when faced with internet disruptions or outages. In addition, Tech for Palestine community members are among BitChat’s top code contributors.</p><p>Bitchat has seen a surge in downloads in countries facing civil unrest like Nepal, Indonesia, Côte d'Ivoire, and most recently Madagascar. The Nepali government <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/09/11/jack-dorseys-bitchat-gains-traction-during-nepals-unrest/?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>blocked access</u></a> to all major social media platforms, forcing civilians to search for alternative methods of communication.</p><p>WhatsApp is known to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/05/22/whatsapp-security-vulnerability-meta-israel-palestine/?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>expose</u></a> <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/09/09/whatsapp-and-meta-accused-of-serious-security-breaches-by-former-executive_6745186_13.html?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>private</u></a> data, potentially to Israel – and these breaches have been used to <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240418-israel-using-metas-whatsapp-to-kill-palestinians-in-gaza-through-ai-system/?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>target Palestinians</u></a>. Communicating via WhatsApp or social media presents the risk of exposing private data, limiting free expression, and undermining user privacy. BitChat does not have the same vulnerabilities and does not allow Meta to help Israel surveil Palestinians.</p><p><strong><u>Get started</u></strong></p><p>You can start using Bitchat easily, without even creating an account.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.ctms.me/posts/2025-11-14-being-poor-or-being-broke/">https://blog.ctms.me/posts/2025-11-14-being-poor-or-being-broke/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45928912">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>The more I speak about being poor, the more I realize how fundamentally other folks misunderstand what it means to be poor versus being broke. The advice folks will give comes from a good place. However, I would like to give some examples to help everyone understand most advice from non-poor folks isn’t helpful.</p>
<p>Everyone has experienced being broke. Being broke sucks. You are watching every dollar spent, finding wayys to trim or make things stretch until the next payday. The difference is when you are broke you have <em>some money</em>. You can afford to put gas in your car, but not enough to do that repair. Money is tight, but you can get the basics at the grocery store. You can’t afford to go to the movies, but will stay home and watch what’s new on Netflix. Being broke sucks. You are watching every dollar spent, finding ways to trim or make things stretch until the next payday.</p>
<p>When you are poor that next payday brings no relief. It is like an endless runner game. No matter how fast you run or how high you jump you can never see the finish line. No matter how tired you are the ground keeps moving. There is no room for errors as the punishment for mistakes is astronomical. When you hit an obstacle you don’t restart from the last checkpoint, you go back to the beginning.</p>
<p>There is this mindset from folks that poor people must not be smart. I mean, you’re smart and you’re not poor! The problem must be a skill issue! Learn the skills to do it yourself and you’ll be able to pull yourself up.</p>
<p>The other mindset is poor people are lazy. Quit complaining and do it yourself!  Just get a better job! Get a second job! There’s money out there, you just have to go get it.</p>
<p>The last is these folks think they understand what it is like to be poor. Hey, I was a broke college student and I get being poor! I had a rough patch, it will pass.</p>
<p>Let’s start at the top.</p>
<p>I have a van that is falling apart. It needs a lot of work that we cannot afford to do. In the mindset that poor people are unskilled, it appears that I should watch some YouTube videos, get the parts, and do it myself. The misunderstanding is that being poor means you have tons and tons of skills. You have to fix everything yourself. There is never, I mean never, a time you can pay someone to fix it for you.</p>
<p>In this example folks think, “If the repair at the shop costs $1,000, but the parts cost $300, you can save a lot of money doing it yourself.” You are absolutely correct. Yet, I still need to be able to afford the $300 in parts.</p>
<p>Do you see the misunderstanding? I can’t make $300 appear out of thin air. I have the skills, I’ve had to fix all my cars myself. I’ve done complete engine rebuilds, I’ve replaced transmissions, I do all my own regular maintenance. The problem isn’t skills, its <em>money</em>. When you are broke, spending $300 instead of $1,000 sounds like a win because you can’t afford the $1,000. When you’re poor $300 might as well be $1,000 or $10,000, you will never afford it.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of time, either. I can’t put aside money each month and then get it. There is never money to put aside. I can’t put it on the credit card as I know I will never be able to pay it. I’ll just have this $300 debt looming over me, increasing with interest every month, mocking how much of a loser I am.</p>
<p>The second mindset: Being lazy.</p>
<p>How do I have the time to work multiple jobs when I’m doing all this extra work? How do I have the time when in my extra time I’m fixing cars, appliances, the roof, and cooking every meal from scratch?</p>
<p>Should I work a second job and never see my wife? My kids? Should I never have any personal time? Should my entire life revolve around money? Should I kill myself for capitalism?</p>
<p>Folks who say things like this have only ever experienced being broke. It is a temporary situation and a few months of extra income will solve the problem. Being poor is not missing $1,000 or $10,000 in the short term. It’s missing $40,000 a year, every year, forever. There is no short term relief. This isn’t a rough patch. It is The Pit in The Dark Knight Rises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There’s a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth… Hope. Every man who has rotted here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy… So simple… And like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned here that there can be no true despair without hope.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, it is possible to escape. Hell, two people have done it! Why can’t you do it! But you are completely ignoring how many people have fallen to their death trying.</p>
<p>All of the general guidance to escape being poor is actually advice for getting through being broke.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cancel Netflix</li>
<li>Make food at home</li>
<li>Stop going to Starbucks</li>
<li>Fix it yourself</li>
<li>Don’t upgrade your phone</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all things that will help you <em>temporarily</em>. It will help you get through a short period of being broke. Or it will help you get your spending under control. You have enough money, you just don’t spend it wisely.</p>
<p>Being poor is you already did all those things. You cancelled all your streaming services years ago. You make all your food from scratch all the time. You never go to fucking Starbucks. You fix everything yourself. You already stretch everything to the limit. That is how you have to live every day of your life, for eternity, with no relief in sight.</p>
<p>Last example and is pertinent to our times in the US. A lot of poor folks are having to stand in line for hours and hours to get food at a food bank due to goverment ineptitude. The advice to simply cook at home doesn’t fix that there isn’t any food at home.</p>
<p>Do you honestly think people standing in line at a food bank could fix their situation if they stopped getting DoorDash? Going to Starbucks? Fuck off. They weren’t doing that already.</p>
<p>How are they to get another job or put in extra hours if they have to stand in line for 3 hours to get food? Should they go without food until they get that job and the paycheck?</p>
<p>You need to step aside and think about the differences between being broke and being poor.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-60909">

		<p>Mozilla is developing a built‑in AI assistant for Firefox that will be offered as a third browsing mode alongside Normal and Private tabs. They’re calling it “Window AI.”</p>
<p>Details are still scarce. Based on Mozilla’s <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/ai-window/">official announcement</a> on Thursday (13<sup>th</sup>), it looks like a deeper implementation than the existing sidebar that gives access to third‑party chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.). The post stresses the feature will be opt-in and that the user “is in control.”</p>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.firefox.com/en-US/ai/">waitlist</a> to try the feature and a Mozilla forum thread inviting people to “help shape” the initiative.</p>
<figure id="attachment_60904" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-60904"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/manualdousuario.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/window-ai-firefox.png?resize=320%2C271&amp;ssl=1" alt="Illustration showing Firefox’s three modes/windows: normal, “Window AI” and private window." width="320" height="271"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-60904">Image: Mozilla.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s safe to say that the people who volunteered to “shape” the initiative <a href="https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/building-ai-the-firefox-way-shaping-what-s-next-together/td-p/109922">want it dead and buried</a>. Of the 52 responses at the time of writing, *all* rejected the idea and asked Mozilla to stop shoving AI features into Firefox.</p>
<p>I don’t know whether the negative reactions reflect the majority of Firefox users or are just a noisy minority. Mozilla, after all, likely has a clearer view of the whole user base.</p>
<p>What strikes me as odd is the decision to position itself as just <a href="https://manualdousuario.net/en/web-browsers-ai-assistants/">another AI‑enabled web browser</a>, picking a fight with big techs and better‑funded startups whose users are less hostile (and sometimes enthusiastic) about adding AI to web browsing.</p>
<p>Mozilla seems to be trying to wedge itself between those who reject AI and those who want generative‑AI features in the browser — trying to please everyone — as this excerpt from the post shows:</p>
<blockquote><p>We see a lot of promise in AI browser features making your online experience smoother, more helpful, and free from the everyday disruptions that break your flow. But browsers made by AI companies ask you to make a hard choice — either use AI all the time or don’t use it at all.</p>
<p>We’re focused on making the best browser, which means recognizing that everyone has different needs. For some, AI is part of everyday life. For others, it’s useful only occasionally. And many are simply curious about what it can offer, but unsure where to start.</p>
<p>Regardless of your choice, with Firefox, you’re in control.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those unhappy have another option: use an AI‑free Firefox fork such as <a href="https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a>, <a href="https://www.waterfox.net/">Waterfox</a>, or <a href="https://zen-browser.app/">Zen Browser</a>.</p>

<p>
  <i>
    <time datetime="2025-11-14">
      14 Nov 2025
    </time>
  </i>
</p>
<p>Reading <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/460331/empire-of-ai-by-hao-karen/9780241678923"><em>Empire of AI</em> by Karen Hao</a>, I was struck by how people associated with OpenAI <em>believe</em> in AGI. They really do think someone, perhaps them, will build AGI, and that it will lead to either the flourishing or destruction of humanity.</p>
<p>Elon Musk founded OpenAI because he thought Demis Hassabis was an evil genius who would build AGI first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Musk would regularly characterise Hassabis as a supervillain who needed to be stopped. Musk would make unequivocally clear that OpenAI was the good to DeepMind’s evil. … “He literally made a video game where an evil genius tries to create AI to take over the world,” Musk shouted [at an OpenAI off-site], referring to Hassabis’s 2004 title <em>Evil Genius</em>, “and fucking people don’t see it. Fucking people don’t see it! And Larry [Page]? Larry thinks he controls Demis but he’s too busy fucking windsurfing to realize that Demis is gathering the power.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OpenAI’s co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever regularly told audiences and employees to “feel the AGI”. At a company off-site in Yosemite in September 2022, employees gathered around a firepit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the pit, [Sutskever] had placed a wooden effigy that he’d commissioned from a local artist, and began a dramatic performance. This effigy, he explained represented a good, aligned AGI that OpenAI had built, only to discover it was actually lying and deceitful. OpenAI’s duty, he said, was to destroy it. … Sutskever doused the effigy in lighter fluid and lit on fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s remarkable that what was until recently sci-fi fantasy has become a mainstream view in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Hao writes that GPT-2 was a bet on the “pure language” hypothesis, that asserts that since we communicate through language, then AGI should emerge from training a model solely on language. This is contrast to the “grounding” hypothesis, that asserts an AGI needs to perceive the world. Successfully scaling GPT to GPT-2 convinced enough people at OpenAI that the pure language hypothesis was valid. They just needed more data, more model parameters, and more compute.</p>
<p>So the belief in AGI, plus the recent results from LLMs, necessitates scaling, and justifies building data centres that <a href="https://restofworld.org/2024/data-centers-environmental-issues/">consume hundreds of litres of water a second</a>, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/08/xai_turbines_colossus/">run on polluting gas generators because the grid can’t supply the power</a> (<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/01/microsoft_openai_5gw_dc/">and might use as much power as entire cities</a>), driving up CO2 emissions from manufacture and operation of new hardware,&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/chatgpt-openai-content-abusive-sexually-explicit-harassment-kenya-workers-on-human-workers-cf191483">exploits and traumatises data workers</a> to make sure ChatGPT doesn’t generate outputs like child sexual abuse material and hate speech or encourage users to self-harm. (The thirst for data is so great that they stopped curating training data and instead consume the internet, warts and all, and manage the model output using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback">RLHF</a>.)</p>
<p>And this is all fine, because they’re going to make AGI and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">expected value</a> (EV) of it will be huge! (Briefly, the argument goes that if there is a 0.001% chance of AGI delivering an extremely large amount of value, and 99.999% chance of much less or zero value, then the EV is still extremely large because <code>(0.001% * very_large_value) + (99.999% * small_value) = very_large_value</code>).</p>
<p>But AGI arguments based on EV are nonsensical because the values and probabilities are made up and unfalsifiable. They also ignore externalities like environmental damage, which in contrast to AGI, have known negative value and certain probability: costs borne by everyone else right now.</p>
<p>As a technologist I want to solve problems effectively (by bringing about the desired, correct result), efficiently (with minimal waste) and without harm (to people or the environment).</p>
<p>LLMs-as-AGI fail on all three fronts. The computational profligacy of LLMs-as-AGI is dissatisfying, and the exploitation of data workers and the environment unacceptable. Instead, if we drop the AGI fantasy, we can evaluate LLMs and other generative models as solutions for specific problems, rather than <em>all</em> problems, with proper cost benefit analysis. For example, by using smaller purpose-built generative models, or even discriminative (non-generative) models. In other words, make trade-offs and actually do engineering.</p>

<p id="15905113-780b-45b9-973e-ebd4fcdffa94">The launch of Nvidia's Vera Rubin platform for AI and HPC next year could mark significant changes in the AI hardware supply chain as Nvidia plans to ship its partners fully assembled Level-10 (L10) VR200 compute trays with all compute hardware, cooling systems, and interfaces pre-installed, according to J.P. Morgan (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1988821744476688410" target="_blank" data-url="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1988821744476688410" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link">@Jukanlosreve</a>). The move would leave major ODMs with very little design or integration work, making their lives easier, but would also trim their margins in favor of Nvidia's. The information remains unofficial at this stage.</p><p>Starting with the VR200 platform, Nvidia is reportedly preparing to take over production of fully built L10 compute trays with a pre-installed Vera CPU, Rubin GPUs, and a cooling system instead of allowing hyperscalers and ODM partners to build their own motherboards and cooling solutions. This would not be the first time the company has supplied its partners with a partially integrated server sub-assembly: it did so with its GB200 platform when it supplied the whole Bianca board with key components pre-installed. However, at the time, this could be considered as L7 – L8 integration, whereas now the company is reportedly considering going all the way to L10, selling the whole tray assembly — including accelerators, CPU, memory, NICs, power-delivery hardware, midplane interfaces, and liquid-cooling cold plates — as a pre-built, tested module.</p><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-Y3LG2dFhTnAx5ob7hkrRGF-mgegWfHHM1h56TlfWnMKmBOk64IMu0xv"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div><picture data-hydrate="true"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" alt="Nvidia" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-normal="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"></picture></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nvidia/YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p id="0714a889-dac0-4681-bc70-1dc4e0bcd901">This move promises to shorten the ramp for VR200 as Nvidia's partners will not have to design everything in-house and could lower production costs due to the volume of scale ensured by a direct contract between Nvidia and an EMS (most likely Foxconn as the primary supplier and then Quanta and Wistron, but that is speculation). For example, a Vera Rubin Superchip board recently demonstrated by Jensen Huang uses a very complex design, a very thick PCB, and only solid-state components. Designing such a board takes time and costs a lot of money, so using select EMS provider(s) to build it makes a lot of sense.</p><p>J.P. Morgan reportedly mentions the increase in power consumption of one Rubin GPU from 1.4 kW (Blackwell Ultra) to 1.8 kW (R200) and even 2.3 kW (a previously unannounced TDP for an allegedly unannounced SKU (Nvidia declined a <em>Tom's Hardware </em>request for comment on the matter) and increased cooling requirements as one of the motivations for moving to supply the whole tray instead of individual components. However, we know from reported supply chain sources that various OEMs and ODMs, as well as hyperscalers like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a>, are experimenting with very advanced cooling systems, including immersion and embedded cooling, which underscores their experience.</p><p>However, Nvidia's partners will shift from being system designers to becoming system integrators, installers, and support providers.

<p>Every quarter, Drive Stats gives us the numbers. This quarter, it gave us a crisis of meaning. What does it really mean for a hard drive to fail? Is it the moment the lights go out, or the moment we decide they have? Philosophers might call that an ontological gray area. We just call it Q3.</p>



<p>As of June 30, 2025, we had 332,915 drives under management. Of that total, there were 3,970 boot drives and 328,348 data drives. Let’s dig into our stats, then talk about the meaning of failure.</p>

<h2>Q3 2025 hard drive failure rates</h2>



<p>During Q3 2025, we were tracking 328,348 storage drives. Here are the numbers:&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Notes and observations</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>The failure rate has increased: </strong>The failure rate has changed, and by quite a bit. As a reminder, last quarter’s AFR was 1.36% compared with this quarter’s 1.55%. (Interestingly, the <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-drive-stats-for-2024/">2024 yearly AFR</a> was 1.57%.)&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>That new drive energy: </strong>Say hello to the 24TB Toshiba MG11ACA24TE, joining the drive pool with 2,400 drives and 24,148 drive days. That means that we’ve hit the thresholds for the quarterly stats, but not the lifetime.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>The zero failure club: </strong>It was a big month for the zero failure club, with four drives making the cut:
<ul>
<li>Seagate HMS5C4040BLE640 (4TB)</li>



<li>Seagate ST8000NM000A (8TB)</li>



<li>Toshiba MG09ACA16TE (16TB)</li>



<li>Toshiba MG11ACA24TE (24TB)—and yes, that’s the new drive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>For those of you tracking the stats closely, you’ll notice that the Seagate ST8000NM000A (8TB) is a frequent flier on this list. The last time it had a failure was in <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-drive-stats-for-q3-2024/">Q3 2024</a>—and it was just a single failure for the whole quarter!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The highest AFRs were </strong><strong><em>really</em></strong><strong> high: </strong>The high end was so high that this month, it inspired us to run an outlier analysis using the standard quartile analysis (Tukey method). Based on that information, any drive with a quarterly AFR higher than 5.88% is an outlier, and there are three:
<ul>
<li>Seagate ST10000NM0086 (10TB): 7.97%</li>



<li>Seagate ST14000NM0138 (14TB): 6.86%</li>



<li>Toshiba MG08ACA16TEY (16TB): 16.95%</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>What’s going on there? Great question, and we’ll get into that after the lifetime failure rates.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Lifetime hard drive failure rates</h2>



<p>To be considered for the lifetime review, a drive model was required to have 500 or more drives as of the end of Q2 2025 and have over 100,000 accumulated drive days during their lifetime. When we removed those drive models which did not meet the lifetime criteria, we had drives grouped into 27 models remaining for analysis as shown in the table below.</p>

<h3>Notes and observations</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>That lifetime AFR is pretty consistent, isn’t it? </strong>The lifetime AFR is 1.31%. Last quarter we reported that it was 1.30%, and the quarter before that, it was 1.31%.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>The 4TB average age hasn’t shifted: </strong>As we’ve reported on previously, the 4TB drives are being decommissioned over time. Now, we’re down to just a handful left—just 11 of the ALE models and 187 of the BLE models. But, because their lifetime populations are so comparatively large, the additional drive days aren’t enough to move the needle on the average age in months. So, no ghosts in the machine here, and decommissioning is proceeding as planned.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Steady uptick in higher capacity drives</strong>: Of the 20TB+ drives that meet our lifetime data parameters, we’ve added 7,936 since last quarter. And, don’t forget that our newest entrée to the cohort, the Toshiba MG11ACA24TE (24TB), hasn’t made its way to this table yet—that adds an additional 2,400 drive models. All together, the 20TB+ club represents 67,939 drives, or about 21% of the drive pool.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Defining a failure—from a technical perspective</h2>



<p>A question that’s come up a few times when we’re hosting a webinar or chatting in the comments section is how we define a failure. While it may seem intuitive, it’s actually something of a meaty conundrum, and something we haven’t addressed since the early days of this series. Tracking down the answer to this question touches internal drive fleet monitoring tools (via SMART stats), the actual Drive Stats collection program, and our data engineering layer. I’ll dig into each of these in detail, then we’ll take a look at the outliers for this quarter.</p>



<h3>SMART stats reporting&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We use <a href="https://www.smartmontools.org/">Smartmontools</a> to collect the SMART attributes of drives, and another monitoring tool called drive sentinel to flag read/write errors that exceed a certain threshold as well as some other anomalies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main indicator we use for determining if a drive should be replaced is when it responds to reads with uncorrectable medium errors. When a drive reads the data from the disk, but the data fails its integrity check, the drive will try to reconstruct the data using internal error correction codes. If it is unable to reconstruct the data, it notifies the host by reporting it as an uncorrectable error and marks that part of the disk as pending reallocation, which shows up in SMART under an attribute like <code>Current_Pending_Sector</code>.</p>



<p>On Storage Pods that control drives through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA">SATA</a> links, the drive sentinel will count the number of these uncorrectable errors a drive reports and if it exceeds a threshold, access to the drive will be removed. This is important in the classic Backblaze Storage Pods where five drives share a single SATA link and errors by one drive will affect all drives on the link.</p>



<p>On Dell and SMCI pods that use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Attached_SCSI">SAS</a> topology to connect drives, drive sentinel doesn’t remove access to drives because the errors are reported differently; but, that’s also not as critical since SAS minimizes the impact that a problem disk can have on others.</p>



<h3>The Drive Stats program&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We’ve talked about the <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/overload-to-overhaul-how-we-upgraded-drive-stats-data/">custom program</a> we use to collect Drive Stats in the past, and here’s a quick recap:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The podstats generator runs on every Storage Pod, what we call any host that holds customer data, every few minutes. It’s a C++ program that collects SMART stats and a few other attributes, then converts them into an .xml file (“podstats”). Those are then pushed to a central host in each datacenter and bundled. Once the data leaves these central hosts, it has entered the domain of what we will call Drive Stats.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For this program, the logic is relatively simple: A failure in Drive Stats occurs when a drive vanishes out of the reporting population. It is considered “failed” until it shows up again. Drives are tracked by serial number and we report daily logs on a per-drive basis, so truly, we can get pretty granular here.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The data engineering layer</h3>



<p>To recap, we’ve collected our SMART stats and compiled them with the podstats program. Now we’ve got all the information, and data intelligence needs to add the context. A drive may go offline for a day or so (not return a response to those tools that collect daily logs of SMART stats), but it could be something as simple as a loose cable. So, time-wise, if a drive reappears after one day or 30, at what point in that period of time do we classify it as an official failure?</p>



<p>Previously, we manually cross-referenced data center work tickets, but these days, we’ve automated that process. On the backend, it’s a SQL query, but in human speak, this is what it comes down to:</p>



<ol>
<li>If a drive logs data on the last day of the selection period (which in this case is a quarter) then it has not failed.</li>



<li>There are three human-curated tables that the query cross references. If a drive serial number appears on one of them, it tells us whether there’s a failure or not (depending on the table’s function).&nbsp;</li>



<li>If the drive serial number is the primary serial number in a drive replacement Jira ticket then it has failed. (Jira is where we track our data center work tickets.)</li>



<li>If the drive serial number is the target serial number in a clone Jira ticket or a (temp) replacement ticket, then it has not failed.</li>
</ol>



<p>Basically, when we go to write the Drive Stats reports at the end of the quarter, if a drive has either appeared in one of our various work trackers or hasn’t re-entered the population, then it’s considered failed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In rare instances, that can mean that we have so-called “cosmetic” failures when we have some work we’re doing on a drive model that lasts more than that quarterly collection period. And, spoiler, we have one of those instances that showed up in the data this month—our outlier Toshiba drive with the 16.9% failure rate. We’ll dig in in just a minute; but first, some context.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Connecting drive failure to overall picture of the drive pool&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As we mentioned above, certain drives in the pool had such high swings in AFR that we ended up running an outlier analysis using the quartile method. (It’s also worth mentioning that a cluster analysis could potentially be a better fit, but we can save that for another day.) Based on that analysis, anything that has above a 5.88% failure rate is an outlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The primary motivation was inspired by an attempt to visualize the relationship between the age in months of a drive versus this quarter’s AFRs.&nbsp;</p>

<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;6917570b8731b&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="489" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Age-in-months-vs.-quarterly-failure-rates-1-2-1024x489.png" alt="A scatter plot that shows the relationship between the age in months of a drive versus this quarter’s AFRs" srcset="https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Age-in-months-vs.-quarterly-failure-rates-1-2-1024x489.png 1024w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Age-in-months-vs.-quarterly-failure-rates-1-2-300x143.png 300w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Age-in-months-vs.-quarterly-failure-rates-1-2-768x367.png 768w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Age-in-months-vs.-quarterly-failure-rates-1-2.png 1072w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>We’re interested, really, in the shape of the relationship. If we posit that the older drives get, the higher their failure rates, you’d expect a larger concentration in the top right quadrant. But, our data follows a much more interesting pattern than that, with most of our data points concentrated in the lowest regions of the graph regardless of age—something you’d expect from a set of data that reflects a bunch of smart folks actively working towards the goal of a healthy drive population.&nbsp;And yet, we have some data points that break the mold. </p>



<p>As is pretty intuitive to my business intelligence folks in the audience, the process of identifying outliers is actionable data as well. Just like all press is good press; in our world, more data is more better. So, let’s take a closer look at those outliers. As a reminder, that’s these three drive models:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Seagate ST10000NM0086 (10TB): 7.97%</li>



<li>Seagate ST14000NM0138 (14TB): 6.86%</li>



<li>Toshiba MG08ACA16TEY (16TB): 16.95%</li>
</ul>



<h3>Seagate ST10000NM0086 (10TB)</h3>



<p>This drive has some pretty explainable factors for the high failure rate. It’s well over seven years old (92.35 months). And, since it only has 1,018 drive models in operation, single failures hold a lot of weight compared with the average drive count per model—which comes in at 10,952 if you use the mean of this quarterly data and 6,177 if you use the median.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you can see that borne out in the trend in the last year of data:&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;6917570b87966&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="648" height="337" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Seagate-ST10000NM0086-10TB.png" alt="A chart showing the failure rates for drive model Seagate-ST10000NM0086-10TB for the last year. " srcset="https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Seagate-ST10000NM0086-10TB.png 648w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Seagate-ST10000NM0086-10TB-300x156.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px"></figure></div>


<h3>Seagate ST14000NM0138 (14TB)</h3>



<p>This drive is nearing five years in age (56.57 months) and, again, has a lower drive count at 1,286. More importantly, this particular drive model has had historically high failure rates. In parallel with above, here’s the last year of quarterly failure rates:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;6917570b8809b&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="648" height="321" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Seagate-ST14000NM0138-14TB.png" alt="A chart showing the failure rates for the drive model Seagate-ST14000NM0138-14TB for the last year." srcset="https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Seagate-ST14000NM0138-14TB.png 648w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Seagate-ST14000NM0138-14TB-300x149.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px"></figure></div>


<h3>Toshiba MG08ACA16TEY (16TB)</h3>



<p>Finally, our Toshiba model is the most interesting of all. It’s less than four years old (44.61 months), and has 5,145 drives in the pool. And, this quarter is clearly a change from its normal, decent, AFRs.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;6917570b885ad&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="520" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Toshiba-MG08ACA16TEY-16TB-1-1-1024x520.png" alt="A line graph of the Toshiba MG08ACA16TEY failure rates from Q3 2024 to Q3 2025" srcset="https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Toshiba-MG08ACA16TEY-16TB-1-1-1024x520.png 1024w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Toshiba-MG08ACA16TEY-16TB-1-1-300x152.png 300w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Toshiba-MG08ACA16TEY-16TB-1-1-768x390.png 768w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Toshiba-MG08ACA16TEY-16TB-1-1.png 1151w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>When we see deviations like this one, it’s usually an indication that there’s something afoot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Never fear, Drive Stats fans; this was a known quantity before we went on this journey. This past quarter, working with Toshiba, we deployed some firmware updates they provided to optimize performance on these drives. Because we needed to pull drives to achieve this in some cases, we had an abnormal number of “failed” drives in this population.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What that means for <em>this </em>drive is that it’s actually not a bad drive model; and, given the ways we and Toshiba have worked together on a fix, we should see failure rates normalizing in the near future. And, this also goes back to our conversation of defining a failure—in this case, while the drives “failed,” the failure wasn’t mechanical and <em>was </em>based on something that we’ll be able to fix without replacing the drives. In short, don’t sweat the spike and pay attention to the long arc of performance on this population. We expect to see those drives happy and spinning for years to come (and with better performance, too).&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let’s talk about memory management!  Following up on my article about <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2023/12/07/the-last-5-years-of-v8s-garbage-collector">5 years of developments in V8’s garbage
collector</a>, today I’d like to bring that up to date with what went down in V8’s GC over the last couple years.</p><h3>methodololology</h3><p>I selected all of the commits to <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/heap/"><tt>src/heap</tt></a> since my previous roundup.
There were 1600 of them, including reverts and relands.  I read all of
the commit logs, some of the changes, some of the linked bugs, and any
design document I could get my hands on.  From what I can tell, there
have been about 4 FTE from Google over this period, and the commit rate
is fairly constant.  There are very occasional patches from Igalia,
Cloudflare, Intel, and Red Hat, but it’s mostly a Google affair.</p><p>Then, by the very rigorous process of, um, just writing things down and
thinking about it, I see three big stories for V8’s GC over this time,
and I’m going to give them to you with some made-up numbers for how much
of the effort was spent on them.  Firstly, the effort to improve memory
safety via the sandbox: this is around 20% of the time.  Secondly, the
Oilpan odyssey: maybe 40%.  Third, preparation for multiple JavaScript
and WebAssembly mutator threads: 20%.  Then there are a number of lesser
side quests: heuristics wrangling (10%!!!!), and a long list of
miscellanea.  Let’s take a deeper look at each of these in turn.</p><h3>the sandbox</h3><p>There was a nice blog post in June last year summarizing the <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/sandbox">sandbox
effort</a>: basically, the goal is to prevent
user-controlled writes from corrupting memory outside the JavaScript
heap.  We start from the assumption that the user is
somehow able to obtain a write-anywhere primitive, and we work to mitigate
the effect of such writes.  The most fundamental way is to reduce the
range of addressable memory, notably by encoding pointers as 32-bit
offsets and then ensuring that no host memory is within the addressable
virtual memory that an attacker can write.  The sandbox also uses some
40-bit offsets for references to larger objects, with similar
guarantees.  (Yes, a sandbox really does reserve a terabyte of virtual memory).</p><p>But there are many, many details.  Access to external objects is
intermediated via type-checked <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2024/05/13/partitioning-pitfalls-for-generational-collectors">external pointer
tables</a>.
Some objects that should never be directly referenced by user code go in
a separate “trusted space”, which is outside the sandbox.  Then you have
read-only spaces, used to allocate data that might be shared between
different isolates, <a href="https://dbezhetskov.dev/multi-sandboxes/">you might want multiple
cages</a>, there are “shared”
variants of the other spaces, for use in shared-memory multi-threading,
executable code spaces with embedded object references, and so on and so
on.  Tweaking, elaborating, and maintaining all of these details has
taken a lot of V8 GC developer time.</p><p>I think it has paid off, though, because the new development is that <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/350324877">V8
has managed to turn on hardware memory protection for the
sandbox</a>: sandboxed code
is prevented by the hardware from writing memory outside the sandbox.</p><p>Leaning into the “attacker can write anything in their address space”
threat model has led to some funny patches.  For example, sometimes code
needs to check flags about the page that an object is on, as part of a
write barrier.  So some GC-managed metadata needs to be in the sandbox.
However, the garbage collector itself, which is outside the sandbox,
can’t trust that the metadata is valid.  We end up having two copies of
state in some cases: in the sandbox, for use by sandboxed code, and
outside, for use by the collector.</p><p>The best and most amusing instance of this phenomenon is related to
integers.  <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Integer_Types">Google’s style guide recommends signed integers by
default</a>,
so you end up with on-heap data structures with <tt>int32_t len</tt> and such.
But if an attacker overwrites a length with a negative number, there are
a couple funny things that can happen.  The first is a <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/425896305">sign-extending
conversion to <tt>size_t</tt> by run-time
code</a>, which can lead to
sandbox escapes.  The other is <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5335156">mistakenly concluding that an object is
small, because its length is less than a limit, because it is
unexpectedly
negative</a>.
Good times!</p><h3>oilpan</h3><p>It took 10 years for Odysseus to get back from Troy, which is about as
long as it has taken for conservative stack scanning to make it from
<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8/+/main/include/cppgc/README.md">Oilpan</a>
into V8 proper.  Basically, Oilpan is garbage collection for C++ as used
in Blink and Chromium.  Sometimes it runs when the stack is empty; then
it can be precise.  But sometimes it runs when there might be references
to GC-managed objects on the stack; in that case it runs conservatively.</p><p>Last time I <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2023/12/07/the-last-5-years-of-v8s-garbage-collector">described how V8 would like to add support for generational
garbage collection to
Oilpan</a>,
but that for that, you’d need a way to promote objects to the old
generation that is compatible with the ambiguous references visited by
conservative stack scanning.  I thought V8 had a chance at success with
their new <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2023/12/08/v8s-mark-sweep-nursery">mark-sweep
nursery</a>,
but that seems to have turned out to be a lose relative to the copying
nursery.  They even tried <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2022/10/22/the-sticky-mark-bit-algorithm">sticky mark-bit generational
collection</a>,
but it <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/333906585">didn’t work out</a>.
Oh well; one good thing about Google is that they seem willing to try
projects that have uncertain payoff, though I hope that the hackers
involved came through their OKR reviews with their mental health intact.</p><p>Instead, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UHe6Ac60lnOshlgfP4XG6GXeh7szqbxPl4uu1x4i1EY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.n1atlriavj6v">V8 added support for pinning to the Scavenger copying nursery
implementation</a>.
If a page has incoming ambiguous edges, it will be placed in a kind of
quarantine area for a while.  I am not sure what the difference is
between a quarantined page, which logically belongs to the nursery, and
a pinned page from the mark-compact old-space; they seem to require
similar treatment.  In any case, we seem to have settled into a design
that was mostly the same as before, but in which any given page can opt
out of evacuation-based collection.</p><p>What do we get out of all of this?  Well, not only can we get
generational collection for Oilpan, but also we unlock cheaper, less
bug-prone <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/42203211">“direct
handles”</a> in V8 itself.</p><p>The funny thing is that I don’t think any of this is shipping yet; or,
if it is, it’s only in a <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/chrome-finch">Finch
trial</a> to a
minority of users or something.  I am looking forward in interest to
seeing a post from upstream V8 folks; <a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/studentTheses/retro-fitting-conservative-garbage-collection/">whole doctoral theses have been
written on this
topic</a>,
and it would be a delight to see some actual numbers.</p><h3>shared-memory multi-threading</h3><p>JavaScript implementations have had the luxury of a single-threadedness:
with just one mutator, garbage collection is a lot simpler.  But this is
ending.  I don’t know what the state of <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-structs">shared-memory multi-threading
is in JS</a>, but in WebAssembly
it <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/shared-everything-threads">seems to be moving
apace</a>, and
Wasm uses the JS GC.  Maybe I am overstating the effort here—probably it
doesn’t come to 20%—but <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/42204563">wiring this up has been a whole
thing</a>.</p><p>I will mention just one patch here that I found to be funny.  So with
pointer compression, an object’s fields are mostly 32-bit words, with
the exception of 64-bit doubles, so we can reduce the alignment on most
objects to 4 bytes.  <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40644235">V8 has had a bug open forever about alignment of
double-holding objects</a>
that it mostly ignores via unaligned loads.</p><p>Thing is, if you have an object visible to multiple threads, and that
object might have a 64-bit field, then the field should be 64-bit
aligned to prevent tearing during atomic access, which usually means the
object should be 64-bit aligned.  <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6540510">That is now the
case</a> for
Wasm structs and arrays in the shared space.</p><h3>side quests</h3><p>Right, we’ve covered what to me are the main stories of V8’s GC over the
past couple years.  But let me mention a few funny side quests that I
saw.</p><h4>the heuristics two-step</h4><p>This one I find to be hilariousad.  Tragicomical.  Anyway I am amused.
So any real GC has a bunch of heuristics: when to promote an object or a
page, when to kick off incremental marking, how to use background
threads, when to grow the heap, how to choose whether to make a minor or
major collection, when to aggressively reduce memory, how much virtual
address space can you reasonably reserve, what to do on hard
out-of-memory situations, how to account for off-heap mallocated memory,
how to compute whether concurrent marking is going to finish in time or if you need to pause... and V8 needs to do
this all in all its many configurations, with pointer compression off or
on, on desktop, high-end Android, low-end Android, iOS where everything
is weird, something called Starboard which is apparently part of Cobalt
which is apparently a whole new platform that Youtube uses to show
videos on set-top boxes, on machines with different memory models and
operating systems with different interfaces, and on and on and on.
Simply tuning the system appears to involve a dose of science, a dose of
flailing around and trying things, and a whole cauldron of witchcraft.
There appears to be one person whose full-time job it is to implement
and monitor metrics on V8 memory performance and implement appropriate
tweaks.  Good grief!</p><h4>mutex mayhem</h4><p>Toon Verwaest noticed that V8 was exhibiting many more context switches
on MacOS than Safari, and identified V8’s use of platform mutexes as the
problem.  So he rewrote them to use
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/os_unfair_lock"><tt>os_unfair_lock</tt></a>
on MacOS.  Then <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/384940357">implemented adaptive locking on all
platforms</a>.
Then... <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6175168">removed it all and switched to
abseil</a>.</p><p>Personally, I am delighted to see this patch series, I wouldn’t have
thought that there was juice to squeeze in V8’s use of locking.  It
gives me hope that I will find a place to do the same in one of my
projects :)</p><h4>ta-ta, third-party heap</h4><p>It used to be that <a href="https://mmtk.io/">MMTk</a> was trying to get a number of
production language virtual machines to support abstract APIs so that
MMTk could slot in a garbage collector implementation.  Though this
seems to work with OpenJDK, with V8 I think the churn rate and
laser-like focus on the browser use-case makes an interstitial API
abstraction a lose.  V8 <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5797605">removed it a little more than a year
ago</a>.</p><h3>fin</h3><p>So what’s next?  I don’t know; it’s been a while since I have been to Munich to drink from the source.  That said, shared-memory multithreading and <a href="https://wasmfx.dev/">wasm effect handlers</a> will extend the memory management hacker’s full employment act indefinitely, not to mention actually landing and shipping conservative stack scanning.  There is a lot to be done in non-browser V8 environments, whether in Node or on the edge, but it is admittedly harder to read the future than the past.</p><p>In any case, it was fun taking this look back, and perhaps I will have the opportunity to do this again
in a few years.  Until then, happy hacking!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - <em>RegreSQL brings PostgreSQL's regression testing methodology to your application queries, catching both correctness bugs and performance regressions before production.</em></p>
<p>As puzzling as it might seem, the common problem with production changes is the ever-present "AHA" moment when things start slowing down or crashing straight away. Testing isn't easy as it is, but there's a widespread practice gap when it comes to testing SQL queries. Some might pretend to "fix it" by using ORMs to abstract away the problem. Others treat SQL as "just glue code" that doesn't deserve systematic testing. Most settle for integration tests that verify the application layer works, never actually testing whether their queries will survive the next schema change or index modification.</p>
<p>For PostgreSQL development itself, the project has a robust regression test suite that has been preventing disasters in core development for decades. The database itself knows how to test SQL systematically - we just don't use those same techniques for our own queries. Enter <a href="https://github.com/boringSQL/regresql">RegreSQL</a>, a tool originally created by Dimitri Fontaine for <a href="https://theartofpostgresql.com/"><em>The Art of PostgreSQL</em></a> book (which is excellent for understanding and mastering PostgreSQL as a database system), designed to bring the same regression testing framework to our application queries.</p>
<p>I've been trying to use it for some time, but due to missing features and limitations gave up several times. Until now. I decided to fork the project and spend the time needed to take it to the next level.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction
</h2>
<p>The <strong>RegreSQL</strong> promise starts with the biggest strength and perceived weakness of SQL queries. They are just strings. And unless you use something like <a href="https://sqlc.dev/">sqlc</a> (for Go), <a href="https://github.com/darioteixeira/pgocaml">PG'OCaml</a> or Rust's <a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx">SQLx</a> toolkit giving you compile-time checking, your queries are validated only when they are executed. Which in better case mean either usually slow-ish test suite or integration tests, in worst scenario only when deployed. ORMs are another possibility - completely abstracting away SQL (but more on that later).</p>
<p>But even with compile-time checking, you are only checking for one class of problems: schema mismatches. What about behavior changes after schema migration or performance regressions? What about understanding whether your optimization actually made things faster or just moved the problem elsewhere?</p>
<p>This is where RegreSQL comes in. Rather than trying to turn SQL into something else, RegreSQL embraces "SQL as strings" reality and applies the same testing methodology PostgreSQL itself uses: regression testing. You write (or generate - continue reading) your SQL queries, provide input data, and RegreSQL verifies that future changes don't break those expectations.</p>
<p>The features don't stop there though - it tracks performance baselines, detects common query plan regressions (like sequential scans), and gives you framework for systematic experimentation with the schema changes and query change management.</p>

<p>Enough with theory. Let's jump in straight into the action and see what a sample run of RegreSQL looks like</p>
<pre><code><span>$ regresql text
</span><span>Connecting to 'postgres://radim:password123@192.168.139.28/cdstore_test'… ✓
</span><span>
</span><span>Running regression tests...
</span><span>

</span><span>✓ album-by-artist_list-albums-by-artist.2.json (0.00s)

</span><span>✓ genre-tracks_tracks-by-genre.json (0.00s)
</span><span>
</span><span>Results: 8 passed, 0 failed, 8 skipped (0.00s)
</span></code></pre>
<p>In this example based on <a href="https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database">Chinook database</a> (as used originally in The Art of PostgreSQL book), RegreSQL scans the current directory (or one provided by <code>-C /path/to/project</code>) for <code>*.sql</code> files and attempts to run all queries against the configured PostgreSQL connection.</p>
<p>The individual files can contain either single or multiple sql queries. Like following example</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- name: top-artists-by-album
</span><span>-- Get the list of the N artists with the most albums
</span><span>SELECT
</span><span>    </span><span>artist</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>) AS albums
</span><span>FROM
</span><span>    artist
</span><span>    </span><span>LEFT JOIN</span><span> album </span><span>USING</span><span> (artist_id)
</span><span>GROUP BY
</span><span>    </span><span>artist</span><span>.</span><span>name
</span><span>ORDER BY
</span><span>    albums </span><span>DESC
</span><span>LIMIT</span><span> :n;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The syntax for the queries supports both positional arguments (like <code>$1</code> known from libpq library) or (preferred) <code>psql</code> style variable (<code>:varname</code>). The each identified query (not file) is then executed for 0..N times, based on number of predefined plans and verified to the expected results - validating the expected data matches the one returned. The support for SQL files handling is available separately with https://github.com/boringSQL/queries (Go version only for now).</p>
<p>This gives you what original RegreSQL tool has introduced - change your schema, refactor a query, run <code>regresql test</code> and see immediately what broke. The test suite now has ability to catch regressions before they are committed / shipped. The current version built on top of it, giving you better console formatter instead of TAP style output, as well as jUnit, JSON and GitHub actions formatters for better integration into your CI/CD pipelines.</p>
<h2 id="performance-regression-testing">Performance regression testing
</h2>
<p>Basic regression testing catches correctness issues - wrong results, broken queries, schema mismatches. But there's another class of production issues it misses. Performance regressions. No matter how unbelievable it might sound but queries get deployed without appropriate indexes, or they change over time. Simple fix - both for handwritten SQL or ORM code - can switch from milliseconds to seconds. You add index that helps one query, but tanks another. You modify conditionals and accidently force sequential scan of millions of rows. This is where it hurts.</p>
<p>RegreSQL addresses this by tracking performance baselines alongside correctness. Once baselines are generated</p>
<pre data-lang="text"><code data-lang="text"><span>$ regresql baseline
</span><span>Connecting to 'postgres://appuser:password123@192.168.139.28/cdstore_test'… ✓
</span><span>Creating baselines directory: regresql/baselines
</span><span>Creating directory 'regresql/baselines'

</span><span>  Created baseline: genre-topn_genre-top-n.top-3.json
</span><span>  Created baseline: genre-tracks_tracks-by-genre.json
</span><span>
</span><span>Baselines have been created successfully!
</span><span>Baseline files are stored in: regresql/baselines
</span></code></pre>
<p>the test command not only tests the regressions to the captured times, but also detects the common bad patterns in query execution plans. For now it provides warnings for detection of sequential scans - both on their and/or with nested loops and multiple sort operations. I believe this alone might provide a valuable insights and reduce the mishaps in production. It's also a place where further development of RegreSQL will take place.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this, let's review the test output with the baselines.</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see, despite from not having baseline, RegreSQL is able to detect the basic bad patterns that should be addressed before queries can be considered "production ready".</p>
<p>In some cases, having the detection of sequential scans, or just tracking query costs baselines might be considered undesirable, which would lead to false positives. RegreSQL enables this to be addressed by query metadata as demonstrated below.</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- name: query_name
</span><span>-- metadata: key1=value1, key2=value2
</span><span>SELECT</span><span> ...;
</span></code></pre>
<p>At this point RegreSQL recognizes</p>
<ul>
<li><code>notest</code> to skip the query testing altogether (not just cost tracking)</li>
<li><code>nobaseline</code> to skip cost tracking</li>
<li><code>noseqscanwarn</code> to keep cost tracking but disable sequential scan warnings</li>
<li>and <code>difffloattolerance</code> to cost failure threshold (default 10% at the moment).</li>
</ul>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- name: query_name
</span><span>-- regresql: notest, nobaseline
</span><span>-- regresql: noseqscanwarn
</span><span>-- regresql: difffloattolerance:0.25
</span><span>-- query that can vary in cost by 20% without being considered a failure
</span><span>SELECT</span><span> ...;
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="orm-enters-the-room">ORM enters the room
</h2>
<p>ORMs abstract away SQL, but they still generate it - and that generated SQL can have performance problems you won't catch until production. Consider this common scenario: you start with a simple SQLAlchemy query that works fine, then months later add eager loading for related data:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>orders = (
</span><span>    session.</span><span>query</span><span>(Order)
</span><span>    .</span><span>filter</span><span>(Order.user_id == user_id)
</span><span>    .</span><span>options</span><span>(
</span><span>        </span><span>joinedload</span><span>(Order.user),
</span><span>        </span><span>joinedload</span><span>(Order.shipping_address),
</span><span>        </span><span>selectinload</span><span>(Order.items)  </span><span># NEW: Load order items
</span><span>    )
</span><span>    .</span><span>all</span><span>()
</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>That innocent <code>selectinload(Order.items)</code> generates a separate query - and without an index on <code>order_items.order_id</code>, it performs a sequential scan.</p>
<p>RegreSQL can catch this by intercepting ORM-generated SQL using SQLAlchemy's event system:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>@event.</span><span>listens_for</span><span>(engine, "</span><span>before_cursor_execute</span><span>")
</span><span>def </span><span>capture_sql</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>, </span><span>cursor</span><span>, </span><span>statement</span><span>, *</span><span>args</span><span>):
</span><span>    captured_queries.</span><span>append</span><span>(statement)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Run your ORM code, capture the SQL, save it as a .sql file, and test it with RegreSQL. The performance baseline testing will flag the missing index before it hits production. This is currently experimental, but ORM integration is a key area for RegreSQL's future development.</p>
<h2 id="test-data-management">Test Data Management
</h2>
<p>Up until now we have covered how RegreSQL verifies query correctness and tracks performance regressions. But there's a critical prerequisite we've only skimmed through.  Every regression test needs consistent, reproducible data. Change the data, change their cardinality, and your expected results become meaningless. Your performance  baselines drift. Your tests become flaky.</p>
<p>Traditional approach to create test data might involve</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Database dumps</strong> become unmanageable - 500MB files you can't review, can't understand, that break with every schema migration, and whose data becomes stale as production evolves. Which version of the dump are your tests even using?</li>
<li><strong>SQL scripts</strong> might be better than dumps, but still imperative and hard to maintain. You end up with INSERT statements scattered across multiple files, managing foreign keys manually, and debugging constraint violations.</li>
<li><strong>Factories in application code</strong> might work great for integration tests, but we're testing SQL directly. Do you really want to maintain parallel data generation in your application language just for SQL tests?</li>
<li><strong>Shared test database</strong> is the synonym for classic "works on my machine" problem. State leaks between tests. Parallel execution becomes impossible. Debugging is a nightmare.</li>
</ul>
<p>What we need is something that's declarative (what data, not how to insert it), reproducible (similar data every time), composable (build complex scenarios from simple pieces), and scalable (from 10 rows to 100,000).</p>
<p>This is where next improvement in RegreSQL's fixture system comes in. Think of it as infrastructure-as-code for your test data. You describe the data you need in YAML files, and RegreSQL handles the rest - dependencies, cleanup, foreign keys, and even realistic data generation at scale.</p>
<p>RegreSQL's fixture system lets you define test data in YAML files stored in <code>regresql/fixtures/</code>. Here's a simple example</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml"><code data-lang="yaml"><span>  </span><span>fixture</span><span>: </span><span>basic_users
</span><span>  </span><span>description</span><span>: </span><span>a handful of test users
</span><span>  </span><span>cleanup</span><span>: </span><span>rollback
</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>data</span><span>:
</span><span>    - </span><span>table</span><span>: </span><span>users
</span><span>      </span><span>rows</span><span>:
</span><span>        - </span><span>id</span><span>: </span><span>1
</span><span>          </span><span>email</span><span>: </span><span>alice@example.com
</span><span>          </span><span>name</span><span>: </span><span>Alice Anderson
</span><span>          </span><span>created_at</span><span>: </span><span>2024-01-15
</span><span>        - </span><span>id</span><span>: </span><span>2
</span><span>          </span><span>email</span><span>: </span><span>bob@example.com
</span><span>          </span><span>name</span><span>: </span><span>Bob Builder
</span><span>          </span><span>created_at</span><span>: </span><span>2024-02-20
</span></code></pre>
<p>To use this fixture in your tests, reference it in the query's plan file (<code>regresql/plans/get-user.yaml</code>) you can just reference the fixture</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml"><code data-lang="yaml"><span>  </span><span>fixtures</span><span>:
</span><span>    - </span><span>basic_users
</span><span>
</span><span>  "</span><span>1</span><span>":
</span><span>    </span><span>email</span><span>: </span><span>alice@example.com
</span><span>
</span><span>  "</span><span>2</span><span>":
</span><span>    </span><span>email</span><span>: </span><span>bob@example.com
</span></code></pre>
<p>And when you run <code>regresql test</code>, the fixture is automatically loaded before the query executes, and cleaned up afterward. No manual setup scripts, no state leakage between tests. But it does not stop with static fixtures. When you want to test queries against realistic volumes you can use range of <strong>data generators</strong> including</p>
<ul>
<li>sequences, random integer, decimal, string, uuid, email and name generators</li>
<li>date_between for generating random timestamps within a range</li>
<li>foreign key references to be able to reuse data from other table's fixtures</li>
<li>range to select value from predefined sources</li>
<li>Go template support</li>
</ul>
<pre data-lang="yaml"><code data-lang="yaml"><span> </span><span>fixture</span><span>: </span><span>realistic_orders

</span><span>
</span><span>    - </span><span>table</span><span>: </span><span>orders

</span><span>          </span><span>end</span><span>: "</span><span>2024-12-31</span><span>"
</span></code></pre>
<p>This generates 1,000 customers and 5,000 orders with realistic-looking data - names, emails, dates, and amounts that feel production-like.</p>
<p>The fixtures are also <strong>stackable</strong> and can be build on top of each other. For example if you need to make sure users fixtures are created before orders fixtures, just declare the dependency (the already planned improvement is to include the support automatic foreign-key detection to avoid ID hard-coding). RegreSQL loads fixtures in dependency order and handles cleanup in reverse.</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml"><code data-lang="yaml"><span>  </span><span>fixture</span><span>: </span><span>orders_with_shipping
</span><span>  </span><span>depends_on</span><span>:

</span><span>          </span><span>status</span><span>: </span><span>shipped
</span></code></pre>
<p>Should the available options for fixtures (manual data or data generators) not be enough, you always have options to use good old SQL based data generation.</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml"><code data-lang="yaml"><span>  </span><span>fixture</span><span>: </span><span>mixed_setup

<p>RegreSQL provides commands to inspect and validate your fixtures</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>  </span><span># List all available fixtures

</span><span>  </span><span>regresql</span><span> fixtures apply basic_users
</span></code></pre>
<p>The fixture system has been design to transforms test data from a maintenance burden into a documented, version-controlled process. Your YAML files become the single source of truth for what data your tests need, making it easy to understand test scenarios and maintain test data as the application evolves.</p>
<h2 id="regresql-future">RegreSQL future
</h2>
<p>Introducing a new open source project is an ambitious goal, and RegreSQL is just starting up. Despite the fork being in works for almost 2 years. In coming weeks and months I plan further improvements, as well as better documentation and more tutorials. The project is maintained as part of my <strong>boringSQL</strong> brand, where it's vital component (together with pgTap) for building <a href="https://labs.boringsql.com/">SQL Labs</a> which (as I sincerely hope) will provide a foundation for its further development.</p>
<p>At the same time <strong>RegreSQL</strong> is an attempt to give back to welcoming PostgreSQL community, make developer user experience slightly better if possible and (just maybe) provide one more argument against the case that SQL queries are not testable.</p>
<p>RegreSQL is available at <a href="https://github.com/boringSQL/regresql">GitHub</a> - feel free to open issue, or drop me email about the project at <a href="mailto:radim@boringsql.com">radim@boringsql.com</a> or connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/1radim/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://entropytown.com/articles/2025-11-13-world-model-lecun-feifei-li/">https://entropytown.com/articles/2025-11-13-world-model-lecun-feifei-li/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45923326">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>AI has finally reached the “we need to model the whole world” phase.</p>
<p>In the same season, Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs shipped <strong>Marble</strong>, a “multimodal world model” that turns prompts into walkable 3D scenes in your browser, and reports emerged that Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun is leaving to build a <strong>world-model</strong> startup of his own. DeepMind, meanwhile, is calling its new interactive video engine <strong>Genie 3</strong> a world model as well.</p>
<p>Same phrase. Three very different bets.</p>
<h2 id="the-week-world-models-went-mainstream">The week “world models” went mainstream</h2>
<p>World Labs has spent the year rolling out a neat narrative stack: Fei-Fei Li’s manifesto, <a href="https://drfeifei.substack.com/p/from-words-to-worlds-spatial-intelligence"><em>From Words to Worlds: Spatial Intelligence Is AI’s Next Frontier</em></a>, argues that language-only systems (LLMs) are a dead end and that the real frontier is “spatial intelligence” and “world models” that understand 3D space, physics and action. On top of that sits the launch of <a href="https://www.worldlabs.ai/blog/marble-world-model">Marble</a>, which promises anyone can now generate editable 3D worlds from text, images, videos or simple layouts.</p>
<p>At almost the same time, outlets like Nasdaq reported that LeCun is preparing to leave Meta and raise money for a company “focused on world models” in the very different sense he’s been sketching since his 2022 paper <em>A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence</em> (<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-depart-and-launch-ai-start-focused-world-models">Nasdaq</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf">paper PDF</a>).</p>
<p>On Hacker News, the Marble launch thread is full of arguments about Gaussian splats and game engines (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45902732">HN</a>). The LeCun thread is full of arguments about whether Meta has chosen “AI slopware” over proper research. Same word, different fights.</p>
<p>To understand why, we have to start with the only thing anyone can actually click.</p>
<h2 id="world-labs-world-model-gaussian-splats-for-humans">World Labs’ world model: Gaussian splats for humans</h2>
<p><strong>Marble</strong>, as shipped today, is a full-stack 3D content pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes <strong>text prompts, single images, short videos or blocky 3D layouts</strong>.</li>
<li>It hallucinates a <strong>3D representation</strong> of a scene.</li>
<li>It lets you <strong>walk around</strong> that scene in a web or VR viewer and tweak it with an in-browser editor called Chisel.</li>
<li>It exports as <strong>Gaussian splats</strong>, standard <strong>meshes</strong> (OBJ/FBX) or flat <strong>video</strong> for downstream tools (<a href="https://www.worldlabs.ai/blog/marble-world-model">Marble docs</a>, <a href="https://radiancefields.com/world-labs-unveils-new-model-marble-a-generative-world-model">RadianceFields explainer</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>For people who ship VR apps or game levels, a pipeline that goes “prompt → 3D world → export to Three.js / Unity” is extremely useful. World Labs even ships its own Three.js renderer, Spark, specifically tuned for splats (<a href="https://radiancefields.com/world-labs-releases-spark-v0-1-9">Spark release</a>).</p>
<p>But it’s very much a <strong>3D asset</strong> story. On Marble’s own blog, “world model” sits in the same sentence as “export Gaussian splats, meshes and videos”; there is no robot in sight.</p>
<p>Hacker News users clocked that immediately. One early top-level comment, contrasting Marble with DeepMind’s video-based Genie, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Genie delivers on-the-fly generated video that responds to user inputs in real time. Marble renders a static Gaussian Splat asset (like a 3D game engine asset) that you then render in a game engine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another says, with the particular baffled politeness of an ML engineer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Isn’t this a Gaussian Splat model? I work in AI and, to this day, I don’t know what they mean by ‘world’ in ‘world model’.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reddit is less shy. In a thread about the first demo from the “$230m startup led by Fei-Fei Li” in r/StableDiffusion, one commenter sums it up as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Taking images and turning them into 3D environments using gaussian splats, depth and inpainting. Cool, but that’s a 3D GS pipeline, not a robot brain.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1h53uhj/first_demo_from_world_labs_230m_startup_led_by/">Reddit thread</a>)</p>
<p>That doesn’t make Marble bad. It does make its use of “world model” slightly ambitious. To see how, you need a quick primer in what a Gaussian splat actually is.</p>
<h3 id="sidebar-photogrammetry-splats-and-meshes">Sidebar: photogrammetry, splats and meshes</h3>
<p>If you’re not a 3D person, 2025’s splat discourse can sound like hand-waving. In practice, there are three characters here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Photogrammetry</strong> – The old guard. Take hundreds of overlapping photos of a real thing, reconstruct a <strong>polygon mesh</strong> (a shell made of tiny triangles), and bake textures on top. Great if you want to measure, collide or 3D-print.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3D Gaussian splatting</strong> – The new hotness. Represent the scene as millions of fuzzy coloured blobs (“Gaussians”) floating in space, and “splat” them onto the screen so they blend into an image. Excellent at foliage, hair and soft light; runs in real time on gaming GPUs. The canonical paper is Kerbl et al.’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04079"><em>3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering</em></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Renderers</strong> – Engines like Three.js, Unity or Unreal that take a mesh or a splat cloud and turn it into pixels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A photogrammetry practitioner on r/photogrammetry puts the trade-off like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Use photogrammetry if you want to do something with the mesh itself, and Gaussian splatting if you want to skip all the steps and just show the scan like it is. It’s kind of a shortcut to interactive photorealism.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/photogrammetry/comments/1mqt64y/what_are_the_benefits_and_different_use_cases/">explainer thread</a>)</p>
<p>Marble lives squarely in that world: it’s a <strong>shortcut to interactive photorealism</strong>. It generates splats/meshes and hands them to a renderer. The “world” it models is the part we can see and walk around in. It’s for humans (and game engines), not for machines to think with.</p>
<p>Fei-Fei Li’s essay, however, speaks in a different register.</p>
<p>She writes about “embodied agents”, “commonsense physics” and “robots that can understand and act in the world” — all the things you would want a robot’s <strong>internal model</strong> to support. Marble is presented as “step one” on that road. The tension, and the comic potential, comes from the fact that step one is currently a very polished 3DGS viewer.</p>
<p>Ironically, Fei-Fei Li’s original manifesto, <em>From Words to Worlds</em>, never once mentions 3D Gaussian Splatting — the very technique at the heart of Marble’s output pipeline.</p>
<p>If Marble were the only “world model” on offer, you could reasonably conclude that the term has been kidnapped by marketing. Unfortunately for your hot take, Yann LeCun exists.</p>
<h2 id="lecuns-world-model-the-brain-in-the-middle">LeCun’s world model: the brain in the middle</h2>
<p>LeCun’s use of “world model” comes from control theory and cognitive science rather than from 3D graphics.</p>
<p>In <em>A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence</em> (<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf">PDF</a>), he describes a system in which:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>world model</strong> ingests streams of sensory data.</li>
<li>It learns <strong>latent state</strong>: compressed internal variables that capture “what’s going on out there”.</li>
<li>It learns to <strong>predict how that latent state will evolve</strong> when the agent (or environment) acts.</li>
<li>A separate module uses that machinery to <strong>plan</strong> and choose actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>You never see the world model directly. It doesn’t need to output pretty pictures. Its job is to let an agent think a few steps ahead.</p>
<p>JEPA-style models — “Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures” — are early instances of this approach: instead of predicting raw pixels, they predict masked or future embeddings and are trained to be <em>useful</em> representations rather than perfect renderings. LeCun has been giving talks about this since at least 2022 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvSe0ktD95k">YouTube</a>).</p>
<p>When Nasdaq and others reported that he’s spinning out to build a world-model startup (<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-depart-and-launch-ai-start-focused-world-models">Nasdaq</a>), the reaction on HN wasn’t, “ooh, another 3D viewer.” It was:</p>
<ul>
<li>does this mean Meta has given up on this line of research in favour of GPT-ish products?</li>
<li>can a JEPA-like architecture ever match LLMs in practical usefulness?</li>
<li>is there even a market for a world model that mostly lives in diagrams and robot labs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you think LeCun is right or wrong, you can’t really accuse him of chasing the same thing as World Labs. One “world model” is essentially a front-end asset generator. The other is a back-end predictive brain.</p>
<p>And then there’s DeepMind, happily occupying the middle.</p>
<h2 id="deepminds-world-model-worlds-as-video">DeepMind’s world model: worlds as video</h2>
<p>DeepMind’s <strong>Genie 3</strong> model is introduced, without much modesty, as “a new frontier for world models” (<a href="https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models">blog</a>).</p>
<p>From a text prompt, it generates an <strong>interactive video-like environment</strong> at 720p / 24 fps that you (or an agent) can move around in for several minutes. Objects persist across frames, you can “prompt” world events (“it starts raining”), and the whole thing functions as a tiny videogame rendered by a model instead of a traditional engine.</p>
<p>The Guardian describes it as a way for AI agents and robots to “train in virtual warehouses and ski slopes” before they ever touch the real world (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/05/google-step-artificial-general-intelligence-deepmind-agi">Guardian</a>). DeepMind is perfectly happy to connect it to the AGI narrative.</p>
<p>Where Marble generates <strong>assets</strong> and LeCun dreams of <strong>latents</strong>, Genie 3 produces <strong>simulators</strong>: online environments where you can act, observe consequences and learn.</p>
<p>On HN, when someone asks “how does Marble compare?”, a typical answer is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Genie is on-the-fly generated video that responds to user inputs in real time. Marble is a static Gaussian splat asset you render in a game engine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, not an insult — just taxonomy.</p>
<h2 id="one-word-three-bets">One word, three bets</h2>
<p>Put all of this together and “world model” now covers at least three distinct ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>World models as interface</strong><br>
Marble is a beautiful way to go from <em>words and flat media</em> to <em>3D environments humans can edit and share</em>. The “world” is whatever your Quest headset needs next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>World models as simulator</strong><br>
Genie-style models produce <em>continuous, controllable video worlds</em> where agents can try things, fail, and try again. The “world” is whatever keeps the game loop coherent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>World models as cognition</strong><br>
LeCun-style architectures are about <em>internal predictive state</em>. The “world” lives inside an agent as latent variables and transition functions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Fei-Fei Li’s writing borrows heavily from bucket (3) — embodied agents, intuitive physics — while Marble, so far, mostly occupies bucket (1). LeCun’s plans live squarely in (3), with the hope that someone, someday, builds a good version of (2) on top. Genie lives between (2) and (3), with occasional marketing holidays in all of them.</p>
<p>If you only look at Marble’s demo, it’s tempting to say “world model” is just 3DGS with better PR. If you only read LeCun, it’s tempting to believe language models were a historical detour and JEPA will save us all. If you only read DeepMind, it’s simulated ski slopes all the way down.</p>
<p>The truth is they’re all building different parts of the same vague ambition: <strong>give machines some structured way to think about the world, beyond next-token prediction.</strong> One group starts from the rendering, one from the physics, one from the internal code.</p>
<p>Until the jargon catches up, the safest move when you see a “world model” headline is to ask three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this a <strong>thing for humans to look at</strong>, a <strong>place for agents to train</strong>, or a <strong>box inside a diagram</strong>?</li>
<li>Does it output <strong>static assets</strong>, <strong>real-time frames</strong>, or mostly <strong>latent states</strong>?</li>
<li>If you knock over a virtual vase, does anything in the system remember for more than one frame?</li>
</ol>
<p>If the answers are “for humans”, “static assets” and “not really”, you’re basically looking at a very nice Gaussian splat viewer. If they’re “for agents”, “real-time” and “yes, in latent space”, then you might just be staring at the world model LeCun has been talking about — the one that, very inconveniently for demo culture, doesn’t fit in a single tweetable GIF.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>This article is currently an experimental machine translation and may contain errors. If anything is unclear, please refer to the original Chinese version. I am continuously working to improve the translation.</p><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>This blog post should be the final part of the <em>“Running Your Own ISP at Home”</em> series, and we’re going to talk about how to modify the geolocation of the IP addresses we announce.</p><p>By tweaking IP geolocation, you can:</p><ul><li>Display absurd IP locations on various platforms — for example, Antarctica (which barely has internet infrastructure), North Korea (which isn’t connected to the global internet), or some obscure tiny country with only tens of thousands of people</li><li>Use a single VPS to obtain IP addresses from all over the world, <del>show off on probe networks</del> and achieve a weird kind of “All In One” status (yep, even this is All In One now)</li><li>Unlock region-locked streaming services — see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hostloc.com/thread-1247865-1-1.html">this hostloc thread</a></li><li><del>Run a one-man IDC selling VPSes from all corners of the globe</del> — I found one called GlobalVM, but haven’t tried it, so no recommendation. Feel free to search on your own.</li></ul><p>This article will mainly focus on modifying IP geolocation and using WARP to get a corresponding-region IPv4 address. Unlocking streaming content and running an IDC won’t be covered in depth — refer to the link above if interested.</p><h2 id="Prerequisites"><a href="#Prerequisites" title="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites</h2><p>This is probably common knowledge for many, but for completeness, let’s go over it briefly.</p><h3 id="IP-Databases"><a href="#IP-Databases" title="IP Databases"></a>IP Databases</h3><p>IP database providers compile mappings from <code>IP → geographical location</code> using methods like network scanning and WHOIS lookups. They also include data such as IP threat scores and type (residential, server, or VPN). These databases are sold to users — typically websites — which then query them in the backend to display location info and perform risk assessment. A handy tool for querying multiple geolocation databases at once: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://iplark.com/">https://iplark.com/</a></p><p>Popular IP databases include Maxmind, IPInfo, and DB-IP. Smaller databases often sync data from larger ones.</p><h3 id="WARP"><a href="#WARP" title="WARP"></a>WARP</h3><p>WARP is a WireGuard-based VPN service provided by Cloudflare. While they offer an official Linux client, most people use native WireGuard to connect. WARP can provide your server with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, commonly used to add IPv4 connectivity to IPv6-only VPSes (or vice versa). One key feature of WARP is that <strong>the public IP it assigns will have the same geolocation as the IP you’re connecting from</strong> — we’ll use this property later. For a detailed WARP setup guide, check out: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://p3terx.com/archives/use-cloudflare-warp-to-add-extra-ipv4-or-ipv6-network-support-to-vps-servers-for-free.html">https://p3terx.com/archives/use-cloudflare-warp-to-add-extra-ipv4-or-ipv6-network-support-to-vps-servers-for-free.html</a></p><h2 id="Submitting-Geolocation-Correction-Requests"><a href="#Submitting-Geolocation-Correction-Requests" title="Submitting Geolocation Correction Requests"></a>Submitting Geolocation Correction Requests</h2><p>In reality, the “location” of an IP is inherently fuzzy. For instance, my <code>2a14:7c0:4d00::/40</code> block was originally allocated to Israel. But later, I bought parts of this range and announced them via BGP in Germany, the US, and Singapore (see previous article on <a href="https://blog.lyc8503.net/post/asn-4-anycast-network/">Anycast networks</a>). Meanwhile, I’m physically located in mainland China. As the owner of this IP block, I can also freely edit the <code>country</code> field in the WHOIS database — and I set it to KP (North Korea).</p><p>Because of this ambiguity, it’s nearly impossible to precisely determine an IP’s location using any single technical method. As a result, almost all geolocation databases accept public/user-submitted correction requests.</p><h3 id="Preparation"><a href="#Preparation" title="Preparation"></a>Preparation</h3><p>Before submitting any requests, let’s do a little prep work.</p><p>IP databases collect IP ranges from global routing tables. Previously, we were announcing the entire <code>2a14:7c0:4d00::/40</code> block without subdividing it in RIPE NCC, which makes it harder for databases to process smaller segments. So let’s fix that.</p><p>Log in to the RIPE Database, go to <code>My Resources → IPv6 → Create assignment</code>, and fill out the form to create a new <code>inet6num</code> (which represents an IPv6 address block):</p><ul><li><code>inet6num</code>: Enter a subnet. The smallest allowed is <code>/48</code>, so I entered <code>2a14:7c0:4d00::/48</code>. If you only own a <code>/48</code>, you can’t subdivide further — you can only edit the LIR-assigned block.</li><li><code>netname</code>: Pick a name you like</li><li><code>country</code>: Choose the country/region you want this IP block to appear in</li><li><code>admin-c</code> &amp; <code>tech-c</code>: Fill in two contact objects — use the ones you created earlier</li><li><code>status</code>: Select <code>ASSIGNED</code> to indicate it’s assigned</li></ul><p><img src="https://blog.lyc8503.net/en/post/asn-5-worldwide-servers/inet6num.png" alt="Form for creating a new inet6num"><span>Form for creating a new inet6num</span></p><p>After creation, you can see all your subnets under “My Resources”:</p><p><img src="https://blog.lyc8503.net/en/post/asn-5-worldwide-servers/specific-inet6.png" alt="Viewing subnets under the LIR-assigned block"><span>Viewing subnets under the LIR-assigned block</span></p><p>Next, update the BIRD configuration from our <a href="https://blog.lyc8503.net/post/asn-2-bgp-session/">previous article</a>, changing <code>2a14:7c0:4d00::/40</code> to <code>2a14:7c0:4d00::/48</code>, then restart BIRD.</p><p>After some time, use BGP Tools to verify that <code>2a14:7c0:4d00::/48</code> is now visible. The old <code>/40</code> page should return 404.</p><h3 id="Submitting-Correction-Requests"><a href="#Submitting-Correction-Requests" title="Submitting Correction Requests"></a>Submitting Correction Requests</h3><p>You can submit geolocation correction requests to common IP databases: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-location-correction">Maxmind</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ipinfo.io/corrections">IPInfo</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://support.google.com/websearch/workflow/9308722?hl=en">Google</a></p><p>If asked for justification, write something like “Due to incorrect IP geolocation, I/my clients cannot access region-restricted websites” (in English). Avoid mentioning use for anonymous proxies — that might violate their correction policies.</p><p>Each database has its own review process. Some involve manual checks, and changes usually take 3 days to 2 weeks to go live. Most offer online lookup tools (like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-web-services-demo">Maxmind’s Demo</a>) — you can use them to check progress, or use IPLark for batch queries.</p><p>In my test, IPInfo accepted my request within a week. Maxmind didn’t respond after two weeks, so I followed up via their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/contact-corrections">contact form</a>, and they finally approved it. (Wait a bit first — only reach out after multiple failed submissions.)</p><p>(p.s. Recently, Maxmind has been rejecting requests to set location to Antarctica (AQ) — <del>probably too many people trying to go there</del>. That’s why this article uses North Korea as an example. If you really want an Antarctica IP, try the geofeed method at the end to bypass manual review.)</p><p>Below is for reference only — feel free to <del>make up</del> craft your own justification:</p><blockquote><p>Q: Hello, I am the network operator and owner of AS214775. I found out that my IP address segment 2a14:7c0:4d00::/40 is incorrectly localized to Israel, causing me to be denied access to other websites. I have tried several times to submit data corrections using the data correction form, but no response. I have corrected the country of my IP segment in the RIPE NCC database, and some other databases such as ipinfo.io have been synchronized, but Maxmind keeps locating my IP segment to Israel. I would like to politely ask why MaxMind has not responded to my correction request?</p><p>A: Thank you for your email. This will be updated in Tuesday’s release of the database.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Using-WARP-to-Get-a-Region-Matched-IPv4"><a href="#Using-WARP-to-Get-a-Region-Matched-IPv4" title="Using WARP to Get a Region-Matched IPv4"></a>Using WARP to Get a Region-Matched IPv4</h2><p>Cloudflare uses Maxmind’s database, so as long as Maxmind reflects your desired location, WARP will follow suit. Note that Cloudflare may lag behind Maxmind by 1–2 weeks. If Maxmind shows the correct location but Cloudflare hasn’t updated, just wait a little longer.</p><p>WARP assigns IPv4 (and IPv6) addresses based on your connection IP’s geolocation. The IPv4 address not only allows access to IPv4-only sites, but its geolocation is maintained by Cloudflare — highly accurate and consistent across databases, much more reliable than manually submitting corrections everywhere.</p><p>We’ve already introduced WARP, so let’s jump straight into setup using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://p3terx.com/archives/use-cloudflare-warp-to-add-extra-ipv4-or-ipv6-network-support-to-vps-servers-for-free.html">this guide</a>:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br><span>18</span><br><span>19</span><br><span>20</span><br><span>21</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span>curl -fsSL git.io/wgcf.sh | sudo bash</span><br><span>wgcf register</span><br><span>wgcf generate</span><br><span></span><br><span>vim wgcf-profile.conf</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>ip -6 route add &lt;WARP_server_IP&gt;/128 via &lt;IPv6_gateway&gt; dev eth0 src &lt;your_AS<span>'s_IPv6_address&gt;</span></span><br><span><span># Example: ip -6 route add 2606:4700:d0::a29f:c001/128 via 2a03:d9c0:2000::5 dev eth0 src 2a14:7c0:4d00::1</span></span><br><span><span></span></span><br><span><span>cp wgcf-profile.conf /etc/wireguard/warp.conf</span></span><br><span><span>wg-quick up warp</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><hr><p>Now test your VPS’s IPv4 geolocation using Cloudflare’s <code>/cdn-cgi/trace</code> endpoint (available on any site behind CF). <code>ip=104.28.212.208</code> means we got that IP, <code>colo=DUS</code> means we’re connecting via the DUS (Düsseldorf Airport) data center (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_airport_code">IATA code</a>), <code>loc=IL</code> means geolocation is IL (Israel) (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">country code</a>), and <code>warp=on</code> confirms WARP is active:</p><p><del>We did successfully change our location, but <code>loc=IL</code> means Cloudflare hasn’t picked up Maxmind’s update yet — let’s wait a bit longer</del></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br><span>18</span><br><span>19</span><br><span>20</span><br><span>21</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>root@s39230 ~ </span><br><span>fl=910f1</span><br><span>h=www.cloudflare.com</span><br><span>ip=104.28.212.208</span><br><span>ts=1731586511.237</span><br><span>visit_scheme=https</span><br><span>uag=curl/7.88.1</span><br><span>colo=DUS</span><br><span>sliver=none</span><br><span>http=http/2</span><br><span>loc=IL</span><br><span>tls=TLSv1.3</span><br><span>sni=plaintext</span><br><span>warp=on</span><br><span>gateway=off</span><br><span>rbi=off</span><br><span>kex=X25519</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>root@s39230 ~ </span><br><span>{<span>"code"</span>:0,<span>"msg"</span>:<span>""</span>,<span>"message"</span>:<span>""</span>,<span>"data"</span>:{<span>"addr"</span>:<span>"104.28.212.210"</span>,<span>"country"</span>:<span>"Israel"</span>,<span>"province"</span>:<span>"Jerusalem District"</span>,<span>"city"</span>:<span>"Jerusalem"</span>,<span>"isp"</span>:<span>"cloudflare.com"</span>,<span>"latitude"</span>:<span>"31.768319"</span>,<span>"longitude"</span>:<span>"35.21371"</span>}}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>After nearly ten real-world days, Cloudflare WARP finally updated its database!

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mini-apps-partner/">https://developer.apple.com/programs/mini-apps-partner/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45922550">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


								<h2>How it works</h2>

								<p>This program is designed for developers who host mini apps and games, which are experiences that are built using web technologies like HTML5 or JavaScript and distributed within a larger, native app. Participating apps are required to support certain App&nbsp;Store technologies, including the Declared Age Range API and the Advanced Commerce API in order to provide a safe and seamless experience for customers. As a result, program members earn 85% of <a href="#qualifying-in-app-purchase">qualifying In‑App&nbsp;Purchase</a> sales within <a href="#qualifying-mini-app">qualifying mini apps</a>.</p>

								<h3>Implement host app requirements</h3>

								<p>To be eligible for the Mini&nbsp;Apps Partner&nbsp;Program:</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Your app must be available on iOS and iPadOS on the App&nbsp;Store.</li>
									<li>You must ensure all hosted mini apps comply with applicable requirements from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/">Apple&nbsp;Developer Program License Agreement</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines">App&nbsp;Review Guidelines</a>, including the specific requirements listed in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#third-party-software">guideline 4.7</a> — Mini apps, mini games, streaming games, chatbots, plug-ins, and game emulators — and have provided a manifest required by guideline 4.7.4 that’s approved by Apple and includes hosted mini app metadata.</li>
									<li>You must provide metadata that follows the outlined guidance in order to identify all mini app in-app purchases (including non-qualifying) and the digital goods and services sold. This allows customers to clearly understand what purchases they’re making within your qualifying mini apps, as well as helps Apple identify qualifying In‑App&nbsp;Purchases and apply appropriate commission rate.</li>
									<li>Your app must support the following technologies: 
										<ul>
											<li><strong>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/advanced-commerce-api/">Advanced Commerce API</a> and supporting technologies</strong> to properly merchandise qualifying mini apps and any associated purchases.</li>
											<li><strong>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/declaredagerange">Declared Age Rating API<span></span></a></strong> to help provide age-appropriate content and experiences within your app.</li>
											<li><strong>Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/">In‑App Purchase</a> system</strong> to provide users with a familiar and trusted way to make purchases and easily check their purchase history, view, modify, or cancel subscriptions, as well as access customer support, like requesting a refund.</li>
											<li><strong>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreserverapi/send_consumption_information"> Send Consumption Information<span></span></a></strong> endpoint in the App&nbsp;Store Server API to send information about a user’s In‑App Purchase to Apple when they request a refund. This information also helps to inform and improve the refund request process.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>




								<h3>Join the program</h3>

								<p>If you’d like to participate in the Mini&nbsp;Apps Partner&nbsp;Program, submit a request form. Please note that you’ll need to be an Account&nbsp;Holder in the Apple&nbsp;Developer Program. You’ll be asked to provide information related to your host app, eligibility, and mini app, as well as agree to the program’s terms and conditions. If approved, you’ll receive an email confirmation that includes setup details to help you configure your offerings.</p>

								<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/mini-apps-partner-program/">Make a request<span></span></a></p>

								<h3>Submit for review</h3>

								<p>Once your app is tested and ready, you’ll <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-for-review">submit</a> it for app review. Submit your app binary and generic mini app In‑App Purchase Product&nbsp;ID in App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;Connect and be sure to mention that your app uses the Advanced Commerce API and offers mini apps.</p>

								<p>If you’re currently a participant in the Mini&nbsp;Apps Partner&nbsp;Program and would like to add additional mini apps, simply update your manifest with this information as part of your submission process. To add an additional host app, be sure your app has access to the Advanced Commerce API (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/advanced-commerce/">submit a request<span></span></a> if needed) and provide an accompanying manifest describing your host app and associated mini&nbsp;apps.</p>




								<h2>Q&amp;A</h2>

								<h4 id="mini-app">What’s a mini&nbsp;app?</h4>
								<p>Mini apps are software packages, scripts, or game content that are added after app installation and executed on the device, provided such code is written in HTML5 or JavaScript, or another language approved by Apple.

<p><em>When Peter Matthiessen’s name comes up in conjunction with </em>The Paris Review<em>, two facts are sure to emerge. The first is that Matthiessen was one of the magazine’s founders, and that his enchantingly shabby Paris apartment provided a bumptious gathering place in its earliest days. The second is that he was, at the time, an undercover CIA operative, and that the creation of the magazine was somehow wrapped up in his spycraft. The</em> New York Times <em>revealed Matthiessen’s CIA affiliation in a bombshell 1977 story with the headline “</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/26/archives/worldwide-propaganda-network-built-by-the-cia-a-worldwide-network.html"><em>Worldwide Propaganda Network Built by the C.I.A</em></a><em>,” which examined dozens of publications and cultural organizations that had been secretly “owned, subsidized or influenced in some way by the C.I.A. over the past three decades.” Matthiessen’s connection rated only three brief sentences buried at the center of what he called a “long gray article”; the reporter, John Crewdson, noted that there was no evidence the CIA had used the writer “to influence the</em> Paris Review<em>.” Even so, Matthiessen spent the rest of his life facing questions about his role. He had left the agency in 1953, after about two years, but he never divulged the details of his work for the organization, which remain unclear even now, eleven years after his death.</em></p>
<p><em>Some have speculated that the </em>Review <em>itself received CIA support as part of the agency’s broader effort to prop up pro-Western art and literature. At the peak of its influence, in the fifties and sixties, the CIA fronted money to support a broad array of cultural production, from the seemingly innocuous to the expressly anti-communist. Among many other ventures, it had its hand in abstract-expressionist painting, jazz, Radio Free Asia, literary magazines, academic books on Finland and East Germany, a Roman newspaper, and an animated film adaptation of </em>Animal Farm<em>. While some artists were aware of the source of their funding, many were not. Given that </em>The Paris Review<em> portrayed itself as studiously apolitical—recall William Styron’s famous anti-manifesto in the first issue, fashioning it as a home for “the non-drumbeaters and non-axe-grinders”—Matthiessen’s CIA involvement has raised questions and eyebrows since its revelation in the seventies.</em></p>
<p><em>Lance Richardson’s </em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/604930/true-nature-by-lance-richardson/">True Nature: The Pilgrimage of Peter Matthiessen</a> <em>is the first biography of the writer. Matthiessen, born in New York in 1927, was the author of ten novels, two collections of stories, and nearly two dozen works of nonfiction; he is the only writer to have won the National Book Award for both fiction (for </em>Shadow Country<em>, in 2008) and nonfiction (for </em>The Snow Leopard<em>, in 1980). A keen observer of the natural world, he traveled widely in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean in search of remote places where one could find a “glimpse of the earth’s morning,” as he described it. </em>True Nature<em> offers a deft assessment of his work and a capacious telling of the forces that shaped his interest in everything from Zen Buddhism to environmentalism to cryptozoology to labor rights. Richardson conducted hundreds of interviews over seven and a half years, and his archival research yielded, among many other insights, a clearer picture of </em>The Paris Review<em>’s first years, when Matthiessen was doing double duty as a fiction editor and a secret agent. I spoke to Richardson by phone to ask what he’d discovered about Matthiessen’s years in Paris.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>What do we know about why Peter Matthiessen decided to join the CIA—the decision that led, eventually, to the founding of <em>The Paris Review</em>?</p>
<p>LANCE RICHARDSON</p>
<p>Before he died, in anticipation of a possible memoir, Matthiessen wrote out a series of narratives about what he’d been doing in Paris. The title of one of them is “THE PARIS REVIEW V. THE CIA: My Half-life as a Capitalist Running Dog.” They were incomplete, and I had to be careful about assuming everything was one hundred percent accurate—not because Peter was necessarily trying to leave a trail of lies or anything, but because he was writing this decades after it happened, and he had his own agenda. In terms of other materials, the CIA wouldn’t give me anything. I filed FOIA requests. I talked to their entertainment liaison, who works with Hollywood. But they don’t declassify personnel records.</p>
<p>As Matthiessen tells it, he had finished Yale in 1950 and wanted to be a writer, but how do you just become a writer? His English professor Norman Holmes Pearson tapped him on the shoulder and asked if he wanted to do something for his country. This was happening quite a lot at Yale at the time. One of Matthiessen’s contemporaries estimated that two dozen of their classmates were recruited for the CIA through various professors. The agency called them the “P source,” for “professor.” Matthiessen wrote that Pearson opened him “like an oyster.” Not because he was ideologically driven—his politics at that point were unformed and chaotic—but because he wanted a stipend and an excuse to go to Paris, which was a city that he and his first wife, Patsy Southgate, really loved. The CIA then was reputationally much more benign, at least domestically. It hadn’t yet become known by most Americans for its involvement in coups and things like that.<span id="more-172160"></span></p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>They were active in Korea, Guatemala, and Iran in those years, arranging paramilitary operations and working, in the last case, to bring the shah back to power, though as you say none of that had come to light. At this point, then, they were into election interference and some psyops, but no exploding cigars and mind-control experiments yet?</p>
<p>RICHARDSON</p>
<p>Right. They sent Matthiessen first to D.C. to meet with James Angleton, a now-famous spymaster who at that time headed up the agency’s Office of Special Operations, which handled foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, and espionage. Then Matthiessen went to spycraft training in New York, which he called “great fun,” and he got on a boat to Paris in 1951. He stumbled into this world of espionage as an excuse to write a novel and be in a city that he associated with freedom.</p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>Do you think Matthiessen’s time in the navy, during the final stages of World War II, may have motivated him to join the CIA?</p>
<p>RICHARDSON</p>
<p>Absolutely. He was at the Hotchkiss School during the war, in high school, and he would watch a lot of the young men slightly older than him go off to fight. He saw it as a rite of passage, a badge of honor. By the time it was his turn, when he was doing basic training in Sampson, New York, V-J Day happened. So he missed out. His letters to his girlfriends at the time are really conflicted. He was happy the war was over, but he also felt that he’d been denied something. Eventually, toward the end of 1945, he got sent off anyway, to Hawaii. His job was to do the laundry of the real soldiers who were being demobilized and sent home. He felt incredibly emasculated by this. There’s one point in his notes for his memoir when he says, and I’m paraphrasing here, that he saw joining the CIA as another opportunity to make up for something he had been denied during the war.</p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>His apartment in Paris, at 14, rue Perceval, was integral to the romance of the early days of <em>The Paris Review</em>—a kind of midcentury bohemian, glass-walled paradise where they threw all these parties. It was heated with lumps of coal dust, and there was a huge painting of a cat’s head on the wall. What was his life like in Paris?</p>
<p>RICHARDSON</p>
<p>In <a href="https://classic.esquire.com/article/1963/7/1/looking-for-hemingway">an article Gay Talese wrote for </a><a href="https://classic.esquire.com/article/1963/7/1/looking-for-hemingway"><em>Esquire</em></a><a href="https://classic.esquire.com/article/1963/7/1/looking-for-hemingway"> in 1963</a> about those early days of the magazine, he called the apartment “a monstrous fishbowl.” But those parties, and that bohemian lifestyle, were just one aspect of Matthiessen’s life. He would take the metro to meet his CIA handler in the Jeu de Paume, and they would stroll from the museum to the gardens near the Louvre and discuss his assignments. What he was actually working on for the CIA is still opaque. Matthiessen described it later as “deceiving people” and “serial lying.” Until the CIA releases its files, it’s always going to be a bit shadowy. I assume he was spying on other expat Americans, his friends. That’s probably why he was always cagey about it—the shame he felt about doing that.</p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>Matthiessen wrote about cultivating a source he dubbed “Monsieur X,” whom he called “a near fanatic” and “a veteran Communist agitator.” But there was speculation that he could’ve been spying on the novelist Richard Wright as well, right?</p>
<p>RICHARDSON</p>
<p>I would not have been surprised if he was reporting on Wright. Wright was being watched at the time by the CIA. And then Matthiessen turns up in Paris around the same time, and they have an overlapping social circle. It seems unlikely to me that he wouldn’t have reported back about Wright.</p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>What led him from spying to starting a magazine?</p>
<p>RICHARDSON</p>
<p>The problem with Matthiessen’s cover soon became clear—the labor of a writer is pretty invisible to the outside world. It looks like we’re just sitting inside and not doing anything at all. Matthiessen’s handler told him he needed a visible profession. And one day in one of the cafés he runs into Harold “Doc” Humes, another American who was running a magazine called the <em>Paris News Post</em>, which he had acquired for six hundred bucks, because that was the trend among expats in postwar Paris. Everyone had a little magazine going in that time—there was <em>Merlin</em>, <em>Points</em>, <em>Zero.</em></p>
<p>Humes was a real character, a bit of a loose cannon. He was wearing a cape when Matthiessen saw him at the café that day. He brought on Matthiessen as his fiction editor. But Matthiessen saw the <em>Paris News Post</em> as a lightweight endeavor. He suggested one day to Doc that they flick it off and make something better. Doc jumped at the idea—or, if you take his word for it, it was really his idea, and he planted it in Matthiessen’s head. Peter didn’t want to be the top editor, so he phoned up his friend George Plimpton, whom he’d known since they were children on the Upper East Side. Plimpton was in Cambridge, England, at the time, about to graduate, not sure what he was going to do with his life. And he seized the opportunity to come over to Paris and start editing this new magazine, with Matthiessen still on as the fiction editor.</p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>So, in a funny way, it was really the fact that writing is far too solitudinous an activity that gave us <em>The Paris Review</em>. Along with the CIA, of course. Matthiessen was intimately involved with choosing work for the first issues—he really did two jobs at once. I mean, it wasn’t like he was phoning it in at the magazine. But did the CIA ever give <em>The Paris Review </em>money?</p>
<p>RICHARDSON</p>
<p>The question of whether the CIA ever directly funded <em>The Paris Review</em> is an incredibly complicated one. The editors were all raising money to run the magazine, canvassing all their parents’ friends. Julius Fleischmann, of the instant-yeast family, was one of Matthiessen’s father’s friends. He and Matty Matthiessen would drink highballs on boats down in the Caribbean together. Fleischmann was a well-known philanthropist and arts patron, but it came out later that he was also a frontman for the CIA. So it’s hard to say, when he gave money to the <em>Review</em>, if it was his own money or if he was funneling it to the magazine through the Farfield Foundation, which the agency used to fund pro-Western propaganda.</p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>You write about “arguably the most contentious document in the <em>Paris Review</em> archive,” a letter from Matthiessen soliciting funding from Fleischmann. His donation was comparatively small—a thousand dollars.</p>
<p>RICHARDSON</p>
<p>That was still quite a lot of money, but not compared to the check that the Farfield Foundation sent to a more political London literary magazine called <em>Encounter</em> in the same year, 1953, for forty thousand dollars. A few years later, there’s a letter in the archive in which Plimpton gets his secretary to go back to Fleischmann for more money, and Fleischmann’s secretary says, Sorry, we can’t help you. So if the magazine really was of interest to the CIA as an ideological tool, why would they give a small donation and then decline any further donations later? I think they were interested in the magazine purely as a cover for Matthiessen, and once Matthiessen quit his spying job, in 1953, they no longer needed it. He was working as the fiction editor by then, and brought in stories like Sue Kaufman’s “Tea at Le Gord,” which Plimpton especially liked, and which appeared in the third issue. It’s about an American student negotiating the price of a homestay with a French woman.</p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>You could argue that, ideologically, the magazine’s founders toed the CIA line unintentionally. In the biography, you have this amazing quote from an interview Patsy Southgate gave to Talese in 1963—“They’re a bunch of reactionaries; their idea of a radical step is to eliminate the comma.” Did your research change your thinking about the politics of the magazine in those early days?</p>
<p>RICHARDSON</p>
<p>Talese is meticulous with his archives. In his basement on the Upper East Side there’s a box of files of interviews with all the original <em>Review</em> people, and he very graciously allowed me to see them. Southgate, by the time he spoke with her, was Matthiessen’s ex-wife, and she was quite bitter about their relationship and her time in Paris. She gave an interview where she’s strafing all the founders of the magazine, saying that they were trying on these bohemian masks because they were “very insecure about their maleness,” as a way of making up for not doing anything in the war—that it was very macho, and she was relegated to the kitchen. Her version of the story hadn’t really been told—and provides more of a feminist take on the early years of <em>The Paris Review</em>. A lot of the existing accounts of <em>The Paris Review</em>’s founding had involved a lot of mythmaking. They were more like Plimpton burnishing the legend of the magazine, the expat community, the parties, and the scrappiness of the staff—a legend that started somewhat unintentionally with Talese’s article in <em>Esquire</em>,which is actually fairly caustic about the privilege and entitlement of these young men. Talese did not come from that world. His father was a tailor—he always likes to tell that story—so he was skeptical of the whole thing. But because that article is so evocative of an era, he helped create the legend of <em>The Paris Review</em>, and then Plimpton ran with it, because that’s who he was.</p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>How do you think the revelations about Matthiessen’s intelligence work affected his relationship with Plimpton and the magazine? You note that his editorial correspondence with the <em>Review </em>mostly stopped sometime around the summer of 1955, and that once he moved back to New York he felt increasingly detached from the day-to-day operations. He would mail his story selections to Plimpton in Paris, whom he felt was “needlessly abrasive” in his responses to writers. They had a fight about this sometime in the late fifties or in 1960, at the latest, and Matthiessen resigned as fiction editor, though he remained on the magazine’s board as a founder. But it’s not until later that he decides to come clean about his CIA involvement. He told Plimpton in 1964 or ’65, and I don’t think there’s a record of how that went. But Humes, whom he told in ’66, had recently taken a heroic dose of LSD and had a breakdown—</p>
<p>RICHARDSON</p>
<p>Doc was in London having a mental health crisis, and Peter was like, Now is the right time to tell you that all of your paranoid fantasies are actually based in reality. His timing was a little questionable. Humes threatened to resign from the magazine afterward, and Plimpton had to talk him down—which meant Plimpton was now upset at Peter, too, for rocking the boat. Plimpton was shocked and outraged, too. Their friendship was already tinged with ambivalence. Plimpton looked at what Matthiessen was doing, and wanted to be a writer himself, but became better known as an editor. Matthiessen looked at Plimpton and, I think, saw him as a bit of dilettante. There was some animosity. I’m speculating here, but I imagine Plimpton resented that Matthiessen’s CIA affiliation gave a taint to his life’s project. There was a bit of grit in the shell even decades later. In 1988, Matthiessen submitted a short story to the magazine about a CIA agent, and Plimpton supposedly threw it across the room because he thought it was rubbish. Matthiessen got very mad about that. The story, “Lumumba Lives,” which was published in <em>Wigwag</em>, went on to become a runner-up for the O. Henry Award. But that reaction is telling—these were grown men throwing each other’s papers across the room.</p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>Maybe there’s also a difference in the ways they wore their <small>WASP</small> backgrounds. Both men came from rich, patrician families, eager to keep up appearances, worried about how things looked on the outside. I think of Plimpton with his table at Elaine’s, ever the bon vivant. Meanwhile, Matthiessen wrote of his urge to “simplify” himself. He craved acceptance from men with blue-collar backgrounds, and he took pains to expunge himself from the <em>Social Register</em>, literally. His interests in Zen and LSD, his ceaseless wandering—was he always, in a sense, running away from his past?</p>
<p>RICHARDSON</p>
<p>Matthiessen felt he had to atone for all the advantages he’d enjoyed coming from this powerful family. Around 1968, he got involved with social justice movements, with Cesar Chavez and then later with the American Indian Movement. He wrote a two-part <em>New Yorker </em>profile of Chavez, which he then expanded into a book. And then <em>In the Spirit of Crazy Horse</em>, his chronicle of the shoot-out at Pine Ridge in 1975, where two FBI agents and a Native man died, was the most controversial thing he ever wrote. He was subjected to a lawsuit from the governor of South Dakota and another from an active FBI agent. His third wife, Maria, said to me at one point that he felt like he had to make up for not only his own privilege, but to atone for all the dreadful things America had done. He took this enormous burden on his shoulders, and he put it on the shoulders of his children as well. It was part of the problem of his home life—his own neurosis about where he’d come from, which he then foisted onto his children.</p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>You write that his family “were often made to feel like rocks in his rucksack that he was desperate to offload.” Given that sense of conflict, and his later political leanings more generally, why do you think he could never fully admit what he’d done for the CIA?</p>
<p>RICHARDSON</p>
<p>He never legally had clearance to talk about it publicly. It wasn’t declassified. So on one level, he would say he wasn’t allowed to. On another level—and probably a more significant one—I think part of his evasiveness was just because there was shame involved for him. When he did get involved with Chavez’s United Farm Workers, and also the American Indian Movement, these were groups that had already been infiltrated by government agents. If Matthiessen were exposed as actually having <em>been</em> one of those government agents, he would lose all credibility with these people, and everything he’d done to further their cause would be thrown out the window. There’s an amazing letter that he wrote to Leonard Peltier in 2008, after the <em>Times</em> had run a piece about Doc Humes that mentioned the CIA link. And Matthiessen says that he’s ashamed of his former association, but that it had been over for more than half a century, and it never had anything to do with his commitment to Peltier’s cause. Leonard writes back and says, I’ve known about this for decades—it doesn’t matter at all.</p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>I notice that Matthiessen had a fondness for the word <em>primordial</em>—that he was attracted to an idea of prehistory, and that he sought out landscapes that still evoked the world as it was before humankind put it under the plow. What do you think was driving his wandering from place to place, and his interest in remoteness especially?</p>
<p>RICHARDSON</p>
<p>Matthiessen had this idea of what he called “the island.” He was always looking for a lost paradise, and in the late sixties he considered writing a book called “The Search for an Island.” His editor wrote in a memo that Matthiessen’s “most deep-felt interest is in finding a place isolated from the world.” Sometimes it was a physical place—he typed up a note once about having a “bay for crabs and oysters” and a house “close-chinked against the wind, with its pine fire and fat pile of drying wood”—but sometimes it was more of an abstraction. In either case it was a place where you could exist without all the encrustations of ego and the expectations that inevitably emerge as you become older. You’re in a childlike state. You can think of it as an Eden before the fall, a prelapsarian place where you can be your pure self without having to worry about, I don’t know, paying taxes and all the responsibilities we have as members of society.</p>
<p>He yearned for the island, and he found it in his life, in fleeting glimpses. The most important one he found was Shey Gompa, the “Crystal Monastery,” in Nepal. The weeks that he spent there were some of the happiest in his life, following the wolves or the blue sheep, meditating, just existing. I wanted to go there and physically be in that space. Even though I was only there briefly because I was ill, I got it. It’s an extraordinary place, so high that you feel like you’re at the edge of the atmosphere. I felt for a moment what it was he’d been searching for.</p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>What drew you to Matthiessen as a subject?</p>
<p>RICHARDSON</p>
<p>I read his book <em>The Snow Leopard</em> about fifteen years ago. It came out in 1978, and covers the two months he spent in the Himalayas, when he was mourning the death of his second wife and hoping to glimpse this legendarily elusive animal of the mountains<em>. </em>I couldn’t initially explain why this book struck me so forcefully. It was something about his sensibility. Matthiessen took science and spirituality—these two modes of thinking that we often treat as incompatible—and wrote in both registers simultaneously. I was really interested in how this allowed him to see the world. He had this unique capacity to glimpse these two separate traditions at once.</p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>And that led you to a kind of method biography in which you followed in his footsteps, taking a trip to the Himalayas like the one in <em>The Snow Leopard. </em>How did that trip—which you describe as somewhat disastrous—inform your biography?</p>
<p>RICHARDSON</p>
<p>Initially the idea of the trip to the Himalayas was just what I put in the book proposal, because I wanted to have an adventure. I wasn’t even planning on doing a biography. I was going to write a book about the landscape and animals Peter had written about. I was going to revisit them and see how they had changed. In the process of doing the research, it became clear that his life was so far-flung, that he had never settled, and that he had seen so much of the twentieth century from these unexpected angles. It was impossible to categorize his work, which was much more idiosyncratic than was sometimes believed—he wrote one novel, <em>Far Tortuga</em>, entirely in Caribbean dialect—and he never succeeded in figuring himself out. So I backed into the biography. But I had been like, Yeah, sure, I’ll go walk across the Himalayas. How hard can it be? I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I got very ill at that altitude. A doctor, when I got back, told me I had the symptoms of pulmonary edema. But it was worth it. I’d do it all again.</p>
<p>INTERVIEWER</p>
<p>Matthiessen wrote so well about the natural world and the environment, and yet he resented being pigeonholed as a nature writer. Why do you think he didn’t like that term?</p>
<p>RICHARDSON</p>
<p>He thought it was passive and soft. He was more interested in something aggressive or active that was connected to his desire to create change. He preferred the term “environmental writer”—he didn’t see a difference between being an environmental writer and being an environmental activist. But he resisted that, too, because in his mind, he was a novelist. He had a hierarchy of forms of writing, and at the very top was the novelist. When it came to nonfiction, he saw that as a lower tier, as a type of cabinetmaking, whereas fiction was art. He really bristled at having become more famous for his nonfiction than his fiction. And ultimately, in 2008, when he won the National Book Award for his novel <em>Shadow Country</em>, he saw that as a vindication. That meant more to him than all the success of <em>The Snow Leopard</em>, a book that he always felt very conflicted about—which I find extraordinary. If I wrote something on the level of <em>The Snow Leopard</em>, I would hang up my hat. I’d be done.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2025/11/12/ingress-nginx-retirement/">https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2025/11/12/ingress-nginx-retirement/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45921431">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To prioritize the safety and security of the ecosystem, Kubernetes SIG Network and the Security Response Committee are announcing the upcoming retirement of <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/">Ingress NGINX</a>. Best-effort maintenance will continue until March 2026. Afterward, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. <strong>Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will continue to function and installation artifacts will remain available.</strong></p><p>We recommend migrating to one of the many alternatives. Consider <a href="https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/">migrating to Gateway API</a>, the modern replacement for Ingress. If you must continue using Ingress, many alternative Ingress controllers are <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/">listed in the Kubernetes documentation</a>. Continue reading for further information about the history and current state of Ingress NGINX, as well as next steps.</p><h2 id="about-ingress-nginx">About Ingress NGINX</h2><p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/">Ingress</a> is the original user-friendly way to direct network traffic to workloads running on Kubernetes. (<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/">Gateway API</a> is a newer way to achieve many of the same goals.) In order for an Ingress to work in your cluster, there must be an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/">Ingress controller</a> running. There are many Ingress controller choices available, which serve the needs of different users and use cases. Some are cloud-provider specific, while others have more general applicability.</p><p><a href="https://www.github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">Ingress NGINX</a> was an Ingress controller, developed early in the history of the Kubernetes project as an example implementation of the API. It became very popular due to its tremendous flexibility, breadth of features, and independence from any particular cloud or infrastructure provider. Since those days, many other Ingress controllers have been created within the Kubernetes project by community groups, and by cloud native vendors. Ingress NGINX has continued to be one of the most popular, deployed as part of many hosted Kubernetes platforms and within innumerable independent users’ clusters.</p><h2 id="history-and-challenges">History and Challenges</h2><p>The breadth and flexibility of Ingress NGINX has caused maintenance challenges. Changing expectations about cloud native software have also added complications. What were once considered helpful options have sometimes come to be considered serious security flaws, such as the ability to add arbitrary NGINX configuration directives via the “snippets” annotations. Yesterday’s flexibility has become today’s insurmountable technical debt.</p><p>Despite the project’s popularity among users, Ingress NGINX has always struggled with insufficient or barely-sufficient maintainership. For years, the project has had only one or two people doing development work, on their own time, after work hours and on weekends. Last year, the Ingress NGINX maintainers <a href="https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1hoxW/securing-the-future-of-ingress-nginx-james-strong-isovalent-marco-ebert-giant-swarm">announced</a> their plans to wind down Ingress NGINX and develop a replacement controller together with the Gateway API community. Unfortunately, even that announcement failed to generate additional interest in helping maintain Ingress NGINX or develop InGate to replace it. (InGate development never progressed far enough to create a mature replacement; it will also be retired.)</p><h2 id="current-state-and-next-steps">Current State and Next Steps</h2><p>Currently, Ingress NGINX is receiving best-effort maintenance. SIG Network and the Security Response Committee have exhausted our efforts to find additional support to make Ingress NGINX sustainable. To prioritize user safety, we must retire the project.</p><p>In March 2026, Ingress NGINX maintenance will be halted, and the project will be <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-retired/">retired</a>. After that time, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. The GitHub repositories will be made read-only and left available for reference.</p><p>Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will not be broken. Existing project artifacts such as Helm charts and container images will remain available.</p><p>In most cases, you can check whether you use Ingress NGINX by running <code>kubectl get pods \--all-namespaces \--selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx</code> with cluster administrator permissions.</p><p>We would like to thank the Ingress NGINX maintainers for their work in creating and maintaining this project–their dedication remains impressive. This Ingress controller has powered billions of requests in datacenters and homelabs all around the world. In a lot of ways, Kubernetes wouldn’t be where it is without Ingress NGINX, and we are grateful for so many years of incredible effort.</p><p><strong>SIG Network and the Security Response Committee recommend that all Ingress NGINX users begin migration to Gateway API or another Ingress controller immediately.</strong> Many options are listed in the Kubernetes documentation: <a href="https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/">Gateway API</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/">Ingress</a>. Additional options may be available from vendors you work with.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin has landed the booster of its New Glenn mega-rocket on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean on just its second attempt — making it the second company to perform such a feat, following Elon Musk’s SpaceX.</p>

<p>It’s an accomplishment that will help the new rocket system become an option to send larger payloads to space, the moon, and beyond.</p>







<p>Thursday’s launch wasn’t just about the landing attempt, though. Roughly 34 minutes after takeoff, the upper stage of New Glenn successfully deployed the rocket’s first commercial payload: twin spacecraft for NASA that will travel to Mars to study the red planet’s atmosphere.</p>

<p>The pair of achievements are remarkable for the second-ever launch of such a massive rocket system. And it could put Blue Origin in position to compete with SpaceX, which dominates the world’s launch market with its Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starship rockets. </p>

<p>The accomplishment is noteworthy for the broader space industry, and one that SpaceX CEO Gwynne Shotwell acknowledged via a post on social media site X with a simple “Magnificent!” Musk even offered his own <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1989096465898303600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">congratulations</a> shortly after. </p>

<figure></figure>

<p>New Glenn’s first launch was in January, and Blue Origin experienced a number of delays in getting the second rocket to launch. The company had hoped to make a second attempt as early as the spring, but pushed it back multiple times. New Glenn finally made it to the launch pad on Sunday, but weather and solar storms delayed it further.</p>

<p>The rocket finally took off from Launch Complex 36 in Cape Canaveral, Florida on Thursday at around 3:55 p.m. ET. At about four minutes into the flight, the second stage separated and headed further into space, while the New Glenn booster began its journey back toward Earth. Roughly 10 minutes into the flight, the 189-foot-tall booster touched down on the platform.</p>

<p>Blue Origin had attempted to bring the New Glenn booster back on the rocket’s first flight in January. But the booster exploded before it had a chance to land on the drone ship. Blue Origin worked with the Federal Aviation Administration to identify and make a number of fixes to the rocket, and the company was confident it could stick the landing on attempt number two.</p>

<p>The ability to land a booster like this is an important step in making the rocket system reusable, which lowers the cost for customers — a capability that SpaceX has mastered. Blue Origin will now have to demonstrate the ability to refurbish the rocket booster and launch it again.</p>

<p>These are crucial capabilities for commercial customers and government missions. Blue Origin has had its eyes on the moon for years, and is currently developing a lunar lander. So is SpaceX, with Starship. But the government has asked them to speed up these programs, and acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy recently criticized SpaceX for moving too slowly.</p>







<p>Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/blue-origin-will-move-heaven-and-earth-to-help-nasa-reach-the-moon-faster-ceo-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently said in response</a> his company “will move heaven and Earth” to help NASA get back to the moon faster. But it can’t do that without successfully proving out all of New Glenn’s capabilities.</p>

<p>Thursday’s launch went a long way toward accomplishing that overarching goal.  </p>

      <p>
        OpenMANET is an open-source project for building Raspberry Pi–based MANET radios on Wi-Fi HaLow (915 MHz) using Morse Micro chipsets. 
        A MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network) is a self-forming wireless mesh where each node connects directly without centralized infrastructure. 
        This technology is especially useful in the civilian space for search and rescue, disaster response, airsoft events, and any disconnected communications scenario. 
        <span>Designed to be budget-friendly with excellent long-range performance.</span>
        The build is designed to integrate with ATAK over multicast, but works equally well over standard IP and internet links.

<p dir="auto">DBOS provides lightweight durable workflows built on top of Postgres.
Essentially, it helps you write long-lived, reliable code that can survive crashes, restarts, and failures without losing state or duplicating work.</p>
<p dir="auto">As your workflows run, DBOS checkpoints each step they take in a Postgres database.
When a process stops (fails, intentionally suspends, or a machine dies), your program can recover from those checkpoints to restore its exact state and continue from where it left off, as if nothing happened.</p>
<p dir="auto">In practice, this makes it easier to build reliable systems for use cases like AI agents, data synchronization, payments, or anything that takes minutes, days, or weeks to complete.
Rather than bolting on ad-hoc retry logic and database checkpoints, DBOS workflows give you one consistent model for ensuring your programs can recover from any failure from exactly where they left off.</p>
<p dir="auto">This library contains all you need to add durable workflows to your program: there's no separate service or orchestrator or any external dependencies except Postgres.
Because it's just a library, you can incrementally add it to your projects, and it works out of the box with frameworks like Spring.
And because it's built on Postgres, it natively supports all the tooling you're familiar with (backups, GUIs, CLI tools) and works with any Postgres provider.</p>

<details open=""><summary><strong>💾 Durable Workflows</strong></summary>

<p dir="auto">Workflows make your program <strong>durable</strong> by checkpointing its state in Postgres.
If your program ever fails, when it restarts all your workflows will automatically resume from the last completed step.</p>
<p dir="auto">You add durable workflows to your existing Java program in just a few lines of code by registering ordinary functions as workflows and steps:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="
interface Example {
    public void workflow();
}

class ExampleImpl implements Example {

    private void stepOne() {
        System.out.println(&quot;Step one completed!&quot;);
    }

    private void stepTwo() {
        System.out.println(&quot;Step two completed!&quot;);
    }

    @Workflow()
    public void workflow() {
        DBOS.runStep(() -> stepOne(), &quot;stepOne&quot;);
        DBOS.runStep(() -> stepTwo(), &quot;stepTwo&quot;);
    }
}"><pre><span>interface</span> <span>Example</span> {

<details><summary><strong>📒 Asynchronous execution </strong></summary>

<p dir="auto">You can run your workflows asynchronously without making any changes to their interface or implementation.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is ideal for long-running background workflows: you code can return at a later point and check the status for completion and/or retrieve the result.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="var handle = DBOS.startWorkflow(()->example.exampleWorkflow(&quot;HelloDBOS&quot;));

<details><summary><strong>📒 Durable Queues</strong></summary>

<p dir="auto">DBOS queues help you <strong>durably</strong> run distributed tasks.
You can enqueue a task from a durable workflow and one of your processes will pick it up for execution.
DBOS manages the execution of your tasks: it guarantees that tasks complete, and that their callers get their results without needing to resubmit them, even if your application is interrupted.</p>
<p dir="auto">Queues also provide flow control, so you can limit the concurrency of your tasks on a per-queue or per-process basis.
You can also set timeouts for tasks, rate limit how often queued tasks are executed, deduplicate tasks, or prioritize tasks.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can add queues to your workflows in just a couple lines of code.
They don't require a separate queueing service or message broker—just Postgres.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=" public void queuedTasks() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        String workflowId = &quot;child&quot; + i;
        var options = new StartWorkflowOptions(workflowId).withQueue(q);
        List<WorkflowHandle<String>> handles = new ArrayList<>();
        handles.add(DBOS.startWorkflow(()->simpleService.childWorkflow(workflowId), options));
    }

    for (int i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++) {
        String workflowId = &quot;child&quot;+i;
        var h = DBOS.retrieveWorkflow(workflowId);
        System.out.println(h.getResult());
    }
}

// In your main

DBOS.registerQueue(queue);"><pre> <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>queuedTasks</span>() {

<p dir="auto">Schedule workflows using cron syntax, or use durable sleep to pause workflows for as long as you like (even days or weeks) before executing.</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="

<details><summary><strong>📫 Durable Notifications</strong></summary>

<p dir="auto">Pause your workflow executions until a notification is received, or emit events from your workflow to send progress updates to external clients.
All notifications are stored in Postgres, so they can be sent and received with exactly-once semantics.
Set durable timeouts when waiting for events, so you can wait for as long as you like (even days or weeks) through interruptions or restarts, then resume once a notification arrives or the timeout is reached.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, build a reliable billing workflow that durably waits for a notification from a payments service, processing it exactly-once:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="@Workflow(name = &quot;billing&quot;)
public void billingWorkflow() {
    // Calculate the charge, then submit the bill to a payments service
    String paymentStatus = (String) DBOS.recv(PAYMENT_STATUS, paymentServiceTimeout);
    if (paymentStatus.equals(&quot;paid&quot;)) {
        // handle paid
    } else {
        // handle not paid
    }
}

@Workflow(name = &quot;payment&quot;) 
public void payment(String targetWorkflowId) {
    DBOS.send(targetWorkflowId, PAYMENT_STATUS, &quot;paid&quot;) ;
}
      "><pre><span>@</span><span>Workflow</span>(<span>name</span> = <span>"billing"</span>)
<span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>billingWorkflow</span>() {
    <span>// Calculate the charge, then submit the bill to a payments service</span>
    <span>String</span> <span>paymentStatus</span> = (<span>String</span>) <span>DBOS</span>.<span>recv</span>(<span>PAYMENT_STATUS</span>, <span>paymentServiceTimeout</span>);
    <span>if</span> (<span>paymentStatus</span>.<span>equals</span>(<span>"paid"</span>)) {
        <span>// handle paid</span>
    } <span>else</span> {
        <span>// handle not paid</span>
    }
}

<span>@</span><span>Workflow</span>(<span>name</span> = <span>"payment"</span>) 
<span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>payment</span>(<span>String</span> <span>targetWorkflowId</span>) {

<details><summary><strong>DBOS vs. Temporal</strong></summary>

<p dir="auto">Both DBOS and Temporal provide durable execution, but DBOS is implemented in a lightweight Postgres-backed library whereas Temporal is implemented in an externally orchestrated server.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can add DBOS to your program by installing the open-source library, connecting it to Postgres, and annotating workflows and steps.
By contrast, to add Temporal to your program, you must rearchitect your program to move your workflows and steps (activities) to a Temporal worker, configure a Temporal server to orchestrate those workflows, and access your workflows only through a Temporal client.
<a href="https://docs.dbos.dev/explanations/comparing-temporal" rel="nofollow">This page</a> makes the comparison in more detail.</p>
