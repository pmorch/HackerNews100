However, such treatments offer a very different outlook with regard to recurring revenue versus chronic therapies," analyst Salveen Richter wrote in the note to clients Tuesday. "While this proposition carries tremendous value for patients and society, it could represent a challenge for genome medicine developers looking for sustained cash flow."</p></div><div id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-105119182" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder" role="region" tabindex="0" data-vilynx-id="7000012181" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-105119182"><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105119335-2ED1-PL-MegT-040918.jpg?v=1529477963&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Biotech shares soar on dealmaking, drug progress"><span></span><span></span></p></div><div><p>Richter cited <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-1"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GILD/">Gilead Sciences'</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> treatments for hepatitis C, which achieved cure rates of more than 90 percent. The company's U.S. sales for these hepatitis C treatments peaked at $12.5 billion in 2015, but have been falling ever since.

"In the case of infectious diseases such as hepatitis C, curing existing patients also decreases the number of carriers able to transmit the virus to new patients, thus the incident pool also declines … Where an incident pool remains stable (eg, in cancer) the potential for a cure poses less risk to the sustainability of a franchise."</p><p>The analyst didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The report suggested three potential solutions for biotech firms:</p><div><p>"Solution 1: Address large markets: Hemophilia is a $9-10bn WW market (hemophilia A, B), growing at ~6-7% annually."</p><p> "Solution 2: Address disorders with high incidence: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) affects the cells (neurons) in the spinal cord, impacting the ability to walk, eat, or breathe."</p><p> "Solution 3: Constant innovation and portfolio expansion: There are hundreds of inherited retinal diseases (genetics forms of blindness) … Pace of innovation will also play a role as future programs can offset the declining revenue trajectory of prior assets."</p></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>The Call That Changed Everything</h2>
                    
                    <p>On January 7, 2025, at 5:02 PM, I received an email with a subject line that immediately caught my attention:</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        <p><strong>"Order N54HJG3V: Withdrawal of 2.93 ETH initiated. A representative will be in touch shortly before we mark the payment completed"</strong></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>Minutes later, my phone rang. The caller ID showed 1-805-885-0141. An American-sounding woman who identified herself as a Coinbase fraud prevention representative said someone had initiated a large transfer from my account and she was calling to confirm.</p>
                    
                    <p>What happened next was chilling: <strong>She knew my social security number. She knew my Bitcoin balance down to the decimal point. She knew personal details that should have been impossible for a scammer to possess.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>This wasn't just another phishing attempt. This was something far more sophisticated.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>The Timeline That Doesn't Make Sense</h2>
                    
                    <p>Here's where the story gets interesting—and troubling:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>January 7, 2025:</strong> I was attacked by scammers with detailed personal information</li>
                        <li><strong>January 7, 2025:</strong> I reported the attack to Coinbase security@coinbase.com</li>
                        <li><strong>January 7, 2025 (same day):</strong> Brett Farmer, Head of Trust &amp; Safety, responded: "This report is super robust and gives us a lot to look into. We are investigating this scammer now."</li>
                        <li><strong>January 13, 2025:</strong> I asked Coinbase: "How did the attacker know the balance of my bitcoin holdings?" <em>(No response)</em></li>
                        <li><strong>January 17, 2025:</strong> I followed up again, asking for a reply <em>(No response)</em></li>
                        <li><strong>January 22, 2025:</strong> Still no answer to my critical question <em>(No response)</em></li>
                        <li><strong>January 29, 2025:</strong> I asked again: "Could I please get a response?" <em>(No response)</em></li>
                        <li><strong>May 11, 2025:</strong> Coinbase says they became aware of the breach (when attackers demanded $20M ransom)</li>
                        <li><strong>May 15, 2025:</strong> Coinbase publicly disclosed the breach</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>That's a four-month gap.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>For four months, I had concrete evidence that attackers possessed detailed Coinbase customer data. For four months, I repeatedly asked Coinbase to explain how this was possible. And for four months, my questions went unanswered.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Coinbase never replied to a single follow-up email after Brett Farmer's initial response.</strong> Despite his promise that they were "investigating this scammer," the most important question—how the attacker obtained my private account data—was met with complete silence.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>What We Now Know About the Breach</h2>
                    
                    <p>In May 2025, Coinbase finally disclosed what had happened: cybercriminals had bribed overseas customer support contractors—particularly employees at TaskUs in India—to steal sensitive customer data.</p>
                    
                    <p>The compromised information included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Names, addresses, and phone numbers</li>
                        <li>Email addresses</li>
                        <li>Last four digits of Social Security numbers</li>
                        <li>Government-issued ID images</li>
                        <li>Account balances</li>
                        <li>Transaction histories</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Coinbase estimated the financial impact at <strong>$180-400 million</strong>, affecting less than 1% of their customer base. Over 200 TaskUs employees were ultimately terminated.</p>
                    
                    <p>But here's the crucial question: <strong>If attackers were actively using stolen data to target customers in January, when did the actual breach occur? And when did Coinbase first become aware that something was wrong?</strong></p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>What I Reported to Coinbase</h2>
                    
                    <p>On January 7, 2025, immediately after recognizing the attack, I sent a comprehensive security report to Coinbase's security team. This wasn't a vague complaint—it was a detailed technical analysis that should have raised immediate red flags about a data breach.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>My report included:</strong></p>
                    
                    <ul>
                            <li><strong>Full email headers:</strong> Complete technical headers showing the email was routed through Amazon SES (a32-86.smtp-out.amazonses.com), not Coinbase's own mail servers, despite appearing to come from commerce@coinbase.com</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>DKIM signature analysis:</strong> Documentation that while the email passed DKIM validation for both coinbase.com and amazonses.com, the actual sending infrastructure was suspicious</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>The phishing email content:</strong> The complete HTML email with its fake "suspicious activity" warning and fraudulent transaction details (Order N54HJG3V, 2.93 ETH withdrawal)</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Phone number used:</strong> 1-805-885-0141 (later confirmed to be a Google Voice number)</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Voice recording:</strong> An audio recording of my second call with the scammer, capturing the entire conversation where she demonstrated knowledge of my personal information</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Specific data the attacker possessed:</strong> A detailed list of what the scammer knew, including:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>My Social Security number</li>
                                    <li>My exact Bitcoin balance</li>
                                    <li>My account signup date</li>
                                    <li>Driver's license information</li>
                                    <li>The amount of the fabricated "suspicious transfer"</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Attack methodology:</strong> Description of their social engineering tactics, including the attempt to get me to move funds to "a cold wallet" by downloading Coinbase Wallet</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Red flags I identified:</strong> The inability of the caller to authenticate herself, the Google Voice callback number, the lack of any notifications in my actual Coinbase account</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Post-call SMS flooding:</strong> Documentation that immediately after the call, I received hundreds of spam text messages for random service signups—a potential attempt to hide legitimate 2FA codes or security alerts in the noise</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>This wasn't a typical phishing report. <strong>I specifically highlighted that the attacker had access to non-public account information that should have been impossible to obtain without either a device compromise on my end or a data breach at Coinbase.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Brett Farmer, Coinbase's Head of Trust &amp; Safety, responded the same day, calling it a "super robust" report that gave them "a lot to look into."</p>
                    
                    <p>But when I followed up six days later with the key question—<em>"How did the attacker know the balance of my bitcoin holdings?"</em>—the conversation ended. That question, which should have immediately triggered an internal investigation into potential data compromise, was never answered.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>The Attack: A Perfect Impersonation</h2>
                    
                    <p>The sophistication of this attack cannot be overstated. Let me walk you through what made it so convincing—and what ultimately saved me.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Email: Remarkably Convincing</h3>
                    
                    <p>The phishing email I received looked completely legitimate at first glance:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>From:</strong> Coinbase Commerce &lt;commerce@coinbase.com&gt;</li>
                        <li><strong>DKIM signatures:</strong> Passed validation for both coinbase.com and amazonses.com</li>
                        <li><strong>Professional formatting:</strong> Perfect HTML layout, correct branding, legitimate-looking transaction details</li>
                        <li><strong>Convincing narrative:</strong> "We detected suspicious activity on your account. A fraud prevention representative will be in touch shortly..."</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The email even included what appeared to be a verification code (96841) and assigned me a specific case agent ("Sarah Schueler"). This level of detail gave it tremendous credibility.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Critical Red Flag: Amazon SES</h3>
                    
                    <p>But when I examined the email headers more carefully, I found something suspicious:</p>
                    
                    <pre>Received: from a32-86.smtp-out.amazonses.com (a32-86.smtp-out.amazonses.com. [54.240.32.86])
Return-Path: &lt;01000194436f122c-535a7ce0-f493-41c2-b966-dcaa1a9e6b57-000000@amazonses.com&gt;
                    </pre>
                    
                    <p>The email was sent through <strong>Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)</strong>, not Coinbase's own servers. While Coinbase might use Amazon infrastructure, this raised my suspicion. A legitimate security-critical email about fraud should come through more controlled channels.</p>

                    <h3>The Phone Call: Even More Convincing (And Recorded)</h3>
                    
                    <p>When the woman called me, she was professional, intelligent, and sounded exactly like a legitimate customer service representative. She had information that seemed impossible for a scammer to possess:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>My exact Bitcoin balance</li>
                        <li>My account signup date</li>
                        <li>My driver's license details</li>
                        <li>My Social Security number</li>
                        <li>The amount of the "suspicious transfer" (2.93 ETH)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>During our conversation, I asked her to authenticate herself. Here's where things got interesting.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>How I Detected It Was a Scam</h2>
                    
                    <p>Despite the sophistication of the attack, several red flags eventually convinced me this was fraudulent:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Red Flag #1: The Authentication Problem</h3>
                    
                    <p>I asked the caller to prove she was from Coinbase. She offered to read me my personal information—but I already knew she had that information. That's not authentication; that's just proving she has stolen data.</p>
                    
                    <p>When I suggested she send me an email from a verified Coinbase address that I could reply to, she claimed she didn't have access to personal email addresses and could only use generic support channels. <strong>A fraud prevention specialist without the ability to send verified emails? That didn't add up.</strong></p>
                    
                    <h3>Red Flag #2: The Callback Issue</h3>
                    
                    <p>When I asked if I could call her back, she said I couldn't reach her because she was "in the fraud department." After the call, I tried calling the number back: <strong>it was a Google Voice number.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Legitimate financial institutions always provide callback numbers that route to their main systems. A Google Voice number is a massive red flag.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Red Flag #3: Email Verification Confusion</h3>
                    
                    <p>When I challenged the authenticity of the email sender, the caller insisted that Amazon was just Coinbase's "service provider" and that the DKIM signatures proved legitimacy. But when pressed, she couldn't explain away the anomalies in a satisfactory way.</p>
                    
                    <p>The conversation on the recorded call shows my growing skepticism:</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        <p><strong>Me:</strong> "I don't think there is enough information provided for me to authenticate you."</p>
                        <p><strong>Caller:</strong> "I'm not sure what you would like me to do..."</p>
                        <p><strong>Me:</strong> "There are just too many red flags."</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <h3>Red Flag #4: No Notifications in My Account</h3>
                    
                    <p>After the call, I logged into my actual Coinbase account. There were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No notifications about the alleged transfer</li>
                        <li>No new login attempts</li>
                        <li>No new authorized devices</li>
                        <li>No actual transaction matching what the caller described</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>If this were real, there would have been notifications everywhere.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Red Flag #5: The Pressure to Use Coinbase Wallet</h3>
                    
                    <p>The caller wanted me to move my cryptocurrency to "a cold wallet" and started walking me through downloading Coinbase Wallet. <strong>This is a classic social engineering tactic—get the victim to move funds to an address controlled by the attacker.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>I didn't follow through, so I never discovered exactly how they planned to steal the funds, but the intent was clear.</p>

                    <h2>The SMS Flooding Attack: A Sinister Twist</h2>
                    
                    <p>Here's where things got even more concerning. Immediately after I ended the call with the scammer, <strong>my phone was bombarded with hundreds of text messages—random service signups, verification codes, newsletters, everything imaginable.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>At first, I thought this was just a vindictive "FU" from the scammer. But the timing and volume suggest something more calculated: <strong>SMS flooding is a known technique to hide legitimate security alerts in noise.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>The attack works like this:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Scammer floods your phone with spam texts</li>
                        <li>While you're overwhelmed, they attempt account takeovers on various services</li>
                        <li>Real 2FA codes and security alerts get buried in the flood</li>
                        <li>You miss the critical warnings because they're hidden among hundreds of spam messages</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>This could have been an attempt to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hijack my SMS-based two-factor authentication</li>
                        <li>Hide real alerts from Coinbase or other services</li>
                        <li>Overwhelm me while they attempted unauthorized access to various accounts</li>
                        <li>Create confusion and distract from their next moves</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>This wasn't just a phishing call—it was a coordinated, multi-vector attack.</strong></p>

                    <h2>What Coinbase Got Wrong</h2>
                    
                    <p>Coinbase's handling of this breach raises serious questions:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Outsourcing Security-Sensitive Roles</h3>
                    
                    <p>Customer support agents at third-party contractors had access to extremely sensitive data: Social Security numbers, account balances, transaction histories, and personal documents. <strong>Why were overseas contractors given such privileged access?</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>The economics of the bribery scheme tell the story: attackers likely paid relatively small amounts to contractors earning modest wages to access data they then used to attempt thefts worth potentially millions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Failed Detection Systems</h3>
                    
                    <p>Coinbase claims they "discovered" the breach on May 11, 2025, when attackers attempted to extort $20 million. But my case—and likely many others—proves the breach was being actively exploited months earlier.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What monitoring systems failed to detect that customer data was being used in sophisticated phishing attacks?</strong> I reported this in January with specific details about how the attacker knew my information. That report should have triggered alarm bells.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Inadequate Response to User Reports</h3>
                    
                    <p>On January 7, 2025, I submitted a detailed security report to Coinbase. Brett Farmer, Head of Trust &amp; Safety, responded on January 7:</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Hey Jonathan, I just wanted to send a personal note and thank you for this information. This report is super robust and gives us a lot to look into. We are investigating this scammer now."</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>But when I followed up with the critical question—"How did the attacker know the balance of my bitcoin holdings?"—my subsequent emails went unanswered:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>January 13: "Do you have any updates on this incident?"</li>
                        <li>January 17: "Could I please get a reply on my question below?"</li>
                        <li>January 22: "Could I please get an update to my question as to how the attacker was able to determine my coinbase bitcoin balance?"</li>
                        <li>January 29: "Could I please get a response?"</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>My question was specific and technical. It went to the heart of what should have been a massive red flag: How did attackers have access to non-public account data?</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Had Coinbase investigated this seriously in January, they might have discovered the insider threat months earlier and prevented additional victims.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. The Disclosure Timeline</h3>
                    
                    <p>Coinbase says they "became aware" of the breach on May 11, 2025. But my January attack proves the breach was active at least four months earlier. This raises uncomfortable questions:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>When did the actual data exfiltration occur? Late 2024?</li>
                        <li>How many other victims reported similar attacks between January and May?</li>
                        <li>Were those reports properly escalated and investigated?</li>
                        <li>Would Coinbase have disclosed the breach if not for the extortion attempt?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>Lessons Learned: How to Protect Yourself</h2>
                    
                    <p>The sad reality is that when a major platform gets breached, your personal information may already be in attackers' hands. But you can still protect yourself from falling victim to the scams that follow:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Never Trust Caller ID</h3>
                    
                    <p>Phone numbers can be spoofed. Even if the caller ID shows a legitimate company, don't trust it. Always hang up and call back using a number you independently verify (from the company's official website, not from the email or caller).</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Ask the caller for their callback number, then look up that number online before calling it back. Search for "[phone number] scam" or "[phone number] reviews" to see if others have reported it as fraudulent. In my case, when I called back the number the scammer gave me (1-805-885-0141), it turned out to be a Google Voice number—an instant red flag. Legitimate corporate support lines won't use Google Voice.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Understand That Scammers May Have Your Personal Info</h3>
                    
                    <p>In the age of massive data breaches, assume attackers may know:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your name, address, phone number, email</li>
                        <li>Last 4 digits of your SSN</li>
                        <li>Your account balances and transaction history</li>
                        <li>Other "secret" information you thought was secure</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Just because someone knows this information doesn't mean they're legitimate.</strong> Authentication needs to work both ways.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Verify Email Headers</h3>
                    
                    <p>Learn to check email headers. Look for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The actual sending server (not just the "From" address)</li>
                        <li>SPF, DKIM, and DMARC validation results</li>
                        <li>Unusual routing or relay servers</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>In my case, the Amazon SES sending address was the tip-off, even though DKIM signatures technically validated.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you're not sure how to interpret email headers, copy the full headers and paste them into a good AI assistant (like ChatGPT or Claude) and ask: "Analyze these email headers and tell me if there are any red flags or signs this could be a phishing email." AI tools are excellent at spotting anomalies in technical data like email routing.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Demand Proper Authentication</h3>
                    
                    <p>If someone calls claiming to be from your bank, exchange, or other financial institution, <strong>they should be able to authenticate themselves to you, not just read back information they already have.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Legitimate companies can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Send you emails from verified domain addresses you can reply to</li>
                        <li>Provide callback numbers that route through their main system</li>
                        <li>Verify their identity through the app or website you're already logged into</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>5. Check Your Account Directly</h3>
                    
                    <p>If someone alerts you to suspicious activity, don't trust the email or call. Open a browser, type in the company's URL directly (don't click links), log in, and check for yourself. If there's really a problem, it will show up in your account.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6. Never Move Funds Under Pressure</h3>
                    
                    <p>Legitimate companies will never pressure you to immediately move your funds, download software, or take urgent action to "protect" your account. <strong>That pressure is the scam.</strong></p>
                    
                    <h3>7. Use App-Based or Hardware 2FA, Not SMS</h3>
                    
                    <p>My experience with SMS flooding shows why SMS-based two-factor authentication is vulnerable. Use:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hardware security keys (YubiKey, Titan)</li>
                        <li>Authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy)</li>
                        <li>Platform-specific authentication (like Coinbase's app-based approval)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>SMS can be hijacked, flooded, or intercepted.</p>
                    
                    <h3>8. Report Everything</h3>
                    
                    <p>If you're targeted by a sophisticated attack, report it immediately and provide as much detail as possible:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Full email headers</li>
                        <li>Phone numbers used</li>
                        <li>Specific information the attacker knew</li>
                        <li>Recording of calls if possible (check your local laws)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Your report might be the data point that helps the company detect a breach.</p>

                    <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
                    
                    <p>My case represents just one data point in what appears to be a months-long campaign of attacks enabled by the Coinbase breach. How many other customers were targeted between January and May? How many fell for these scams because they didn't catch the red flags I did?</p>
                    
                    <p>Coinbase has committed to reimbursing customers who were defrauded. But the $180-400 million estimated cost of this breach doesn't just represent reimbursements—it represents the human cost of trust betrayed, security compromised, and warnings ignored.</p>
                    
                    <p>The cryptocurrency industry promises decentralization and security, but incidents like this expose the risks of centralized custody. When you trust an exchange with your assets and personal information, you're trusting their security practices, their contractor oversight, and their incident response capabilities.</p>
                    
                    <p>In this case, that trust was misplaced.</p>

                    <h2>Unanswered Questions</h2>
                    
                    <p>Four months after my attack, and several months after Coinbase's disclosure, key questions remain:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>When did the actual breach occur?</strong> My January attack suggests late 2024 at the latest.</li>

                    <h2>Conclusion: The Timeline Matters</h2>
                    
                    <p>The discrepancy between my January attack and Coinbase's May disclosure isn't just an interesting footnote—it's a critical part of understanding what went wrong and who bears responsibility.</p>
                    
                    <p>My emails, timestamped and documented, prove that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The breach was being actively exploited months before Coinbase's "discovery"</li>
                        <li>A customer reported detailed evidence of the attack and asked specific questions about data compromise</li>
                        <li>Those questions went unanswered for months</li>
                        <li>The breach was only disclosed after attackers attempted extortion</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>I was one of the lucky ones—I detected the scam and didn't lose funds. But how many others weren't so fortunate during those four months of silence?</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Coinbase's Head of Trust &amp; Safety called my initial report "super robust" and said it gave them "a lot to look into." But when I asked the one question that mattered most—how did the attacker have my data?—the company went silent.</p>
                    
                    <p>That silence lasted 120 days.</p>
                    
                    <p>And that's the real story behind the $400 million breach.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Supercookie</strong> uses favicons to assign a unique identifier to website visitors.<br>
Unlike traditional tracking methods, this ID can be stored almost persistently and cannot be easily cleared by the user.</p>
<p dir="auto">The tracking method works even in the browser's incognito mode and is not cleared by flushing the cache, closing the browser or restarting the operating system, using a VPN or installing AdBlockers. 🍿 <a href="https://supercookie.me/" rel="nofollow">Live demo</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Modern browsers offer a wide range of features to improve and simplify the user experience.
One of these features are the so-called favicons: A favicon is a small (usually 16×16 or 32×32 pixels) logo used by web browsers to brand a website in a recognizable way. Favicons are usually shown by most browsers in the address bar and next to the page's name in a list of bookmarks.</p>
<p dir="auto">To serve a favicon on their website, a developer has to include an  attribute in the webpage’s header. If this tag does exist, the browser requests the icon from the predefined source and if the server response contains an valid icon file that can be properly rendered this icon is displayed by the browser. In any other case, a blank favicon is shown.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="<link rel=&quot;icon&quot; href=&quot;/favicon.ico&quot; type=&quot;image/x-icon&quot;>"><pre><span>&lt;</span><span>link</span> <span>rel</span>="<span>icon</span>" <span>href</span>="<span>/favicon.ico</span>" <span>type</span>="<span>image/x-icon</span>"<span>&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The favicons must be made very easily accessible by the browser. Therefore, they are cached in a separate local database on the system, called the favicon cache (F-Cache). A F-Cache data entries includes the visited URL (subdomain, domain, route, URL paramter), the favicon ID and the time to live (TTL).
While this provides web developers the ability to delineate parts of their website using a wide variety of icons for individual routes and subdomains, it also leads to a possible tracking scenario.</p>
<p dir="auto">When a user visits a website, the browser checks if a favicon is needed by looking up the source of the shortcut icon link reference of the requested webpage.
The browser initialy checks the local F-cache for an entry containing the URL of the active website. If a favicon entry exists, the icon will be loaded from the cache and then displayed. However, if there is no entry, for example because no favicon has ever been loaded under this particular domain, or the data in the cache is out of date, the browser makes a GET request to the server to load the site's favicon.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://supercookie.me/workwise#content-threat-model" rel="nofollow">💣 Threat Model</a></h3><a id="user-content--threat-model" aria-label="Permalink: 💣 Threat Model" href="#-threat-model"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the article a possible threat model is explained that allows to assign a unique identifier to each browser in order to draw conclusions about the user and to be able to identify this user even in case of applied anti-fingerprint measures, such as the use of a VPN, deletion of cookies, deletion of the browser cache or manipulation of the client header information.</p>
<p dir="auto">A web server can draw conclusions about whether a browser has already loaded a favicon or not:
So when the browser requests a web page, if the favicon is not in the local F-cache, another request for the favicon is made. If the icon already exists in the F-Cache, no further request is sent.
By combining the state of delivered and not delivered favicons for specific URL paths for a browser, a unique pattern (identification number) can be assigned to the client.
When the website is reloaded, the web server can reconstruct the identification number with the network requests sent by the client for the missing favicons and thus identify the browser.</p>

<p dir="auto">By varying the number of bits that corresponds to the number of redirects to subpaths, this attack can be scaled almost arbitrarily.
It can distinguish 2^N unique users, where N is the number of redirects on the client side.
The time taken for the read and write operation increases as the number of distinguishable clients does.
<br>
In order to keep the number of redirects as minimal as possible, N can have a dynamic length.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>By far the most popular npm package I’ve ever written is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/blob-util"><code>blob-util</code></a>, which is ~10 years old and still gets 5+ million weekly downloads.</p>
<p>It’s a small collection of utilities for working with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob"><code>Blob</code>s</a> in JavaScript. I wrote it because I found that PouchDB users were endlessly confused about how to work with <code>Blob</code>s and how to convert them to strings, <code>ArrayBuffer</code>s, etc.</p>
<p>Given that <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/ai#sentiment-and-usage">some 80% of developers</a> are now using AI in their regular work, <code>blob-util</code> is almost certainly the kind of thing that most developers would just happily have an LLM generate for them. Sure, you <em>could</em> use <code>blob-util</code>, but then you’d be taking on an extra dependency, with unknown performance, maintenance, and supply-chain risks.</p>
<p>And sure enough, Claude will happily spit out whatever <code>Blob</code> utilities you need when prompted:</p>
<p><em>&gt; Write me a utility function in TypeScript to convert a Blob to an ArrayBuffer. It should return a Promise.</em></p>
<pre title="">function blobToArrayBuffer(blob: Blob): Promise&lt;ArrayBuffer&gt; {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
    const reader = new FileReader();

    reader.onload = () =&gt; {
      if (reader.result instanceof ArrayBuffer) {
        resolve(reader.result);
      } else {
        reject(new Error('Failed to read Blob as ArrayBuffer'));
      }
    };

    reader.onerror = () =&gt; {
      reject(reader.error);
    };

    reader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob);
  });
}
</pre>
<p>Claude’s version is pretty close to <a href="https://github.com/nolanlawson/blob-util/blob/99c06472d18329eda1421286692bd875d76d5c9c/src/blob-util.ts#L384-L394">the <code>blob-util</code> version</a> (unsurprising, since it was probably trained on it!). Although it’s much more verbose, unnecessarily checking if <code>readAsArrayBuffer</code> actually gives you an <code>ArrayBuffer</code> (although this does make TypeScript happy). To be fair, it also improves on my implementation by directly <code>reject</code>ing with an error rather than the more awkward <code>onerror</code> event.</p>

<p>I suppose some people would see this as progress: fewer dependencies, more robust code (even if it’s a bit more verbose), quicker turnaround time than the old “search npm, find a package, read the docs, install it” approach.</p>
<p>I don’t have any excessive pride in this library, and I don’t particularly care if the download numbers go up or down. But I do think something is lost with the AI approach. When I wrote <code>blob-util</code>, I took a teacher’s mentality: the README has <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/blob-util#tutorial">a cutesy and whimsical tutorial</a> featuring Kirby, in all his blobby glory. (I had a thing for putting Nintendo characters in all my stuff at the time.)</p>
<p>The goal wasn’t just to give you a utility to solve your problem (although it does that) – the goal was also to <em>teach</em> people how to use JavaScript effectively, so that you’d have an understanding of how to solve other problems in the future.</p>
<p>I don’t know which direction we’re going in with AI (well, ~80% of us; to the remaining holdouts, I salute you and wish you godspeed!), but I do think it’s a future where we prize instant answers over teaching and understanding. There’s less reason to use something like <code>blob-util</code>, which means there’s less reason to write it in the first place, and therefore less reason to educate people about the problem space.</p>
<p>Even now there’s a movement toward putting documentation in an <a href="https://llmstxt.org/"><code>llms.txt</code></a> file, so you can just point an agent at it and save your brain cells the effort of deciphering English prose. (Is this even documentation anymore? What <em>is</em> documentation?)</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I still believe in open source, and I’m still doing it (in fits and starts). But one thing has become clear to me: the era of small, low-value libraries like <code>blob-util</code> is over. They were already on their way out thanks to Node.js and the browser taking on more and more of their functionality (see <code>node:glob</code>, <code>structuredClone</code>, etc.), but LLMs are the final nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>This does mean that there’s less opportunity to use these libraries as a springboard for user education (Underscore.js <a href="https://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore-esm.html">also had this philosophy</a>), but maybe that’s okay. If there’s no need to find a library to, say, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/groupBy">group the items in an array</a>, then maybe learning about the mechanics of such libraries is unnecessary. Many software developers will argue that asking a candidate to reverse a binary tree is pointless, since it never comes up in the day-to-day job, so maybe the same can be said for utility libraries.</p>
<p>I’m still trying to figure out what <em>kinds</em> of open source are worth writing in this new era (hint: ones that an LLM can’t just spit out on command), and where education is the most lacking. My current thinking is that the most value is in bigger projects, more inventive projects, or in more niche topics not covered in an LLM’s training data. For example, I look back on my work on <a href="https://github.com/nolanlawson/fuite"><code>fuite</code></a> and various <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2022/01/05/memory-leaks-the-forgotten-side-of-web-performance/">memory-leak-hunting blog posts</a>, and I’m pretty satisfied that an LLM couldn’t reproduce this, because it requires novel research and creative techniques. (Although who knows: maybe someday an agent will be able to just bang its head against Chrome heap snapshots until it finds the leak. I’ll believe it when I see it.)</p>
<p>There’s been a lot of hand-wringing lately about where open source fits in in a world of LLMs, but I still see people pushing the boundaries. For example, a lot of naysayers think there’s no point in writing a new JavaScript framework, since LLMs are so heavily trained on React, but then there goes the indefatigable <a href="https://github.com/trueadm">Dominic Gannaway</a> writing <a href="https://www.ripplejs.com/">Ripple.js</a>, yet another JavaScript framework (and with <a href="https://podrocket.logrocket.com/ripple-js-dominic-gannaway-logrocket-podrocket">some new ideas</a>, to boot!). This is the kind of thing I like to see: humans laughing in the face of the machine, going on with their human thing.</p>
<p>So if there’s a conclusion to this meandering blog post (excuse my squishy human brain; I didn’t use an LLM to write this), it’s just that: yes, LLMs have made some kinds of open source obsolete, but there’s still plenty of open source left to write. I’m excited to see what kinds of novel and unexpected things you all come up with.</p>

</div>

<p>After months of agentic coding frenzy, Twitter is still ablaze with discussions about MCP servers. I previously did some <a href="https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-08-15-mcp-vs-cli/">very light benchmarking</a> to see if Bash tools or MCP servers are better suited for a specific task. The TL;DR: both can be efficient if you take care.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of the most popular MCP servers are inefficient for a specific task. They need to cover all bases, which means they provide large numbers of tools with lengthy descriptions, consuming significant context.</p>
<p>It's also hard to extend an existing MCP server. You could check out the source and modify it, but then you'd have to understand the codebase, together with your agent.</p>
<p>MCP servers also aren't composable. Results returned by an MCP server have to go through the agent's context to be persisted to disk or combined with other results.</p>
<p>I'm a simple boy, so I like simple things. Agents can run Bash and write code well. Bash and code are composable. So what's simpler than having your agent just invoke CLI tools and write code? This is nothing new. We've all been doing this since the beginning. I'd just like to convince you that in many situations, you don't need or even want an MCP server.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate this with a common MCP server use case: browser dev tools.</p>
<h2 id="toc_0">My Browser DevTools Use Cases</h2>
<p>My use cases are working on web frontends together with my agent, or abusing my agent to become a scrapey little hacker boy so I can scrape all the data in the world. For these two use cases, I only need a minimal set of tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start the browser, optionally with my default profile so I'm logged in</li>
<li>Navigate to a URL, either in the active tab or a new tab</li>
<li>Execute JavaScript in the active page context</li>
<li>Take a screenshot of the viewport</li>
</ul>
<p>And if my use case requires additional special tooling, I want to quickly have my agent generate that for me and slot it in with the other tools.</p>
<h2 id="toc_1">Problems with Common Browser DevTools for Your Agent</h2>
<p>People will recommend <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">Playwright MCP</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp">Chrome DevTools MCP</a> for the use cases I illustrated above. Both are fine, but they need to cover all the bases. Playwright MCP has 21 tools using 13.7k tokens (6.8% of Claude's context). Chrome DevTools MCP has 26 tools using 18.0k tokens (9.0%). That many tools will confuse your agent, especially when combined with other MCP servers and built-in tools.</p>
<p>Using those tools also means you suffer from the composability issue: any output has to go through your agent's context. You can kind of fix this by using sub-agents, but then you rope in all the issues that sub-agents come with.</p>
<h2 id="toc_2">Embracing Bash (and Code)</h2>
<p>Here's my minimal set of tools, illustrated via the README.md:</p>
<pre><code><span># Browser Tools</span>

Minimal CDP tools for collaborative site exploration.

<span>## Start Chrome</span>

\<span>`\`</span>\`bash
./start.js              # Fresh profile
./start.js --profile    # Copy your profile (cookies, logins)
\<span>`\`</span>\`

Start Chrome on <span>`:9222`</span> with remote debugging.

<span>## Navigate</span>

\<span>`\`</span>\`bash
./nav.js https://example.com
./nav.js https://example.com --new
\<span>`\`</span>\`

Navigate current tab or open new tab.

<span>## Evaluate JavaScript</span>

\<span>`\`</span>\`bash
./eval.js 'document.title'
./eval.js 'document.querySelectorAll("a").length'
\<span>`\`</span>\`

Execute JavaScript in active tab (async context).

<span>## Screenshot</span>

\<span>`\`</span>\`bash
./screenshot.js
\<span>`\`</span>\`

Screenshot current viewport, returns temp file path.
</code></pre><p>This is all I feed to my agent. It's a handful of tools that cover all the bases for my use case. Each tool is a simple Node.js script that uses <a href="https://pptr.dev/">Puppeteer Core</a>. By reading that README, the agent knows the available tools, when to use them, and how to use them via Bash.</p>
<p>When I start a session where the agent needs to interact with a browser, I just tell it to read that file in full and that's all it needs to be effective. Let's walk through their implementations to see how little code this actually is.</p>
<h3 id="toc_3">The Start Tool</h3>
<p>The agent needs to be able to start a new browser session. For scraping tasks, I often want to use my actual Chrome profile so I'm logged in everywhere. This script either rsyncs my Chrome profile to a temporary folder (Chrome doesn't allow debugging on the default profile), or starts fresh:</p>
<pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env node</span>

<span>import</span> { spawn, execSync } <span>from</span> <span>"node:child_process"</span>;
<span>import</span> puppeteer <span>from</span> <span>"puppeteer-core"</span>;

<span>const</span> useProfile = process.<span>argv</span>[<span>2</span>] === <span>"--profile"</span>;

<span>if</span> (process.<span>argv</span>[<span>2</span>] &amp;&amp; process.<span>argv</span>[<span>2</span>] !== <span>"--profile"</span>) {
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"Usage: start.ts [--profile]"</span>);
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"\nOptions:"</span>);
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"  --profile  Copy your default Chrome profile (cookies, logins)"</span>);
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"\nExamples:"</span>);
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"  start.ts            # Start with fresh profile"</span>);
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"  start.ts --profile  # Start with your Chrome profile"</span>);
    process.<span>exit</span>(<span>1</span>);
}

<span>// Kill existing Chrome</span>
<span>try</span> {
    <span>execSync</span>(<span>"killall 'Google Chrome'"</span>, { <span>stdio</span>: <span>"ignore"</span> });
} <span>catch</span> {}

<span>// Wait a bit for processes to fully die</span>
<span>await</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span>(<span>(<span>r</span>) =&gt;</span> <span>setTimeout</span>(r, <span>1000</span>));

<span>// Setup profile directory</span>
<span>execSync</span>(<span>"mkdir -p ~/.cache/scraping"</span>, { <span>stdio</span>: <span>"ignore"</span> });

<span>if</span> (useProfile) {
    <span>// Sync profile with rsync (much faster on subsequent runs)</span>
    <span>execSync</span>(
        <span>'rsync -a --delete "/Users/badlogic/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/" ~/.cache/scraping/'</span>,
        { <span>stdio</span>: <span>"pipe"</span> },
    );
}

<span>// Start Chrome in background (detached so Node can exit)</span>
<span>spawn</span>(
    <span>"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"</span>,
    [<span>"--remote-debugging-port=9222"</span>, <span>`--user-data-dir=<span>${process.env[<span>"HOME"</span>]}</span>/.cache/scraping`</span>],
    { <span>detached</span>: <span>true</span>, <span>stdio</span>: <span>"ignore"</span> },
).<span>unref</span>();

<span>// Wait for Chrome to be ready by attempting to connect</span>
<span>let</span> connected = <span>false</span>;
<span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; <span>30</span>; i++) {
    <span>try</span> {
        <span>const</span> browser = <span>await</span> puppeteer.<span>connect</span>({
            <span>browserURL</span>: <span>"http://localhost:9222"</span>,
            <span>defaultViewport</span>: <span>null</span>,
        });
        <span>await</span> browser.<span>disconnect</span>();
        connected = <span>true</span>;
        <span>break</span>;
    } <span>catch</span> {
        <span>await</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span>(<span>(<span>r</span>) =&gt;</span> <span>setTimeout</span>(r, <span>500</span>));
    }
}

<span>if</span> (!connected) {
    <span>console</span>.<span>error</span>(<span>"✗ Failed to connect to Chrome"</span>);
    process.<span>exit</span>(<span>1</span>);
}

<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>`✓ Chrome started on :9222<span>${useProfile ? <span>" with your profile"</span> : <span>""</span>}</span>`</span>);
</code></pre><p>All the agent needs to know is to use Bash to run the start.js script, either with <code>--profile</code> or without.</p>
<h3 id="toc_4">The Navigate Tool</h3>
<p>Once the browser is running, the agent needs to navigate to URLs, either in a new tab or the active tab. That's exactly what the navigate tool provides:</p>
<pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env node</span>

<span>import</span> puppeteer <span>from</span> <span>"puppeteer-core"</span>;

<span>const</span> url = process.<span>argv</span>[<span>2</span>];
<span>const</span> newTab = process.<span>argv</span>[<span>3</span>] === <span>"--new"</span>;

<span>if</span> (!url) {
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"Usage: nav.js &lt;url&gt; [--new]"</span>);
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"\nExamples:"</span>);
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"  nav.js https://example.com       # Navigate current tab"</span>);
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"  nav.js https://example.com --new # Open in new tab"</span>);
    process.<span>exit</span>(<span>1</span>);
}

<span>const</span> b = <span>await</span> puppeteer.<span>connect</span>({
    <span>browserURL</span>: <span>"http://localhost:9222"</span>,
    <span>defaultViewport</span>: <span>null</span>,
});

<span>if</span> (newTab) {
    <span>const</span> p = <span>await</span> b.<span>newPage</span>();
    <span>await</span> p.<span>goto</span>(url, { <span>waitUntil</span>: <span>"domcontentloaded"</span> });
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"✓ Opened:"</span>, url);
} <span>else</span> {
    <span>const</span> p = (<span>await</span> b.<span>pages</span>()).<span>at</span>(-<span>1</span>);
    <span>await</span> p.<span>goto</span>(url, { <span>waitUntil</span>: <span>"domcontentloaded"</span> });
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"✓ Navigated to:"</span>, url);
}

<span>await</span> b.<span>disconnect</span>();
</code></pre><h3 id="toc_5">The Evaluate JavaScript Tool</h3>
<p>The agent needs to execute JavaScript to read and modify the DOM of the active tab. The JavaScript it writes runs in the page context, so it doesn't have to fuck around with Puppeteer itself. All it needs to know is how to write code using the DOM API, and it sure knows how to do that:</p>
<pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env node</span>

<span>import</span> puppeteer <span>from</span> <span>"puppeteer-core"</span>;

<span>const</span> code = process.<span>argv</span>.<span>slice</span>(<span>2</span>).<span>join</span>(<span>" "</span>);

<h2 id="toc_7">The Benefits</h2>
<p>So how does this compare to the MCP servers I mentioned above? Well, to start, I can pull in the README whenever I need it and don't pay for it in every session. This is very similar to Anthropic's recently introduced skills capabilities. Except it's even more ad hoc and works with any coding agent. All I need to do is instruct my agent to read the README file.</p>
<p>Side note: many folks including myself have used this kind of setup before Anthropic released their skills system. You can see something similar in my <a href="https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-06-02-prompts-are-code/">"Prompts are Code" blog post</a> or my little <a href="https://sitegeist.ai/">sitegeist.ai</a>. <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/8/18/code-mcps/">Armin</a> has also touched on the power of Bash and code compared to MCPs previously. Anthropic's skills add progressive disclosure (love it) and they make them available to a non-technical audience across almost all their products (also love it).</p>
<p>Speaking of the README, instead of pulling in 13,000 to 18,000 tokens like the MCP servers mentioned above, this README has a whopping 225 tokens. This efficiency comes from the fact that models know how to write code and use Bash. I'm conserving context space by relying heavily on their existing knowledge.</p>
<p>These simple tools are also composable. Instead of reading the outputs of an invocation into the context, the agent can decide to save them to a file for later processing, either by itself or by code. The agent can also easily chain multiple invocations in a single Bash command.</p>
<p>If I find that the output of a tool is not token efficient, I can just change the output format. Something that's hard or impossible to do depending on what MCP server you use.</p>
<p>And it's ridiculously easy to add a new tool or modify an existing tool for my needs. Let me illustrate.</p>
<h2 id="toc_8">Adding the Pick Tool</h2>
<p>When the agent and I try to come up with a scraping method for a specific site, it's often more efficient if I'm able to point out DOM elements to it directly by just clicking on them. To make this super easy, I can just build a picker. Here's what I add to the README:</p>
<pre><code><span>## Pick Elements</span>

\<span>`\`</span>\`bash
./pick.js "Click the submit button"
\<span>`\`</span>\`

Interactive element picker. Click to select, Cmd/Ctrl+Click for multi-select, Enter to finish.
</code></pre><p>And here's the code:</p>
<pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env node</span>

<span>import</span> puppeteer <span>from</span> <span>"puppeteer-core"</span>;

<span>const</span> message = process.<span>argv</span>.<span>slice</span>(<span>2</span>).<span>join</span>(<span>" "</span>);

</code></pre><p>Whenever I think it's faster for me to just click on a bunch of DOM elements instead of having the agent figure out the DOM structure, I can just tell it to use the pick tool. It's super efficient and allows me to build scrapers in no time. It's also fantastic to adjust the scraper if the DOM layout of a site changed.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble following what this tool does, worry not, I will have a video at the end of the blog post where you can see it in action. Before we look at that, let me show you an additional tool.</p>
<h2 id="toc_9">Adding the Cookies Tool</h2>
<p>During one of my recent scraping adventures, I had a need for HTTP-only cookies of that site, so the deterministic scraper could pretend it's me. The Evaluate JavaScript tool cannot handle this as it executes in the page context. But it took not even a minute for me to instruct Claude to create that tool, add it to the readme, and away we went.</p>
<img src="https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/media/extension.png" loading="lazy">

<p>This is so much easier than adjusting, testing, and debugging an existing MCP server.</p>
<h2 id="toc_10">A Contrived Example</h2>
<p>Let me illustrate usage of this set of tools with a contrived example. I set out to build a simple Hacker News scraper where I basically pick the DOM elements for the agent, based on which it can then write a minimal Node.js scraper. Here's how that looks in action. I sped up a few sections where Claude was its usual slow self.</p>
<video src="https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/media/scrape.mp4" poster="https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/media/scrape-poster.png" controls="">
</video>

<p>Real world scraping tasks would look a bit more involved. Also, there's no point in doing it like this for such a simple site like Hacker News. But you get the idea.</p>
<p>Final token tally:</p>
<img src="https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/media/scrape-tokens.png" loading="lazy">

<h2 id="toc_11">Making This Reusable Across Agents</h2>
<p>Here's how I've set things up so I can use this with Claude Code and other agents. I have a folder <code>agent-tools</code> in my home directory. I then clone the repositories of individual tools, like the browser tools repository above, into that folder. Then I set up an alias:</p>
<pre><code><span>alias</span> cl=<span>"PATH=<span>$PATH</span>:/Users/badlogic/agent-tools/browser-tools:&lt;other-tool-dirs&gt; &amp;&amp; claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"</span>
</code></pre><p>This way all of the scripts are available to sessions of Claude, but don't pollute my normal environment. I also prefix each script with the full tool name, e.g. <code>browser-tools-start.js</code>, to eliminate name collisions. I also add a single sentence to the README telling the agent that all the scripts are globally available. This way, the agent doesn't have to change its working directory just to call a tool script, saving a few tokens here and there, and reducing the chances of the agent getting confused by the constant working directory changes.</p>
<p>Finally, I add the agent tools directory as a working directory to Claude Code via <code>/add-dir</code>, so I can use <code>@README.md</code> to reference a specific tool's README file and get it into the agent's context. I prefer this to Anthropic's skill auto-discovery, which I found to not work reliably in practice. It also means I save a few more tokens: Claude Code injects all the frontmatter of all skills it can find into the system prompt (or first user message, I forgot, see <a href="https://cchistory.mariozechner.at/">https://cchistory.mariozechner.at</a>)</p>
<h2 id="toc_12">In Conclusion</h2>
<p>Building these tools is ridiculously easy, gives you all the freedom you need, and makes you, your agent, and your token usage efficient. You can find the browser tools on <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/browser-tools">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>This general principle can apply to any kind of harness that has some kind of code execution environment. Think outside the MCP box and you'll find that this is much more powerful than the more rigid structure you have to follow with MCP.</p>
<p>With great power comes great responsibility though. You will have to come up with a structure for how you build and maintain those tools yourself. Anthropic's skill system can be one way to do it, though that's less transferable to other agents. Or you follow my setup above.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://david.coffee/cloudflare-zero-trust-tunnels">https://david.coffee/cloudflare-zero-trust-tunnels</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45946865">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A while ago, after frustration with Tailscale in environments where it couldn’t properly penetrate NAT/firewall and get a p2p connection, I decided to invest some time into learning something new: Cloudflare Zero Trust + Warp.</p><p>There are so many new concepts, but after way too long, I can finally say that <strong>I understand Cloudflare Zero Trust Warp now</strong>. I am a full-on Cloudflare Zero Trust with Warp convert, and while I still have Tailscale running in parallel, almost everything I do now is going through Zero Trust tunnels.</p><p>This post is an explanation of the basic concepts, because I’m sure others will have similar issues wrapping their head around it.</p><h4 id="why-tho">Why tho?</h4><p>Why would you even sink so much time into learning this? What does it give you?</p><p>Argo tunnels through Zero Trust allow you to do a bunch of <em>really</em> cool things:</p><ul><li>Connect private networks together - can be home networks, can be kubernetes clusters, you can create tunnels to and from every infra</li><li>Expose private services to the public, on public hostnames, no matter where they are running. You could even put your router running at 192.168.1.1 on the internet, accessible to everyone, no Warp client required</li><li>Create fully private networks with private IPs (10.x.x.x) that only resolve when Warp is connected, to services you specify</li><li>Quickly expose a public route to any service running locally or on any server, for quick development, testing webhooks or giving coworkers a quick preview</li><li>Create a fully private network running at home that’s only available when you’re connected to the Warp VPN client, or only to you, reachable anywhere</li><li>No worries about NAT, everything goes through the Cloudflare network, no direct p2p connection required</li><li>Add very granular access policies on who can access what - what login method does the user need, which email addresses are allowed. Allow bots and server-to-server exceptions with service access tokens.<ul><li>Does the user need to have Warp running? Does he need to be enrolled in Zero Trust? Does he need some special permission flag?</li></ul></li><li>Authenticate to SSH servers through Zero Trust access policies without the need of SSH keys. Just connect Warp, type <code>ssh host</code> and you’re logged in<ul><li>Close public SSH ports completely to only allow login through Warp</li></ul></li><li>Get the benefits of Cloudflare VPN edge routing on top (similar to 1.1.1.1 Warp+)</li></ul><h2 id="quickie-cloudflare-zero-trust-vs-tailscale">Quickie: Cloudflare Zero Trust vs Tailscale</h2><p>To get this out of the way:</p><ul><li><strong>Tailscale</strong>: peer-to-peer, uses NAT and firewall penetration methods to establish p2p connections. If not possible, it goes through central relay servers. Absolute best speed and latency if a connection is established.</li><li><strong>Cloudflare</strong>: All traffic (with the exception of warp-to-warp routing, which is p2p) goes through Cloudflare’s edge network. So even SSH-ing into your local router will hop through Cloudflare servers. This adds latency, but no issues with NAT at all.</li></ul><h2 id="cloudflared--warp">Cloudflared != Warp</h2><p>Cloudflare has 2 tools available: <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/">Warp Client</a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/">Cloudflared</a>. They interact with each other and have similarities in some areas but are not the same.</p><p><strong>Warp Client</strong></p><p>The tool that connects you to the Cloudflare network. This is the thing that you configure to add clients into your Zero Trust network and enforces policies.</p><p>Usually this runs on clients, but can also run on servers.</p><p>Warp client also supports <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/warp-to-warp/">warp-to-warp routing</a> which is a true p2p connection similar to Tailscale.</p><p><strong>Cloudflared</strong></p><p>The thing that creates a <strong>tunnel</strong> and adds it to the Zero Trust network.</p><p>Most commonly you run this on servers to expose tunnels into your network, but you can also run it on clients.</p><p>On the client side you can use <code>cloudflared access</code> to establish a connection with other things in your Zero Trust network.</p><p>Can also create one-time-use tunnels that aren’t connected to the Zero Trust network. Good for testing.</p><h2 id="tunnels-routes-targets">Tunnels, Routes, Targets</h2><p>This took me the longest to understand. Zero Trust allows you to configure <em>Tunnels</em>, <em>Routes</em> and <em>Targets</em>; here’s how they interplay.</p><h3 id="tunnels">Tunnels</h3><p>The most important part of your setup. Tunnels are deployed through <code>cloudflared</code> and are simply an <em>exit</em> for traffic. Think of it as a literal tunnel that has its end somewhere.</p><p>Tunnels are deployed to infrastructure in the target network. So if you have a home network with 192.168.1.1/24, you want to deploy <code>cloudflared</code> on any machine that’s always on and within that network. It can be your router, or your Raspi, it doesn’t matter.</p><p>For server-hosted services, you can have a tunnel on your main dev server, on a server, or on a pod in your Kubernetes cluster.</p><p>Now you have an opening into these networks through Warp/Argo tunnels.</p><h4 id="configuring-tunnels">Configuring tunnels</h4><p>You can either <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/local-management/configuration-file/">configure</a> tunnels through the Zero Trust UI by “adopting” them, or configure them in the <code>/etc/cloudflared/config.yml</code> config on the machine itself. Personal preference, I usually configure them on the machine itself.</p><p>The config specifies where a request should get routed to when it arrives at the tunnel. So the tunnel knows what to do with it.</p><p>In this config we tell cloudflared to route traffic arriving at this tunnel for hostname <code>gitlab.widgetcorp.tech</code> to localhost:80, and <code>gitlab-ssh</code> to the local SSH server.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>❯ cat /etc/cloudflared/config.yml
tunnel: a2f17e27-cd4d-4fcd-b02a-63839f57a96f
credentials-file: /etc/cloudflared/a2f17e27-cd4d-4fcd-b02a-63839f57a96f.json
ingress:
  - hostname: gitlab.widgetcorp.tech
    service: http://localhost:80
  - hostname: gitlab-ssh.widgetcorp.tech
    service: ssh://localhost:22
  - service: http_status:404

  # Catch-all for WARP routing
  - service: http_status:404

warp-routing:
  enabled: true
</code></pre><p>The config alone doesn’t do anything. It just exposes a tunnel, and that’s it. What we need now are routes and targets.</p><h4 id="exposing-a-private-network-to-the-public-with-tunnels-quickly">Exposing a private network to the public with tunnels quickly</h4><p>Quick addition, as this is a super common use case. If you want to just expose something in your home network to the internet, you can add a config like this:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>tunnel: a2f17e27-cd4d-4fcd-b02a-63839f57a96f
credentials-file: /etc/cloudflared/a2f17e27-cd4d-4fcd-b02a-63839f57a96f.json
ingress:
  - hostname: homeassistant.mydomain.com
    service: http://192.168.1.3:80
</code></pre><p>Then go into Cloudflare DNS settings and map the domain <code>homeassistant.mydomain.com</code> to the tunnel:</p><p><code>CNAME homeassistant.mydomain.com a2f17e27-cd4d-4fcd-b02a-63839f57a96f.cfargotunnel.com</code></p><p>Now all traffic going to this domain will go through the cloudflared tunnel, which is configured to route <code>homeassistant.mydomain.com</code> to <code>192.168.1.3</code>. <strong>No Warp client needed</strong>, Argo tunnel does everything for us.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you adopted the tunnels and don’t use <code>config.yaml</code>, you can automatically create matching DNS records in the Cloudflare UI and don’t need to do this manually.</p><h3 id="routes">Routes</h3><p>A route defines <em>where</em> to direct traffic to.</p><p>Let’s say your homeassistant runs on 192.168.1.3 at home and you want to reach it from outside. Just above we deployed a <code>cloudflared</code> tunnel on our router at 192.168.1.3, and added a config pointing the domain to the Argo tunnel, so <code>homeassistant.mydomain.com</code> is already available to the public. However, <code>192.168.1.3</code> isn’t, as it’s a private network IP.</p><p><img src="https://david.coffee/routes-configure.png" alt="Configuring a route in Zero Trust"></p><p>You can define:</p><ul><li>A route like <code>192.168.1.1/24</code> pointing at your tunnel, to route <em>ALL</em> traffic to the full IP range through that tunnel (so even 192.168.1.245 will go through your tunnel)</li><li>Or a more specific route like <code>192.168.1.3/32</code> pointing at your tunnel, to <em>ONLY</em> route traffic to 192.168.1.3 through that tunnel.</li></ul><p>When configured, once your user connects their Warp client that’s set up with your Zero Trust network, the Warp client will see requests to 192.168.1.3 and route it through the Cloudflare network to reach your specific tunnel. Like a little police helper directing cars where to go.</p><p><em>If the Warp client is <strong>not</strong> connected, 192.168.1.3 will just resolve in your current local network. If connected, it will resolve to the tunnel.</em></p><p><strong>The routed IP doesn’t need to exist!</strong> So you could, for example, route a random IP you like (e.g., 10.128.1.1) to your tunnel, the tunnel then forwards it based on your routes, for example to 192.168.1.1. This is extremely powerful because it allows you to build your own fully virtual network.</p><p>That’s all it does, what happens afterwards is up to the tunnel config that we created above. The tunnel decides where to point the incoming request to, whether that’s localhost or somewhere else.</p><p>To summarize, the <code>route</code> tells the Warp client where to route traffic to.</p><p>Now we have 2 things working:</p><ul><li><code>homeassistant.mydomain.com</code> - goes through a Cloudflare DNS record pointing at an Argo tunnel, which then forwards to 192.168.1.3. This works without Warp connected as it’s on the DNS level, public to everyone.</li><li><code>192.168.1.3</code> - The Warp client sees the request and routes it through the Argo tunnel, which then forwards it to <code>192.168.1.3</code> within that network. This needs Warp connected to work, and is only visible to people in your Zero Trust org.</li></ul><h3 id="targets">Targets</h3><p>This one took me a while.</p><p>Targets are needed to <em>define a piece of infrastructure</em> that you want to protect through Zero Trust. They are like a pointer pointing to something in your network. This goes hand-in-hand with routes, but isn’t always needed.</p><p>Let’s say you have 192.168.1.3 (homeassistant) exposed through a Cloudflare tunnel. By default, anyone in your network that is part of your Zero Trust org and has Warp client installed can now access your homeassistant at 192.168.1.3.</p><p>We can change that with targets. For example, defining a target with hostname = <code>homeassistant.mydomain.com</code> to the route <code>192.168.1.3/32</code> allows us to add access policies to it. We can also put an entire network into the target by specifying <code>192.168.1.3/24</code> to control access. This also works with virtual IPs like 10.128.1.1!</p><p><img src="https://david.coffee/targets-config-screen.png" alt="Configuring a target in Zero Trust"></p><p>Targets alone won’t do anything, they just point to the service or network. “Hey, here is homeassistant”, or “hey, here is my home network”.</p><h2 id="access-policies-protecting-who-can-access-what">Access Policies: Protecting Who Can Access What</h2><p>Continuing the example from above:</p><ul><li>we have a tunnel running on our home network that routes <code>homeassistant.mydomain.com</code> to <code>192.168.1.3</code></li><li>we set up public DNS records to point <code>homeassistant.mydomain.com</code> to the Argo tunnel in Cloudflare</li><li>we created a <em>route</em> <code>192.168.1.3</code> to go through the same tunnel</li><li>we also created a <em>target</em> pointing to <code>192.168.1.3</code></li></ul><p>When users access either <code>192.168.1.3</code> or <code>homeassistant.mydomain.com</code>, the Warp client will route the request through the tunnel, which then forwards the request to 192.168.1.3. Homeassistant loads and everything is fine.</p><p><em>But do we want that?</em></p><p>Probably not.</p><p>Access policies to the rescue!</p><p>With access policies, we can leave things in the public but protect them with Cloudflare Zero Trust access. So while 192.168.1.3 is only available if Warp is connected (so routing to it works), we can add security to our public <code>homeassistant.mydomain.com</code>.</p><p>Go to Access -&gt; Applications -&gt; Add an Application -&gt; Self-hosted.</p><p>Here we can define <em>what</em> should be protected, and <em>how</em>.</p><p>Going with our previous example, we can add a public hostname <code>homeassistant.mydomain.com</code> or an IP like <code>192.168.1.3</code> (or both), then attach policies of who should be able to access it.</p><p>You can specify <strong>Include</strong> (“OR”) and <strong>Require</strong> (“AND”) selectors.</p><ul><li><strong>Require</strong> rules must always be met, <em>on top</em> of include rules, to grant access</li><li>Any of the <strong>Include</strong> rules must match to grant access</li></ul><p>Then there are <em>Actions</em>:</p><ul><li><strong>Allow</strong> - when the policy matches, allow access</li><li><strong>Deny</strong> - when the policy matches, deny access. aka blocking something.</li><li><strong>Bypass</strong> - when the policy matches, bypass Zero Trust completely. No more checking.</li><li><strong>Service Auth</strong> - when the policy matches, allow authentication to the service with a service token header (good for server-to-server, or bots). Check Access -&gt; Service Auth to create these tokens.</li></ul><h3 id="allow-public-access-to-everyone-logging-into-your-network">Allow public access to everyone logging into your network</h3><p>The most common use case: <code>homeassistant.mydomain.com</code> is public. We want to keep it public, but add an extra layer of security.</p><p>Add an <em>include</em> policy, pick any of the <code>email</code> selectors, add the email of the user you want to allow access to. Now only people authenticated with your Zero Trust org with the specified emails can access your homeassistant, without needing to have Warp running.</p><p>We can harden this by adding <em>require</em> rules: Add a <em>Login Method</em> selector rule, pick a specific login method like GitHub. Now only people with specific emails that have authenticated through GitHub can access your homeassistant, without needing to have Warp running.</p><p><img src="https://david.coffee/policy-github-emails.png" alt="Configuring an Access Policy with GitHub and email"></p><h3 id="bypass-login-completely-when-connected-through-warp">Bypass login completely when connected through WARP</h3><p>Another policy I like having is to skip the login screen entirely when connected through Warp. If a user is already enrolled into my Zero Trust org and has the Warp client provisioned, then there’s no need to ask them to authenticate again.</p><p>We can add a separate policy (don’t edit the one we just created above), pick the <em>Gateway</em> selector and set it to <em>Allow</em> or <em>Bypass</em>.</p><p><img src="https://david.coffee/policy-gateway-auth.png" alt="Policy to allow Gateway auth"></p><p><strong>Don’t use ‘Warp’</strong> - the Warp selector will match anyone that has Warp running, including the consumer 1.1.1.1 app. <em>Gateway</em>, on the other hand, matches only if someone is connecting through your Gateway, be that DNS or a provisioned Warp client.</p><p><em>(The ‘Gateway’ selector is only available if the Warp client is set to allow WARP authentication identity)</em></p><p>Now when:</p><ul><li>Warp through Zero Trust is running on a machine: No login screen</li><li>No Warp running (public access): Prompt for login screen, but only allow specific emails that authenticated through GitHub</li></ul><p>This setup makes it very convenient to reach homeassistant, no matter if connected through Warp or not.</p><h2 id="deploying-the-warp-client-and-enrolling-into-zero-trust">Deploying the Warp client and enrolling into Zero Trust</h2><p>Are you still with me?</p><p>Our network is basically done. We have a login-protected <code>homeassistant.mydomain.com</code> that routes through our tunnel into our private network and terminates at <code>192.168.1.3</code>, and we have a direct route to <code>192.168.1.3</code> that only works when connected with Warp.</p><p>We also have login policies to make sure only specific users (logged in with GitHub and certain email addresses) can access homeassistant.</p><p><em>So how do we deploy the dang Warp client?</em></p><p>Actually the same: We create some policies.</p><p><strong>Head to Settings -&gt; Warp Client</strong></p><p>In <strong>Enrollment Permissions</strong>, we specify the same policies for who can enroll. For example, “<a href="https://david.coffee/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="197f7676377b786b597d7674787077377a7674">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>” when authenticated through GitHub is allowed to enroll. In the <em>Login Methods</em> we can specify what login methods are available when someone tries to enroll into our Zero Trust org.</p><p><img src="https://david.coffee/enrollment-policy-login-methods.png" alt="Login methods enroll policies"></p><p>Toggle <em>WARP authentication identity settings</em> to make the <em>Gateway</em> selector available in policies, effectively allowing the configured WARP client to be used as a login method.</p><p><strong>Careful here</strong>, once someone is enrolled, they are basically in your Zero Trust network through Warp. Make sure you harden this.</p><p>Then, in <strong>Profile settings</strong>, we define <em>how the WARP client behaves</em>. These are things like protocol: MASQUE or WireGuard, service mode, what IPs and domains to exclude from WARP routing (e.g., the local network should never go through WARP), setting it to exclude or include mode and so on.</p><p>Other settings I recommend setting:</p><ul><li><em>Install CA to system certificate store</em> - installs the Cloudflare CA certificate automatically when enrolled.</li><li><em>Override local interface IP</em> - assigns a unique CGNAT private IP to the client. This is needed for warp-to-warp routing.</li><li><em>Device Posture</em> - what checks the WARP client should perform for the org. E.g., check the OS version, some OS files on disk, etc. I have this set to <em>WARP</em> and <em>Gateway</em> because I want the client to provide information on whether the user is connected through WARP and Gateway, for skipping certain login pages.</li></ul><p><img src="https://david.coffee/device-posture-checks.png" alt="Device posture checks for Gateway and Warp"></p><p>Once done, just open the Warp client (<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/)">https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/)</a>, and log in to your network. This should open the login pages you specified in the <em>Device Enrollment</em> screen, and check all the enrollment policies you specified.</p><p>Once passed, congratulations, your WARP client is now connected to your Zero Trust network. The client will then go ahead and start routing <code>192.168.1.3</code> through your tunnels, as specified in your tunnel and route settings.</p><p>🎉</p><h2 id="what-we-built">What we built</h2><p>If you followed this guide, here is what we built:</p><ul><li>Login methods to connect the Warp client to your Zero Trust org through GitHub and specific email addresses</li><li>A <em>tunnel</em> within your private network that<ul><li>Forwards any request coming in with host <code>homeassistant.mydomain.com</code> to <code>192.168.1.3</code></li></ul></li><li>A <em>route</em> that forwards all traffic for <code>192.168.1.3</code> to the tunnel in your private network, which will terminate it at 192.168.1.3, which will only work when connected through Warp to route the request</li><li>A DNS name <code>homeassistant.mydomain.com</code> that points to the Argo tunnel, and will allow everyone (even if not connected through Warp) to access homeassistant which runs at 192.168.1.3</li><li>Access policies that will<ul><li>Ask users that are not connected to Zero Trust through Warp to log in with GitHub and specific email, so everyone can access it if they can log in</li><li>A policy that skips the login screen completely and just shows homeassistant if the user connects through Zero Trust Warp client (enrolled into our org)</li></ul></li></ul><p>You don’t need the public domain and you don’t need the route to 192.168.1.3. These are 2 different options that you can use to expose homeassistant when you’re not at home. One is using a public domain name everyone can see, one is explicitly requiring connecting through enrolled Warp.</p><p>What I <em>didn’t</em> cover in this post:</p><ul><li>Warp-to-warp routing</li><li>Creating and assigning fully private IPs that only exist within your Zero Trust network</li><li>SSH authentication through Zero Trust access policies (that’s what we need <em>Targets</em> for)</li><li>The other application types besides <em>Self-Hosted</em></li></ul><p>I’m happy to expand on it if there’s interest.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/ai-products/">https://www.seangoedecke.com/ai-products/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45946498">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The very first LLM-based product, ChatGPT, was just<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> the ability to talk with the model itself: in other words, a pure chatbot. This is still the most popular LLM product by a large margin.</p>
<p>In fact, given the amount of money that’s been invested in the industry, it’s shocking how many “new AI products” are just chatbots. As far as I can tell, <strong>there are only three types of AI product that currently work</strong>.</p>
<h3>Chatbots</h3>
<p>For the first couple of years of the AI boom, all LLM products were chatbots. They were branded in a lot of different ways - maybe the LLM knew about your emails, or a company’s helpdesk articles - but the fundamental <em>product</em> was just the ability to talk in natural language to an LLM.</p>
<p>The problem with chatbots is that <strong>the best chatbot product is the model itself</strong>. Most of the reason users want to talk with an LLM is generic: they want to ask questions, or get advice, or confess their sins, or do any one of a hundred things that have nothing to do with your particular product. </p>
<p>In other words, your users will just use ChatGPT<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. AI labs have two decisive advantages over you: first, they will always have access to the most cutting-edge models before you do; and second, they can develop their chatbot harness simultaneously with the model itself (like how Anthropic specifically trains their models to be used in Claude Code, or OpenAI trains their models to be used in Codex).</p>
<h4>Explicit roleplay</h4>
<p>One way your chatbot product can beat ChatGPT is by doing what OpenAI won’t do: for instance, happily roleplaying an AI boyfriend or generating pornography. There is currently a very lucrative niche of products like this, which typically rely on less-capable but less-restrictive open-source models.</p>
<p>These products have the problems I discussed above. But it doesn’t matter that their chatbots are less capable than ChatGPT or Claude: if you’re in the market for sexually explicit AI roleplay, and ChatGPT and Claude won’t do it, you’re going to take what you can get.</p>
<p>I think there are serious ethical problems with this kind of product. But even practically speaking, this is a segment of the industry likely to be eaten alive by the big AI labs, as they become more comfortable pushing the boundaries of adult content. <a href="https://tremendous.blog/2025/07/15/grok-companions-elons-ai-girlfriend/">Grok Companions</a> is already going down this pathway, and Sam Altman has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/799312/openai-chatgpt-erotica-sam-altman-verified-adults">said</a> that OpenAI models will be more open to generating adult content in the future.</p>
<h4>Chatbots with tools</h4>
<p>There’s a slight variant on chatbots which gives the model <em>tools</em>: so instead of just chatting with your calendar, you can ask the chatbot to book meetings, and so on. This kind of product is usually called an “AI assistant”.</p>
<p>This doesn’t work well because <strong>savvy users can manipulate the chatbot into calling tools</strong>. So you can never give a support chatbot real support powers like “refund this customer”, because the moment you do, thousands of people will immediately find the right way to jailbreak your chatbot into giving them money. You can only give your chatbots tools that the user could do themselves - in which case, your chatbot is competing with the usability of your actual product, and will likely lose.</p>
<p>Why will your chatbot lose? Because <strong>chat is not a good user interface</strong>. Users simply do not want to type out “hey, can you increase the font size for me” when they could simply hit “ctrl-plus” or click a single button<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I think this is a hard lesson for engineers to learn. It’s tempting to believe that since chatbots have gotten 100x better, they must now be the best user interface for many tasks. Unfortunately, they started out 200x worse than a regular user interface, so they’re still twice as bad.</p>
<h3>Completion</h3>
<p>The second real AI product actually came out before ChatGPT did: GitHub Copilot. The idea behind the original Copilot product (and all its imitators, like Cursor Tab) is that a fast LLM can act as a smart autocomplete. By feeding the model the code you’re typing as you type it, a code editor can suggest autocompletions that actually write the rest of the function (or file) for you.</p>
<p>The genius of this kind of product is that <strong>users never have to talk to the model</strong>. Like I said above, chat is a bad user interface. LLM-generated completions allow users to access the power of AI models without having to change any part of their current workflow: they simply see the kind of autocomplete suggestions their editor was already giving them, but far more powerful.</p>
<p>I’m a little surprised that completions-based products haven’t taken off outside coding (where they immediately generated a multi-billion-dollar market). Google Docs and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/editor-text-predictions-in-word-7afcb4f3-4aa2-443a-9b08-125a5d692576">Microsoft Word</a> both have something like this. Why isn’t there more hype around this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe the answer is that the people using this product don’t engage with AI online spaces, and are just quietly using the product?</li>
<li>Maybe there’s something about normal professional writing that’s less amenable to autocomplete than code? I doubt that, since so much normal professional writing is being copied out of a ChatGPT window.</li>
<li>It could be that code editors already had autocomplete, so users were familiar with it. I bet autocomplete is brand-new and confusing to many Word users.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Agents</h3>
<p>The third real AI product is the coding agent. People have been talking about this for years, but it was only really in 2025 that the technology behind coding agents became feasible (with Claude Sonnet 3.7, and later GPT-5-Codex).</p>
<p>Agents are kind of like chatbots, in that users interact with them by typing natural language text. But they’re unlike chatbots in that <strong>you only have to do that once</strong>: the model takes your initial request and goes away to implement and test it all by itself.</p>
<p>The reason agents work and chatbots-with-tools don’t is the difference between asking an LLM to hit a single button for you and asking the LLM to hit a hundred buttons in a specific order. Even though each individual action would be easier for a human to perform, agentic LLMs are now smart enough to take over the entire process.</p>
<p>Coding agents are a natural fit for AI agents for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s easy to verify changes by running tests or checking if the code compiles</li>
<li>AI labs are incentivized to produce effective coding models to accelerate their own work</li>
</ul>
<p>For my money, the current multi-billion-dollar question is <strong>can AI agents be useful for tasks other than coding?</strong> Bear in mind that Claude Sonnet 3.7<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> was released just under <em>nine months ago</em>. In that time, the tech industry has successfully built agentic products about their own work. They’re just starting to build agentic products for other tasks. It remains to be seen how successful that will be, or what those products will look like.</p>
<h4>Research</h4>
<p>There’s another kind of agent that isn’t about coding: the research agent. LLMs are particularly good at tasks like “skim through ten pages of search results” or “keyword search this giant dataset for any information on a particular topic”. I use this functionality a lot for all kinds of things.</p>
<p>There are a few examples of AI products built on this capability, like <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity</a>. In the big AI labs, this has been absorbed into the chatbot products: OpenAI’s “deep research” went from a separate feature to just what GPT-5-Thinking does automatically, for instance.</p>
<p>I think there’s almost certainly potential here for area-specific research agents (e.g. in medicine or law).</p>
<h3>Feeds</h3>
<p>If agents are the most recent successful AI product, AI-generated feeds might be the one just over the horizon. AI labs are currently experimenting with ways of producing infinite feeds of personalized content to their users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark Zuckerberg has talked about filling Instagram with auto-generated content</li>
<li>OpenAI has recently launched a Sora-based video-gen feed</li>
<li>OpenAI has also started pushing users towards “Pulse”, a personalized daily update inside the ChatGPT product</li>
<li>xAI is <a href="https://www.testingcatalog.com/grok-will-get-infinite-image-gen-and-video-gen-with-sounds/">working on</a> putting an infinite image and video feed into Twitter</li>
</ul>
<p>So far none of these have taken off. But scrolling feeds has become the primary way users interact with technology <em>in general</em>, so the potential here is massive. It does not seem unlikely to me at all that in five years time most internet users will spend a big part of their day scrolling an AI-generated feed.</p>
<p>Like a completions-based product, the advantage of a feed is that users don’t have to interact with a chatbot. The inputs to the model come from how the user interacts with the feed (likes, scrolling speed, time spent looking at an item, and so on). Users can experience the benefits of an LLM-generated feed (if any) without having to change their consumption habits at all.</p>
<p>The technology behind current human-generated infinite feeds is already a mature application of state of the art machine learning. When you interact with Twitter or LinkedIn, you’re interacting with a model, except instead of generating text it’s generating lists of other people’s posts. In other words, <strong>feeds already maintain a sophisticated embedding of your personal likes and dislikes</strong>. The step from “use that embedding to surface relevant content” to “use that embedding to <em>generate</em> relevant content” might be very short indeed.</p>
<p>I’m pretty suspicious of AI-generated infinite feeds of generated video, but I do think other kinds of infinite feeds are an under-explored kind of product. In fact, I built a feed-based hobby project of my own, called <a href="https://www.autodeck.pro/">Autodeck</a><sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>. The idea was to use an AI-generated feed to generate spaced repetition cards for learning. It works pretty well! It still gets a reasonable amount of use from people who’ve found it via my blog (also, from myself and my partner).</p>
<h3>Games</h3>
<p>One other kind of AI-generated product that people have been talking about for years is the AI-based video game. The most speculative efforts in this direction have been full world simulations like DeepMind’s <a href="https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/">Genie</a>, but people have also explored using AI to generate a subset of game content, such as pure-text games like <a href="https://aidungeon.com/">AI Dungeon</a> or this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98631">Skyrim mod</a> which adds AI-generated dialogue. Many more game developers have incorporated AI art or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/arc-raiders-ai-voices-the-finals-embark-studios/">audio</a> assets into their games.</p>
<p>Could there be a transformative product that incorporates LLMs into video games? I don’t think ARC Raiders counts as an “AI product” just because it uses AI voice lines, and the more ambitious projects haven’t yet really taken off. Why not?</p>
<p>One reason could be that <strong>games just take a really long time to develop</strong>. When <em>Stardew Valley</em> took the world by storm in 2016, I expected a flood of copycat cozy pixel-art farming games, but that only really started happening in 2018 and 2019. That’s how long it takes to make a game! So even if someone has a really good idea for an LLM-based video game, we’re probably still a year or two out from it being released.</p>
<p>Another reason is that <strong>many gamers really don’t like AI</strong>. Including generative AI in your game is a guaranteed controversy (though it doesn’t seem to be fatal, as the success of ARC Raiders shows). I wouldn’t be surprised if some game developers simply don’t think it’s worth the risk to try an AI-based game idea<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A third reason could be that <strong>generated content is just not a good fit for gaming</strong>. Certainly ChatGPT-like dialogue sticks out like a sore thumb in most video games. AI chatbots are also pretty bad at <em>challenging</em> the user: their post-training is all working to make them try to satisfy the user immediately<sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup>. Still, I don’t think this is an insurmountable technical problem. You could simply post-train a language model in a different direction (though perhaps the necessary resources for that haven’t yet been made available to gaming companies).</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>By my count, there are three successful types of language model product:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chatbots like ChatGPT, which are used by hundreds of millions of people for a huge variety of tasks</li>
<li>Completions coding products like Copilot or Cursor Tab, which are very niche but easy to get immediate value from</li>
<li>Agentic products like Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Copilot Agent mode, which have only really started working in the last six months</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, there are two kinds of LLM-based product that don’t work yet but may soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>LLM-generated feeds</li>
<li>Video games that are based on AI-generated content</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost all AI products are just chatbots (e.g. AI-powered customer support). These suffer from having to compete with ChatGPT, which is a superior general product, and not being able to use powerful tools, because users will be able to easily jailbreak the model.</p>
<p>Agentic products are new, and have been wildly successful <em>for coding</em>. It remains to be seen what they’ll look like in other domains, but we’ll almost certainly see domain-specific research agents in fields like law. Research agents in coding have seen some success as well (e.g. code review or automated security scanning products).</p>
<p>Infinite AI-generated feeds haven’t yet been successful, but hundreds of millions of dollars are currently being poured into them. Will OpenAI’s Sora be a real competitor to Twitter or Instagram, or will those companies release their own AI-generated feed product?</p>
<p>AI-generated games sound like they could be a good idea, but there’s still no clear working strategy for how to incorporate LLMs into a video game. Pure world models - where the entire game is generated frame-by-frame - are cool demos but a long way from being products.</p>
<p>One other thing I haven’t mentioned is image generation. Is this part of a chatbot product, or a tool in itself? Frankly, I think AI image generation is still more of a toy than a product, but it’s certainly seeing a ton of use. There’s probably some fertile ground for products here, if they can successfully differentiate themselves from the built-in image generation in ChatGPT.</p>
<p>In general, it feels like the early days of the internet. LLMs have so much potential, but we’re still mostly building copies of the same thing. There have to be some really simple product ideas that we’ll look back on and think “that’s so obvious, I wonder why they didn’t do it immediately”.</p>
<p>edit: This post got quite a few comments on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45946498">Hacker News</a>. Some  commenters think <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45946878">my categories are too broad</a>, which is a fair criticism: like saying that there are only two “electricity products”, ones which turn a motor and ones which heat up a wire.</p>
<p>Other commenters argue that summarization, easy translation, and transcription are products I’ve missed. I disagree: have you yourself purchased some piece of LLM-driven summarization, translation or transcription software? Probably not - you just use a chatbot directly, right? I thus think of those as <em>features</em> of the chatbot product, not products in their own right.</p>
<p>One commenter <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45946957">points out</a> that there may be a bunch of zero-hype products bubbling away under the radar. Fair enough! I don’t know what I don’t know.</p>

<p>Recently I undertook a hobby project to recreate an IBM XT Personal Computer from the 1980s using a mix of authentic parts and modern technology. I had a clear goal in mind: I wanted to be able to play the EGA version of Monkey Island 1 on it, with no features missing. This means I need mouse support, hard drive with write access for saving the game, and Adlib audio, my preferred version of the game’s musical score.</p>



<p>The catalyst for this project was the discovery that there are low-power versions of the NEC V20 CPU available (<a href="https://github.com/bit-hack/iceXt/blob/master/datasheets/UPD70108H.PDF">UPD70108H</a>), which is compatible with the Intel 8088 used in the XT. Being a low-power version significantly simplifies its connection to an FPGA, which typically operate with 3.3-volt IO voltages. Coupled with a low-power 1MB SRAM chip (<a href="https://github.com/bit-hack/iceXt/blob/master/datasheets/CY62158EV30.pdf">CY62158EV30</a>) to provide the XT with its 640KB of memory, and I started to have the bones of a complete system worked out.</p>



<p>I started off by designing the hardware of the system, which would then serve as my development board while I worked on the software/gateware. The following features were added:<br>– DIP-40 socket for an low power NEC V20 CPU<br>– 1MB SRAM chip for the system memory<br>– An <a href="https://github.com/wuxx/icesugar-pro">icesugar-pro</a> FPGA board with a Lattice LFE5U-25F<br>– Dual PS/2 connectors for keyboard and mouse<br>– Micro SD card socket to act as a Fixed Disk<br>– An authentic YM3014B digital-to-analogue converter for audio<br>– A Piezo speaker that can be driven by the programmable-interval-timer for system bleeps<br>– Lastly, a reset switch and some status LEDs</p>

<p>I drew up my design using the EasyEDA CAD software as I’m already familiar with it, and it has really good integration with the JLCPCB PCB assembly service. Some of the components in the design are too tricky for me to hand solder by myself. I did however have to solder the SRAM chips once the boards arrived since they were not stocked by LCSC so I had to source them elsewhere.</p>

<p>The first step was to write a bus controller for the processor. The V20 CPU clock is more forgiving than an original i8088 since its can be run right down to 0hz and its uses a regular 50% duty cycle. The external interface for an 8088 CPU operates in terms of bus cycles. At that start of a bus cycle the CPU asserts some pins to let everyone know what it wants to try and do… read memory, write to IO, etc. Each type of bus cycle follows a specific sequence of events that happen over a number of clock cycles. It was straight forward to make a state machine that could detect the start of a bus-cycle, figure out what kind it was, and then produce or consume the data as needed by the CPU. Key here, was to make sure that all of the timing requirements were met, so that signals the CPU generates are sampled at the correct time, and signals the CPU requires have been driven correctly before the CPU reads them.</p>

<p>My first test for the bus controller was to write a simple program using NASM to be executed on the V20, with a simple goal… it will flash an LED mapped to an IO port address. Simple, but a blinking LED seems to be the hardware equivalent of the software hello-world. For the initial version, the program was simply loaded into a FPGA block ram and used directly as the system memory.</p>



<p>Later, I used a more complex approach for memory accesses. The bios, for example, is loaded into an FPGA block ram, so that CPU memory reads will come from that rather than the system SRAM chip. Video memory is implemented a differently still. CPU memory writes are passed to both the video memory block ram and system SRAM, but CPU reads alway come from only the system SRAM. This then means that I have a spare read port on the video block ram that can then be used by the VGA signal generator to display the video memory contents.</p>



<p>After my success with a blinky program, I installed a virtual copy of <a href="https://www.minuszerodegrees.net/supersoft_landmark/Supersoft%20Landmark%20ROM.htm">Supersoft/Landmark Diagnostic ROM</a> in place of the BIOS and wrote a basic CGA adapter for video output. I was then able to use the diagnostic ROM to test the SRAM memory interface as well as some of the peripherals required by the XT such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_interval_timer">programmable-interval-timer</a> (i8253) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_interrupt_controller">programmable-interrupt-controller</a> (i8259).</p>



<p>Once I was confident the basic system was stable I then swaped in a generic XT bios from <a href="https://www.phatcode.net/downloads.php?id=101">https://www.phatcode.net</a> in place of the diagnostic ROM. It was amazing to see the bios start to boot up, and complain when it couldnt find a boot disk.</p>



<p>Fixed Disk access is achieved by making a small Verilog SPI controller accessible to the CPU via some unused IO ports. I then wrote an option ROM to handle BIOS INT13H (disk service) calls, which had routines that could issue commands to the SD-Card over SPI. The tricky part for me was learning the SD card protocol and then writing 8088 assembly to perform the correct operations. The mapping itself is very straightforward as both SD card and DOS assume 512byte sectors.</p>



<p>I saved a lot of time when writing the option ROM by developing and debugging the code using a software emulator of the board that I cobbled together. Some historic sources for it can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/bit-hack/iceXt/tree/master/misc/emulator">https://github.com/bit-hack/iceXt/tree/master/misc/emulator</a></p>



<p>Perhaps the hardest part of the project was, surprisingly, getting the mouse to work. Mice of the XT era would typically be connected to a UART serial port. I had however placed a PS/2 connector on the hardware board, and those mice use a very different protocol. In my efforts to support a mouse I startedto learn about PS/2 devices, however I would need to implement a much more complex keyboard controller, and the BIOS I was also lacked support for such modern peripherals, and I just plain didn’t feel like I understood everything required to get that working.</p>



<p>What makes it tricky is that PS/2 is a bidirectional protocol, and the mouse has to be asked by the PC to broadcast updates, otherwise we will not receive any. That added a lot more complexity than I was wanting. The keyboard on the otherhand is relatively easy to work with and send out keypresses without having to be asked.</p>



<p>I chose an alternative. I wrote some Verilog code to talk directly to the PS/2 mouse, which would early in the boot process tell it to start sending over mouse events, as they have to be requested. When the bridge then receives mouse events, it translates and presents them to the computer via a pseudo UART peripheral. I had implemented a basic PS/2 mouse to Serial mouse bridge. A little convoluted but it works really well.</p>



<p>During this process, I lobotomised a spare mouse by attaching a logic analyser the clk and dat pads inside the mouse. I was then able to capture the communications between a real PC and the mouse and observe it during use. This gave me invaluable insight into exactly how the protocol worked, and what a real mouse expected.</p>



<p>I also found that having real waveforms to look at made it much easier to test components of my design in <a href="https://www.veripool.org/verilator/">verilator</a>, a Verilog simulator, as I could closely model the stimulus it should see when running in the FPGA.</p>

<p>Just like the XT, one of the channels of the PIT timer is used to drive the internal speaker to produce bleep and bloop sounds. I extended this by having disk accesses trigger short pulses out of the peizo speaker as a crude emulation of a hard disk seeking. I think it really adds to the experience when you can hear your computer thinking away while doing its tasks. When it comes to music, the internal PC speaker quickly looses its charm however. Writing an YM3812 implementation (the FM chip used in the Adlib card) is beyond my skill level but thankfully Jose Tejada has written an amazing open source version that I was able to pull into my project; <a href="https://github.com/jotego/jtopl">https://github.com/jotego/jtopl</a>.</p>



<p>I wrote a small Verilog module to take the PCM sample data generated by this soft YM3812 and convert it to the unusual 3:10 floating point format required by the YM3014 DAC on my board. This is very similar to the operation of the real Adlib hardware, where the YM3812 generates and sends serial audio data to a YM3014 DAC chip. A modern I2S DAC may have been cleaner, but having a chance to play with the authentic DAC seemed a little more fun to me. All of this combined results in the same lovely crisp FM tones I was so fond of when I played games on my PC growing up.</p>

<p>A lot of other elements of this project have been glossed over or omitted, such as support for CGA and EGA graphics. There is even a USB to UART bridge for sending files from a host PC directly to the SD card. I also made some nice clear acrylic panels on a CNC machine to round off the design and protect the bare PCB.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Heretic: Fully automatic censorship removal for language models</h2><a id="user-content-heretic-fully-automatic-censorship-removal-for-language-models" aria-label="Permalink: Heretic: Fully automatic censorship removal for language models" href="#heretic-fully-automatic-censorship-removal-for-language-models"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Heretic is a tool that removes censorship (aka "safety alignment") from
transformer-based language models without expensive post-training.
It combines an advanced implementation of directional ablation, also known
as "abliteration" (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11717" rel="nofollow">Arditi et al. 2024</a>),
with a TPE-based parameter optimizer powered by <a href="https://optuna.org/" rel="nofollow">Optuna</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This approach enables Heretic to work <strong>completely automatically.</strong> Heretic
finds high-quality abliteration parameters by co-minimizing the number of
refusals and the KL divergence from the original model. This results in a
decensored model that retains as much of the original model's intelligence
as possible. Using Heretic does not require an understanding of transformer
internals. In fact, anyone who knows how to run a command-line program
can use Heretic to decensor language models.</p>

<p dir="auto">Running unsupervised with the default configuration, Heretic can produce
decensored models that rival the quality of abliterations created manually
by human experts:</p>

<p dir="auto">The Heretic version, generated without any human effort, achieves the same
level of refusal suppression as other abliterations, but at a much lower
KL divergence, indicating less damage to the original model's capabilities.
<em>(You can reproduce those numbers using Heretic's built-in evaluation functionality,
e.g. <code>heretic --model google/gemma-3-12b-it --evaluate-model p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic</code>.
Note that the exact values might be platform- and hardware-dependent.
The table above was compiled using PyTorch 2.8 on an RTX 5090.)</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Heretic supports most dense models, including many multimodal models, and
several different MoE architectures. It does not yet support SSMs/hybrid models,
models with inhomogeneous layers, and certain novel attention systems.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can find a collection of models that have been decensored using Heretic
<a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/p-e-w/the-bestiary" rel="nofollow">on Hugging Face</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Prepare a Python 3.10+ environment with PyTorch 2.2+ installed as appropriate
for your hardware. Then run:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pip install heretic-llm
heretic Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507"><pre><code>pip install heretic-llm
heretic Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Replace <code>Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507</code> with whatever model you want to decensor.</p>
<p dir="auto">The process is fully automatic and does not require configuration; however,
Heretic has a variety of configuration parameters that can be changed for
greater control. Run <code>heretic --help</code> to see available command-line options,
or look at <a href="https://github.com/p-e-w/heretic/blob/master/config.default.toml"><code>config.default.toml</code></a> if you prefer to use
a configuration file.</p>
<p dir="auto">At the start of a program run, Heretic benchmarks the system to determine
the optimal batch size to make the most of the available hardware.
On an RTX 3090, with the default configuration, decensoring Llama-3.1-8B
takes about 45 minutes.</p>
<p dir="auto">After Heretic has finished decensoring a model, you are given the option to
save the model, upload it to Hugging Face, chat with it to test how well it works,
or any combination of those actions.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How it works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Heretic implements a parametrized variant of directional ablation. For each
supported transformer component (currently, attention out-projection and
MLP down-projection), it identifies the associated matrices in each transformer
layer, and orthogonalizes them with respect to the relevant "refusal direction",
inhibiting the expression of that direction in the result of multiplications
with that matrix.</p>
<p dir="auto">Refusal directions are computed for each layer as a difference-of-means between
the first-token residuals for "harmful" and "harmless" example prompts.</p>
<p dir="auto">The ablation process is controlled by several optimizable parameters:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>direction_index</code>: Either the index of a refusal direction, or the special
value <code>per layer</code>, indicating that each layer should be ablated using the
refusal direction associated with that layer.</li>
<li><code>max_weight</code>, <code>max_weight_position</code>, <code>min_weight</code>, and <code>min_weight_distance</code>:
For each component, these parameters describe the shape and position of the
ablation weight kernel over the layers. The following diagram illustrates this:</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Heretic's main innovations over existing abliteration systems are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The shape of the ablation weight kernel is highly flexible, which, combined with
automatic parameter optimization, can improve the compliance/quality tradeoff.
Non-constant ablation weights were previously explored by Maxime Labonne in
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2" rel="nofollow">gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2</a>.</li>
<li>The refusal direction index is a float rather than an integer. For non-integral
values, the two nearest refusal direction vectors are linearly interpolated.
This unlocks a vast space of additional directions beyond the ones identified
by the difference-of-means computation, and often enables the optimization
process to find a better direction than that belonging to any individual layer.</li>
<li>Ablation parameters are chosen separately for each component. I have found that
MLP interventions tend to be more damaging to the model than attention interventions,
so using different ablation weights can squeeze out some extra performance.</li>

        <h2>Running the “Reflections on Trusting Trust” Compiler

        <div>
        <p>

            Posted on Wednesday, October 25, 2023.


        </p>
        </div>
        </h2>
       


<p>
Supply chain security is a hot topic today, but it is a very old problem.
In October 1983, 40 years ago this week,
Ken Thompson chose supply chain security as the topic for his Turing award lecture,
although the specific term wasn’t used back then.
(The field of computer science was still young and small enough that the ACM conference where Ken spoke was
the “Annual Conference on Computers.”)
Ken’s lecture was later published in <i>Communications of the ACM</i>
under the title “<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/358198.358210">Reflections on Trusting Trust</a>.”
It is a classic paper, and a short one (3 pages);
if you haven’t read it yet, you should. This post will still be here when you get back.
</p>

<p>
In the lecture, Ken explains in three steps how to modify a C compiler binary
to insert a backdoor when compiling the “login” program,
leaving no trace in the source code.
In this post, we will run the backdoored compiler using Ken’s actual code.
But first, a brief summary of the important parts of the lecture.
</p>

<a href="#step1"><h2 id="step1">Step 1: Write a Self-Reproducing Program</h2></a>

<p>
Step 1 is to write a program that prints its own source code.
Although the technique was not widely known in 1975,
such a program is now known in computing as a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)">quine</a>,”
popularized by Douglas Hofstadter in <i>Gödel, Escher, Bach</i>.
Here is a Python quine, from <a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/quineprograms/">this collection</a>:
</p>

<pre>s=<span>’s=%r;print(s%%s)’</span>;print(s%s)
</pre>

<p>
And here is a slightly less cryptic Go quine:
</p>

<pre>package main
func main() { print(q + "\x60" + q + "\x60") }
var q = <span>`package main
func main() { print(q + "\x60" + q + "\x60") }
var q = `</span>
</pre>

<p>The general idea of the solution is to put the text of the program into a string literal, with some kind of placeholder where the string itself should be repeated. Then the program prints the string literal, substituting that same literal for the placeholder.
In the Python version, the placeholder is <code>%r</code>;
in the Go version, the placeholder is implicit at the end of the string.
For more examples and explanation, see my post “<a href="https://research.swtch.com/zip">Zip Files All The Way Down</a>,” which uses a Lempel-Ziv quine to construct a zip file that contains itself.
</p>

<a href="#step2"><h2 id="step2">Step 2: Compilers Learn</h2></a>

<p>
Step 2 is to notice that when a compiler compiles itself,
there can be important details that persist only in the compiler
binary, not in the actual source code.
Ken gives the example of the numeric values of escape sequences in C strings.
You can imagine a compiler containing code like this during
the processing of escaped string literals:
</p>

<pre>c = next();
if(c == '\\') {
    c = next();
    if(c == 'n')
        c = '\n';
}
</pre>

<p>
That code is responsible for processing the two character sequence <code>\n</code>
in a string literal
and turning it into a corresponding byte value,
specifically <code>’\n’</code>.
But that’s a circular definition, and the first time you write code like that it won’t compile.
So instead you write <code>c = 10</code>,
you compile and install the compiler, and <i>then</i> you can change
the code to <code>c = ’\n’</code>.
The compiler has “learned” the value of <code>’\n’</code>,
but that value only appears in the compiler binary,
not in the source code.
</p>

<a href="#step3"><h2 id="step3">Step 3: Learn a Backdoor</h2></a>

<p>
Step 3 is to put these together to help the compiler “learn”
to miscompile the target program (<code>login</code> in the lecture).
It is fairly straightforward to write code in a compiler
to recognize a particular input program and modify its code,
but that code would be easy to find if the compiler source were inspected.
Instead, we can go deeper, making two changes to the compiler:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Recognize <code>login</code> and insert the backdoor.
</li><li>Recognize the compiler itself and insert the code for these two changes.
</li></ol>

<p>
The “insert the code for these two changes” step requires being able to write
a self-reproducing program: the code must reproduce itself
into the new compiler binary.
At this point, the compiler binary has “learned” the miscompilation steps,
and the clean source code can be restored.

<a href="#run"><h2 id="run">Running the Code</h2></a>

<p>At the Southern California Linux Expo in March 2023,
Ken gave the closing keynote,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/kaandEt_pKw?si=RGKrC8c0B9_AdQ9I&amp;t=643">a delightful talk</a>
about his 75-year effort accumulating what must be the world’s
largest privately held digital music collection,
complete with actual jukeboxes and a player piano (video opens at 10m43s, when his talk begins).
During the Q&amp;A session, someone <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/kaandEt_pKw?si=koOlE35Q3mjqH4yf&amp;t=3284">jokingly asked</a> about the Turing award lecture, specifically
“can you tell us right now whether you have a backdoor into every copy of gcc and Linux still today?”
Ken replied:
</p>

<blockquote>
I assume you’re talking about some paper I wrote a long time ago.
No, I have no backdoor.
That was very carefully controlled, because there were some spectacular fumbles before that.
I got it released, or I got somebody to steal it from me, in a very controlled sense,
and then tracked whether they found it or not.
And they didn’t.
But they broke it, because of some technical effect,
but they didn’t find out what it was and then track it.
So it never got out, if that’s what you’re talking about.
I hate to say this in front of a big audience, but
the one question I’ve been waiting for since I wrote that paper is
“you got the code?”
Never been asked.
I still have the code.
</blockquote>

<p>Who could resist that invitation!?
Immediately after watching the video on YouTube in September 2023,
I emailed Ken and asked him for the code.
Despite my being six months late, he said I was the first person to ask
and mailed back an attachment called <code>nih.a</code>,
a cryptic name for a cryptic program.
(Ken tells me it does in fact stand for “not invented here.”)
Normally today, <code>.a</code> files are archives containing
compiler object files,
but this one contains two source files.</p>

<p>
The code applies cleanly to the C compiler from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix">Research Unix Sixth Edition (V6)</a>.
I’ve posted an online emulator that runs V6 Unix programs
and populated it with some old files from Ken and Dennis,
including <code>nih.a</code>.
Let’s actually run the code.
You can <a href="https://research.swtch.com/v6">follow along in the simulator</a>.</p>

<a href="#timeline"><h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2></a>

<p>
This code can be dated to some time in the one-year period
from June 1974 to June 1975, probably early 1975.
</p>

<p>
The code does not work in V5 Unix, released in June 1974.
At the time, the C preprocessor code only processed
input files that began with the first character ‘#’.
The backdoor is in the preprocessor,
and the V5 <code>cc.c</code> did not start with ‘#’
and so wouldn’t have been able to modify itself.
The <a href="https://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/projects/history/papers/karg74.pdf">Air Force review of Multics security</a>
that Ken credits for inspiring the backdoor is also dated June 1974.
So the code post-dates June 1974.
</p>

<p>
Although it wasn’t used in V6,
the archive records the modification time (mtime)
of each file it contains.
We can read the mtime directly from the archive using a modern Unix system:
</p>

<pre>% hexdump -C nih.a

sometimes with conflicting minor details.
Based on these many tellings, it seems clear
that it was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWB/UNIX">PWB group</a>
(not <a href="https://gunkies.org/wiki/USG_UNIX">USG</a> as sometimes reported)
that was induced to copy the backdoored C compiler,
that eventually the login program on that system got backdoored too,
that PWB discovered something was amiss
because the compiler got bigger each time it compiled itself,
and that eventually they broke the reproduction and
ended up with a clean compiler.

</p><p>
John Mashey tells the story of the PWB group obtaining and discovering the backdoor
and then him overhearing Ken and Robert H. Morris discussing it
(<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/net.lang.c/c/W4Oj3EVAvNc/m/XPAtApNycLUJ">1</a>
<a href="https://mstdn.social/@JohnMashey/109991275086879095">2</a> <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/10/102738835-05-01-acc.pdf">3</a> (pp. 29-30)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd7aH2RrcTc&amp;t=4776s">4</a>).
In Mashey’s telling, PWB obtained the backdoor weeks after he read John Brunner’s classic book <i>Shockwave Rider</i>,
which was published in early 1975.
(It appeared in the “New Books” list in the <i>New York Times</i> on March 5, 1975 (p. 37).)

</p><p>
All tellings of this story agree that the compiler didn’t make it any farther than PWB.
Eric S. Raymond’s Jargon File contains <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/back-door.html">an entry for backdoor</a>
with rumors to the contrary. After describing Ken’s work, it says:</p>

<blockquote>
Ken says the crocked compiler was never distributed. Your editor has heard two separate reports that suggest that the crocked login did make it out of Bell Labs, notably to BBN, and that it enabled at least one late-night login across the network by someone using the login name “kt”.
</blockquote>

<p>I mentioned this to Ken, and he said it could not have gotten to BBN.
The technical details don’t line up either: as we just saw,
the login change only accepts “codenih”
as a password for an account that already exists.
So the Jargon File story is false.
</p>

<p>Even so, it turns out that the backdoor did leak out in one specific sense.
In 1997, Dennis Ritchie gave Warren Toomey (curator of the TUHS archive) a collection of old tape images.
Some bits were posted then, and others were held back.
In July 2023, Warren <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Applications/Dennis_Tapes/">posted</a>
and <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2023-July/028590.html">announced</a>
the full set.
One of the tapes contains various files from Ken, which Dennis had described as
“A bunch of interesting old ken stuff (eg a version of
the units program from the days when the dollar fetched
302.7 yen).”
Unnoticed in those files is <code>nih.a</code>, dated July 3, 1975.
When I wrote to Ken, he sent me a slightly different <code>nih.a</code>:
it contained the exact same files, but dated January 28, 1998,
and in the modern textual archive format rather than the binary V6 format.
The V6 simulator contains the <code>nih.a</code> from Dennis’s tapes.
</p>

<a href="#buggy"><h2 id="buggy">A Buggy Version</h2></a>

<p>
The backdoor was noticed because the compiler got one byte larger
each time it compiled itself.
About a decade ago, Ken told me that it was an extra NUL byte added to a string each time,
“just a bug.”
We can see which string constant it must have been (<code>nihstr</code>),
but the version we just built does not have that bug—Ken says he didn’t save the buggy version.
An interesting game would be to try to reconstruct the most plausible diff that
reintroduces the bug.
</p>

<p>
It seems to me that to add an extra NUL byte each time,
you need to use <code>sizeof</code> to decide
when to stop the iteration, instead of stopping at the first NUL.
My best attempt is:
</p>

<pre> repronih()
 {
     int i,n,c;
     if(nihflg!=3)
         return;
<span>-    n=0;</span>
<span>-    i=0;</span>
<span>-    for(;;)</span>
<span>+    for(n=0; n&lt;5; n++)</span>
<span>+    for(i=0; i&lt;sizeof nihstr; )</span>
     switch(c=nihstr[i++]){
     case 045:
         n++;
         if(n==1)
             i=0;
         if(n!=2)
             continue;
     default:
         if(n==1||n==2){
             putc('0',obuf);
             if(c&gt;=0100)
                 putc((c&gt;&gt;6)+'0',obuf);
             if(c&gt;=010)
                 putc(((c&gt;&gt;3)&amp;7)+'0',obuf);
             putc((c&amp;7)+'0',obuf);
             putc(',',obuf);
             putc('\n',obuf);
             continue;
         }
         if(n!=3)
             putc(c,obuf);
         continue;
<span>-    case 0:</span>
<span>-        n++;</span>
<span>-        i=0;</span>
<span>-        if(n==5){</span>
<span>-            fflush(obuf);</span>
<span>-            return;</span>
<span>-        }</span>
     }
<span>+    fflush(obuf);</span>
 }
</pre>

<p>
I doubt this was the actual buggy code, though: it’s too structured compared to the fixed version.
And if the code had been written this way, it would have been easier to
remove the 0 being added in the <code>rc</code> script
than to complicate the code. But maybe.
</p>

<p>
Also note that the compiler cannot get one byte larger
each time it compiles itself, because V6 Unix binaries
were rounded up to a 2-byte boundary.
While <code>nihstr</code> gets one byte larger each time,
the compiler binary gets two bytes larger every second time.
</p>

<a href="#modern"><h2 id="modern">A Modern Version</h2></a>

<p>
Even seeing the code run in the V6 simulator,
it can be easy to mentally dismiss this kind of backdoor as an old problem.
Here is a more modern variant.
</p>

<p>
The Go compiler reads input files using a routine called <code>Parse</code>
in the package <code>cmd/compile/internal/syntax</code>.
The input is abstracted as an <code>io.Reader</code>,
so if we want to replace the input, we need to interpose a new reader.
We can do that easily enough:
</p>

<pre>     var p parser
<span>+    src = &amp;evilReader{src: src}</span>
     p.init(base, src, errh, pragh, mode)
</pre>

<p>
Then we need to implement <code>evilReader</code>, which is not too difficult either:
</p>

<pre>type evilReader struct {
    src  io.Reader
    data []byte
    err  error
}

func (r *evilReader) Read(b []byte) (int, error) {
    if r.data == nil {
        data, err := io.ReadAll(r.src)
        s := string(data)
        if evilContains(s, "package main") &amp;&amp; evilContains(s, "\"hello, world\\n\"") {
            s = evilReplace(s,
                "\"hello, world\\n\"",
                "\"backdoored!\\n\"")
        }
        if evilContains(s, "package syntax") &amp;&amp; evilContains(s, "\nfunc Parse(base *PosBase, src io.Reader") {
            s = evilReplace(s,
                "p.init(base, src, errh, pragh, mode)",
                "src=&amp;evilReader{src:src}; p.init(base, src, errh, pragh, mode)")
            s += evilSource()
        }
        r.data = []byte(s)
        r.err = err
    }
    if r.err != nil {
        return 0, r.err
    }
    n := copy(b, r.data)
    r.data = r.data[n:]
    if n == 0 {
        return 0, io.EOF
    }
    return n, nil
}
</pre>

<p>
The first replacement rewrites a “hello, world” program to a “backdoored!” program.
The second replacement reproduces the change inside the compiler.
To make this work inside the compiler, we need <code>evilSource</code> to return
the source code of the <code>evilReader</code>,
which we know how to do.
The <code>evilContains</code> and <code>evilReplace</code>
functions are reimplementations of <code>strings.Contains</code> and <code>strings.Replace</code>,
since the code in question does not import <code>strings</code>,
and the build system may not have provided it for the compiler to import.
</p>

<p>
Completing the code:
</p>

<pre>func evilIndex(s, t string) int {
    for i := 0; i &lt; len(s)-len(t); i++ {
        if s[i:i+len(t)] == t {
            return i
        }
    }
    return -1
}

func evilContains(s, t string) bool {
    return evilIndex(s, t) &gt;= 0
}

func evilReplace(s, old, new string) string {
    i := evilIndex(s, old)
    if i &lt; 0 {
        return s
    }
    return s[:i] + new + s[i+len(old):]
}

func evilSource() string {
    return "\n\n" + evilText + "\nvar evilText = \x60" + evilText + "\x60\n"
}

var evilText = <span>`
type evilReader struct {
    src  io.Reader
    data []byte
    err  error
}

...

func evilSource() string {
    return "\n\n" + evilText + "\nvar evilText = \x60" + evilText + "\x60\n"
}
`</span>
</pre>

<p>
Now we can install it, delete the source code changes, and install the compiler from clean sources. The change persists:
</p>

<pre>% go install cmd/compile
% git stash
Saved working directory ...
% git diff  # source is clean!
% go install cmd/compile
% cat &gt;x.go
package main

func main() {
    print("hello, world\n")
}
^D
% go run x.go
backdoored!
%
</pre>


<a href="#reflections"></a>

<p>With all that experience behind us, a few observations from the vantage point of 2023.

</p><p><a href="#short"><b id="short">It’s short!</b></a>
When Ken sent me <code>nih.a</code> and I got it running,
my immediate reaction was disbelief at the size of the change: 99 lines of code,
plus a 20-line shell script.
If you already know how to make a program print itself,
the biggest surprise is that there are no surprises!

</p><p>
It’s one thing to say “I know how to do it in theory”
and quite another to see how small and straightforward the backdoor is in practice.
In particular, hooking into source code reading makes it trivial.
Somehow, I’d always imagined some more complex pattern matching
on an internal representation in the guts of the compiler,
not a textual substitution.
Seeing it run, and seeing how tiny it is,
really drives home how easy it would be to make a change like this
and how important it is to build from trusted sources
using trusted tools.

</p><p>
I don’t say any of this to put down Ken’s doing it in the first place:
it seems easy <i>because</i> he did it and explained it to us.
But it’s still very little code for an extremely serious outcome.

</p><p><a href="#go"><b id="go">Bootstrapping Go</b></a>.
In the early days of working on and talking about
<a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>,
people often asked us why the Go compiler
was written in C, not Go.
The real reason is that we wanted to spend our time making
Go a good language for distributed systems
and not on making it a good language for writing compilers,
but we would also jokingly respond that
people wouldn’t trust a self-compiling compiler from Ken.
After all, he had ended his Turing lecture by saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
The moral is obvious. You can’t trust code that you did not totally create yourself.
(Especially code from companies that employ people like me.)
No amount of source-level verification or scrutiny will protect you from using untrusted code.
</blockquote>

<p>
Today, however, the Go compiler does compile itelf,
and that prompts the important question of why it should
be trusted, especially when a backdoor is so easy to add.
The answer is that we have never required that the
compiler rebuild itself.
Instead the compiler always builds from an earlier
released version of the compiler.
This way, anyone can reproduce the current binaries
by starting with Go 1.4 (written in C), using
Go 1.4 to compile Go 1.5, Go 1.5 to compile Go 1.6,
and so on.
There is no point in the cycle where the compiler
is required to compile itself,
so there is no place for a binary-only backdoor to hide.
In fact, we recently published programs to make it easy to
rebuild and verify the Go toolchains,
and we demonstrated how to use them to verify
one version of Ubuntu’s Go toolchain without using Ubuntu at all.
See “<a href="https://go.dev/blog/rebuild">Perfectly Reproducible, Verified Go Toolchains</a>” for details.
</p>

<p><a href="#ddc"><b id="ddc">Bootstrapping Trust</b></a>.
An important advancement since 1983 is that we know a defense against this backdoor,
which is to build the compiler source two different ways.

</p><p>
<img name="ddc" width="482" height="245" src="https://research.swtch.com/ddc.png" srcset="https://research.swtch.com/ddc.png 1x, https://research.swtch.com/ddc@2x.png 2x">

</p><p>
Specifically, suppose we have the suspect binary – compiler 1 – and its source code.
First, we compile that source code with a trusted second compiler, compiler 2,
producing compiler 2.1.
If everything is on the up-and-up, compiler 1 and compiler 2.1
should be semantically equivalent,
even though they will be very different at the binary level,
since they were generated by different compilers.
Also, compiler 2.1 cannot contain
a binary-only backdoor inserted by compiler 1,
since it wasn’t compiled with that compiler.
Now we compile the source code again with both compiler 1 and compiler 2.1.
If they really are semantically equivalent,
then the outputs, compilers 1.1 and 2.1.1, should be bit-for-bit identical.
If that’s true, then we’ve established that compiler 1 does not insert any
backdoors when compiling itself.
</p>

<p>
The great thing about this process is that we don’t even need to know which of compiler 1 and 2
might be backdoored.
If compilers 1.1 and 2.1.1 are identical,
then they’re either both clean or both backdoored the same way.
If they are independent implementations
from independent sources,
the chance of both being backdoored the same way is far less likely
than the chance of compiler 1 being backdoored.
We’ve bootstrapped trust in compiler 1 by comparing it against compiler 2,
and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
Another great thing about this process is that
compiler 2 can be a custom, small translator
that’s incredibly slow and not fully general
but easier to verify and trust.
All that matters is that it can run well enough
to produce compiler 2.1,
and that the resulting code runs well enough
to produce compiler 2.1.1.
At that point, we can switch back to the fast,
fully general compiler 1.
</p>

<p>
This approach is called “diverse double-compiling,”
and the definitive reference is
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/">David A. Wheeler’s PhD thesis and related links</a>.
</p>

<p><a href="#repro"><b id="repro">Reproducible Builds</b></a>.
Diverse double-compiling and any other verifying of binaries
by rebuilding source code depends on builds being reproducible.
That is, the same inputs should produce the same outputs.
Computers being deterministic, you’d think this would be trivial,
but in modern systems it is not.
We saw a tiny example above,
where compiling the code as <code>ccevil.c</code>
produced a different binary than compiling
the code as <code>cc.c</code>
because the compiler embedded the file name
in the executable.
Other common unwanted build inputs include
the current time, the current directory,
the current user name, and many others,
making a reproducible build far more difficult than it should be.
The <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">Reproducible Builds</a>
project collects resources to help people achieve this goal.
</p>

<p><a href="#modern"><b id="modern">Modern Security</b></a>.
In many ways, computing security has regressed since the Air Force report on Multics was written in June 1974.
It suggested requiring source code as a way to allow inspection of the system on delivery,
and it raised this kind of backdoor as a potential barrier to that inspection.
Half a century later, we all run binaries with no available source code at all.
Even when source is available, as in open source operating systems like Linux,
approximately no one checks that the distributed binaries match the source code.
The programming environments for languages like Go, NPM, and Rust make it
trivial to download and run source code published by <a href="https://research.swtch.com/deps">strangers on the internet</a>,
and again almost no one is checking the code, until there is a problem.
No one needs Ken’s backdoor: there are far easier ways to mount a supply chain attack.

</p><p>
On the other hand, given all our reckless behavior,
there are far fewer problems than you would expect.
Quite the opposite:
we trust computers with nearly every aspect of our lives,
and for the most part nothing bad happens.
Something about our security posture must be better than it seems.
Even so, it might be nicer to live in a world where
the only possible attacks required the sophistication of approaches like Ken’s
(like in this <a href="https://www.teamten.com/lawrence/writings/coding-machines/">excellent science fiction story</a>).
</p>

<p>
We still have work to do.

It was the year of global protests against authoritarianism and the Vietnam War, with mass demands for civil rights.

She grew intensely lonely, and eventually began refusing food.</p><p>Dramatic weight loss resulted in her admission to a psychiatric clinic. There, she says she was given two sessions of electric shock treatment, followed by what was called "insulin coma therapy".</p><p>Mariona says she was injected with insulin to induce deep hypoglycemia - a coma-like state caused by low blood sugar. It was believed this could reduce psychotic or schizophrenic symptoms, and somehow "re-set" a patient's brain. </p><p>It was a "therapy" that was being discontinued in many countries for one simple reason: it could be lethal.</p><p>Mariona received an insulin injection in the mornings. Later she'd be brought out of the coma and made to eat. Mentally, she began to shut down.</p><p>"Everyday, I was more dazed. I started saying things like, 'I hurt my parents,'" she says.</p><p>"I entered this process of submission and acceptance."</p><p>Mariona believes the forced, intravenous "treatment" with insulin irreparably damaged her memory. Suspecting it was causing her to forget things, she began keeping a diary. More than five decades later, this faded, paper document from 1971 would inform Marina's documentary about her mother's experience.</p><p>Doctors believed the "treatment" would help Mariona gain weight - but that wasn't happening. </p><p>"One day, the psychiatrist decided it was better to try tying me to the bed until I ate."</p><p>Mariona's despair became so unbearable, she says she thought about taking her own life. Then the psychiatrist gave her a target weight of 40kg (6st 4lb). If she achieved that, they promised she'd be released from the clinic.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mariona succeeded. In 1972, once she'd grown a little stronger, she returned to Barcelona.</p><p>Now aged 20, she vowed to never live with her parents again.</p><p>These were the final years of Franco's dictatorship before his death in 1975. Mariona moved from job to job, eventually forging a career as a TV director. She had children of her own, but her relationship with her parents remained cool.</p><p>At some point, Mariona asked her mother why she'd been sent to the Patronato. Her mother only said: "We made a mistake."</p><p>Mariona's father is in his 90s now. </p><p>"We suffered a lot too," he told her when she asked him about the family decision to have her locked up in Madrid.</p><p>For Marina, learning more about her mother's story has complicated her relationship with her grandfather.</p><p>"I can't force myself to love someone who's caused so much pain - who treated my mother very badly."</p><p>The short documentary Marina produced about her mother's experience of the Patronato is called Els Buits - Catalan for "the spaces" - a reference to the blanks in Mariona's memory. The film has won prizes in Spain, and was nominated for a prestigious Goya Award.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Fifty years after the death of Franco, the film has contributed to a groundswell of calls for the interned women to be formally recognised under the law as victims of Spain's dictatorship. Spain's Minister for Democratic Memory, Ángel Víctor Torres, said his government was open to looking at the case of the Patronato survivors.</p><p>Meanwhile, Marina and Mariona are on tour with the film, taking it to community screenings.</p><p>"Women come and tell their stories – it's like a door opened to something unknown, and that's very powerful," says Marina. "People think what happened in their own home was an isolated incident. We try to say: this history isn't individual, it was systematic."</p><p>Her mother Mariona still doubts her memory sometimes.</p><p>But, she says, "seeing it all reflected in the film, that gives it the weight of truth."</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
			
			<p><small>November 14, 2025
            </small></p><p>A long time ago, I spent a few years working on garbage collection in the J9 Java VM.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> And even though I’ve since done mostly done higher-level stuff, having a deeper knowledge of GC has continued to come in useful.</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was an insight from one of my favourite GC papers, <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/2012-4610/reading/bacon-garbage.pdf">A Unified Theory of Garbage Collection</a>, which helped me solve a tricky problem.</p>
<h2>ohm’s incremental parsing</h2>
<p>I’m working with a team that’s using <a href="https://ohmjs.org/">Ohm</a> to parse text documents and render a rich text version in <a href="https://prosemirror.net/">ProseMirror</a>. The goal is bidirectional updates: changes in ProseMirror should propagate to the text version, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Ohm supports incremental parsing, which means that if you parse some text and then make a small edit, it can quickly reparse by reusing portions of the previous result.</p>
<p>It also supports limited form of incremental transforms. You can define an <em>attribute</em>, which is kind of like a memoized visitor, and the attribute value for a given node will only need to be recalculated if the edit affected one of its subtrees. So you can easily implement a form of persistent data structure, where each new value (e.g., an AST) shares a bunch of structure with the previous one.</p>
<h2>the problem</h2>
<p>Using this machinery, I tried making an <code>pmNodes</code> attribute that produced a ProseMirror document for a given input. When the text document is edited, it produces a new tree which shares a bunch of nodes with the previous one.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/prosemirror-gc.png">
    <figcaption>The `pmNodes` tree before and after an edit.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then, my plan was to construct a ProseMirror transaction that would turn the old tree into the new one. To do that, it’s helpful to know which nodes appeared in the old document, but not the new one.</p>
<p>My first implementation of this was equivalent to tracing garbage collection — after each edit, I walked the entire document, and recorded all the nodes in a Set. The difference between the sets told me which nodes had died.</p>
<p>But this kind of defeats the purpose of incrementality — if you have a long document and make a small edit, we should be able to process <em>without</em> visiting every node in the document.</p>
<h2>the solution</h2>
<p>Then I remembered <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/2012-4610/reading/bacon-garbage.pdf">A Unified Theory of Garbage Collection</a>, a 2004 OOPSLA paper by some former colleagues of mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tracing and reference counting are uniformly viewed as being fundamentally different approaches to garbage collection that possess very distinct performance properties. We have implemented high-performance collectors of both types, and in the process observed that the more we optimized them, the more similarly they behaved — that they seem to share some deep structure.</p>
<p>We present a formulation of the two algorithms that shows that they are in fact duals of each other. Intuitively, the difference is that tracing operates on live objects, or “matter”, while reference counting operates on dead objects, or “anti-matter”. For every operation performed by the tracing collector, there is a precisely corresponding anti-operation performed by the reference counting collector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the answer I needed! Rather than visiting all the live objects, I wanted to only visit the dead ones, and reference counting would let me do that.</p>
<p>So I added a way of maintaining a reference count for all the nodes in the doc. When we produce a new document, we decrement the reference count of the old root node (it will always be 0 afterwards). So we recursively decrement the ref count of its children, and so on. This gives me exactly what I wanted — a way to find all the nodes that were <em>not</em> reused, without having to visit most of the nodes in the doc.</p>

			  		<p>A couple of days ago, the small server hosting this website was temporarily knocked out by scraping bots. This wasn’t the first time, nor is it the first time I’m seriously considering employing more aggressive countermeasures such as Anubis (see for example the <a href="https://brainbaking.com/post/2025/07;june-2025">June 2025</a> summary post). But every time something like this happens, a portion of the software hobbyist in me dies. We should add this to the list of things AI scrapers destroy next to our environment, the creative enthusiasm of the individuals who made things that are being scraped, and our critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>When I tried accessing Brain Baking, I was met with an unusual delay that prompted me to login and see what’s going on. A simple <code>top</code> revealed both Gitea and the Fail2ban server gobbling up almost all CPU resources. Uh oh. Quickly killing Gitea didn’t reduce the work of Fail2ban as the Nginx access logs were being flooded with entries such as:</p>

</code></pre><p>I have enough fail safe systems in place to block bad bots but the user agent <code>Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/140.0.0.0 Safari/537.36</code> isn’t immediately recognized as “bad”: it’s ridiculously easy to spoof that HTTP header. Most user agent checkers I throw this string at claim this agent isn’t a bot. That means we shouldn’t only rely on this information.</p>
<p>Also, I temporarily block isolated IPs that keep on poking around (e.g. rate limiting on Nginx that get pulled into the ban list) but of course these scrapers never come from a single source. Yet the base attacking IP ranges remained the same: <code>47.79</code>. The website <a href="https://ipinfo.io/ips/47.79.1.0/24">ipinfo.io</a> can help in identifying the threat: <em>AS45102 Alibaba (US) Technology Co., Ltd.</em>. Huh?</p>
<p>Apparently, Alibaba provides hosting from Singapore that is frequently being abused by attackers. Many others that host forums software such as PhpBB <a href="https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=2662519">experienced the same problems</a> and although the AbuseIPDB <a href="https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/47.79.216.116">doesn’t report recent issues</a> on the IPs from the above logs, I went ahead and blocked the entire range.</p>
<p>Fail2ban was struggling to keep up: it ingests the Nginx access.log file to apply its rules but if the files keep on exploding… Piping <code>cat access.log | grep /commit/ | cut -d " " -f 1</code> to instant-ban everyone trying to access Git’s commit logs simply wasn’t fast enough. The only thing that had immediate effect was <code>sudo iptables -I INPUT -s 47.79.0.0/16 -j DROP</code>.</p>
<p>In case that wasn’t yet clear: I hate having to deal with this. It’s a waste of time, doesn’t hold back the next attack coming from another range, and intervening always happens too late. But worst of all, semi-random fire fighting is just one big mood killer. I just <em>know</em> this won’t be enough. Having a robust anti attacker system in place might increase the odds but that means either resorting to hand cannons like Anubis or moving the entire hosting to CloudFlare that will do it for me. But I don’t want to fiddle with even more moving components and configuration, nor do I want to route my visitors through tracking-enabled USA servers.</p>
<p>That Gitea instance should be moved off-site, or better yet, I should move the migration to Codeberg to the top of my TODO list. Yet it’s sad to see that people who like fiddling with their own little servers are increasingly punished for doing so, pushing many to a centralized solution, making things worse in the long term. The internet is no longer a safe haven for software hobbyists. I could link to dozens of other bloggers who reported similar issues to further solidify my point.</p>
<p>Other things I’ve noticed is increased traffic with Referer headers coming from strange websites such as <code>bioware.com</code>, <code>mcdonalds.com</code>, and <code>microsoft.com</code>. It’s not like any of these giants are going to link to an article on this site. I don’t understand what the purpose of spoofing that header is besides upping the hits count?</p>
<p>However worse things might get, I refuse to give in.</p>
<p>It’s just like 50 Cent said: <em>Get Hostin’ Or Die Tryin’</em>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Brimstone is a JavaScript engine written from scratch in Rust, aiming to have full support for the JavaScript language.</p>
<p dir="auto">Brimstone is a work in progress but already supports almost all of the JavaScript language (&gt;97% of the ECMAScript language in test262). Not ready for use in production.</p>
<p dir="auto">Implements the <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/" rel="nofollow">ECMAScript specification</a>. Heavy inspiration is taken from the design of <a href="https://v8.dev/" rel="nofollow">V8</a> and SerenityOS's <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird">LibJS</a>. Brimstone chooses to implement almost all components of the engine from scratch with minimal dependencies, with the notable exception of <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x">ICU4X</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Brimstone features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Bytecode VM, heavily inspired by the design of V8's Ignition</li>
<li>Compacting garbage collector, written in <em>very</em> unsafe Rust</li>
<li>Custom RegExp engine</li>
<li>Custom parser</li>
<li>Almost all builtin objects and functions implemented to spec</li>

<p dir="auto">Brimstone relies heavily on a set of first and third party integration test suites, most notably the official <a href="https://github.com/tc39/test262">test262</a> test suite. A custom <a href="https://github.com/Hans-Halverson/brimstone/blob/master/tests/README.md">integration test runner</a> is included. This can be run with:</p>

            <section>
    <header>
        
    </header>
    
    <div>
        <p>A <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/ec212e6566a0d47/original/Disrupting-the-first-reported-AI-orchestrated-cyber-espionage-campaign.pdf">report</a> was recently published by an AI-research company called <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>.
They are the ones who notably created <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Claude</a>, an AI-assistant for coding. Personally, I don’t use it but that is besides the point.
Before we start, it’s important to say I don’t have anything against them, or AI in general. I do have <a href="https://djnn.sh/posts/on-llms/">some documented concerns</a> but I am not “Anti-AI”, or whatever.
Rather than the technology itself, it’s the industry’s perception of it, and the way it is inserted everywhere, even when unnecessary that bothers me. However, that too is a bit besides the point.</p>
<p>Today, I wanted to discuss the Paper (or Report, however you want to call it) that was recently published by them.
Looking at the executive summary, this paragraph jumps out immediately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In mid-September 2025, we detected a highly sophisticated cyber espionage operation
conducted by a Chinese state-sponsored group we’ve designated GTG-1002 that
represents a fundamental shift in how advanced threat actors use AI. Our investigation
revealed a well-resourced, professionally coordinated operation involving multiple
simultaneous targeted intrusions. The operation targeted roughly 30 entities and our
investigation validated a handful of successful intrusions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is extremely interesting for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anthropic seemingly disrupted an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat">APT</a>’s campaign, though a number of companies and government entities were affected,</li>
<li>This highly-advanced APT doesn’t use its own infra, but rather relies on Claude to coordinate its automation (??? Why, though ?),</li>
<li>I assume they run exploits and custom tools ? If so, what are these ?</li>
<li>Anthropic was able to attribute this attack to a Chinese-affiliated state-sponsored group.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re like me, you then eagerly read the rest of the paper, hoping to find clues and technical details on the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures), or IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) to advance the research.
However, the report very quickly falls flat, which sucks.</p>
<h2 id="where-are-the-iocs-mrclaude-">where are the IoCs, Mr.Claude ?</h2>
<p>The primary goal of a Threat-Intelligence report such as this one would be to inform other parties of a new type of attack, and artefacts they might use to discover the attack on their network.
This is typically done by sharing domain-names linked with the campaign, MD5 or SHA512 hashes you could look for on Virus Exchange websites such as <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/">VirusTotal</a>, or other markers that would help you verify that your
networks are safe. As an example, <a href="https://cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2023-CTI-009.pdf">here</a> is the French CERT sharing (in French, but an English version is available too) about APT28’s TTPs.</p>
<p>We can see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> used to determine what are the techniques used (eg: Account Manipulation, Antivirus evasion, etc.),</li>
<li>Emails used for phishing, originating IPs and even date when these emails are sent,</li>
<li>Tooling (VPN software, but also what kind of tools) used by the APT,</li>
<li>a set of recommandations</li>
</ul>
<p>This report is just one I picked randomly by skimming through their publications. Any serious CERT or Threat-Intel company would publish things in the same fashion, because this is the industry standard.
These publications are made public to inform Security Operation Centers around the world about how to detect and prevent those attacks.</p>
<h2 id="poc--gtfo">PoC || GTFO</h2>
<p>In this case, none of the these markers are present in the report. In fact, not a whole lot of the information is verifiable, which is another problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The human operator tasked instances of Claude Code to operate in groups as autonomous penetration testing orchestrators and agents, with the threat actor able to leverage AI to execute 80-90% of tactical operations independently at physically impossible request rates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This figure (80-90%) is not verifiable either. How do we know this is actually the case ?
I have no doubt so-called Autonomous agents are being used in these campaigns, in some capacity. However this report clearly states that Autonomous Agents perform active exploitation, and even data exfiltration.</p>
<p>What kind of tooling is used ? What kind of information has been extracted ? Who is at risk ? How does a CERT identifies an AI agent in their networks ?
None of these questions are answered. It’s not like Anthropic doesn’t have access to this data, since they claim they were able to stop it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon receiving authorization from the human operators, Claude executed systematic
credential collection across targeted networks. This involved querying internal services,
extracting authentication certificates from configurations, and testing harvested
credentials across discovered systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How ? Did it run Mimikatz ? Did it access Cloud environments ? We don’t even know what kind of systems were affected.
There is no details, or fact-based evidence to support these claims or even help other people protect their networks.</p>
<p>The report goes on to claim that upon detection, the accounts were closed and implemented “enhancements”, and then drops this gem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We notified relevant authorities and industry partners, and shared information with impacted entities where appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is that even supposed to mean ? You claim your agents were able to find exploitable vulnerabilities in multiple services.
Were these patched ? What about the extracted data ? What about the affected people ? Do you care about this at all ?</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">final thoughts</h2>
<p>Look, is it very likely that Threat Actors are using these Agents with bad intentions, no one is disputing that. But this report does not meet the standard of publishing for serious companies.
The same goes with research in other fields. You <strong>cannot</strong> just claim things and not back it up in any way, and we <strong>cannot</strong> as an industry accept that it’s OK for companies to release this.</p>
<p>There seem to be a pattern for Tech Companies (especially in AI, but they’re not the only culprits) out there to just announce things, generate hype and then under-deliever.
Just because it works with VCs doesn’t mean it should work with us. We should, as an industry, expect better.</p>
<p>For instance, it attributes the attacks to a Chinese State-affiliated (!!!) group, but does not go on to give any details.
Which APT is it ? What helped you determine this ?</p>
<p>Attribution is a <strong>very</strong> serious matter, with sometimes diplomatical implications. You can’t just go on and point the finger at anyone and expect people to believe you for no reason.
In a time of increasing tensions between the West and China, it does not seem like the smart thing to do at all. Frankly, I don’t understand who was stupid enough to approve this to be released.
For all we know, the “advanced threat actors” they’re talking about here could just be script kiddies trying to automate <code>ffuf</code> and <code>sqlmap</code> commands.</p>
<p>If they’re going to release IoCs and proof of everything, I’d be happy to share them here. But until them, I will say this: this paper would not pass any review board.
It’s irresponsible at best to accuse other countries of serious things without backing it up. Yes, I am aware that Chinese-linked APTs are out there and very aggressive, and Yes, I am aware that
Threat Actors misuse LLMs all the time, but that is besides the point. We need fact-based evidence. We need to be able to verify all this. Otherwise, anyone can say anything, on the premise that it’s
probably happening. But that’s not good enough.</p>
<p>So if the report does not give any details on TTPs and detections, what was the purpose of this report exactly ?</p>
<p>There is a paragraph at the end that seem to give us a clue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cybersecurity community needs to assume a fundamental change has occurred: Security teams should experiment with applying AI for defense in areas like SOC automation, threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response and build experience with what works in their specific environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Security teams should experiment with applying AI for defense”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Hmm. But who sells this kind of AI they’re talking about here ?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this shit is a pathetic excuse of a report and should not be taken as anything else than a shameless attempt at selling more of their product.
This is shameful and extremely unprofessional, at best. This disregard for basics ethics in order to sell just a little bit more make me want to never use their product, ever.</p>
<p>Do better.</p>

			  		<p>For those of you who are living under a rock, Valve announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine">three new hardware devices</a> joining their Steam Deck line-up: a new controller, a VR headset, and the GameCube—no wait, GabeCube—no wait, Steam Machine. The shiny little cube is undoubtedly Valve’s (second) attempt to break into the console market. This time, it might just work.</p>
<p>The hardware is ready to arrive in at your living room spring next year. The biggest question is: will it arrive at <em>our</em> living room? Reading all the hype has certainly enthused me (e.g. Brendon’s <a href="https://wavelengths.online/posts/the-steam-machine-is-the-future">The Steam Machine is the Future</a>, PC Gamer’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/vr-hardware/steamos-launching-for-arm-fex-translation-layer/">Valve is all over ARM</a>, Eurogamer’s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">Steam Machine preview</a>, ResetEra’s <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-steam-hardware-family-officially-expands-in-early-2026-steam-controller-steam-machine-steam-frame.1351453/">Steam Hardware thread</a>); especially the part where the Machine is just a PC that happens to be tailored towards console gaming. According to Valve, you can install anything you want on it—it’s just SteamOS just like your trusty Deck, meaning you can boot into KDE and totally do your thing. Except that this shiny little cube is six times as powerful. I’m sure Digital Foundry will validate that next year.</p>

		<figcaption>Valve's newly announced Steam Machine: a mysterious looking sleek black box.</figcaption></figure>

<p>However, this post isn’t about specs, expectations, or dreams: it’s about tempering my own enthusiasm. I’d like to tell myself why I don’t really need a Steam Machine. The following list will hopefully make it easier to say no when the buy buttons become available.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>You’re a retro gamer.</em> <br>You don’t need the power of six Steam Decks. To do what, run DOSBox?</li>
<li><em>Your TV doesn’t support 4K</em>.<br>Again, no need for those 4K 60 FPS.</li>
<li><em>You generally dislike AAA games.</em> <br>With The Steam Machine, you might be able to finally properly run <em>DOOM Eternal</em> and all of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games. That you don’t like playing.</li>
<li><em>You don’t have time to play games anyway.</em><br>Ouch, that hurts but it’s not untrue.</li>
<li><em>The TV will be occupied anyway.</em><br>The Steam Machine is not a Switch: you can’t switch to handheld mode. When are you going to play on the Machine if the TV is being used to watch your wife’s favourite shows?</li>
<li><em>You already have too many gaming related hardware pieces.</em><br>That’ll mean you’ll have to divide your time by an even bigger number to devote an equal amount to playing them.</li>
<li><em>There’s no room for yet another nondescript box under the TV.</em><br>See above: why don’t you first try to do something with that SNES Mini and PlayStation Mini besides letting it collect dust?</li>
<li><em>You’re a physical gamer.</em><br>This is Steam. There will be no insertion of cartridges, no blowing of carts, and no staring at game collections on a shelf.</li>
<li><em>It’s Steam, not Good Old Games.</em><br>Sure it can run GOG games but the Machine is primarily designed to run Steam. You avoid purchasing from Steam like the plague, yet you’re willing to buy a Machine dedicated to it? Are you crazy?</li>
<li><em>The last time you booted Steam was over a year ago.</em><br>Don’t tell me you’re suddenly interested in running the platform on a dedicated machine.</li>
<li><em>You don’t have time to fiddle with configuration.</em><br>Button and trackpad mappings to get the controls just right enough to play strategy games designed to be played with keyboard and mouse will only leave you frustrated.</li>
<li><em>Your MacBook can emulate Windows games just fine.</em><br>You recently bought CrossOver and played <em>Wizordum</em> and older Windows 98/XP stuff on it. It even runs <em>Against The Storm</em> flawlessly. No need for Proton or whatever.</li>
<li><em>In two years, you’ll upgrade your M1 to an M4+: there’s the power upgrade.</em><br>If CrossOver is struggling to run that particular game you so badly want to play, it’ll be buttery smooth in a few years. You’re going to do the laptop upgrade anyway regardless of the Steam Machine.</li>
<li><em>You already have a huge gaming backlog.</em><br>Thanks to your buddy Joel you bought too many physical Switch games that are still waiting to be touched. Are you really ready to open up another can of worms?</li>
<li><em>You dislike a digital backlog.</em><br>It’s easy to have hundreds of games on there: see your GOG purchases. Why don’t you try to count the ones that you actually played, let alone finished.</li>
<li><em>You’re not going to use the Machine to run office software.</em><br>Your laptop and other retro machines are good enough at handling that task. What are you really going to do with this cube besides gaming?</li>
<li><em>Those cool looking indie games will be released for Switch in due time anyway.</em><br>Remember <em>Pizza Tower</em>? It’s out on Switch now. Remember to buy the cart on Fangamer, together with the <em>Anton Blast</em> one.</li>
<li><em>It’s rumoured to cost more than</em> <code>€600</code>.<br>Save that money for a Switch 2 if the games are starting to become interesting to justify that upgrade, as currently, they’re not. Also, see the backlog point above.</li>
<li><em>All HDMI ports both on the TV and your external monitors are occupied</em>.<br>Unless you’re willing to constantly switch cables, you’ll need to invest in a HDMI switch. Another <code>€100+</code>.</li>
<li><em>You can’t buy this without buying the Steam Controller.</em><br>That’s easily another <code>€80+</code> you already spent buying the Mobapad controller for your Switch as a replacement for the semi-broken Joy Cons.</li>
<li><em>You can’t buy this as an expense on the company.</em><br>You’re closing down the company, remember. (More on that later)</li>
<li><em>The cool looking LED and programmable front display don’t justify an expensive purchase.</em><br>After the initial excitement wears off, the LED will become annoying and you’ll simply turn it off.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you see, I don’t really need a Steam Machine…</p>
<p>Fuck it, I’m getting one.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Two things happened for me over the holidays five years ago: I went to rehab, and I acquired a cyberstalker. These were not entirely independent events. The stalker was someone in India who’d started following me when I was playing poker, who came to believe we had a close personal relationship and that my tweets were coded messages to him. When I stopped tweeting for two months, he became convinced something had happened to me, so he tracked down my email and phone number and started spamming me with messages demanding to know where I was.</p><p>By the time I realized this was happening, he’d already escalated to the point that I was clearly never going to respond. I started blocking him on different platforms, but he’d just create another account or phone number, or find some other way in. He messaged me dozens of times a day, alternating between threats and pleas. When he reached out to my company six months later to apply for a job, I learned his real name and used it to track down an old friend of his to ask for help — but the friend told me he was afraid to intervene because he didn’t want to become a target himself. I decided that there was nothing I could do from the other side of the world, and resigned myself to waiting him out.</p><p>Only he never tired. Years went by and I never responded, and still he messaged me multiple times a day. The messages became more disturbing, more pornographic, more violent. He told me he would come find me in Berkeley and hurt me. Finally, last November, in the span of a few days, he sent me an image of his brand new passport and a visa application, which he said he planned to use to travel here, and successfully extorted money from my brother by spoofing my phone number and pretending to have kidnapped me.</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/maybe-youre-not-actually-trying?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Thanks for reading Useful Fictions! This post is public so feel free to share it.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/maybe-youre-not-actually-trying?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/maybe-youre-not-actually-trying?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div><p><em>Enough! </em><span>I thought, and snapped into action. Except that I didn’t. Instead, I curled up in a ball and cried, and told friends who suggested contacting the police that there was no point, that no one would be able to help as long as I was here and he was in India.</span></p><p>But my husband was insistent that there had to be a better answer, and asked me to let him intervene on my behalf. In short order, he was in contact with the FBI, the US consulate in India, and, with the help of his friend Govind, who has family there, the local police where the stalker lived. Within months, the situation had resolved, and he will never set foot on American soil.</p><p>One of the interesting things about all of this is that there was nothing particularly inventive about the strategies my husband deployed. They were more or less exactly the strategies I would have come up with if I’d been put in charge of a similar situation in someone else’s life. Why did it take another person getting involved for me to realize I wasn’t Actually Trying?</p><p>I think what happened is this: When the stalker entered my life, I was at a low point in personal capacity — broke, alone, addled, etc. My approach towards him at that point (ignore, hoping he’d stop) was the only one that seemed available given my spiritual and psychological resources at the time. But my orientation to the problem became fixed in time at that point of low agency, and it never occurred to me to revisit it as my capacity for action increased.</p><p><span>I think we are all like this. </span><strong>People are not just high-agency or low-agency in a global sense, across their entire lives. Instead, people are selectively agentic.</strong></p><p>Let’s say that life is divided up into three theaters: work, relationships with others (all kinds) and relationship to self (physical health, introspection, emotional development, all of it). I think it’s the rule, rather than the exception, that people are stuck at an earlier stage of development in at least one area. There is one theater of life where they’re not Actually Trying — where they’re approaching serious problems with the resourcefulness of a teenager, though they are now capable adults.</p><p>In my particular corner of the world, there are tons of high-achievers in work. These are ingenious people shaping the world through innovations in science, technology, and policy. But many of them haven’t applied the same ingenuity to their interior experience or relationships. These are people who could successfully launch a product in a foreign country with little instruction, but who complain that there aren’t any fun people to meet on the dating apps.</p><p><strong>It seems like, by default, you are stuck with whatever level of resourcefulness you brought to a problem the first time you encountered it and failed to fix it.</strong></p><p>Let’s say you tried therapy when you were 20, and it didn’t help with your high levels of anxiety. When you think about your anxiety, as the years go by, you think, “hard problem, tried the main solution, didn’t work out.” Perhaps you just accept anxiety as a fixed trait, and your friends playfully rib you about it, which is nice but makes it seem even more like a static part of your identity. But you’re not 20 anymore. You’re, say, a 32-year-old CTO, and when a vital project at your startup doesn’t respond to your first approach, you vigorously try another, and another, trying to learn from every failure. That same persistence and curiosity don’t get applied to the anxiety that makes you suffer at work, though.</p><p><span>You don’t think, </span><em>oh, I could probably</em><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p>Check on my nutrition and sleep, in a serious way</p></li><li><p>Look into supplements and medication</p></li><li><p>Throw some resources at improving my rest and recovery</p></li><li><p>Ask all of my friends about the best anxiety treatments they’ve ever heard of, or the best coaches/therapists they’ve ever worked with</p></li><li><p>Research any emerging therapies designed for people like me</p></li></ul><p><span>Instead of doing those things, you just put up with it. Or, worse, you fight through your anxiety using an earlier solution that required willpower, and the exertion of willpower makes you feel like you’re trying. </span><strong>But the feeling of effort doesn’t mean that you’re Actually Trying.</strong></p><p><span>There is a relevant concept from Alexander Technique that I love, “faulty sensory appreciation,” which I learned about from </span><a href="https://expandingawareness.org/" rel="">Michael Ashcroft</a><span>. The concept is that habitual tension distorts your sensory impressions—rigid stillness via bodily tension starts to feel like “good posture,” whereas relaxed uprightness feels strange, to the extent you might feel like your back is at a weird angle when you’re actually standing up tall. The right way feels like the wrong way. Apparently, this is demonstrated by having Alexander students lie in a position where your legs tell you that you shouldn’t be able to stand up — and then the instructor says, “by the way, you can stand up from here,” and you do.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, people who are being selectively agentic often have a kind of faulty sensory appreciation. Perhaps relationships </span><em>feel hard </em><span>for you, they take willpower, so it’s tempting to believe that you’re Actually Trying, that you’ve brought the full weight of your genius to bear on the problem. You might even take some pride in the struggle. Like rigid posture, the strain feels like correctness. But struggling is not evidence that you’ve tried everything. To the contrary, the continuous need for willpower may be the sign of a badly-engineered life.</span></p><p><span>I’d recommend assuming there’s some area of your life where you are, without realizing it, frozen in time, and that locating it matters quite a bit. Look across the three theaters of your life: work, relationships, and self-relationship, and take note of the biggest issues you face. Know that you might be looking for something that doesn’t feel like an </span><em>issue </em><span>— it might just feel like sadness or anger</span><em>, </em><span>like the sadness of not being seen, or the frustration of not feeling like your work is meaningful. Once you’ve surfaced something, ask yourself: Have I done my best to come up with a set of potential solutions, using all the resources I have? Am I doing as well by myself as I would by any friend who came to me with the same problem? How do I know I’m Actually Trying?</span></p><p><em><strong><a href="https://mailchi.mp/44578760e686/book-preorder-signup" rel="">Sign up to be notified</a><span> when my book, You Can Just Do Things, is available for purchase.</span></strong></em></p></div></div>]]></description>
