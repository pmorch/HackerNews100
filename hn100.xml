<h2 id="the-32-bit-timestamp-vulnerability-our-digital-time-bomb">The 32-bit Timestamp Vulnerability: Our Digital Time Bomb</h2>

<p><strong>On 2038-01-19 03:14:08 UTC, millions of sensitive embedded and industrial computer systems worldwide will suddenly start behaving in unpredictable ways, unless we take coordinated action now. And what’s worse, with unsecured time protocols, attackers don’t need to wait until 2038.</strong></p>

<p>This is not science fiction. It’s a real technical vulnerability affecting systems we rely on daily—from hospital equipment to power grids, from banking systems to transportation networks. This vulnerability is embedded in the fundamental architecture of our digital infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-care">Why Should You Care?</h2>

<p>Without proper preparation, we will face widespread disruptions including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hospital equipment displaying incorrect medication times</li>
  <li>Banking systems failing to process payments</li>
  <li>Traffic control systems malfunctioning</li>
  <li>Power grid instabilities causing outages</li>
  <li>Internet service disruptions</li>
  <li>Security systems generating false alarms</li>
</ul>

<p>In our interconnected world, these technical failures could have cascading effects. Critical system failures can endanger lives, disrupt economies, and compromise essential services. <strong>And what’s worse, malicious threat actors can manipulate time synchronization protocols in many cases to trigger this vulnerability at the time of their choosing.</strong> This is particularly concerning given how little attention many networks pay to their Network Time Protocol (NTP) security.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-32-bit-timestamp-vulnerability">Understanding the 32-bit Timestamp Vulnerability</h2>

<p>Many computer systems track time using a 32-bit signed integer that counts seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z (known as “Unix time”). This approach has a mathematical limitation: when this counter reaches its maximum value on 2038-01-19 03:14:08 UTC, affected systems will roll over to negative numbers, causing them to interpret the date as 1901-12-13T20:45:52Z.</p>

<p>This vulnerability exists in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legacy systems running critical infrastructure</li>
  <li>Embedded devices in industrial settings</li>
  <li>Internet of Things (IoT) devices</li>
  <li>Transportation and energy management systems</li>
  <li>Medical equipment</li>
  <li>Financial transaction processors</li>
  <li>Telecommunications infrastructure</li>
  <li>Millions of “smart” devices in homes and businesses worldwide</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-scale-is-unprecedented">The Scale Is Unprecedented</h2>

<p>The 32-bit timestamp vulnerability is definitively more severe than Y2K for several critical reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Massive Scale</strong>: There are now hundreds of times more vulnerable systems than existed during Y2K. For the last 30 years, simple controller computers have been embedded into virtually everything that moves or connects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Embedded Nature</strong>: Unlike Y2K, which primarily affected visible software that could be patched, today’s vulnerability exists in countless embedded systems that cannot be easily updated. Many are physically inaccessible, buried in infrastructure or sealed in hardware.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Increased Dependence</strong>: Our society’s dependence on digital infrastructure has increased dramatically since 2000. Critical systems from healthcare to transportation now rely entirely on accurate timestamps for basic operations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Security Implications</strong>: The near-universal connectivity of today’s systems means time-related vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely. Unsecured time protocols mean attackers could potentially trigger failures at will.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Less Visibility</strong>: Many vulnerable systems operate without user interfaces or monitoring capabilities, making detection of problems significantly harder than with Y2K.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-global-challenge">A Global Challenge</h2>

<p>Our digital infrastructure resembles an interconnected ecosystem. When individual components fail simultaneously, the entire system becomes vulnerable. Even if only 15-30% of critical systems fail, we will experience significant disruptions across multiple sectors.</p>

<p>The challenge is compounded by what economists call a “tragedy of the commons”—where responsibility is distributed but no single entity feels accountable for solving the shared problem. Organizations often assume:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Our systems represent only a small fraction of the infrastructure”</li>
  <li>“Other stakeholders will address the critical components”</li>
  <li>“Updating legacy systems offers minimal return on investment”</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the most concerning aspects involves security infrastructure. When system clocks suddenly jump backward, security certificates will become invalid across large portions of the internet, compromising our digital security framework.</p>

<h2 id="time-is-limited-action-is-required">Time is Limited, Action is Required</h2>

<p><strong>With approximately 12 years remaining until the critical date, we must prioritize our response.</strong></p>

<p>Our analysis indicates we cannot replace or update all vulnerable systems in time. Many embedded devices cannot be updated at all. However, through coordinated action, we can:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify and prioritize the most critical vulnerable systems</li>
  <li>Implement fixes where possible</li>
  <li>Develop contingency plans for systems that cannot be updated</li>
  <li>Establish global coordination to manage the transition</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h2>

<p>The Epochalypse Project was founded by Trey Darley (aka “treyka”) and Pedro Umbelino (aka “kripthor”), two cybersecurity researchers with extensive experience in vulnerability research and critical infrastructure protection.</p>

<p>Trey Darley has been working in IT since his teens, building a diverse career as a developer, sysadmin, network engineer, and cybersecurity specialist. His professional journey has included running IT for a major film production, foundational work in cyber threat intelligence, and serving in a load-bearing capacity at a national CERT during the COVID years. Trey also served on the FIRST.org board of directors, which took him around the world connecting with cybersecurity professionals.</p>

<p>Trey first became aware of the 2038 problem shortly after Y2K was addressed. Around 2016, he began jokingly referencing it in technical conference talks, saying “surely we’re going to fix all these security vulnerabilities before 2038 rolls around.” In 2023, he realized with alarm that 2038 is now closer to us than the 2008 financial crisis. While traveling globally in his FIRST.org role, Trey repeatedly asked knowledgeable contacts what was being done about the 2038 issue. He had assumed some government-sponsored technical group was addressing it, but discovered that no such master plan seems to exist.</p>

<p>Pedro Umbelino began his journey into technology at age 8, teaching himself to code BASIC on a Spectrum computer. By 14, he was decompiling computer viruses using A86/D86, sparked by a chance encounter with an Assembly language book at his local bookstore. Pedro’s career has spanned roles as a sysadmin, developer, and entrepreneur, but computer security remained his passion throughout. For the past decade, he’s focused exclusively on security research across various domains, discovering vulnerabilities in multiple systems along the way.</p>

<p>The Epochalypse Project began in 2024 after Pedro attended Trey’s lightning talk at the hack.lu conference. Pedro had just presented “Blowing up Gas Stations for Fun and Profit,” emphasizing the dangers of exposed industrial systems, when Trey’s message about the looming 2038 problem struck him. Realizing that 2038 was closer than Y2K had been when preparations began, Pedro ran tests on a device and discovered fundamental vulnerabilities. He immediately reached out to Trey, and they decided to start this project together.</p>

<p>This initiative is a side effort driven by their shared concern about a critical vulnerability that isn’t receiving adequate attention. As Trey puts it, “As it seems nobody has a master game plan, it’s up to us to organize and take some coordinated action.” Together, they bring complementary skills in technical research, vulnerability assessment, and public awareness campaigns—applying lessons learned from previous global technical challenges while addressing the unique aspects of the 32-bit timestamp vulnerability.</p>

<p>The Epochalypse Project builds on their combined experience in coordinating responses to widespread vulnerabilities—applying lessons learned from previous global technical challenges while addressing the unique aspects of the 32-bit timestamp vulnerability.</p>

<h2 id="the-epochalypse-project-mission">The Epochalypse Project Mission</h2>

<p>We are building a collaborative global initiative to address the 32-bit timestamp vulnerability through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Standardized testing methodologies</li>
  <li>Documentation of system vulnerabilities</li>
  <li>Development of remediation strategies</li>
  <li>Knowledge sharing across sectors and borders</li>
</ul>

<p>Your participation matters—whether you’re a technical expert or simply someone with a smartphone. Every test you run helps us map vulnerabilities, and every solution you share can safeguard countless systems.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-requires-urgent-global-attention">Why This Requires Urgent Global Attention</h2>

<p>The 32-bit timestamp vulnerability has received insufficient attention despite being demonstrably more severe than Y2K. The technology industry has been aware of this issue since the 1990s, yet coordinated remediation efforts remain limited. <strong>People aren’t taking action right now, and this must change immediately.</strong> The delay in addressing this vulnerability is not just concerning—it’s potentially catastrophic.</p>

<p><strong>You can be part of the solution.</strong></p>

<p>The following sections outline how people in different roles can contribute to this critical effort.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <h2 id="one-click-rce-in-asuss-preinstalled-driver-software">One-Click RCE in ASUS’s Preinstalled Driver Software</h2>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This story begins with a conversation about new PC parts.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/dms.avif" alt="dms.avif"></p>
<p>After ignoring the advice from my friend, I bought a new ASUS motherboard for my PC. I was a little concerned about having a BIOS that would by default silently install software into my OS in the background. But it could be turned off so I figured I would just do that.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/bios.avif" alt="bios.avif"></p>
<p>Immediately after logging into Windows I was hit with a notification requesting admin permissions to complete the installation of ASUS DriverHub, because I forgot to change the BIOS option. Since I needed to get a WiFi driver for the motherboard anyway, I got curious and installed it.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/admin_prompt.avif" alt="admin_prompt.avif"></p>
<p><em>I don’t have a screenshot of DriverHub but it showed a popup exactly like this in the bottom-right of my screen</em></p>
<h2 id="driverhub">DriverHub</h2>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/driverhub_ui.avif" alt="driverhub_ui.avif"></p>
<p>DriverHub is an interesting piece of driver software because it doesn’t have any GUI. Instead it’s just a background process that communicates with the website <a href="https://driverhub.asus.com/">driverhub.asus.com</a> and tells you what drivers to install for your system and which ones need updating. Naturally I wanted to know more about how this website knew what drivers my system needed and how it was installing them, so I cracked open the Firefox network tab.</p>
<p>As I expected, the website uses RPC to talk to the background process running on my system. This is where the background process hosts an HTTP or Websocket service locally which a website or service can connect to by sending an API request to <code>127.0.0.1</code> on a predefined port, in this case <code>53000</code>.</p>
<p>Right about now my elite hacker senses started tingling.</p>
<p><img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/9Z4aF3ksVH0AAAAd/joey-gibson.gif" alt="joey-gibson.gif"></p>
<p>This is a very sketchy way to design driver management software. If the RPC isn’t properly secured, it could be weaponized by an attacker to install malicious applications.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-vulnerability">Finding the Vulnerability</h2>
<p>The next step was to see if I could call the RPC from any website, this was replicated by copying the request from my browser as a curl command and pasting it into my terminal.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/copyascurl.avif" alt="copyascurl.avif"></p>
<p>After fiddling with variations of the command for a while my assumptions were confirmed. DriverHub only responded to requests with the origin header set to “driverhub.asus.com”. So at least this software wasn’t completely busted and evil hackers can’t just send requests to DriverHub willy-nilly.</p>
<p>However I wasn’t done yet, presumably the program checks if the origin is <code>driverhub.asus.hub</code> and if so it’d accept RPC request. What I did next was see if the program did a direct comparison like <code>origin == driverhub.asus.hub</code> or if it was a wildcard match such as <code>origin.includes("driverhub.asus.com")</code>.</p>
<p>When I switched the origin to <code>driverhub.asus.com.mrbruh.com</code>, <strong>it allowed my request.</strong></p>
<p>It was obvious now there was a serious threat. The next step was to determine how much damage was possible.</p>
<h2 id="the-extent-of-the-damage">The Extent of the Damage</h2>
<p>By trawling through the Javascript on the website, and about 700k lines of decompiled code that the exe produced, I managed to create a list of callable endpoints including some unused ones sitting in the exe.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Initialize</strong>
This command is used by the website to check if the software is installed and returns basic installation information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DeviceInfo</strong>
This returns all installed ASUS’s software, all installed .sys drivers, all your hardware components, and your MAC address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reboot</strong>
This reboots the target device immediately without confirmation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<video width="100%" controls="">
    <source src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/reboot_poc.mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video lmao
</video>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Log</strong>
This returns a zipped copy of all of DriverHub’s logs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>InstallApp</strong>
This installs an app or driver by its ID. The ID’s for all the apps are hard coded in an XML file which is provided by the DriverHub installer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UpdateApp</strong>
This self-updates DriverHub using a provided file URL to download and run.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="achieving-rce">Achieving RCE</h2>
<p>I became fixated on the UpdateApp endpoint for obvious reasons. So I spent a few hours exploring the code in ghidra and hitting it with various curl requests to learn the intricacies of how it behaves.</p>
<p>A request to the endpoint looks like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>curl <span>"http://127.0.0.1:53000/asus/v1.0/UpdateApp"</span> -X POST --data-raw <span>'{"List": [{"Url": "https://driverhub.asus.com/&lt;app.exe&gt;"}]}'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here were the observations I had made about the UpdateApp function at that point.</p>
<ul>
<li>The “Url” parameter must contain “.asus.com” but unlike the RPC origin check, it allows stupidity like <code>example.com/payload.exe?foo=.asus.com</code></li>
<li>It saves the file with the filename specified at the end of the URL.</li>
<li>Any file with any extension can be downloaded</li>
<li>If the file is an executable signed by ASUS it will be automatically executed with admin permissions</li>
<li>It will run <em>any</em> executable signed by ASUS, not just a DriverHub installer.</li>
<li><strong>If a downloaded file fails the signing check, it does not get deleted.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When I learned that DriverHub validates the signature of the executable I suspected an RCE may no longer be possible, however I soldiered on regardless.</p>
<p>My first thought was potentially a <em>timing attack</em>, where I tell DriverHub to install a valid executable, and after it validates the signature, but just before it installs the exe, I swap it out with a malicious executable. I theorized this could be possible by making two UpdateApp requests in parallel, with the malicious update being just after the legitimate one.</p>
<p>However timing attacks need to be extremely precise and having that timing being affected by files needing to be downloaded made it a very unreliable option. Given that, I decided to take a step back and think if there were any other options.</p>
<p>Eventually I was led back to the standalone WiFi driver I was going to install all along. The driver was distributed in the following zip file.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/zip_contents.avif" alt="Zip Contents"></p>
<p>The files of importance here are the <code>AsusSetup.exe</code>, <code>AsusSetup.ini</code> and <code>SilentInstall.cmd</code>. When executing AsusSetup.exe it first reads from AsusSetup.ini, which contains metadata about the driver. I took interest in a property in the file: <code>SilentInstallRun</code>.</p>
<p>When you double-click AsusSetup.exe it launches a simple gui installer thingy. But if you run AsusSetup.exe with the <code>-s</code> flag (DriverHub calls it using this to do a silent install), it will execute <em>whatever’s</em> specified in SilentInstallRun. In this case the ini file specifies a cmd script that performs an automated headless install of the driver, <strong>but it could run anything</strong>.</p>

<li>09/05/2025 - <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3462">CVE-2025-3462</a> (8.4) and <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3463">CVE-2025-3463</a> (9.4) were published</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assessing-the-damage">Assessing the Damage</h2>
<p>Almost immediately after reporting the RCE to ASUS I wrote a script to track <a href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/">certificate transparency</a> updates on my VPS, so I could see if anyone else had a domain with <code>driverhub.asus.com.*</code> registered. From looking at other websites certificate transparency logs, I could see that domains and subdomains would appear in the logs usually within a month.</p>
<p>After a month of waiting I am happy to say that my test domain is the only website that fits the regex, meaning <strong>it is unlikely that this was being actively exploited</strong> prior to my reporting of it.</p>
<h2 id="bug-bounty">Bug Bounty</h2>
<p>I asked ASUS if they offered bug bounties. They responded saying they do not, but they would instead put my name in their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asus.com/content/asus-product-security-advisory/#header2025">“hall of fame”</a>. This is understandable since ASUS is just a&nbsp;<a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/asus/marketcap/">small startup</a> and likely does not have the capital to pay a bounty.</p>
<h2 id="fun-notes">Fun Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When submitting the vulnerability report through ASUS’s <a href="https://www.asus.com/securityadvisory/">Security Advisory form</a>, Amazon CloudFront <strong>flagged the attached PoC as a malicious request</strong> and blocked the submission. So I had to strip out some of the PoC code and link video recordings instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you click “Install All” in DriverHub instead of manually clicking install on each recommended driver, it will also install ArmouryCrate, ASUS’s custom CPU-Z, Norton360 and WinRAR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their CVE description for the RCE is a little misleading. They say <em>“This issue is limited to motherboards and does not affect laptops, desktop computers”</em>, however this affects any computer including desktops/laptops that have DriverHub installed. Also, instead of them saying it allows for arbitrary/remote code execution they say it <em>“may allow untrusted sources to affect system behaviour”</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MY ONBOARD WIFI STILL DOESN’T WORK</strong>, I had to buy an external USB WiFi adapter. Thanks for nothing DriverHub.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>ASUS laptops generally have a feature that lets the user toggle the fan speed. Fn-F5 on some models, Fn-F on others. The direct effect is to limit the fan speed, from whisper mode to megablast, and indirectly control performance. But it doesn’t work in OpenBSD, so I needed to write an ASUS ACPI WMI driver.</p><h3 id="acpi">acpi</h3><p>ACPI is a hardware abstraction layer that lets the computer tell the operating system how to do things. It provides functions in byte code which the OS interprets to perform certain tasks. So instead of having to write a driver for every CPU, you call the ACPI method _PSS and that tells you what to do.</p><p>Of course, vendors want to include functionality that isn’t defined in the standard, so they add some extra methods, and then you end up writing some custom drivers anyway, for the little buttons that turn the microphone on and off, etc. OpenBSD (and other OSs) have lots of little drivers for ThinkPads and whatnot.</p><p>ACPI method names are only four letters long, so what do we do if two vendors include a method called WMNB and how do we determine what it does? (Technically, the ACPI nodes are identified by seven letter names, and the methods live under them, so it’s not really a problem, but somebody got paid to make a solution anyway.)</p><h3 id="wmi">wmi</h3><p>The solution is an extension to ACPI called WMI, which stands for Windows Multiplies Irritations or something. You ask ACPI for a buffer called _WDG, and this contains a table mapping GUIDs (globally unique, says so right there in the name) to local method names. Looking through this table, we come across <span>DCBA-FE-10-23-456789</span>, which we recognize as a GUID of interest, and this tells us the method to call is WMNB, but now we know it’s the right one.</p><p>OpenBSD does not have a WMI driver, which is part of what I need to set the fan profile. There is a WMI driver in Linux, and it includes an ASUS support driver for a variety of functions I’m interested in.</p><h3 id="first-steps">first steps</h3><p>First, I wrote a little acpi driver that attaches to PNP0C14. Read the _WDG buffer and print out all the GUIDs. Didn’t recognize any of the values, then realized I got the byte order wrong. Fixed that, saw something very close, realized I still didn’t get the byte order quite right. GUIDs are not big endian, they are not little endian, they are Goldilocks endian.</p><p>With that sorted out, I was able to enable events and get a printf every time I pushed a hotkey.</p><h3 id="events">events</h3><p>After receiving an interrupt and landing in our callback, we need to identify which event just happened by calling _WED. I did this, but was only getting 1 in response every time, regardless of key. I was a little stuck here. Very close to getting what I wanted, but without much clue as to what went wrong.</p><p>Turns out you can just look at your system’s ACPI code. OpenBSD runs <i>acpidump</i> at boot and saves all the files. Copy them to a work directory, run <i>iasl -d</i>, and have a look. A quick grep for _WED reveals the source.</p><pre><code>            Method (_WED, 1, NotSerialized)
            {   
                If ((Arg0 == 0xFF))
                {
                    Return (GANQ ())
                }
     
                Return (One)
            }
            Method (GANQ, 0, Serialized)
            {
                P8XH (Zero, 0xF2)
                If (AQNO)
                {
                    AQNO--
                    Local0 = DerefOf (ATKQ [AQHI])
                    AQHI++ 
                    AQHI &amp;= 0x0F
                    Return (Local0)
                }

                Return (Ones)
            }</code></pre><p>Even without knowing anything at all about ASL, this looks like a function that dequeues an event, but only if called with an argument of 255. That was the bug! Once I called it with the correct argument, I started receiving different event codes for backlight toggle, fan toggle, AC attach, etc.</p><h3 id="devices">devices</h3><p>Wrote some more code to handle getting and setting device state. There’s a magic incantation to call an ACPI method and pass it a device id, which could be the keyboard backlight, or the wifi led, or the fan profile, etc. Started with the keyboard backlight, since this was pretty easy to observe.</p><p>After fixing a few simple bugs like reversing the device ids for fnlock and backlight, I was able to blink the keyboard light by pressing F7. It’s all coming together.</p><p>Toggling the fan profile didn’t seem to accomplish anything, though. Under Windows, there is an audible difference switching to whisper mode, but I didn’t observe any change.</p><p>The Linux driver includes code for at least three different fan and performance profile settings. The same driver is used for a wide range of laptops, from thin and lights to gaming fraggers. According to the Linux driver, you can detect which devices are present by reading their state, then checking for a high bit, and then getting the value by masking off some low bits. This seemed to indicate I had a fan boost device, but it wasn’t responding to my changes.</p><p>After printing out the raw values, I noticed they were all -2. That doesn’t seem very likely. But it definitely has a high bit set, and masking off the low bits made it look reasonable. I think I missed something in the Linux driver? There’s lots of shifts and masks in lots of places.</p><p>Back to the ACPI dump, the WMNB method is a giant switch statement that ends with  Return (0xFFFFFFFE). So sure enough, there’s the -2 for a missing device, but I still don’t know which device id I should be using.</p><p>Back to the Linux driver, there’s an epic norse define for  <span>ASUS_WMI_DEVID_THROTTLE_THERMAL_POLICY_VIVO</span> which I hadn’t yet integrated because I was testing on a Zenbook, not a Vivobook. Added a check anyway, rebooted, and that’s a bingo! The Linux define name is a lie. Confirmed by inspecting the ASL code.</p><pre><code>            If ((IIA0 == 0x00110019))
            {
                Return (FANL (IIA1))
            }</code></pre><p>Now I had all the pieces. After a bit of cleanup and refactoring, my driver is complete. Kinda. There’s still a bunch of sensors that would be interesting to read, but my immediate concern has been addressed.</p><h3 id="results">results</h3><p>Pressing Fn-F after boot drops the fan speed noticeably, from a medium whir to barely a whisper. This has only a moderate effect on ordinary performance. The processor’s power budget is reduced, but not its (single core) clock speeds, so everything still runs smoothly. Lengthy compiles are slower, but I can also switch back to megablast turbo mode with the tap of a button.</p><p>Battery life is also much better. The fan itself is obviously eating less power. I think the CPU also enters a somewhat lower power state in whisper mode, or it’s willing to sleep a little deeper. It’s not clear everything that changes, and it varies by machine, but that’s the beauty of it. I wrote the driver on an AMD Zenbook, but it works without changes on an Intel Vivobook. Very convenient.</p><h3 id="misc">misc</h3><p>I also looked at the FreeBSD driver. FreeBSD directly uses the <span>ACPICA</span> code interfaces, calling function like <code>AcpiEvaluateObject</code> which personally look kinda out of place in BSD driver code. Linux does too, but all the functions have been renamed to <code>acpi_evaluate_object</code>, so they resemble the local style. I’m not entirely sure of the history here, but I think the generic <span>ACPICA</span> was at some pointer extracted and generified from the Linux code. OpenBSD uses a custom AML interpreter, so we have functions like <code>aml_evalname</code>.</p><p>In OpenBSD, nearly all header files are kept with their C files. So both dsdt.c and dsdt.h live in dev/acpi. (Notable exception is core C files in kern and headers in sys.) As a first time acpi driver writer, it was very convenient that all the OpenBSD code I needed to reference, from sample drivers to data structures to helper functions, was all in one spot.</p><p>Linux separates things such that I was looking at C files in drivers/platform/x86 and header files in include/linux/platform_data/x86. And the ACPI code lives other places as well. It’s all very orderly, but at times it felt like navigating a grocery store that arranges products in alphabetical order. Logical, but not exactly cozy.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’ve left Google after working there for 19 years.</p>



<p>For most of that time I’ve been fortunate in being able to work on the <a href="https://go.dev/" data-type="link" data-id="https://go.dev/">Go programming language</a>. Go was started by Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, and Robert Griesemer in the fall of 2007. I joined the team in June, 2008, about the same time as Russ Cox. I’ve been very lucky to be able to work with such remarkable people on such an interesting project.</p>



<p>I am astonished at how much use Go has gotten over the years. Go has reached the status of being just another programming language, one that any programmer can choose when appropriate. That is far beyond what any of us expected in the early days, when our best hope was that Go might serve as an example for useful ideas that other languages and programming environments could adopt.</p>



<p>I started on Go by adding a Go frontend to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC compiler</a>. The Go project already had a compiler, of course, based on the Inferno C compiler. Having two compilers helped ensure that the language was clearly defined. When the two compilers differed, we knew that we had to clarify the spec and figure out what the right behavior should be.</p>



<p>In general my self-appointed role on the Go team consisted of tracking everything I could about the project and looking for areas that needed help. Among other things in the earlier years I added Go support to Google’s internal build system, and to <a href="https://www.swig.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.swig.org/">the SWIG tool</a>. For a couple of years I was the team manager. From the first days of Go people asked for support for some sort of generics or type parameterization; working with Robert Griesemer I developed a series of language change proposals, and generics were added to the language in the <a href="https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics" data-type="link" data-id="https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics">Go 1.18 release in 2022</a>.</p>



<p>My approach had its good points and its bad points. I was quick to see the problems that people were running into today, and the problems they would run into tomorrow, and I was often able to get those problems addressed. But I was slow to see the ideas that would help people do new things that they weren’t trying to do and thus weren’t missing, things such as the Go module proxy and the Go vulnerability database.</p>



<p>Overall I think my approach was a good one in helping to build a successful project. But Gooogle has changed, and Go has changed, and the overall computer programming environment has changed. It’s become clear over the last year or so that I am no longer a good fit for the Go project at Google. I have to move on.</p>



<p>I’m still interested in Go. I don’t think that the language is done. I don’t think that any programming language is ever done–the programming environment changes all the time, and languages must evolve or die. That is doubly true for a language like Go that comes equipped with a substantial standard library, one that must adapt to the new needs of programmers.</p>



<p>I will be taking a break for a while, but I hope to be able to contribute to Go again in the future.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Painting weddings for a few years now, I have spent a fair bit of time observing strangers move through a room. Seeing someone new, I always have a feeling of noticing their internal architecture. I did not realize that some people do not feel this way, at least not as intensely.&nbsp;</p><div><li><p>By internal architecture, what I mean is, when someone talks to me, what I notice first are the supporting beams propping up their words: the cadence and tone and desire behind them. I hear if they are bored, fascinated, wanting validation or connection. I often feel like I can hear how much they like themselves. </p></li><li><p>I hear the speed at which they metabolize information and the nature of their attention. Attention falls on the spectrum of jumping bean to steady stream. Where it falls depends on a person’s nature, and also how much they want to be in that conversation. Someone’s quality of attention is evident from the questions they ask (how much they diverge from what the speaker is saying), if their gaze is wandering elsewhere, if they are fidgeting, restless. The outlier is dissociation, when someone is noticeably vacant, their attention completely absent. </p></li><li><p> Sometimes I see their feelings towards me when we talk, but that has the largest room for error in retrospect. Maybe the person I have the hardest time seeing clearly is still myself. I can see people more clearly when I am watching them talk to others.</p></li><li><p>I watch the person with the loudest laugh. The most striking thing isn't the volume—it's the feverish pitch. As the night goes on, it begins to sound more like desperation. Their joy has a fraying quality; it is exhausting to carry because it comes with a desire to seem happy and make others happy at all times.</p></li><li><p>When someone is flirting: Flirting is marketing, revealing yourself at a specific angle to coax a certain response. People have different marketing strategies, but this is always true: there is energy that is snaking outward, trying to find a surface to grip on. It can feel intrusive when un-welcomed, and pleasurably intimate if welcomed. Some people flirt with everyone. Some people only flirt with people they find hot. Some people never flirt.  </p></li><li><p>It is easy to tell how happy someone is to see another person enter a conversation. There is happy, and there is polite, and they look very different. Polite has a mechanical quality to it, like carrying out all the right movements to replace batteries in a remote. Happy has a boundless quality: unpredictable, even when it is at a low level. There is an openness, allowing another person to surprise and delight them. The easiest way to say this: there is no script for happy. It tumbles out of the body. Polite comes from the mind –it is restrained and calculated – measured lines and pauses. There are reinforcing loops in a polite person and a happy person. A person closed to the possibility of delight finds less of it. A person open to it finds more. </p></li><li><p>When someone is close enough for me to hear them in conversation, I can hear how receptive they are to other people’s worlds. This is often encoded in the pace of their back and forth; the brief pause after someone says something, or the absence of any breathing room. The pause is usually sinking into a feeling, allowing themselves to process and respond in real time. </p></li><li><p>People who don't pause exist more in their head than their body. The mind is top-down, rigid, quick, enforcing an established view. The mind is waiting for the other person to be done so they can say what’s rattling around inside. The body is slower, needs more time, and then words bubble up organically, one after another, without planning. People who exist more in their body are generally better at connecting emotionally with others. </p></li><li><p>I can see how much someone accepts themselves by looking for intense distortions in the way they are interacting with the world. Find the range in how they treat people; if there is a split difference in their stance towards people they admire, and people they look down on. I never met a person who looked down on others and unconditionally accepted themselves. For people who are self-accepting, it is usually less the case that some people are treated like they are golden and others like they are cursed. They may still have preferences to engage with some people over others, but their baseline patience and goodwill does not fall and rise intensely. </p></li><li><p>There are people who hate the world, and people who love a very narrow understanding of it, and people who love the world unconditionally, in all lifetimes, in all understandings. People who love a narrow understanding of the world exhibit a settledness in their bones; they are satisfied and not reaching outward. But their dynamic range moving through a room, moving through conversations, is limited. Opposing ideas often cause them to disengage. It is a little sad to see this, all the possibilities they don't even know they are missing by keeping their world narrow. </p></li><li><p>It is easy to spot the person in the room who thinks they are better than everyone. It is the person uninterested in giving any of their attention, the genuine and open-ended kind, to anyone else. This is also painful to see, because they often cannot see their own misery, how unpleasant the world is if no one is good enough to be loved.</p></li><li><p>Some people don't like themselves. They hide this from themselves by thinking they don’t like other people. They often bristle like a porcupine any time someone gets too close. That, or the opposite: they need to be insulated by other people's skin at all times. These are contrasting expressions of the same fundamental fracture. A person cannot stand themselves, and as a result, they either can only stand being unperceived, or they need other people to constantly perceive them to feel okay. </p></li><li><p>Watching someone reach for shiny things — not necessarily  the reaching, but the amount of hunger tangled with it— reveals how attached they are to their sense of desire and pleasure.</p></li><li><p>Look for unfounded apologies if you want to see how much someone believes in their right to exist. Look at the way they walk through a room, the way their shoulders are caved in or opened outward in relation to their ribcage, the way their eyes move to take in their surroundings, to see how much they believe in their belonging.</p></li><li><p>When I meet someone, I usually get a sense of whether they are generally happy, having a sad day, or generally sad, having a happy day. The emotional history of their life is often etched in the muscle tension in their face and their posture. </p></li><li><p>Some people are more like closed fists, others are more like open palms. Many of the driven people I have met are closed fists: warm, charming, and ready to punch through a wall at any point in time. There is a rigidity, a tunnel vision that naturally follows grasping for certain outcomes. An open palm has an expansive, receptive quality. They may still be incredibly intense and engaged with the world, but they are fluid, not forceful, in nature. </p></li><li><p>You can tell how controlling someone is by how forceful they are in conversation, how often they cut someone else off or steer the conversation towards what they want. Sometimes it is hard to see someone as controlling when what they desire is making you feel special and chosen. </p></li><li><p>&nbsp;It is easy to see when someone has a widely felt gravitational pull. Just watch where eyes congregate and return in room. </p></li><li><p>I can see when two people are close in a way that blocks their energy from the rest of the world, insulated and intimate and barring others from entering. I can also see when two people are close in a way that supports each other in being more engaged with the world. I admire the couples who are able to inhabit both states: experiencing the kind of connection that doesn’t allow outside entry, and then turning outward and drawing people in together. </p></li><li><p>I can see how much trust exists between couples, based on how men and women interact with their preferred sex. It is easy to sense wariness, someone watching their partner's face as they talk to a beautiful stranger, tension carried in their forehead and jaw, scanning for threats. It is also easy to sense complete ease and safety. It is the orientation I mentioned earlier, being an open palm. Beautiful strangers are not treated differently from anyone else. </p></li><li><p>My favorite kind of person has an elasticity in their movements. There is an openness that does not need to be announced, a curiosity that looks like turning towards all experience. They are not the loudest, but because they exhibit an unconditional acceptance of everyone, they are usually well loved. It makes sense, doesn't it? Unless there are many layers of contortions, most people love what loves them back. Not desire, not need, love — to see them wholly, with gentleness and acceptance. If you are able to do that, most people will sense it. And they will try to love you back. </p></li></div></div>]]></description>

<p><em>[Editor’s Note: I recently asked <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/2031/the-culture-of-tech-podcast-episode-1-steve-wozniak-and-television">Steve Wozniak</a> via email about why the original Apple II did not support lowercase letters. I could have guessed the answer, but it’s always good to hear the reason straight from the source. Woz’s response was so long and detailed that I asked him if I could publish the whole thing on VC&amp;G. He said yes, so here we are. –Benj]</em></p>

<p><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/images/forum_contest/divider2.jpg" alt="----------"></p>

<p>In the early 1970s, I was very poor, living paycheck to paycheck. While I worked at HP, any spare change went into my digital projects that I did on my own in my apartment. I was an excellent typist. I was proficient at typing by touch using keypunches with unusual and awkward special characters — even though some used two fingers of one hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wozniak-and-jobs.jpg"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wozniak-and-jobs.jpg" alt="Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs with an Apple I" width="250"></a>I saw a friend typing on a teletype to the six computers on the early ARPAnet. I had to have this power over distant computers too. After building many arcade games on computers, how to build it was obvious to me instantly. I’d create a video generator (as with the arcade games) and display text using a character generator chip. But I needed a keyboard.</p>
<p>I’d show up at HP every morning around 6 AM to peruse engineering magazines and journals to see what new chips and products were coming. I found an offer for a $60 keyboard modeled after the upper-case-only ASR-33 teletype.</p>
<p>That $60 for the keyboard is probably like $500 today <em>[About $333 adjusted for inflation — Benj]</em>. This $60 was the single biggest price obstacle in the entire development of the early Apple computers. I had to gulp just to come up with $60, and I think my apartment rental check bounced that month — they put me on cash payment from then on. Other keyboards you could buy back then cost around $200, which might be $1000 or more now. There just wasn’t any mass manufacturing of digital keyboards in 1974.</p>
<p>So my TV Terminal, for accessing the ARPAnet, was uppercase only.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/images/forum_contest/divider2.jpg" alt="----------"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AP_81887390289-1000x532.jpg"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AP_81887390289-1000x532.jpg" alt="Apple I Owned By Steve Jobs Auction Image" width="250"></a>The idea for my own computer came into my head the first day of the Homebrew Computer Club.</p>
<p>Maybe a year prior, I had looked at the 4-bit Intel 4004 microprocessor and determined that it could never be used to build the computer I wanted for myself — based on all the minicomputers that I’d designed on paper and desired since 1968-1970. But at the Homebrew Computer Club, they were talking about the 8008 and 8080 microprocessors, which I had not kept up with after my 4004 disappointment. I took home a data sheet for the 8008, based on a version of it from a Canadian company. That night, I discovered that this entire processor was capable of being a computer.</p>
<p>I already had my input and output, my TV Terminal. With that terminal, I’d type to a computer in Boston, for example, and that far-away computer, on the ARPAnet, would type back to my TV. I now saw that all I had to do was connect the microprocessor, with 4K of RAM (I’d built my tiny computer with the capability of the Altair, 5 years prior, in 1970, with my own TTL chips as the processor). 4K was the amount of RAM allowing you to type in a program on a human keyboard and run it.</p>
<p>My computer wasn’t designed from the ground up. I just added the 6502 microprocessor and 4K DRAMS (introduced that summer of 1975 and far less costly than Intel static RAMs) to have a complete computer with input and output.</p>
<p>So the uppercase keyboard was not designed as part of a computer. It already existed as my TV Terminal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/awozjobs.png"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/awozjobs.png" alt="Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs with an Apple II" width="250"></a>I truly would have wanted lower case on a keyboard, but I was still totally cash strapped, with no spare money. After already starting a BASIC interpreter for my computer, I would have had to re-assemble all my code. But here again, I did not have the money to have an account on a timeshare service for a 6502 interpreter. The BASIC was handwritten and hand-assembled. I’d write the source code and then write the binary that an interpreter would have turned my code into. To implement a major change like lower case (keeping 6 bits per character in my syntax table instead of 5 bits) would have been a horrendous and risky job to do by hand. If I’d had a time-share assembler, it would have been quick and easy. Hence, the Apple I wound up with uppercase only.</p>
<p>I discussed the alternatives with Steve Jobs. I was for lower case, but not for money (cost). Steve had little computer experience, and he said that uppercase was just fine. We both had our own reasons for not changing it before the computers were out. Even with the later Apple II (as with the Apple I), the code was again hand-written and hand-interpreted because I had no money. All 8 kB of code in the Apple II was only written by my own hand, including the binary object code. That made it impossible to add lower case into it easily.</p>
<p>So, in the end, the basic reason for no lowercase on the Apple I and Apple II was my own lack of money. Zero checking. Zero savings.</p>

<p>Microsoft is working on adding a new Teams feature&nbsp;that will prevent users from capturing screenshots of sensitive information shared during meetings.</p>

<p>Those joining from unsupported platforms will be automatically placed in audio-only mode to protect shared content.&nbsp;The company&nbsp;plans to start rolling out this new Teams feature to Android, desktop, iOS, and web&nbsp;users worldwide in July 2025.</p>

<p>"To address the issue of unauthorized screen captures during meetings, the Prevent Screen Capture feature ensures that if a user attempts to take a screen capture, the meeting window will turn black, thereby protecting sensitive information," <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=490051" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft shared</a> in a new&nbsp;Microsoft 365 roadmap entry.</p>

<p>"This feature will be available on Teams desktop applications (both Windows and Mac) and Teams mobile applications (both iOS and Android)."</p>

<p>However, it should be noted that, even if screenshots are blocked, sensitive media and information shared in Teams meetings can still be captured by taking a photo of the conversation.</p>

<p>Last month, Meta introduced a similar WhatsApp feature named "<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/whatsapps-new-advanced-chat-privacy-protects-sensitive-messages/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Advanced Chat Privacy</a>," which protects sensitive information exchanged in private chats and group conversations by blocking attempts to save shared media and export chat content.</p>

<p>Redmond will also roll out&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=490050" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">town hall screen privilege management update</a>&nbsp;in Teams Rooms on Windows,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=490564" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interactive BizChat/Copilot Studio agents</a>&nbsp;in meetings and 1-on-1 calls, and a Copilot feature to help&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=488807" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">generate audio overviews</a>&nbsp;of transcribed meetings in June.</p>

<p>Another Copilot feature to help&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=488807" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">generate audio overviews</a>&nbsp;of transcribed meetings is also under development and&nbsp;will let users choose the speakers, adjust the tone, and tailor the length.</p>

<p>In January, the company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-teams-phishing-attack-alerts-coming-to-everyone-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reminded Microsoft 365 admins</a>&nbsp;that its new Teams Chat brand impersonation protection feature, which alerts users when detecting phishing attacks targeting organizations with external Teams access toggled on, will be made generally available for all customers by mid-February 2025.</p>

<p>At last year's&nbsp;Enterprise Connect enterprise communications and collaboration conference, Microsoft&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftteamsblog/microsoft-teams-building-a-foundation-for-the-future/4090393" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a>&nbsp;that the Teams platform had reached over 320 million monthly active users across 181 markets and 44 languages.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Thank you very much, Your Eminence. Before taking our seats, let us begin with a prayer, asking the Lord to continue to accompany this College, and above all the entire Church with this spirit, with enthusiasm, but also with deep faith. Let us pray together in Latin.</p> 
<p>Pater noster… Ave Maria…</p> 
<p>In the first part of this meeting, there will be a short talk with some reflections that I would like to share with you. But then there will be a second part, a bit like the opportunity that many of you had asked for: a sort of dialogue with the College of Cardinals to hear what advice, suggestions, proposals, concrete things, which have already been discussed in the days leading up to the Conclave.</p> 
<p>Dear Brother Cardinals,</p> 
<p>I greet all of you with gratitude for this meeting and for the days that preceded it. Days that were sad because of the loss of the Holy Father Pope Francis and demanding due to the responsibilities we confronted together, yet at the same time, in accordance with the promise Jesus himself made to us, days rich in grace and consolation in the Spirit (cf. <i>Jn</i> 14:25-27).</p> 
<p>You, dear Cardinals, are the closest collaborators of the Pope. This has proved a great comfort to me in accepting a yoke clearly far beyond my own limited powers, as it would be for any of us. Your presence reminds me that the Lord, who has entrusted me with this mission, will not leave me alone in bearing its responsibility. I know, before all else, that I can always count on his help, the help of the Lord, and through his grace and providence, on your closeness and that of so many of our brothers and sisters throughout the world who believe in God, love the Church and support the Vicar of Christ by their prayers and good works.</p> 
<p>I thank the Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re – who deserves applause, at least once, if not more – whose wisdom, the fruit of a long life and many years of faithful service to the Apostolic See, has helped us greatly during this time. I thank the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell – I believe he is present today – for the important and demanding work that he has done throughout the period of the Vacant See and for the convocation of the Conclave. My thoughts also go to our brother Cardinals who, for reasons of health, were unable to be present, and I join you in embracing them in communion of affection and prayer.</p> 
<p>At this moment, both sad and joyful, providentially bathed in the light of Easter, I would like all of us to see the passing of our beloved Holy Father Pope Francis and the Conclave as a paschal event, a stage in that long exodus through which the Lord continues to guide us towards the fullness of life. In this perspective, we entrust to the “merciful Father and God of all consolation” (<i>2 Cor</i> 1:3) the soul of the late Pontiff and also the future of the Church.</p> 
<p>Beginning with Saint Peter and up to myself, his unworthy Successor, the Pope has been a humble servant of God and of his brothers and sisters, and nothing more than this. It has been clearly seen in the example of so many of my Predecessors, and most recently by Pope Francis himself, with his example of complete dedication to service and to sober simplicity of life, his abandonment to God throughout his ministry and his serene trust at the moment of his return to the Father’s house. Let us take up this precious legacy and continue on the journey, inspired by the same hope that is born of faith.</p> 
<p>It is the Risen Lord, present among us, who protects and guides the Church, and continues to fill her with hope through the love “poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us” (<i>Rom</i> 5:5). It is up to us to be docile listeners to his voice and faithful ministers of his plan of salvation, mindful that God loves to communicate himself, not in the roar of thunder and earthquakes, but in the “whisper of a gentle breeze” (<i>1 Kings</i> 19:12) or, as some translate it, in a “sound of sheer silence.” It is this essential and important encounter to which we must guide and accompany all the holy People of God entrusted to our care.</p> 
<p>In these days, we have been able to see the beauty and feel the strength of this immense community, which with such affection and devotion has greeted and mourned its Shepherd, accompanying him with faith and prayer at the time of his final encounter with the Lord. We have seen the true grandeur of the Church, which is alive in the rich variety of her members in union with her one Head, Christ, “the shepherd and guardian” (<i>1 Peter</i> 2:25) of our souls. She is the womb from which we were born and at the same time the flock (cf. <i>Jn</i> 21:15-17), the field (cf. <i>Mk</i> 4:1-20) entrusted to us to protect and cultivate, to nourish with the sacraments of salvation and to make fruitful by our sowing the seed of the Word, so that, steadfast in one accord and enthusiastic in mission, she may press forward, like the Israelites in the desert, in the shadow of the cloud and in the light of God’s fire (cf. <i>Ex</i> 13:21).</p> 
<p>In this regard, I would like us to renew together today our complete commitment to the path that the universal Church has now followed for decades in the wake of the <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/index.htm">Second Vatican Council</a>. Pope Francis masterfully and concretely set it forth in the Apostolic Exhortation <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html">Evangelii Gaudium</a></i>, from which I would like to highlight several fundamental points: the return to the primacy of Christ in proclamation (cf. No. 11); the missionary conversion of the entire Christian community (cf. No. 9); growth in collegiality and synodality (cf. No. 33); attention to the <i>sensus fidei</i> (cf. Nos. 119-120), especially in its most authentic and inclusive forms, such as popular piety (cf. No. 123); loving care for the least and the rejected (cf. No. 53); courageous and trusting dialogue with the contemporary world in its various components and realities (cf. No. 84; Second Vatican Council, Pastoral Constitution <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html">Gaudium et Spes</a></i>, 1-2).</p> 
<p>These are evangelical principles that have always inspired and guided the life and activity of God’s Family. In these values, the merciful face of the Father has been revealed and continues to be revealed in his incarnate Son, the ultimate hope of all who sincerely seek truth, justice, peace and fraternity (cf. Benedict XVI, <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20071130_spe-salvi.html">Spe Salvi</a></i>, 2; Francis, <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/bulls/documents/20240509_spes-non-confundit_bolla-giubileo2025.html">Spes Non Confundit</a></i>, 3).</p> 
<p>Sensing myself called to continue in this same path, I chose to take the name Leo XIV. There are different reasons for this, but mainly because Pope Leo XIII in his historic Encyclical <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html">Rerum Novarum</a></i> addressed the social question in the context of the first great industrial revolution. In our own day, the Church offers to everyone the treasury of her social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labour.</p> 
<p>Dear brothers, I would like to conclude the first part of our meeting by making my own – and proposing to you as well – the hope that Saint Paul VI expressed at the inauguration of his Petrine Ministry in 1963: “May it pass over the whole world like a great flame of faith and love kindled in all men and women of good will. May it shed light on paths of mutual cooperation and bless humanity abundantly, now and always, with the very strength of God, without whose help nothing is valid, nothing is holy” (<a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/la/speeches/1963/documents/hf_p-vi_spe_19630622_first-message.html">Message <i>Qui Fausto Die </i>addressed to the entire human family</a>, 22 June 1963).</p> 
<p>May these also be our sentiments, to be translated into prayer and commitment, with the Lord’s help. Thank you!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In 1985, Intel introduced the groundbreaking 386 processor, the first 32-bit processor in the x86 architecture.
To improve performance, the 386 has a 16-byte instruction prefetch queue.
The purpose of the prefetch queue is to fetch instructions from memory before they are needed,
so the processor usually doesn't need to wait on memory while executing instructions.
Instruction prefetching takes advantage of times when the processor is "thinking" and the memory bus would otherwise be unused.</p>
<p>In this article, I look at the 386's prefetch queue circuitry in detail.
One interesting circuit is the incrementer, which adds 1 to a pointer to step through memory.
This sounds easy enough, but the incrementer uses complicated circuitry for high performance.
The prefetch queue uses a large network
to shift bytes around so they are properly aligned.
It also has a compact circuit to extend signed 8-bit and 16-bit
numbers to 32 bits.
There aren't any major discoveries in this post, but if you're interested in low-level circuits and dynamic logic, keep reading.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the 386's shiny fingernail-sized silicon die under a microscope.
Although it may look like an aerial view of a strangely-zoned city, the die photo reveals the functional blocks
of the chip.
The Prefetch Unit in the upper left is the relevant block.
In this post, I'll discuss the
prefetch queue circuitry (highlighted in red), skipping over the prefetch control circuitry to the right.
The Prefetch Unit receives data from the Bus Interface Unit (upper right) that communicates with memory.
The Instruction Decode Unit receives prefetched instructions from the Prefetch Unit, byte by byte, and decodes the
opcodes for execution.</p>

<p>The left quarter of the chip consists of stripes of circuitry that appears much more orderly than the rest of the chip.
This grid-like appearance arises because
each functional block is constructed (for the most part) by repeating the same circuit 32 times, once for each bit, side by side.
Vertical data lines run up and down, in groups of 32 bits, connecting the functional blocks.
To make this work, each circuit must fit into the same width on the die; this layout constraint forces the circuit
designers to develop a circuit that uses this width efficiently without exceeding the allowed width.
The circuitry for the prefetch queue uses the same approach: each circuit is 66 µm wide<span id="fnref:width"><a href="#fn:width">1</a></span> and repeated 32 times.
As will be seen, fitting the prefetch circuitry into this fixed width requires some layout tricks.</p>
<h2>What the prefetcher does</h2>
<p>The purpose of the prefetch unit is to speed up performance by reading instructions from memory before they are needed,
so the processor won't need to wait to get instructions from memory.
Prefetching takes advantage of times when the memory bus is otherwise idle, minimizing conflict with other instructions
that are reading or writing data.
In the 386, prefetched instructions are stored in a 16-byte queue, consisting of four 32-bit blocks.<span id="fnref:cache"><a href="#fn:cache">2</a></span></p>
<p>The diagram below zooms in on the prefetcher and shows its main components.
You can see how the same circuit (in most cases) is repeated 32 times, forming vertical bands.
At the top are 32 bus lines from the Bus Interface Unit. These lines provide the connection between the datapath and
external memory, via the Bus Interface Unit.
These lines form a triangular pattern as the 32 horizontal lines on the right branch off and form 32 vertical lines, one for each bit.
Next are the fetch pointer and the limit register, with a circuit to check if the fetch pointer has
reached the limit.
Note that the two low-order bits (on the right) of the incrementer and limit check circuit are
missing.
At the bottom of the incrementer, you can see that some bit positions have a blob of circuitry missing from others,
breaking the pattern of repeated blocks.
The 16-byte prefetch queue is below the incrementer. Although this memory is the heart of the prefetcher, its
circuitry takes up a relatively small area.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/prefetcher-labeled.jpg"><img alt="A close-up of the prefetcher with the main blocks labeled. At the right, the prefetcher receives control signals." height="387" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/prefetcher-labeled-w600.jpg" title="A close-up of the prefetcher with the main blocks labeled. At the right, the prefetcher receives control signals." width="600"></a></p><p>A close-up of the prefetcher with the main blocks labeled. At the right, the prefetcher receives control signals.</p>
<p>The bottom part of the prefetcher shifts data to align it as needed.
A 32-bit value can be split across two 32-bit
rows of the prefetch buffer.
To handle this, the prefetcher includes a data shift network to shift and align its data.
This network occupies a lot of space, but there is no active circuitry here: just a grid of horizontal and vertical wires.</p>
<p>Finally, the sign extend circuitry converts a signed 8-bit or 16-bit value into a signed 16-bit or 32-bit value
as needed.
You can see that the sign extend circuitry is highly irregular, especially in the middle.
A latch stores the output of the prefetch queue for use by the rest of the datapath.</p>
<h2>Limit check</h2>
<p>If you've written x86 programs, you probably know about the processor's Instruction Pointer (EIP) that holds the
address of the next instruction to execute.
As a program executes, the Instruction Pointer moves from instruction to instruction.
However, it turns out that the Instruction Pointer doesn't actually exist!
Instead, the 386 has an "Advance Instruction Fetch Pointer", which holds the address of the next instruction to
fetch into the prefetch queue.
But sometimes the processor needs to know the Instruction Pointer value, for instance, to determine the return
address when calling a subroutine or to compute the destination address of a relative jump.
So what happens?
The processor gets the Advance Instruction Fetch Pointer address from the prefetch queue circuitry and subtracts
the current length of the prefetch queue.
The result is the address of the next instruction to execute, the desired Instruction Pointer value.</p>
<p>The Advance Instruction Fetch Pointer—the address of the next instruction to prefetch—is stored
in a register at the
top of the prefetch queue circuitry.
As instructions are prefetched, this pointer is incremented by the prefetch circuitry. (Since instructions are fetched 32 bits at a time,
this pointer is incremented in steps of four and the bottom two bits are always 0.)</p>
<p>But what keeps the prefetcher from prefetching too far and going outside the valid memory range?
The x86 architecture infamously uses segments to define valid regions of memory.
A segment has a start and end address (known as the base and limit) and memory is protected by blocking accesses
outside the segment.
The 386 has six active segments; the relevant one is the Code Segment that holds program instructions.
Thus, the limit address of the Code Segment controls when the prefetcher must stop prefetching.<span id="fnref:paging"><a href="#fn:paging">3</a></span>
The prefetch queue contains a circuit to stop prefetching when the fetch pointer reaches the limit of the Code Segment.
In this section, I'll describe that circuit.</p>
<p>Comparing two values may seem trivial, but the 386 uses a few tricks to make this fast.
The basic idea is to use 30 XOR gates to compare the bits of the two registers.
(Why 30 bits and not 32? Since 32 bits are fetched at a time, the bottom bits of the address are 00 and can be ignored.)
If the two registers match, all the XOR values will be 0, but if they don't match, an XOR value will be 1.
Conceptually, connecting the XORs to a 32-input OR gate will yield the desired result:
0 if all bits match and 1 if there is a mismatch.
Unfortunately, building a 32-input OR gate using standard CMOS logic is impractical for electrical reasons, as well as
inconveniently large to fit into the circuit.
Instead, the 386 uses dynamic logic to implement a spread-out NOR gate with one transistor in each column of the 
prefetcher.</p>
<p>The schematic below shows the implementation of one bit of the equality comparison.
The mechanism is that if the two registers differ, the transistor on the right is turned on, pulling the equality bus low.
This circuit is replicated 30 times, comparing all the bits: if there is any mismatch, the equality bus will be pulled
low, but if all bits match, the bus remains high.
The three gates on the left implement XNOR; this circuit may seem overly complicated, but it is a standard way
of implementing XNOR.
The NOR gate at the right blocks the comparison except during clock phase 2.
(The importance of this will be explained below.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/equality-logic.jpg"><img alt="This circuit is repeated 30 times to compare the registers." height="120" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/equality-logic-w500.jpg" title="This circuit is repeated 30 times to compare the registers." width="500"></a></p><p>This circuit is repeated 30 times to compare the registers.</p>
<p>The equality bus travels horizontally through the prefetcher, pulled low if any bits don't match.
But what pulls the bus high?
That's the job of the dynamic circuit below.
Unlike regular static gates, dynamic logic is controlled by the processor's clock signals and depends on capacitance in the circuit to hold data.
The 386 is controlled by a two-phase clock signal.<span id="fnref:clock"><a href="#fn:clock">4</a></span>
In the first clock phase, the precharge transistor below turns on, pulling the
equality bus high.
In the second clock phase, the XOR circuits above are enabled, pulling the equality bus low if the two registers don't
match.
Meanwhile, the CMOS switch turns on in clock phase 2, passing the equality bus's value to the latch.
The "keeper" circuit keeps the equality bus held high unless it is explicitly pulled low, to avoid the risk of
the voltage on the equality bus slowly dissipating.
The keeper uses a weak transistor to keep the bus high while inactive. But if the bus is pulled low, the
keeper transistor is overpowered and turns off.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/equality-out.jpg"><img alt="This is the output circuit for the equality comparison.  This circuit is located to the right of the prefetcher." height="171" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/equality-out-w600.jpg" title="This is the output circuit for the equality comparison.  This circuit is located to the right of the prefetcher." width="600"></a></p><p>This is the output circuit for the equality comparison.  This circuit is located to the right of the prefetcher.</p>
<p>This dynamic logic reduces power consumption and circuit size.
Since the bus is charged and discharged during opposite
clock phases, you avoid steady current through the transistors.
(In contrast, an NMOS processor like the 8086 might use a pull-up on the bus.
When the bus is pulled low, would you end up with current flowing through the pull-up and the pull-down transistors.
This would increase power consumption, make the chip run hotter, and limit your clock speed.)</p>
<h2>The incrementer</h2>
<p>After each prefetch, the Advance Instruction Fetch Pointer must be incremented to hold the address of the next
instruction to prefetch.
Incrementing this pointer is the job of the incrementer.
(Because each fetch is 32 bits, the pointer is incremented by 4 each time.
But in the die photo, you can see a notch in the incrementer and limit check circuit where the circuitry for the
bottom two bits has been omitted.
Thus, the incrementer's circuitry increments its value by 1, so the pointer (with two zero bits appended)
increases in steps of 4.)</p>
<p>Building an incrementer circuit is straightforward, for example, you can use a chain of 30 half-adders.
The problem is that incrementing a 30-bit value at high speed is difficult because of the carries from one position to the next.
It's similar to calculating 99999999 + 1 in decimal; you need to tediously carry the 1, carry the 1, carry the 1, and so forth,
through all the digits, resulting in a slow, sequential process.</p>
<p>The incrementer uses a faster approach. First, it computes all the carries at high speed, almost in parallel.
Then it computes each output bit in parallel from the carries—if there is a carry into a position, it toggles that bit.</p>
<p>Computing the carries is straightforward in concept: if there is a block of 1 bits at the end of the value,
all those bits will
produce carries, but carrying is stopped by the rightmost 0 bit.
For instance, incrementing binary 11011 results in 11100; there are carries from the last two bits, but the zero
stops the carries.
A circuit to implement this was developed at the University of Manchester in England way back in 1959, and is known as the Manchester
carry chain.</p>
<p>In the Manchester carry chain, you build a chain of switches, one for each data bit, as shown below.
For a 1 bit, you close the switch, but for a 0 bit you open the switch.
(The switches are implemented by transistors.)
To compute the carries, you start by feeding in a carry signal at the right
The signal will go through the closed switches
until it hits an open switch, and then it will be blocked.<span id="fnref:manchester"><a href="#fn:manchester">5</a></span>
The outputs along the chain give us the desired carry value at each position.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/chain.jpg"><img alt="Concept of the Manchester carry chain, 4 bits." height="149" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/chain-w500.jpg" title="Concept of the Manchester carry chain, 4 bits." width="500"></a></p><p>Concept of the Manchester carry chain, 4 bits.</p>
<p>Since the switches in the Manchester carry chain can all be set in parallel and the carry signal blasts through
the switches at high speed, this circuit rapidly computes the carries we need.
The carries then flip the associated bits (in parallel), giving us the result much faster than a straightforward adder.</p>
<p>There are complications, of course, in the actual implementation.
The carry signal in the carry chain is inverted, so a low signal propagates through the carry chain to indicate a carry.
(It is faster to pull a signal low than high.)
But <em>something</em> needs to make the line go high when necessary.
As with the equality circuitry, the solution is dynamic logic.
That is, the carry line is precharged high during one clock phase and then processing happens in the
second clock phase, potentially pulling the line low.</p>
<p>The next problem is that the carry signal weakens as it passes through multiple transistors and long
lengths of wire. 
The solution is that each segment has a circuit to amplify the signal, using a clocked inverter and an asymmetrical
inverter.
Importantly, this amplifier is not in the carry chain path, so it doesn't slow down the signal through the chain.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/chain-circuit.jpg"><img alt="The Manchester carry chain circuit for a typical bit in the incrementer." height="275" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/chain-circuit-w500.jpg" title="The Manchester carry chain circuit for a typical bit in the incrementer." width="500"></a></p><p>The Manchester carry chain circuit for a typical bit in the incrementer.</p>
<p>The schematic above shows the implementation of the Manchester carry chain for a typical bit.
The chain itself is at the bottom, with the transistor switch as before.
During clock phase 1,
the precharge transistor pulls this segment of the carry chain high.
During clock phase 2, the signal on the chain goes through the "clocked inverter" at the right to produce the local carry signal.
If there is a carry, the next bit is flipped by the XOR gate, producing the incremented output.<span id="fnref:xor"><a href="#fn:xor">6</a></span>
The "keeper/amplifier" is an asymmetrical inverter that produces a strong low output but a weak high output.
When there is no carry, its weak output keeps the carry chain pulled high.
But as soon as a carry is detected, it strongly pulls the carry chain low to boost the carry signal.</p>
<p>But this circuit still isn't enough for the desired performance. The incrementer uses a second carry technique in parallel:
carry skip.
The concept is to look at blocks of bits and allow the carry to jump over the entire block.
The diagram below shows a simplified implementation of the carry skip circuit. Each block consists of 3 to 6 bits.
If all the bits in a block are 1's, then the AND gate turns on the associated transistor in the carry skip line.
This allows the carry skip signal to propagate (from left to right), a block at a time. When it reaches a block with a
0 bit, the corresponding transistor will be off, stopping the carry as in the Manchester carry chain.
The AND gates all operate in parallel, so the transistors are rapidly turned on or off in parallel.
Then, the carry skip signal passes through a small number of transistors, without going through any logic.
(The carry skip signal is like an express train that skips most stations, while the Manchester carry chain
is the local train to all the stations.)
Like the Manchester carry chain, the implementation of carry skip needs precharge
circuits on the lines, a keeper/amplifier, and clocked logic, but I'll skip the details.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/carry-skip.jpg"><img alt="An abstracted and simplified carry-skip circuit. The block sizes don't match the 386's circuit." height="133" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/carry-skip-w600.jpg" title="An abstracted and simplified carry-skip circuit. The block sizes don't match the 386's circuit." width="600"></a></p><p>An abstracted and simplified carry-skip circuit. The block sizes don't match the 386's circuit.</p>
<p>One interesting feature is the layout of the large AND gates.
A 6-input AND gate is a large device, difficult to fit into one cell of the incrementer.
The solution is that the gate is spread out across multiple cells.
Specifically, the gate uses a standard CMOS NAND gate circuit with NMOS transistors in series and PMOS transistors
in parallel.
Each cell has an NMOS transistor and a PMOS transistor, and the chains are connected at the end to form the desired
NAND gate. (Inverting the output produces the desired AND function.)
This spread-out layout technique is unusual, but keeps each bit's circuitry approximately the same size.</p>
<p>The incrementer circuitry was tricky to reverse engineer because of these techniques.
In particular, 
most of the prefetcher consists of a single block of circuitry repeated 32 times, once for each bit.
The incrementer, on the other hand, consists of <em>four</em> different blocks of circuitry, repeating in an irregular pattern.
Specifically, one block starts a carry chain, a second block continues the carry chain, and a third block ends
a carry chain.
The block before the ending block is different (one large transistor to drive the last block), making four variants in
total.
This irregular pattern is visible in the earlier photo of the prefetcher.</p>
<h2>The alignment network</h2>
<p>The bottom part of the prefetcher rotates data to align it as needed.
Unlike some processors, the x86 does not enforce aligned memory accesses.
That is, a 32-bit value does not need to start on a 4-byte boundary in memory.
As a result, a 32-bit value may be split across two 32-bit rows of the prefetch queue.
Moreover, when the instruction decoder fetches one byte of an instruction, that byte may be at any position in the prefetch queue.</p>
<p>To deal with these problems, the prefetcher includes an alignment network that can rotate bytes to output a byte, word, or four bytes with the alignment required by the rest of the processor.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows part of this alignment network.
Each bit exiting the prefetch queue (top) has four wires, for rotates of 24, 16, 8, or 0 bits.
Each rotate wire is connected to one of the 32 horizontal bit lines.
Finally, each horizontal bit line has an output tap, going to the datapath below.
(The vertical lines are in the chip's lower M1 metal layer, while the horizontal lines are in the upper M2 metal layer.
For this photo, I removed the M2 layer to show the underlying layer.
Shadows of the original horizontal lines are still visible.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/alignment-network.jpg"><img alt="Part of the alignment network." height="411" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/alignment-network-w600.jpg" title="Part of the alignment network." width="600"></a></p><p>Part of the alignment network.</p>
<p>The idea is that by selecting one set of vertical rotate lines, the 32-bit output from the prefetch queue will be
rotated left by that amount.
For instance, to rotate by 8, bits are sent down the "rotate 8" lines. Bit 0 from the prefetch queue will energize
horizontal line 8, bit 1 will energize horizontal line 9, and so forth, with bit 31 wrapping around to horizontal line 7. Since horizontal bit line 8 is connected to
output 8, the result is that bit 0 is output as bit 8, bit 1 is output as bit 9, and so forth.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/alignment-diagram.jpg"><img alt="The four possibilities for aligning a 32-bit value. The four bytes above are shifted as specified to produce the desired output below." height="115" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/alignment-diagram-w500.jpg" title="The four possibilities for aligning a 32-bit value. The four bytes above are shifted as specified to produce the desired output below." width="500"></a></p><p>The four possibilities for aligning a 32-bit value. The four bytes above are shifted as specified to produce the desired output below.</p>
<p>For the alignment process,
one 32-bit output may be split across two 32-bit entries in the prefetch queue in four different ways, as shown above.
These combinations are implemented by multiplexers and drivers.
Two 32-bit multiplexers select the two relevant rows in the prefetch queue (blue and green above).
Four 32-bit drivers are connected to the four sets of vertical lines, with one set of drivers activated to
produce the desired shift.
Each byte of each driver is wired to achieve the alignment shown above. For instance, the rotate-8 driver gets
its top byte from the "green" multiplexer and the other three bytes from the "blue" multiplexer.
The result is that the four bytes, split across two queue rows, are rotated to form an aligned 32-bit value.</p>
<h2>Sign extension</h2>
<p>The final circuit is sign extension. Suppose you want to add an 8-bit value to a 32-bit value.
An unsigned 8-bit value can be extended to 32 bits by simply filling the upper bits with zeroes.
But for a signed value, it's trickier. For instance, -1 is the eight-bit value 0xFF, but the 32-bit value is
0xFFFFFFFF.
To convert an 8-bit signed value to 32 bits, the top 24 bits must be filled in with the top bit of the original
value (which indicates the sign).
In other words, for a positive value, the extra bits are filled with 0, but for a negative value, the extra bits are
filled with 1.
This process is called sign extension.<span id="fnref:sex"><a href="#fn:sex">9</a></span></p>
<p>In the 386, a circuit at the bottom of the prefetcher performs sign extension for values in instructions.
This circuit supports extending an 8-bit value to 16 bits or 32 bits, as well as extending a 16-bit value to 32 bits.
This circuit will extend a value with zeros or with the sign, depending on the instruction.</p>
<p>The schematic below shows one bit of this sign extension circuit. It consists of a latch on the left and right, with a
multiplexer in the middle.
The latches are constructed with a standard 386 circuit using a CMOS switch (see footnote).<span id="fnref:latch"><a href="#fn:latch">7</a></span>
The multiplexer selects one of three values: the bit value from the swap network, 0 for sign extension, or 1 for
sign extension.
The multiplexer is constructed from a CMOS switch if the bit value is selected and two transistors for the 0 or 1 values.
This circuit is replicated 32 times, although the bottom byte only has the latches, not the multiplexer, as
sign extension does not modify the bottom byte.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/sign-extend-circuit.jpg"><img alt="The sign extend circuit associated with bits 31-8 from the prefetcher." height="195" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/sign-extend-circuit-w600.jpg" title="The sign extend circuit associated with bits 31-8 from the prefetcher." width="600"></a></p><p>The sign extend circuit associated with bits 31-8 from the prefetcher.</p>
<p>The second part of the sign extension circuitry determines if the bits should be filled with 0 or 1 and sends the control
signals to the circuit above.
The gates on the left determine if the sign extension bit should be a 0 or a 1. For a 16-bit sign extension, this
bit comes from bit 15 of the data, while for an 8-bit sign extension, the bit comes from bit 7.
The four gates on the right generate the signals to sign extend each bit, producing separate signals for the
bit range 31-16 and the range 15-8.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/sign-extend-logic.jpg"><img alt="This circuit determines which bits should be filled with 0 or 1." height="165" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/sign-extend-logic-w500.jpg" title="This circuit determines which bits should be filled with 0 or 1." width="500"></a></p><p>This circuit determines which bits should be filled with 0 or 1.</p>
<p>The layout of this circuit on the die is somewhat unusual.
Most of the prefetcher circuitry consists of 32 identical columns, one for each bit.<span id="fnref:extension"><a href="#fn:extension">8</a></span>
The circuitry above is implemented once, using about 16 gates (buffers and inverters are not shown above).
Despite this, the circuitry above is crammed into bit positions 17 through 7, creating irregularities in the layout.
Moreover, the implementation of the circuitry in silicon is unusual compared to the rest of the 386.
Most of the 386's circuitry uses the two metal layers for interconnection, minimizing the use of polysilicon wiring.
However, the circuit above also uses long stretches of polysilicon to connect the gates.</p>

<p>The diagram above shows the irregular layout of the sign extension circuitry amid the regular datapath circuitry that
is 32 bits wide.
The sign extension circuitry is shown in green; this is the circuitry described at the top of this section, repeated
for each bit 31-8.
The circuitry for bits 15-8 has been shifted upward, perhaps to make room for the sign extension control circuitry,
indicated in red.
Note that the layout of the control circuitry is completely irregular, since there is one copy of the circuitry and
it has no internal structure.
One consequence of this layout is the wasted space to the left and right of this circuitry block, the
tan regions with no circuitry except vertical metal lines passing through.
At the far right, a block of circuitry to control the latches has been wedged under bit 0.
Intel's designers go to great effort to minimize the size of the processor die since a smaller die saves substantial
money.
This layout must have been the most efficient they could manage, but I find it aesthetically displeasing compared
to the regularity of the rest of the datapath.</p>
<h2>How instructions flow through the chip</h2>
<p>Instructions follow a tortuous path through the 386 chip.
First, 
the Bus Interface Unit in the upper right
corner reads instructions from memory and sends them over a 32-bit bus (blue) to the prefetch unit.
The prefetch unit stores the instructions in the 16-byte prefetch queue.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/386-instr-labeled.jpg"><img alt="Instructions follow a twisting path to and from the prefetch queue." height="641" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/386-instr-labeled-w600.jpg" title="Instructions follow a twisting path to and from the prefetch queue." width="600"></a></p><p>Instructions follow a twisting path to and from the prefetch queue.</p>
<p>How is an instruction executed from the prefetch queue? It turns out that there are two distinct paths.
Suppose you're executing an instruction to add 12345678 to the EAX register.
The prefetch queue will hold the five bytes 05 (the opcode), 78, 56, 34, and 12.
The prefetch queue provides opcodes to the decoder one byte at a time over the 8-bit bus shown in red.
The bus takes the lowest 8 bits from the prefetch queue's alignment network and sends this byte to a buffer
(the small square at the head of the red arrow).
From there, the opcode travels to the instruction decoder.<span id="fnref:decoder"><a href="#fn:decoder">10</a></span>
The instruction decoder, in turn, uses large tables (PLAs) to convert the x86 instruction into a 111-bit internal format
with 19 different fields.<span id="fnref:slager"><a href="#fn:slager">11</a></span></p>
<p>The data bytes of an instruction, on the other hand, go from the prefetch queue to the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) through a 32-bit data bus (orange).
Unlike the previous buses, this data bus is spread out, with one wire through each column of the datapath.
This bus extends through the entire datapath so values can also be stored into registers.
For instance,
the <code>MOV</code> (move) instruction can store a value from an instruction (an "immediate" value) into a register.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The 386's prefetch queue contains about 7400 transistors, more than an Intel 8080 processor.
(And this is just the queue itself; I'm ignoring the prefetch control logic.)
This illustrates the rapid advance of processor technology: part of one functional unit in the 386 contains more
transistors than an entire 8080 processor from 11 years earlier.
And this unit is less than 3% of the entire 386 processor.</p>
<!-- about 230 transistors per column -->

<p>Every time I look at an x86 circuit, I see the complexity required to support backward compatibility, and
I gain more understanding of why RISC became popular.
The prefetcher is no exception.
Much of the complexity is due to the 386's support for unaligned memory accesses, requiring a byte shift network to
move bytes into 32-bit alignment.
Moreover, at the other end of the instruction bus is the complicated instruction decoder that decodes
intricate x86 instructions. Decoding RISC instructions is much easier.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope you've found this look at the prefetch circuitry interesting.
I plan to write more about the 386, so
follow me on Bluesky (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/righto.com">@righto.com</a>) or <a href="https://www.righto.com/feeds/posts/default">RSS</a> for updates.
I've written multiple articles on the 386 previously; a good place to start might be my <a href="https://www.righto.com/2023/10/intel-386-die-versions.html">survey of the 368 dies</a>.</p>

<p>Last week, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman announced in San Francisco that the World project he co-founded, formerly known as Worldcoin, is opening six stores across the United States, allowing users of the project's app to scan their eyeballs.</p>
<p>Simply put, the premise is this: scan your eyeball, get a biometric tag, verify yourself, buy our apps (and cryptocurrency). The scary part is the for-profit company developing the project has now gathered millions in venture capital investment, powerful partners, and is ready to expand and impose its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)">Minority Report</a> style technology everywhere. <strong>Welcome to Dystopialand.</strong><!-- more --></p>
<p>The World(coin) project is an initiative from the startup Tools for Humanity, co-founded by its CEO Alex Blania. Despite its friendly name, the for-profit corporation has been on the radar of many critics through the years already. From experts to journalists to privacy commissioners around the world, not everyone shares Blania's enthusiasm for his biometric-based technology.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-world-app">What is the World App?</h2>
<p>The World project, recently rebranded from the Worldcoin project (possibly to convey better its expansionist ambitions) presented its plan for the World App to Americans this week. The project is now expanding well beyond the cryptocurrency it started from.</p>
<p>The World App is an everything app, providing users with a <em>World ID</em>, that can be verified through the collection of biometric data in the form of an iris scan.</p>
<p>The scan is then filtered and hashed to create a unique identifier that is stored as a so-called "proof of personhood" on the <em>World Network</em>, a blockchain-based protocol.</p>
<p>The World App itself contains a collection of "Mini Apps", where users can manage their cryptocurrencies, chat together, play games, receive their pay check even, and ultimately live their whole life within the closed "verified" ecosystem of the app.</p>
<p>For a company constantly praising decentralization, it sure looks like they want to make sure they are the center of it all.</p>
<p>To obtain this coveted verification code, users <em>must</em> be ready to share their precious eyeball data with the Orb.</p>
<p>The Orb is a piece of hardware designed by Tools for Humanity to perform iris scans. It is available to access in the United States at one of the currently six locations in Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco (more to come soon), like some sort of biometrics collection ATM.</p>
<p>The World project has for ambition to expand its reach across the United States to install 7,500 Orbs by the end of this year, so be prepared to see this dystopian technology everywhere soon.</p>
<p>The San Francisco <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/04/sam_altman_startup_world/">presentation last week</a> was clearly prepared to impress investors with its Apple announcement vibe. The promise of a quickly growing startup that everyone will soon want to work with, was repeated over and over in different flavors.</p>
<p>Tools for Humanity bragged about many large partnerships that should make any privacy advocates shiver in dread: the Match Group dating apps conglomerate (Tinder, OkCupid, Hinge, Plenty of Fish), Stripe, and Visa are some of them.</p>
<p>If they succeed in convincing enough people, many of us could soon have little choice but to unwillingly have to enroll.</p>
<h2 id="worldcoin-isnt-new-you-might-have-heard-of-its-unethical-practices-already">World(coin) isn't new, you might have heard of its unethical practices already</h2>
<p>The project <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/sam-altmans-world-unveils-a-mobile-verification-device/">claims</a> to have onboarded 26 million people already, including 12 millions "users" who are verified (had their biometric data collected).</p>
<p>These "users" are largely located in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. This is because the company started testing for its project there a few years ago, in regions where people often have fewer legal protections.</p>
<p>In 2022, MIT Technology Review produced <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/">an extensive investigation</a> on the startup's debut in an article titled: <em>Deception, exploited workers, and cash handouts: How Worldcoin recruited its first half a million test users.</em></p>
<p>The investigation revealed a collection of unethical practices to pressure the most vulnerable populations in signing up for Worldcoin, and <strong>have their eyeball scanned in exchange for money</strong> they desperately needed.</p>
<p>Some participants had to provide much more personal information than the company says is required, such as emails, phone numbers, and even photos of official ID. Many people who gave their biometric data to Worldcoin were rushed and misinformed. Some who signed up didn't even have an email and had to create one. The "Orb operators" hired to perform the scans locally were often poorly trained, poorly informed, and unable to answer the questions asked by participants.</p>
<p>So much so that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/kenya-suspends-worldcoin-scans-over-security-privacy-and-financial-concerns/">Kenya suspended the company's operations</a> in 2023 over concerns for privacy, security, and financial service practices.</p>
<p>Some people who signed up never received the promised money. Some officials were bribed to give the impression to participants these operations were official and supported by the government.</p>
<p>As Ruswandi, one of the person targeted by this early campaign <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/">remarked</a>: "why did Worldcoin target lower-income communities in the first place, instead of crypto enthusiasts or communities?"</p>
<p>Exploiting people in situation of poverty in order to test a biometric identification technology isn't a great way to start a project developed by a company called "Tools for Humanity".</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-problem-selling-the-solution">Creating the problem, selling the solution</h2>
<p>Why developing such a technology in the first place?</p>
<p>Sam Altman himself have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-orb-eyeball-scan-launch-us/">expressed concern</a> about the problem this alleged solution solves: the avalanche of fake accounts and pretend persons online caused by the new AI tools unleashed everywhere.</p>
<p>The proposed use of a "proof of personhood" claims to solve this problem by allocating a unique identifier to each human, a personal code supposedly impossible to duplicate or cheat. Of course, this has <a href="https://gizmodo.com/worldcoin-black-market-iris-data-identity-orb-1850454037">already been proven wrong</a>.</p>
<p>No one will miss the irony of the CEO of OpenAI, responsible for creating the largest share of this problem, expressing such concern <strong>while continuing to feed the fire</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a classic case of creating a problem and selling the solution. Well, in this case it is more like <strong><em>selling</em> the problem and selling the solution</strong>. As researcher and cryptocurrency critic <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/worldcoin-a-solution-in-search-of/">Molly White pointed out</a> in 2023:</p>
<p>"That's right, the guy who's going to sell us all the solution to a worsening AI-powered bot infestation of the Internet and to AI-induced mass unemployment is the same guy who's making the AI in question."</p>
<p>Sadly, this proposed solution also isn't really a solution, or at least it isn't a <em>good</em> solution. Indeed, this will <strong>create a whole collection of new problems</strong>, many much worse than a bot infestation.</p>
<h2 id="the-risks-of-sharing-biometric-data">The risks of sharing biometric data</h2>
<p>Biometric data is incredibly sensitive data, because it's irrevocably attached to a person. Whether it's from a face scan, palm scan, fingerprint, keystroke pattern, or iris scan, this data is part of our bodies and <strong>cannot be changed like a password</strong> if it gets compromised.</p>
<p>For this reason, a growing number of legislations around the world now include special categories for such data collection, and require extra protections and supervision for it.</p>
<p>There are many dangers in collecting and potentially endangering biometric data. First, if this data gets stolen, criminals can impersonate a victim much more convincingly, because they will have the "proof" to "verify" this is really you.</p>
<p>While straight-up stealing your eyeball or face might still belong to science-fiction, the risk of getting the data produced <em>from</em> the scan stolen is very real.</p>
<p>When the World project claims it is secure because biometric data isn't stored anywhere, even if that was true, the iris <em>code</em> derivative of this data is indeed stored and processed somewhere, and this can potentially be stolen.</p>
<p>How hard will it be for a victim to recover an account from a biometric thief when everything is reinforcing the false narrative shared with investors that this technology can't be cheated?</p>
<p>Then, there is the loss of pseudonymity protections online.</p>
<p>If every social media account becomes tied to a unique biometric-based identifier, whether directly or indirectly, there is no pseudonymity anymore.</p>
<p>Further, if only one account is allowed by "verified human", then no one can create separate accounts for their work life and personal life anymore. Creating separate accounts for separate purposes is an excellent privacy-preserving practice.</p>
<p>Even if the identifier isn't tied to a legal name directly, accounts on different platforms using the same identifier could potentially get liked together. To be fair, it does seem Tools for Humanity worked to prevent different platforms from having access to the same code, but how well will this hold the test of time? Will platforms increasingly escalate privacy-invasive requests from this point, like they often do?</p>
<p><strong>Pseudonymity saves lives.</strong> It is an essential tool for the safety of the most vulnerable online. Killing pseudonymity by requiring unique biometric identification could endanger millions.</p>
<p>This is a serious problem coming up with <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/05/06/age-verification-wants-your-face/">age verification</a> processes as well, which World ID will soon also be a part of when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/sam-altmans-eyeball-scanning-id-technology-debuts-in-the-us-130032856.html">testing</a> its implementation for Tinder in Japan.</p>
<p>Biometric data should never be used lightly. It should be reserved for the most extreme cases only.</p>
<p>The regions who have adopted stronger regulations for biometric data collection are moving in the right direction. But will protective legislation be enough to resist the pressure from a for-profit VC-backed corporation with a valuation at billions?</p>
<h2 id="flipping-the-coin">Flipping the coin</h2>
<p>Tools for Humanity seems to be well aware of its creepiness factor, and of the criticisms brought by privacy commissioners around the world.</p>
<p>Its recent Orb redesign from the previous cold (Black)mirror finish clearly tries hard to replace creepiness with cuteness.</p>
<p>The company has also evidently invested a lot in presenting a pro-privacy image, likely in an attempt to reassure users (and investors).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of these privacy-preserving claims are inaccurate. Some claims promoting "features" that might sound impressive to a neophyte's ear are actually just the baseline, and others sadly are misleading <em>at best</em>.</p>
<p>While a few privacy-preserving efforts are indeed positive, most of the focus on privacy relates to marketing much more than any serious protections.</p>
<h2 id="how-privacy-preserving-is-it">How privacy-preserving is it?</h2>
<p>Most people are still put off by the idea of having their eyeball scanned, and the company has evidently invested a lot in promoting a "privacy-preserving" image, possibly as an attempt to reassure unconvinced humans and <a href="#privacy-legislators-arent-on-board">privacy commissioners</a> alike.</p>
<p>But how much can we trust those claims?</p>
<h3 id="flawed-assumption-about-what-constitutes-personal-data">Flawed assumption about what constitutes personal data</h3>
<p>The largest assumption about why this technology is "privacy-preserving" seems to come from the fact that the World App doesn't collect names, official IDs (<a href="https://www.toolsforhumanity.com/legal/privacy-notice#6-2-credentials-">unless it does</a>), emails (<a href="https://www.toolsforhumanity.com/legal/privacy-notice#annex-i-%E2%80%93-legal-grounds/purposes-for-tools-for-humanity-data-processing-activities-">unless it does</a>), phone numbers (<a href="https://www.toolsforhumanity.com/legal/privacy-notice#5-1-data-you-provide-to-us">unless it does</a>), date of birth (<a href="https://world.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-new-world-id-unverify-option-increases-personal-control-over-data">unless it does</a>), or other identifiers.</p>
<p>This assumption however neglects the fact that 1) even data that isn't attached to a legal name can be personal data, and 2) the iris code it produces from the iris scan <em>is</em> indeed personal data.</p>
<p>While there are variations, most privacy regulations have similar definitions of what constitute personal data. The European General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/">defines</a> it as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person". An iris code derived from an iris scan of course fits this definition.</p>
<p>Moreover, to create a World ID, the company also collects a face image. Together, the original iris scan and face photo are referred to as <em>Image Data</em>. For "privacy-preserving" purposes, Image Data of course never leaves the Orb device (<a href="https://world.org/legal/biometric-data-consent-form">unless it does</a>).</p>
<p>While it seems some effort has been made to protect the Image Data in some ways, the idea that derivative data from the scans isn't still sensitive personal information anymore is wrong.</p>
<p>If there is a way for a person to scan their iris again and generate the same code, then this data relates to their identifiable person. This also means that <em>someone else</em> could scan their iris and generate the same code.</p>
<p>As whistleblower <a href="https://x.com/Snowden/status/1451990496537088000">Edward Snowden rightfully pointed out</a> in a 2021 tweet:</p>
<p>“This looks like it produces a global (hash) database of people's iris scans (for 'fairness'), and waves away the implications by saying 'we deleted the scans!' Yeah, but you save the <em>hashes</em> produced by the scans. Hashes that match <em>future</em> scans. Don't catalogue eyeballs.”</p>
<h3 id="questionable-reassurance-about-local-data">Questionable reassurance about local data</h3>
<p>One of the biggest reassurance relates to the claim that sensitive biometric data (Image Data) is only stored locally. But this isn't completely accurate either, and there seems to be conflicting information about it from the company's own documentation.</p>
<p>The World <a href="https://whitepaper.world.org/#enrollment-process">white paper</a> specifies that:</p>
<p>"The Orb verifies that it sees a human, runs local fraud prevention checks, and takes pictures of both irises. The iris images are converted on the Orb hardware into the iris code. Raw biometric data does not leave the device (unless explicitly approved by the user for training purposes)."</p>
<p>However, according to the <a href="https://world.org/legal/biometric-data-consent-form">Biometric Data Consent Form</a> users have to sign prior to data collection, if a user needs a fully verified World ID, inevitably this sensitive biometric data will be sent to their phone, therefore leaving the Orb.</p>
<p>After a user agrees to the form, they can keep the option for <em>Data Custody</em> disabled to have their biometric data deleted from the Orb "later", and have it uploaded to their phone (with all the risk that this entails).</p>
<p>The other option users have is to enable Data Custody (if allowed in the user's country) and have this sensitive data sent to both their phone <em>and</em> to Tools for Humanity.</p>
<p>This means the Orb inevitably sends this sensitive data to a mobile device. Then, this data is only as secure as the mobile device is. Which isn't so reassuring.</p>
<p>The documentation does maintain this biometric data is sent as an "end-to-end encrypted data bundle", but this doesn't mean the data never leaves the Orb, it just means it leaves it while encrypted (which is really just the basics), and copies it to the user's device.</p>
<p>Furthermore, future users are <em>strongly</em> incentivized to share their Image Data with Tools for Humanity, for algorithm improvement purposes. Pressure to opt in is even presented as a <em>convenience</em> option, because it would be cumbersome to have to come over for another scan after every update.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://world.org/legal/biometric-data-consent-form">stated</a> in the Biometric Data Consent Form:</p>
<p>"This will likely help you avoid some inconvenience because, if we have your Image Data, then you will not need to return to an Orb to re-verify your digital identity when we update the software."</p>
<p>The company continues to repeat they have a "privacy by default and by design approach". But <strong>you can't keep your privacy-preserving cake and eat it, too</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-the-white-paper-say">What does the white paper say</h3>
<p>In tech, a white paper is usually a research-based document produced by the developers that presents more technical details on an application, product, or process. It is especially valuable for products like the Orb and the World App, where security and privacy <em>should</em> be paramount, and therefore examined closer.</p>
<p>Because it isn't an independent review, a white paper can also not be worth much more than a marketing pamphlet.</p>
<p>To its credit, Tools for Humanity does <a href="https://whitepaper.world.org/#nature-of-the-whitepaper">warn</a> in its white paper that this information is "intended for general informational purposes and community discussion only and do not constitute a prospectus, an offer document, an offer of securities, a solicitation for investment, or any offer to sell any product, item or asset (whether digital or otherwise)."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the company makes sure to specify that "circumstances may change and that the Whitepaper or the Website may become outdated as a result; and the [World] Foundation is not under any obligation to update or correct this document in connection therewith."</p>
<p>The document is also described as a "crypto-asset white paper".</p>
<p>We have been warned.</p>
<p>In its Privacy section, the white paper <a href="https://whitepaper.world.org/#image-custody-opt-in">states</a> that "no data collected, including images taken by the Orb has or will ever be sold. Nor will it be used for any other intent than to improve World ID."</p>
<p>However, its <a href="https://world.org/legal/privacy-notice#8--when-we-share-your-data">Privacy Notice also states</a> that they may "share your personal information in connection with, or during negotiations concerning, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company."</p>
<p>If this happens, many regretful users might find themselves in <a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/23andme-is-bankrupt-and-about-to-sell-your-dna-heres-how-to-stop-that-from-happening">the same shoes as 23andMe users this year</a>, where the DNA collecting company started to look for buyers of its biometric data assets after filling for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Face Authentication section of the white paper <a href="https://whitepaper.world.org/#face-authentication">describes</a> a process where encrypted facial biometrics collected from the Orb are used for authentication in the World App.</p>
<p>Even if this data is stored on-device, it is still biometric data getting collected by the Orb then processed by the phone app. There is no question this is sensitive and personal biometric data, and it is indeed kept outside the orb.</p>
<p>Tools for Humanity lacks consistency in the various claims and statements found through its documentation and promotion material. It becomes difficult to know which version to trust, and if it is to be trusted at all.</p>
<h3 id="no-deletion-on-the-blockchain">No deletion on the blockchain</h3>
<p>Tools for Humanity's Privacy Policy declares that the company will delete all account data (when laws allow it) one month after it is closed, this is good. They also state they will delete entirely any inactive account after 2 years, and this is actually a great policy.</p>
<p>But what happens to the World ID, transactions, and other data stored on the blockchain?</p>
<p>While some thoughts have been put into deletion and some good mechanisms seem to have been implemented, unfortunately data stored on the blockchain might be "deletion-resistant".</p>
<p>There's a possibility that <strong>what happens on the blockchain stays on the blockchain, forever</strong>.</p>
<p>The policy <a href="https://www.toolsforhumanity.com/legal/privacy-notice#11--how-long-do-we-keep-your-data-">notes</a> that:</p>
<p>"Due to the public and immutable nature of blockchain technology, we cannot amend, erase, or control the disclosure of data that is stored on blockchains."</p>
<p>So that is something to keep in mind if you value your right to delete.</p>
<h2 id="data-security-considerations">Data security considerations</h2>
<p>Even if some thoughtful security features seem to have been implemented for the World App and its Orbs, nothing processing sensitive data at such a large scale should be left in the hands of a single for-profit, largely unregulated, organization.</p>
<p>This would be like putting 8 billion eggs in a very fragile basket, held by someone paid to make the basket pretty and convince as many people as possible to put their precious single egg in it, with no incentive whatsoever to ensure the basket doesn't break. I would not want to put my egg in there, especially with how much it costs now.</p>
<p>The idea of using one single <em>for-profit</em> app worldwide for "human verification", identity verification, age verification, money transactions, and storing official IDs (and so on and so forth) makes this application a <em>huge</em> target for criminals and hostile governments alike.</p>
<p>It's good that the app had <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2023-08-worldcoin-orb-securityreview.pdf">security audits</a>, made some <a href="https://github.com/worldcoin">code available</a> as open source, and reportedly <a href="https://whitepaper.world.org/#why-custom-hardware-is-needed">plans</a> to open a bug bounty program.</p>
<p>However, there are still problems that remain. For example, the phone in this case becomes a single point of failure. The easiest way to steal someone's identity and money (all at once) will be to steal their phone data (whether physically or remotely). Even without criminal intent, what happens when someone just loses their phone? Or accidentally drop it in the pool? Or step on it?</p>
<p>With <strong>everything relying on a single app and a single device</strong>, risk is greatly amplified.</p>
<p>Outside the user's responsibility, Orb operators and Orb stores are susceptible to various attacks. This will increase exponentially with the number of users of course, as the target becomes bigger. In fact, Orb operators have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/12/hackers-stole-passwords-of-worldcoin-orb-operators/">already been hacked</a>.</p>
<p>Then, there is the appeal of fake identities and money fraud for criminals. Already, there is a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/worldcoin-black-market-iris-data-identity-orb-1850454037">black market</a> for iris data in China, where people buy iris data (or verified World ID according to World) from people in Cambodia, Kenya, and other countries for a few dollars only. The vulnerability allowing this was reportedly fixed, but it is doubtful this is the last one we hear about.</p>
<p>The Orb itself is also an important potential <abbr title="The total number of possible entry points for unauthorized access to a system">attack surface</abbr>. With Tools for Humanity's ambition to fill the world with Orbs everywhere, will Orbs become the next version of the sketchy ATM? Where you might wonder if this funny-looking Orb is trustworthy enough to pay your bar tab without risking emptying your crypto wallet?</p>
<h2 id="privacy-legislators-arent-on-board">Privacy legislators aren't on board</h2>
<p>Despite all its privacy promotion material, the World project has failed to convince privacy commissioners around the world of their supposedly good intentions. Perhaps in this case actions speak louder than words, and privacy commissioners aren't so gullible.</p>
<p>With the expansion the project plans this year, we can expect even more experts will examine the company's claims and challenge its "privacy-preserving" assumptions</p>
<p>There are many reasons to remain skeptical about these promises of privacy. Indeed, numerous countries have already suspended, fined, or called for investigation on the company's (mal)practices.</p>
<h3 id="the-company-was-fined-for-personal-data-violation">The company was fined for personal data violation</h3>
<p>In 2024, the company was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-fines-worldcoin-personal-data-violations">fined</a> 1.1 billion Korean won for violating South Korea's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA). The Worldcoin Foundation was also imposed corrective orders and recommendations. Organizations that are truly "privacy-first" rarely reach this point.</p>
<p>The Data Custody feature, which allows (and encourages) users to share their biometric data with Tools for Humanity is now unavailable in South Korea.</p>
<h3 id="brazil-has-banned-worldcoin-in-the-country">Brazil has banned Worldcoin in the country</h3>
<p>In January this year, the National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) <a href="https://decrypt.co/305639/brazilian-regulator-denies-worldcoin-appeal-ban">banned</a> Worldcoin's operations in Brazil, after the company's appeal was rejected.</p>
<p>The ban comes from regulation stating that consent to process biometric data must be "free, informed, and unequivocal", which cannot be the case with the World project paying users in cryptocurrency in exchange for their iris scans. Data deletion concerns were also raised by the regulator.</p>
<p>The World project tried again to appeal the decision, in vain.</p>
<h3 id="kenya-and-indonesia-suspended-its-operations">Kenya and Indonesia suspended its operations</h3>
<p>In 2023, Kenya, one of the first country where Worldcoin was available, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/kenya-suspends-worldcoin-scans-over-security-privacy-and-financial-concerns/">suspended</a> Worldcoin's operations citing concerns over the "authenticity and legality" of its activities related to privacy, security, and financial services.</p>
<p>The worse part is, months before the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) of the country had ordered Tools for Humanity to stop collecting personal information from its citizens. The company simply <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/worldcoin-in-kenya/">ignored the ODPC order</a> and continued to collect biometric data from Kenyans. It only stopped after Kenya's ministry of interior and administration gave the suspension order later on.</p>
<p>This again is quite far from the behavior of a company who genuinely values privacy.</p>
<p>More recently on May 4th 2025, Indonesia also <a href="https://en.antaranews.com/news/353861/indonesia-suspends-worldcoin-world-id-operations-over-public-concerns">suspended</a> the World project's operation in the country over concerns related to user privacy and security. The Ministry of Communication and Digital will be summoning the project's local operators to clarify the operations and determine potential violation of the Indonesia's electronic system regulation.</p>

<p>In December 2024, the German regulator, the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA), <a href="https://decrypt.co/298090/german-watchdog-cracks-down-on-worldcoin-over-biometric-data">issued an order</a> to obligate proving deletion procedures that comply with the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> within one month. Additionally, the BayLDA ordered the complete deletion of certain data records that were previously collected without sufficient legal basis.</p>
<p>Again, the World Foundation is fighting the order and will <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/german-watchdog-order-worldcoin-delete-data">appeal</a> the decision. The company tries to argue the data collected was "anonymized", a common strategy to try evading <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> compliance, which does not regulate anonymized data.</p>

<p>In 2023, France's data protection authority the CNIL <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/worldcoin-paris-office-checked-by-french-data-watchdog-2023-08-31/">investigated</a> Worldcoin's activities in the country. The same year, UK's privacy watchdog started its own <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/uk-data-watchdog-make-enquiries-worldcoin-crypto-project-2023-07-25/">inquiry</a> into the company's operations.</p>
<p>In 2024, Hong Kong's Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3250480/hong-kong-eye-scan-cryptocurrency-scheme-probed-citys-privacy-watchdog">raided</a> six Worldcoin offices citing personal information privacy and security concerns.</p>
<p>There is no doubt more countries and regions will follow with similar investigations and bans as the World project expands to its ambition.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-united-states-the-app-is-restricted-in-some-states">In the United States, the app is restricted in some states</h3>
<p>Even in the US where the company is headquartered, the app is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-orb-eyeball-scan-launch-us/">restricted</a> in some states. The announcement for its event this month carried a warning the World is “not available for distribution via World App to people, companies or organizations who are residents of, or are located or incorporated in the State of New York or other restricted territories.”</p>
<p>We can also expect the project will encounter roadblocks in states that have passed <a href="https://www.huschblackwell.com/2024-state-biometric-privacy-law-tracker">regulations specific to the collection of biometric data</a>. This includes states like Illinois, Texas, Washington, and Colorado.</p>
<h3 id="some-regions-have-special-regulations-for-biometric-data">Some regions have special regulations for biometric data</h3>
<p>Around the world the number of biometric-specific regulations is growing. Even without a regulation specific to this type of data, many privacy laws have started to include special categories and requirements to govern the collection and processing of sensitive biometric data. As companies are increasingly requesting such collection, legislations to protect users are essential.</p>
<p>For example, the province of Quebec in Canada has recently implemented <a href="https://www.cai.gouv.qc.ca/protection-renseignements-personnels/sujets-et-domaines-dinteret/biometrie?%2F">strong protections for biometric data</a> with its new privacy law, the Law 25. Consent isn't sufficient to collect biometric data, as the law requires organizations to explicitly justify the necessity for such collection in the first place. Importantly, any violation of Law 25 comes with fines as hefty as the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>'s.</p>
<p>More privacy laws should implement such protections quickly, as corporations collecting biometric information carelessly are multiplying fast.</p>
<h2 id="welcome-to-full-dystopia">Welcome to full dystopia</h2>
<p>The most concerning part of the World project's recent expansion isn't its cryptocurrency grift as much as stepping out of it.</p>
<p>If cryptocurrency enthusiasts wish to share their personal data to get into a special cryptocurrency club, they might (although privacy regulations should still protect them). But using financial coercion to get new users by exploiting vulnerable communities living in poverty is <strong>absolutely despicable</strong>.</p>
<p>Further, the fact that the World project has partnered with powerful players in the financial, gaming, and even dating sectors <em>should terrify everyone</em>.</p>
<p>Beyond cryptocurrency, if platforms start to demand users everywhere to verify they are a human and verify they are an adult through the World ID system, then <strong>everyone will soon be subjected to this</strong>.</p>
<p>The amount of money invested in the project means there will be an incredible pressure to spread it everywhere soon, and <em>monetize</em> it. There will be a <em>strong</em> incentive to monetize our data and to monetize our proof of humanity. This isn't trivial.</p>
<p>The well-known dating app Tinder has already partnered with World ID to verify the age of users in Japan. If this experiment works well, and if users comply without objection, this could be soon mandatory for <em>all</em> dating apps.</p>
<p>Let's not stop at dating apps, the World project has already announced last week they will also be working with Razer to verify humanity of online gamers. How far can this go in the age of age verification? Will every online games with mature content soon require a World ID to play?</p>
<p>What about social media? Tools for Humanity's team have insisted the age of AI made us incapable of detecting if we are interacting with bots online. Therefore, they must valiantly come to our rescue to verify our humanity scanning our eyeballs (which bots tragically lack). What if this human verification is expanded to all our social media accounts? Certainly, regulators pushing for authoritarian age verification online would be delighted by such a product.</p>
<p>Then, it comes for our money. The everything app of course offers payment and money management features. This is the app where you can keep your whole wallet, containing all your official IDs, your cryptocurrencies of all kind, and even connect with your less hyped regular bank accounts.</p>
<p>Imagine a single app, owned by a single for-profit corporation, that collects and processes all the data from all your transactions online, all your communications online, that you absolutely have to continue using for your other social media accounts, your gaming life, and your dating life.</p>
<p>There could soon be no way to escape the grasp of World's everything app. Actually, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/04/sam_altman_startup_world/">some governments</a> (Taiwan and Malesia) have already started using it for official services, because why not.</p>
<p><strong>The ways this could degenerate fast into full dystopia are infinite</strong>, and very real.</p>
<p>The company even plans to ship next year the Orb Mini, a pocket-size personal spy-device with which users will be able to scan their own eyeballs on the go!</p>
<p>But why stop there? Why not scan other people's eyeballs as well? Maybe all government officials could carry one? Maybe every payment terminal could have one too?</p>
<p>We will find out soon, in one or two years.</p>
<p>Tools for Humanity also bragged about the numerous utilities its new technology could make possible. For example, for event tickets! Order a concert ticket with your "proof of personhood" then maybe confirm you are the owner by having your eyeballs scanned to assist to a Rage Against the Machine concert?</p>
<p>The only fun part in this is the irony.</p>
<p>Tools for Humanity with its expansionist dream is without a doubt hungry enough to eat the whole World™️.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-world-of-wealth-inequalities">A new world of wealth inequalities</h3>
<p>The company brings up a few times the mention of Universal Basic Income (UBI) in its documentation, it even mentions it briefly in its <a href="https://whitepaper.world.org/#ubi">white paper</a>.</p>
<p>While puzzling, it appears Tools for Humanity might consider its cryptocurrency bribe to sign up and subsequent token giveaways as some form of UBI? Or perhaps this is only one of its other ambition to control all the financial systems in the entire world. Why UBI is even mentioned at all in this context is unclear.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's worth mentioning a for-profit company giving cash back in exchange for biometric data isn't UBI at all, it's just a <strong>creepy membership card points</strong>, at best.</p>
<p>While the World project works hard to present the idea this is a tool for the people, where everyone is equal, wealth will definitely <a href="https://whitepaper.world.org/#wld-token-allocation">not be distributed evenly</a> in this new World order.</p>
<p>Already, 11.1% of World's cryptocurrency tokens (WLD) have been distributed to the World's team, 13.6% to investors, and 0.3% are reserved for Tools for Humanity. This means these entities would share together 25% of the wealth, while 75% of the world's population (according the Tools for Humanity's ambition) would have to share 75% of what's left.</p>
<p>In the new "human" world this corporation envisions, Tools for Humanity and its investors would own 1 quarter of the entire world's wealth. There is nothing equitable or communal in a system like this.</p>
<p>It's important not to forget this everything app will do everything to pressure its users in eventually using Worldcoins, its ultimate goal.</p>
<p>From Tinder's mandatory age verification to cryptocurrency financial ruin in one single move.</p>
<h2 id="the-normalization-of-surveillance">The normalization of surveillance</h2>
<p>Even if this process was perfectly secure and perfectly private (which it is definitely not), the problem remains the normalization of surveillance.</p>
<p>This isn't limited to Tools for Humanity, although the way the company tries to advertise itself as a privacy-first organization makes it even more important to scrutinize.</p>
<p>But anyone else with a similar approach to biometric data collection for verifying humanity or age or legal names should be on our radar. Moreover, if it's a for-profit corporation with the power to impose this technology on us everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>One company should never have such power.</p>
<p>Further, biometric data should never be used for trivial purposes like "proof of personhood" or age verification. No amount of supposedly "privacy-preserving" features can change this.</p>
<p>The premise itself is flawed from the start to respect privacy rights.</p>
<p>While the problem of proving identify can still be an important one to solve in <em>some</em> context, the solution to this can never be monopolized by for-profit corporations.</p>
<p>Regardless of Tools for Humanity's intentions and efforts to convince us to trust them, any similar technology is just another step towards a global system of mass surveillance, where ultimately privacy rights and human rights are lost.</p>
<p>So, should you scan your eyeball to get a verified World ID?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p><strong>No, you really shouldn't.</strong></p>

</div>   <div><p>Another shipping port official voiced concern about the drastic decline in imports as a result of President <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump" data-sys="1">Donald Trump</a>'s tariffs.</p><p>"I can see it right over my shoulder here, I'm looking out at the Port of Seattle right now, and we currently have no container ships at berth," Seattle port commissioner Ryan Calkins told <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/cnn" data-sys="1">CNN</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>"That happens every once in a while at normal times, but it's pretty rare," he added.

Meta’s chief executive believes everyone should have a therapist and if they don’t – artificial intelligence can do that job.</p><p>“I personally have the belief that everyone should probably have a therapist,” he said last week. “It’s like someone they can just talk to throughout the day, or not necessarily throughout the day, but about whatever issues they’re worried about and for people who don’t have a person who’s a therapist, I think everyone will have an AI.”</p><p>The Guardian spoke to mental health clinicians who expressed concern about AI’s emerging role as a digital therapist. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/01/damehood-for-professor-til-wykes-is-a-recognition-of-mental-health-work" data-link-name="in body link">Prof Dame Til Wykes</a>, the head of mental health and psychological sciences at King’s College London, cites the example of an eating disorder chatbot that was <a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/news/neda-suspends-ai-chatbot-for-giving-harmful-eating-disorder-advice/" data-link-name="in body link">pulled in 2023</a> after giving dangerous advice.</p><p>“I think AI is not at the level where it can provide nuance and it might actually suggest courses of action that are totally inappropriate,” she said.</p><figure id="d717a53d-1bb0-4a3d-996a-6e6c377d467f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:4,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Heavy ChatGPT users tend to be more lonely, suggests research&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;d717a53d-1bb0-4a3d-996a-6e6c377d467f&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/25/heavy-chatgpt-users-tend-to-be-more-lonely-suggests-research&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>Wykes also sees chatbots as being potential disruptors to established relationships.</p><p>“One of the reasons you have friends is that you share personal things with each other and you talk them through,” she says. “It’s part of an alliance, a connection. And if you use AI for those sorts of purposes, will it not interfere with that relationship?”</p><p>For many AI users, Zuckerberg is merely marking an increasingly popular use of this powerful technology. There are mental health chatbots such as Noah and Wysa, while the Guardian has spoken to users of AI-powered “grieftech” – or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jun/14/i-felt-i-was-talking-to-him-are-ai-personas-of-the-dead-a-blessing-or-a-curse" data-link-name="in body link">chatbots that revive the dead</a>.</p><p>There is also their casual use as virtual friends <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/16/computer-says-yes-how-ai-is-changing-our-romantic-lives" data-link-name="in body link">or partners</a>, with bots such as character.ai and Replika offering personas to interact with. ChatGPT’s owner, OpenAI, admitted last week that a version of its groundbreaking chatbot was responding to users in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/01/chatgpt-chatbot-truth-user-update-ai" data-link-name="in body link">tone that was “overly flattering”</a> and withdrew it.</p><p>“Seriously, good for you for standing up for yourself and taking control of your own life,” it reportedly responded to a user, who claimed they had stopped taking their medication and had left their family because they were “responsible for the radio signals coming in through the walls”.</p><p>In an interview with the Stratechery newsletter, Zuckerberg, whose company owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, added that AI would not squeeze people out of your friendship circle but add to it. “That’s not going to replace the friends you have, but it will probably be additive in some way for a lot of people’s lives,” he said.</p><p>Outlining uses for Meta’s AI chatbot – available across its platforms – he said: “One of the uses for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/meta" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Meta</a> AI is basically: ‘I want to talk through an issue’; ‘I need to have a hard conversation with someone’; ‘I’m having an issue with my girlfriend’; ‘I need to have a hard conversation with my boss at work’; ‘help me roleplay this’; or ‘help me figure out how I want to approach this’.”</p><p>In a separate interview last week, Zuckerberg said “the average American has three friends, but has demand for 15” and AI could plug that gap.</p><figure id="0bc631b2-4246-43cc-810d-d0844eed007d" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:13,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘Dangerous nonsense’: AI-authored books about ADHD for sale on Amazon&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;0bc631b2-4246-43cc-810d-d0844eed007d&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/04/dangerous-nonsense-ai-authored-books-about-adhd-for-sale-on-amazon&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>Dr Jaime Craig, who is about to take over as chair of the UK’s Association of Clinical Psychologists, says it is “crucial” that mental health specialists engage with AI in their field and “ensure that it is informed by best practice”. He flags Wysa as an example of an AI tool that “users value and find more engaging”. But, he adds, more needs to be done on safety.</p><p>“Oversight and regulation will be key to ensure safe and appropriate use of these technologies. Worryingly we have not yet addressed this to date in the UK,” Craig says.</p><p>Last week it was reported that Meta’s AI Studio, which allows users to create chatbots with specific personas, was hosting bots claming to be therapists – with fake credentials. A journalist at 404 Media, a tech news site, said <a href="https://www.404media.co/instagram-ai-studio-therapy-chatbots-lie-about-being-licensed-therapists/" data-link-name="in body link">Instagram had been putting those bots in her feed</a>.</p><p>Meta said its AIs carry a disclaimer that “indicates the responses are generated by AI to help people understand their limitations”.</p></div></div>]]></description>
