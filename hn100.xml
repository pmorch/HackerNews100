  <p>Historically, physicians worked independently of—if in partnership with—hospitals. But increasingly, doctors are selling their practices to hospital systems, as well as private equity firms and insurance companies. What does it mean for patients and what they pay for healthcare when their doctors are employed by a hospital system?‌</p><p>The effects of hospital systems acquiring physician practices are hard to determine, because until now, there has been no comprehensive source of data about these mergers and the effects of integration on pricing can be hard to isolate. New research by Yale SOM economist Fiona Scott Morton tackles these challenges, determining the scale of hospital-physician mergers and examining their effects on pricing. In their study, Scott Morton and her co-authors—Yale economist Zack Cooper; Stuart V. Craig and Ashley T. Swanson of the University of Wisconsin–Madison; Aristotelis Epanomeritakis of Harvard University; Matthew Grennan of Emory University; and Joseph R. Martinez of the University of California, San Francisco—found that these integrations significantly increase prices for consumers, because competition decreases.</p><p>To Scott Morton, these findings are a wake-up call for regulators. “States haven’t been enforcing [antitrust laws] to the extent that they could,” she says. “I think there’s a lot of good that could be done with some incremental enforcement.”‌</p>

  <p>Mergers between hospital systems and physicians in private practice are what antitrust experts call “mergers of complements” or “non-horizontal mergers.” These aren’t horizontal mergers, because doctors aren’t competing with hospitals, but they aren’t quite vertical either, because doctors aren’t suppliers to hospitals. ‌</p><p>In general, scholars expect mergers of complements to have positive effects. Imagine, for example, a car maker decides it wants to own the software that will go into its vehicles. Rather than keeping its future design plans a secret from its software maker, “I can talk to them, and they can start thinking about what cool software could be used with my hardware. So we could do things together that we can’t do apart,” Scott Morton explains. Non-horizontal mergers can also reduce prices: “If I mark up my car and you mark up your software, then the [buyer] has two markups to pay, whereas if the hardware buys the software and makes a bundle, then they internalize that problem.”‌</p><p>But Scott Morton and her co-authors suspected healthcare might function differently. For example, there’s no reason to believe healthcare quality would improve after integration; after all, between navigating different insurance companies and referring patients to different specialists and hospitals, “doctors are rather good at providing care across corporate boundaries,” she says. And because healthcare is geographically constrained—patients don’t want to travel long distances to see a doctor—regional consolidation could increase prices. ‌</p><p>To study hospital–physician mergers more closely, the researchers first had to contend with an informational challenge. “Everybody knew, anecdotally, that these transactions were happening and that there were a lot of them,” Scott Morton says, “but we just couldn’t measure them.” Hospital acquisitions of private practices are generally small enough transactions that hospitals aren’t required to report the purchases to regulators.‌</p><p>So, in the absence of a single comprehensive source of data, the team developed a workaround. Using administrative data from Medicare, hospital surveys, physician directories, and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, they trained a machine-learning algorithm to identify when a physician had moved from private practice to a hospital system. The researchers tested the algorithm’s results against verified data about mergers and found it achieved 97% accuracy. ‌</p>


<div data-paragraph-pullquote="quotation">
          <blockquote>
            
      <span>  <p>You may say, the increase is only 3%. But this is 3% of a large hospital bill. And healthcare is already 19% of GDP. It’s giant.</p>

</span>

            
          </blockquote>
  </div>


  <p>When they set the algorithm loose on national data from 2008 to 2016, it identified a striking degree of integration—overall, the share of doctors employed by a hospital grew from 27.5% to‌ 47.2% during that span. ‌</p><p>To understand how this integration was affecting prices, the researchers looked at childbirths, which account for a large share of both commercial hospital admissions and healthcare spending. They gathered data on pricing—that is, how much doctors and hospitals were charging insurers—from a large private insurance company. Then the researchers looked at OB-GYNs who had integrated with a hospital system in 2013–2014, and compared the prices those doctors and hospitals charged two years before and two years after the merger. To ensure they were isolating the effects of integration, they also compared these doctors and hospitals to otherwise similar doctors and hospitals that had not integrated. ‌</p><p>Both hospitals and doctors charged more after integration, the researchers discovered: hospital prices for labor and delivery increased by 3.3% ($475, on average), while physician prices increased by 15.1% ($502, on average).‌</p><p>These are “substantial price increases,” Scott Morton says. “You may say, it’s only 3%. But this is 3% of a large hospital bill. And healthcare is already 19% of GDP. It’s giant.”‌</p><p>And this uptick in price did not reflect an improvement in healthcare quality as far as the researchers can determine. After examining common measures of quality for childbirths, including hospital readmission and C-section rates, the researchers found no improvements in the years after integration.‌</p>





  <p>As the researchers continued analyzing their results, they found statistical signs of three different anticompetitive mechanisms that explained the price increases they observed.‌</p><p>The first of these is called foreclosure. Before integration, an OB-GYN in solo practice might refer their patients to several hospitals in the area for labor and delivery. After integration, however, the doctor might feel pressured to steer their patients to deliver within their hospital system. “That’s foreclosing those doctors and patients from choosing between hospitals,” Scott Morton explains. This gives the hospital and the doctor more power in the market, and therefore the ability to raise prices. ‌</p><p>The second is called recapture. If a physician in private practice is charging too much, an insurance company might refuse to include them in their network. “After the merger, tossing out the physician means tossing out the hospital,” she says. This might cause consumers to switch insurers so they can remain with their preferred doctor and hospital—“so a physician will recapture those people.” Once again, the doctor and the hospital can get away with raising prices. ‌</p><p>The third mechanism is simply market concentration. Over time, if a hospital system acquires enough private practices, “there is a horizontal impact of these [non-horizontal] mergers,” Scott Morton explains. “If the hospital already owns a couple of obstetricians, and buys another group, then those obstetricians become horizontally joined….and we find prices go up for that reason.” ‌</p><p>The researchers found further evidence of reduced competition when they looked at another group of doctors. Prices for doctors who had <em>already </em>integrated with a hospital system increased by 9% after the hospital acquired more doctors in their specialty. Nothing changed for these already-integrated doctors; they were the same doctors working at the same hospitals. The only plausible explanation for their ability to charge higher prices is a reduction in competition. ‌</p><p>To Scott Morton, these results call for renewed attention from regulators. States could, for example, require medical organizations to submit information about their ownership and physician affiliates, which would make it far easier to track hospital-physician mergers. Regulators could also require a waiting period before such mergers, “so that the state can assess for itself whether that transaction would be harmful.” A small task force at the federal level could even advise state regulators in making these assessments. ‌</p><p>And it’s important, she argues, to draw attention to the larger effects of small transactions in local markets: “States as well as citizens care a lot about having those prices be low and markets be efficient and working well.” ‌</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/zig-builds-getting-faster">https://mitchellh.com/writing/zig-builds-getting-faster</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45468698">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Andrew Kelley famously (or infamously, depending on your views) said
"the compiler is too damn slow, that's why we have bugs."<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>As a result, one of the primary stated goals of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> for
years has been faster compile times. The Zig team has been working on
extremely hard problems to make this a reality
(such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/16270">yeeting LLVM</a>,
writing their own <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ziglang.org/download/0.15.1/release-notes.html#Compiler">code generation backends</a>,
building their own <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/25299">linkers</a>,
and marching towards <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ziglang.org/download/0.15.1/release-notes.html#Incremental-Compilation">incremental compilation</a> in general).<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The fruits of this multi-year labor are finally starting to show
with Zig 0.15.1. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ghostty.org/">Ghostty</a> project just completed upgrading to
Zig 0.15.1, and I'd like to share some real-world build times.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="build-script-compilation">Build Script Compilation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Zig 0.14: 7sec 167ms</li>
<li>Zig 0.15: 1sec 702ms</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the time it takes to build the <code>build.zig</code> script itself. The
times above were measured by running <code>zig build --help</code>.</p>
<p>A well-written build script should only rebuild itself rarely. However,
this is a cost every new uncached source build will pay (e.g. a user
downloading the project to build from source one time). As such, it directly
impacts the time to build a usable binary.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="full-uncached-ghostty-binary">Full Uncached Ghostty Binary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Zig 0.14: 41sec</li>
<li>Zig 0.15: 32sec</li>
</ul>
<p>This includes the time to build the build script itself. Given the prior
results, Zig 0.15 is building everything else ~2 seconds faster. But, you
can still see in wall time the change in this initial build time.</p>
<div><p><strong>Important: most of this is still using LLVM.</strong> Ghostty still can't fully build and link using
the self-hosted x86_64 backend, since the backend still has bugs. So, this just shows the general
improvements in the Zig compiler itself, even with LLVM in the picture.</p></div>
<p>Once Ghostty can use the self-hosted x86_64 backend completely, I expect
this time to plummet to around 25 seconds or less, fully half the time it
would take with Zig 0.14.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="incremental-build-ghostty-executable">Incremental Build (Ghostty Executable)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Zig 0.14: 19sec</li>
<li>Zig 0.15: 16sec</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the time it takes to rebuild Ghostty after a one-line change to
the most core terminal emulation code (adding a log function call to the
escape sequence parser).</p>
<p>This build has a fully cached build script and dependency graph, so it
is only rebuilding what it needs to. Incremental compilation in Zig isn't
functional yet, so this still recompiles a considerable amount of code.
Additionally, as with the prior section, <strong>this is still using LLVM</strong>.
By simply dropping LLVM out of the picture, I expect this time to drop to
around 12 seconds or so (less the time LLVM is emitting).</p>
<p>Going further, once Zig supports incremental compilation, I expect
we'll be able to measure incremental builds like this within milliseconds
at worst. But, let's wait and see when that is reality.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="incremental-build-libghostty-vt">Incremental Build (libghostty-vt)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Zig 0.14: 2sec 884ms</li>
<li>Zig 0.15: 975ms</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the time it takes to rebuild only <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/libghostty-is-coming">libghostty-vt</a>
after a one-line change. Unlike the Ghostty executable, <code>libghostty-vt</code>
is fully functional with the self-hosted x86_64 backend, so this
shows the differences in build times without LLVM in the picture.</p>
<p>Similar to the Ghostty executable, this is still rebuilding the full
Zig module for <code>libghostty-vt</code>, since incremental compilation isn't
fully functional yet. I expect this to also drop to single-digit milliseconds
at worst once incremental compilation is a reality.</p>
<p>But still, a sub-second build time for a non-trivial library is <em>amazing</em>.
This is the library I'm spending most of my time working on right now,
and even in a few short days since upgrading to Zig 0.15.1, I've felt
a huge difference in my workflow. Previously, I might tab out to read an
email between builds or tests, but now its so fast I can stay in flow
in my terminal.</p>
<p><strong>This improvement is most indicative of what's to come in the short term.</strong>
The self-hosted x86_64 backend is already stable enough to build all debug
builds by default and the aarch64 backend is getting there, too. We aren't
able to build the full Ghostty executable yet, but I bet this will get
ironed out within months.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="faster-builds-are-here">Faster Builds Are Here</h2>
<p>As you can see, building Ghostty with Zig 0.15.1 is faster in every single
scenario, despite the fact that a lot of Ghostty still can't even take
advantage of the self-hosted backend! And despite the fact that incremental
compilation isn't functional yet!</p>
<p>I've loved betting on Zig for Ghostty, and I love that they're focusing
on compile times. These improvements are real, and they're here now. And
I suspect in the next couple years, the results posted today will look
downright slow. 😜</p>

<p>The world’s 3rd known interstellar object – 3I/ATLAS – has made its closest approach to Mars. The approach took place at <a href="https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/universal-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">4 UTC</a> on October 3, 2025 (11 p.m. CDT on October 2). At that time, the comet was approximately 18 million miles (29 million kilometers) from Mars. It was the object’s closest approach to any planet during its one-time journey through our solar system. </p>
<p>As of this writing (10 UTC on October 3), we have not seen any new images from the pass. But multiple space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are coordinating observations using various spacecraft and orbiters around Mars. Instruments on ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, as well as NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, are focusing on capturing detailed data from this interstellar visitor. In an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/interstellar-comet-nasa-b9df6568efee22c02b722a87377d30db" rel="noopener" target="_blank">October 2 story from AP</a>, Marcia Dunn reported: </p>
<blockquote><p>Both of the European Space Agency’s satellites around Mars are already aiming their cameras at the comet, which is only the 3rd interstellar object known to have passed our way. NASA’s satellite and rovers at the red planet are also available to assist in the observations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Previously, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmeubanks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marshall Eubanks</a> of Space Initiatives had <a href="https://groups.io/g/mpml/message/40919" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>During the Mars close approach, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will observe 3I with HiRISE, observing between 1 – 4 a.m. on October 2, and the CaSSIS camera on ESA’s Trace Gas Orbiter and the Mars Express’ High Resolution Stereo Camera will be observing on October 3.</p></blockquote>
<p>3I/ATLAS will reach perihelion, its closest point to the sun, on October 29, 2025. Its perihelion  distance will be roughly 1.36 astronomical units (<a href="https://earthsky.org/space/what-is-the-astronomical-unit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AU</a>) from the sun – just inside the orbit of Mars.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in tracking the object, <a href="https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/solar-system/#/home" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NASA’s Eyes on the Solar System tool</a> offers interactive simulations of its path. Also, <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/3i-atlas/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NASA just launched a new page devoted to 3I/ATLAS</a>. And the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/ESA_observations_of_interstellar_comet_3I_ATLAS" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest updates on ESA observations are here</a></p>
<p>Please note that 3I/ATLAS will not be visible to the unaided eye from Earth at this Mars approach, or at any time. It will be possible to view the object with 8-inch (20 cm) or larger telescopes … but the best time for that won’t come until November. If you spot it then, you’ll be in good company. Between November 2 and 25, ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (<a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Juice" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Juice</a>) will be observing the comet with various instruments. As Juice looks towards 3I/ATLAS so soon after its closest approach to the sun, it is likely to have the best view of the comet in a very active state, with a bright halo around its nucleus and a long tail stretching out behind it.</p>

<h3>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS: A look backward</h3>
<p>Where did 3I/ATLAS come from? We know it came from the Sagittarius direction in our sky; that is, it came from the direction of the center of our <a href="https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/what-is-the-milky-way-galaxy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Milky Way</a> galaxy. But there are billions of stars in that direction. Which one is the home system of this object?</p>
<p>There have been many studies and ideas. One team of scientists, led by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_jw3KtcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xabier Pérez-Couto</a> of the University of A Coruña in Spain, traced the path of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS back 10 million years. The astronomers were seeking its origin star, or any stars that might have perturbed its path as it traveled from its point of origin to our solar system.</p>
<p>The researchers examined 3I/ATLAS’s trajectory with the help of the <a href="https://earthsky.org/space/live-whats-phil-thinking-of-now-gaia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gaia space observatory’s</a> data on stars. For 12 years, Gaia collected data on billions of stars in our Milky Way galaxy, precisely noting their positions again and again and thereby determining their motions. These astronomers’ calculations took them more than 100 million astronomical units (AU, or Earth-sun units) from our solar system. With these data in hand, researchers said they identified 93 nominal “encounters” for 3I/ATLAS, 62 of which were “significant.” Yet, they found that none of those encounters produced any meaningful perturbation of ATLAS’s orbit. </p>
<p>So, in other words, all of those 93 (or 62) encounters happened too fast, with the stars too far from 3I/ATLAS to meaningfully impact its trajectory. In the end, they didn’t find a star along 3I/ATLAS’s path that might have been responsible for bringing this 3rd-known interstellar object to us. </p>

<h3>Tracing 3I/ATLAS’ path, a daunting task</h3>
<p>And, as you might imagine, tracing 3I/ATLAS’ path backward through the galaxy is a daunting task. That’s in part because small uncertainties in orbits and stellar motions grow rapidly over time. But based on the researchers’ analyses of the interstellar object’s vertical motion in the galaxy (its path is known to weave up and down in the galactic disk), they concluded that it likely originated from the Milky Way’s <em>thin disk</em>, not its <em>thick disk</em> as was mentioned some months ago.

<h3>Unlocking galactic mysteries with 3I/ATLAS</h3>
<p>3I/ATLAS is thought to have been drifting through interstellar space for many billions of years before encountering our solar system. Pérez-Couto and team said that the interstellar comet is a: </p>
<blockquote><p>… key probe of the galactic population of icy planetesimals.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the formation of solar systems is a messy process. In a solar system’s earliest days, rocks and pockets of gas and dust bang into each other and get swept up into clumps, which eventually get big enough to begin gathering yet more rocks, gas and dust to themselves via the force of gravity. Thus, planets come to be, astronomers think. According to theories of planet formation, clearing processes are also common, and those sometimes involve material – often the outer, icy regions of debris – getting ejected from a system altogether. As the paper said: </p>
<blockquote><p>… interstellar space should be filled with planetesimals.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Other possibilities</h3>
<p>Plus, there are other ways these interstellar interlopers might have achieved their lonely paths through our Milky Way galaxy. The possibilities range from close passages of other stars to tidal fragmentation of comets. So, as the paper said: </p>
<blockquote><p>Identifying the origin of interstellar objects is key to understanding planet formation efficiency, the distribution of volatiles and organics in the galaxy, and the dynamical pathways by which planetary systems evolve.</p></blockquote>
<p>All that from a small chunk of icy stuff (we know it’s icy in part because 3I/ATLAS has formed a tail, as icy comets do)!</p>
<h3>EarthSky interview with Colin Orion Chandler</h3>
<p>On August 7, 2025, NASA <a href="https://esahubble.org/news/heic2509/?lang" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shared</a> an updated estimate of the size of the object’s nucleus, or core. Shortly after the object was first identified on July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was estimated to have a diameter of about 12 miles (20 km). Then in late July – using data from the new Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile – the size estimate dropped to 6 miles (10 km). The latest analysis uses data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. It reduces the estimated diameter of 3I/ATLAS’s nucleus still further, to 3.5 miles (5.6 km). </p>
<p>And, the astronomers using Hubble data said, the object could be even smaller, as small as 1,050 feet (320 meters) across!</p>

<p>By the way, the two previously known interstellar objects are <a href="https://earthsky.org/space/oumuamua-outgassing-comet-strange-orbit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">1I/ ‘Oumuamua</a> and <a href="https://earthsky.org/space/2i-borisov-pristine-comet-interstellar-visitor/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2I/Borisov</a>. ‘Oumuamua’s size is thought to be about 656 feet (200 meters) across at its widest (you’ll recall it has an elongated shape). And Borisov is thought to be less than 3,280 feet (1 km) across.</p>

<h3>An early EarthSky interview with Matthew Hopkins</h3>
<p>Shortly after the discovery of 3I/ATLAS – on July 1, 2025 – astronomers were saying it was likely the oldest comet we’ve ever seen. That claim came from University of Oxford astronomer <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/hopkinsm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Matthew Hopkins</a>, whose analysis suggested 3I/ATLAS might be more than 7 billion years old, predating our solar system by more than 3 billion years!

<h3>EarthSky interview with Colin Snodgrass</h3>
<p>Scientists first spotted 3I/ATLAS in early July 2025. And since then, one question has been asked countless times: will we send out a spacecraft to take a closer look? EarthSky’s <a href="https://earthsky.org/author/will-triggs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Will Triggs</a> spoke to University of Edinburgh astronomer <a href="https://www.roe.ac.uk/~csn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Colin Snodgrass</a> on August 21, 2025, to find out the answer. Colin essentially said, no, we don’t have time to organize a space mission specifically for 3I/ATLAS. But he talked about a future mission, the European Space Agency’s <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Comet_Interceptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Comet Interceptor</a>. This upcoming spacecraft will be primed to intercept future interstellar objects. Watch Will’s interview with Colin in the player below, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U_OBw84v_E" rel="noopener" target="_blank">or on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="1383" height="494" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3U_OBw84v_E" title="Will We Send A Spacecraft To 3I/ATLAS?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the behavior of 3I/ATLAS is much like the signature of previously seen sun-bound comets originating within our solar system. But 3I/ATLAS is moving <em>fast</em>. In fact, it’s traveling through our solar system at roughly 130,000 miles per hour (210,000 kph). That’s the highest velocity ever recorded for a solar system visitor. </p>
<h3>How they spotted interstellar object 3I/ ATLAS</h3>
<p>The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) – a system of survey telescopes – detected our new interstellar visitor on July 1, 2025. And the Minor Planet Center <a href="https://minorplanetcenter.net/mpec/K25/K25N12.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> its interstellar nature the following day (July 2, 2025), naming it 3I/ATLAS (or C/2025 N1). The “3I” means it’s the 3rd interstellar visitor that we’ve found. Its trajectory and speed revealed it as an object not from our solar system, but from another star system.</p>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope imaged the object on July 21, 2025. See the post from Bluesky below.</p>

<h3>It’s still heading sunward</h3>
<p>Our new visitor will get its closest to the sun – at about 2 astronomical units (AU), or twice as far as Earth is from the sun – in October. As it reaches perihelion – its closest point to the sun – it will be traveling at almost <a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/news/noirlab2522/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">15,500 miles per hour</a> (25,000 kph).</p>
<p>The speedy nature of Comet 3I/ATLAS is another indication of its interstellar nature. It has to be moving at a blistering pace in order to escape the sun’s gravitational pull.</p>
<p>Marshall Eubanks, a physicist and Very-long-baseline interferometry radio astronomer and co-founder of Space Initiatives, said the comet will come within about 0.4 AU of Mars in October. That would make it just barely observable by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>

						<span><span></span>Press release</span>
					The Riksbank and representatives from the payment market have today reached an agreement to increase the possibility to make offline card payments for essential goods. The agreement is an important step in the work to strengthen Sweden's payment preparedness and increase resilience to disruptions in the digital payments system. The goal is for the measures to be in place no later than 1 July 2026.
				</p>



				

			<div>
				
<p>“In Sweden, we pay digitally to a large degree and the use of cash is low. The general public being able to pay by card for example for food and medicines even in the event of a serious breakdown in data communication, that is offline, is a milestone in our intensified efforts to strengthen emergency preparedness”, says Governor Erik Thedéen.</p>
<p>The agreement describes the measures that participants in Swedish card payments – card issuers, card networks, card acquirers, the retail sector and the Riksbank – will implement to increase the possibility of offline payments by card. For instance, financial agents will adapt their regulatory frameworks, and the retail trade will introduce technological solutions. The Riksbank is leading this work and is responsible for monitoring its implementation.</p>
<p>“We are very pleased that all participants involved are taking responsibility for strengthening Sweden's payment readiness. Some are covered by the Riksbank's regulations, but far from all. We regard the fact that so many are nevertheless choosing to contribute as very positive for Sweden's overall civil preparedness”, concludes Erik Thedéen.</p>
<p>The online function shall apply to physical payment cards and accompanying PIN code when purchasing essential goods such as food, medicine and fuel. The Riksbank will continue its work on enabling offline payments for other payment methods after 1 July 2026.</p>

But rather than just being a lower core count part, the 9355P pulls levers to let each core count for more. First, it clocks up to 4.4 GHz. AMD has faster clocking chips in its server lineup, but 4.4 GHz is still a good bit higher than the 3.7 or 4.1 GHz that </span><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/server/epyc/9005-series.html#specifications" rel="">128 or 192 core Zen 5 SKUs reach</a><span>. Then, AMD uses eight CPU dies (CCDs) to house those 32 cores. Each CCD only has four cores enabled out of the eight physically present, but still has its full 32 MB of L3 cache usable. That provides a high cache capacity to core count ratio. Finally, each CCD connects to the IO die using a “GMI-Wide” setup, giving each CCD 64B/cycle of bandwidth to the rest of the system in both the read and write directions. GMI here stands for Global Memory Interconnect. Zen 5’s server IO die has 16 GMI links to support up to 16 CCDs for high core count parts, plus some xGMI (external) links to allow a dual socket setup. GMI-Wide uses two links per CCD, fully utilizing the IO die’s GMI links even though the EPYC 9355P only has eight CCDs.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xcV9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89ddd15e-c1e8-4f84-95f8-56d9181f7a4d_975x527.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xcV9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89ddd15e-c1e8-4f84-95f8-56d9181f7a4d_975x527.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xcV9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89ddd15e-c1e8-4f84-95f8-56d9181f7a4d_975x527.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xcV9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89ddd15e-c1e8-4f84-95f8-56d9181f7a4d_975x527.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xcV9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89ddd15e-c1e8-4f84-95f8-56d9181f7a4d_975x527.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xcV9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89ddd15e-c1e8-4f84-95f8-56d9181f7a4d_975x527.png" width="975" height="527" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/89ddd15e-c1e8-4f84-95f8-56d9181f7a4d_975x527.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:527,&quot;width&quot;:975,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:180582,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/174871357?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89ddd15e-c1e8-4f84-95f8-56d9181f7a4d_975x527.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xcV9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89ddd15e-c1e8-4f84-95f8-56d9181f7a4d_975x527.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xcV9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89ddd15e-c1e8-4f84-95f8-56d9181f7a4d_975x527.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xcV9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89ddd15e-c1e8-4f84-95f8-56d9181f7a4d_975x527.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xcV9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89ddd15e-c1e8-4f84-95f8-56d9181f7a4d_975x527.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-poweredge-servers/new-poweredge-r6715-rack-server/spd/poweredge-r6715/pe_r6715_tm_vi_vp_sb" rel="">Dell has kindly provided a PowerEdge R6715 for testing</a><span>, and it came equipped with the aforementioned AMD EPYC 9355P along with 768 GB of DDR5-5200.

DRAM latency in that mode is slightly better than what Intel’s Xeon 6 achieves in SNC3 mode. SNC3 on Intel divides the chip into three NUMA nodes that correspond to its compute dies. The EPYC 9355P has good memory latency in that respect, but it falls behind compared to the Ryzen 9 9900X with DDR5-5600. Interconnects that tie more agents together tend to have higher latency. On AMD’s server platform, the Infinity Fabric network within the IO die has to connect up to 16 CCDs with 12 memory controllers and other IO, so the higher latency isn’t surprising.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mbb3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff51fed7c-b5d2-4b4c-8a43-4a55ce28914d_975x427.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mbb3!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff51fed7c-b5d2-4b4c-8a43-4a55ce28914d_975x427.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mbb3!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff51fed7c-b5d2-4b4c-8a43-4a55ce28914d_975x427.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mbb3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff51fed7c-b5d2-4b4c-8a43-4a55ce28914d_975x427.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mbb3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff51fed7c-b5d2-4b4c-8a43-4a55ce28914d_975x427.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mbb3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff51fed7c-b5d2-4b4c-8a43-4a55ce28914d_975x427.png" width="975" height="427" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f51fed7c-b5d2-4b4c-8a43-4a55ce28914d_975x427.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:427,&quot;width&quot;:975,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:72295,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/174871357?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff51fed7c-b5d2-4b4c-8a43-4a55ce28914d_975x427.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mbb3!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff51fed7c-b5d2-4b4c-8a43-4a55ce28914d_975x427.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mbb3!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff51fed7c-b5d2-4b4c-8a43-4a55ce28914d_975x427.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mbb3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff51fed7c-b5d2-4b4c-8a43-4a55ce28914d_975x427.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mbb3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff51fed7c-b5d2-4b4c-8a43-4a55ce28914d_975x427.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Cache performance is similar across AMD’s desktop and server Zen 5 implementations, with the server variant only losing because of lower clock speeds.

Intel trades L3 latency for capacity and the ability to a logical L3 instance across more cores.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QONl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf03a30-37d4-4d15-9c01-690fe0305f95_975x227.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QONl!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf03a30-37d4-4d15-9c01-690fe0305f95_975x227.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QONl!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf03a30-37d4-4d15-9c01-690fe0305f95_975x227.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QONl!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf03a30-37d4-4d15-9c01-690fe0305f95_975x227.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QONl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf03a30-37d4-4d15-9c01-690fe0305f95_975x227.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QONl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf03a30-37d4-4d15-9c01-690fe0305f95_975x227.png" width="975" height="227" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/adf03a30-37d4-4d15-9c01-690fe0305f95_975x227.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:227,&quot;width&quot;:975,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:47683,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/174871357?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf03a30-37d4-4d15-9c01-690fe0305f95_975x227.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QONl!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf03a30-37d4-4d15-9c01-690fe0305f95_975x227.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QONl!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf03a30-37d4-4d15-9c01-690fe0305f95_975x227.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QONl!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf03a30-37d4-4d15-9c01-690fe0305f95_975x227.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QONl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf03a30-37d4-4d15-9c01-690fe0305f95_975x227.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Different NUMA configurations can subdivide EPYC 9355P, associating cores with the closest memory controllers to improve latency. NPS2 divides the chip into two hemispheres, and has 16 cores form a NUMA node with the six memory controllers on one half of the die. NPS4 divides the chip into quadrants, each with two CCDs and three memory controllers. Finally, the chip can present each CCD as a NUMA node. Doing so makes it easier to pin threads to cores that share a L3 cache, but doesn’t affect how memory is interleaved across channels.

The bandwidth penalty is minor, but a bigger potential pitfall is lower bandwidth to each NUMA node’s memory pool. Two CCDs can draw more bandwidth than the three memory controllers they’re associated with. Manually distributing memory accesses across NUMA nodes can improve bandwidth for a workload contained within one NUMA node’s cores. But doing so in practice may be an intricate exercise.</p><p>In general, EPYC 9355P has very mild NUMA characteristics and little penalty associated with running the chip in NPS1 or NPS2 mode. I imagine just using NPS1 mode would work well enough in the vast majority of cases, with little performance to be gained from carrying out NUMA optimizations.</p><p>GMI-Wide is AMD’s attempt to address bandwidth pinch points between CCDs and the rest of the system. With GMI-Wide, a single CCD can achieve 99.8 GB/s of read bandwidth, significantly more than the 62.5 GB/s from a Ryzen 9 9900X CCD with GMI-Narrow. GMI-Wide also allows better latency control under high bandwidth load. The Ryzen 9 9900X suffers from a corner case where a single core pulling maximum bandwidth can saturate the GMI-Narrow link and starve out another latency sensitive thread. That sends latency to nearly 500 ns, as observed by a latency test thread sharing a CCD with a thread linearly traversing an array. Having more threads generate bandwidth load seems to make QoS mechanisms kick in, which slightly reduces bandwidth throughput but brings latency back under control.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KTCF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a88e138-9963-4f94-99e7-64854c656bc8_975x529.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KTCF!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a88e138-9963-4f94-99e7-64854c656bc8_975x529.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KTCF!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a88e138-9963-4f94-99e7-64854c656bc8_975x529.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KTCF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a88e138-9963-4f94-99e7-64854c656bc8_975x529.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KTCF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a88e138-9963-4f94-99e7-64854c656bc8_975x529.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KTCF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a88e138-9963-4f94-99e7-64854c656bc8_975x529.png" width="975" height="529" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1a88e138-9963-4f94-99e7-64854c656bc8_975x529.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:529,&quot;width&quot;:975,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:95917,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/174871357?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a88e138-9963-4f94-99e7-64854c656bc8_975x529.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KTCF!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a88e138-9963-4f94-99e7-64854c656bc8_975x529.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KTCF!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a88e138-9963-4f94-99e7-64854c656bc8_975x529.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KTCF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a88e138-9963-4f94-99e7-64854c656bc8_975x529.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KTCF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a88e138-9963-4f94-99e7-64854c656bc8_975x529.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>I previously wrote about loaded memory latency on the Ryzen 9 9950X when testing the system remotely, and </span><a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/p/pushing-amds-infinity-fabric-to-its" rel="">thought it controlled latency well under high bandwidth load</a><span>.

The same isn’t true in NPS4 mode, where a GMI-Wide link can outmatch a NPS4 node’s three memory controllers. Everything’s fine with just reads, which actually benefit possibly because of lower latency and not having to traverse as much of the IO die. But with a read-modify-write pattern, bandwidth drops from 134 GB/s in NPS1 mode to 96.6 GB/s with NPS4. Latency gets worse too, rising to 248 ns. Again, NPS4 is something to be careful with, particularly if applications might require high bandwidth from a small subset of cores.</p><p>From a single thread perspective, the EPYC 9355P falls some distance behind the Ryzen 9 9900X. Desktop CPUs are designed around single threaded performance, so that’s to be expected. But with boost turned off on the desktop CPU to match clock speeds, performance is surprisingly close. Higher memory latency still hurts the EPYC 9355P, but it’s within striking distance.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S4dS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56176f96-0c6f-465b-9c2c-7b927fe48aaa_975x583.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S4dS!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56176f96-0c6f-465b-9c2c-7b927fe48aaa_975x583.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S4dS!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56176f96-0c6f-465b-9c2c-7b927fe48aaa_975x583.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S4dS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56176f96-0c6f-465b-9c2c-7b927fe48aaa_975x583.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S4dS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56176f96-0c6f-465b-9c2c-7b927fe48aaa_975x583.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S4dS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56176f96-0c6f-465b-9c2c-7b927fe48aaa_975x583.png" width="975" height="583" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/56176f96-0c6f-465b-9c2c-7b927fe48aaa_975x583.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:583,&quot;width&quot;:975,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:102023,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/174871357?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56176f96-0c6f-465b-9c2c-7b927fe48aaa_975x583.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S4dS!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56176f96-0c6f-465b-9c2c-7b927fe48aaa_975x583.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S4dS!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56176f96-0c6f-465b-9c2c-7b927fe48aaa_975x583.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S4dS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56176f96-0c6f-465b-9c2c-7b927fe48aaa_975x583.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S4dS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56176f96-0c6f-465b-9c2c-7b927fe48aaa_975x583.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>NUMA modes barely make any difference.

The 9900X even loses to Redwood Cove cores on Xeon 6. The EPYC 9355P does very well in this test against both the 9900X and Xeon 6. Intel’s interconnect strategy tries to keep the chip logically monolithic and doesn’t have pinch points at cluster boundaries. But each core on Xeon 6 can only get to ~33 GB/s of DRAM bandwidth at best, using an even mix of reads and writes. AMD’s GMI-Wide can more than match that, and Intel’s advantage doesn’t show through in this scenario. However, Intel does have a potential advantage against more density focused AMD SKUs where eight cores sit in front of a narrower link.</p><p>NPS4 is also detrimental to the EPYC 9355P’s performance in this test. It only provides a minimal latency benefit at the cost of lower per-node bandwidth. The bandwidth part seems to hurt here, and taking the extra latency of striping accesses across 6 or 12 memory controllers gives a notable performance improvement.</p><p>Core count isn’t the last word in server design. A lot of scenarios are better served by lower core count parts. Applications might not scale to fill a high core count chip. Bandwidth bound workloads might not benefit from adding cores. Traditionally lower core count server chips just traded core counts for higher clock speeds. Today, chips like the EPYC 9355P do a bit more, using both wider CCD-to-IOD links and more cache to maximize per-core performance.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7uUJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0c58c9a-c90f-4452-8dda-c6d3b5fff36d_975x544.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7uUJ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0c58c9a-c90f-4452-8dda-c6d3b5fff36d_975x544.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7uUJ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0c58c9a-c90f-4452-8dda-c6d3b5fff36d_975x544.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7uUJ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0c58c9a-c90f-4452-8dda-c6d3b5fff36d_975x544.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7uUJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0c58c9a-c90f-4452-8dda-c6d3b5fff36d_975x544.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7uUJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0c58c9a-c90f-4452-8dda-c6d3b5fff36d_975x544.png" width="975" height="544" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f0c58c9a-c90f-4452-8dda-c6d3b5fff36d_975x544.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:544,&quot;width&quot;:975,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:334371,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/174871357?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0c58c9a-c90f-4452-8dda-c6d3b5fff36d_975x544.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7uUJ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0c58c9a-c90f-4452-8dda-c6d3b5fff36d_975x544.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7uUJ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0c58c9a-c90f-4452-8dda-c6d3b5fff36d_975x544.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7uUJ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0c58c9a-c90f-4452-8dda-c6d3b5fff36d_975x544.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7uUJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0c58c9a-c90f-4452-8dda-c6d3b5fff36d_975x544.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Looking at EPYC 9355P’s NUMA characteristics reveals very consistent memory performance across NUMA modes. Intel’s Xeon 6 may be more monolithic from a caching point of view, but AMD’s DRAM access performance feels more monolithic than Intel’s. AMD made a tradeoff back in the Zen 2 days where they took lower local memory latency in exchange for more even memory performance across the socket. Measured latencies on EPYC 9355P are a bit higher than figures on the Zen 2 slide above. DDR5 is higher latency, and the Infinity Fabric topology is probably more complex these days to handle more CCDs and memory channels.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Rh7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdbeb54c-c11b-44fb-8398-9a70ce800e06_975x525.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Rh7!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdbeb54c-c11b-44fb-8398-9a70ce800e06_975x525.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Rh7!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdbeb54c-c11b-44fb-8398-9a70ce800e06_975x525.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Rh7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdbeb54c-c11b-44fb-8398-9a70ce800e06_975x525.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Rh7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdbeb54c-c11b-44fb-8398-9a70ce800e06_975x525.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Rh7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdbeb54c-c11b-44fb-8398-9a70ce800e06_975x525.png" width="975" height="525" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bdbeb54c-c11b-44fb-8398-9a70ce800e06_975x525.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:525,&quot;width&quot;:975,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:567064,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/174871357?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdbeb54c-c11b-44fb-8398-9a70ce800e06_975x525.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Rh7!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdbeb54c-c11b-44fb-8398-9a70ce800e06_975x525.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Rh7!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdbeb54c-c11b-44fb-8398-9a70ce800e06_975x525.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Rh7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdbeb54c-c11b-44fb-8398-9a70ce800e06_975x525.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Rh7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdbeb54c-c11b-44fb-8398-9a70ce800e06_975x525.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>From the AMD EPYC 9005 Processor Architecture Overview</figcaption></figure></div><p>But the big picture remains. AMD’s Turin platform handles well in NPS1 mode, and cross-node penalties are low in NPS2/NPS4 modes. Those characteristics likely carry over across the Zen 5 EPYC SKU stack. It’s quite different from Intel’s Xeon 6 platform, which places memory controllers on compute dies like Zen 1 did. For now, AMD’s approach seems to be better at the DRAM level. Intel’s theoretical latency advantage in SNC3 mode doesn’t show through, and AMD gets to reap the benefits of a hub-and-spoke model while not getting hit where it should have downsides.</p><p>AMD seems to have found a good formula back in the Zen 2 days, and they’re content with reinforcing success. Intel is furiously iterating to find a setup that preserves a single level, logically monolithic interconnect while scaling well across a range of core counts. And of course, there’s Arm chips, which generally lean towards a single level monolithic interconnect too. It’ll be interesting to watch what all of these players do going forward as they continue to iterate and refine their designs.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vt3F!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec50b5cd-e0f1-4c05-9c6f-a9fa59889fbf_975x250.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vt3F!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec50b5cd-e0f1-4c05-9c6f-a9fa59889fbf_975x250.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vt3F!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec50b5cd-e0f1-4c05-9c6f-a9fa59889fbf_975x250.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vt3F!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec50b5cd-e0f1-4c05-9c6f-a9fa59889fbf_975x250.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vt3F!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec50b5cd-e0f1-4c05-9c6f-a9fa59889fbf_975x250.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vt3F!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec50b5cd-e0f1-4c05-9c6f-a9fa59889fbf_975x250.png" width="975" height="250" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ec50b5cd-e0f1-4c05-9c6f-a9fa59889fbf_975x250.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:250,&quot;width&quot;:975,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:409739,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/174871357?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec50b5cd-e0f1-4c05-9c6f-a9fa59889fbf_975x250.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vt3F!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec50b5cd-e0f1-4c05-9c6f-a9fa59889fbf_975x250.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vt3F!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec50b5cd-e0f1-4c05-9c6f-a9fa59889fbf_975x250.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vt3F!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec50b5cd-e0f1-4c05-9c6f-a9fa59889fbf_975x250.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vt3F!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec50b5cd-e0f1-4c05-9c6f-a9fa59889fbf_975x250.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A big thanks to Zach from ZeroOne Technology for taking pictures of the system in the rack!</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>And again, we’d like to thank both Dell and ZeroOne for, respectively, providing and hosting </span><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-poweredge-servers/new-poweredge-r6715-rack-server/spd/poweredge-r6715/pe_r6715_tm_vi_vp_sb" rel="">this PowerEdge R6715</a><span> without both of whom this article wouldn’t have been possible. </span></p><p><span>If you like the content then consider heading over to the </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChipsandCheese" rel="">Patreon</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4EMPH66SBGVSQ" rel="">PayPal</a><span> if you want to toss a few bucks to Chips and Cheese.

<p><strong>Jules Memory for Repositories:</strong> We’re excited to introduce a new Memory feature! Jules now has the ability to learn from your interactions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it works:</strong> During a task, Jules will save your preferences, nudges, and corrections.</li>
<li><strong>The benefit:</strong> The next time you run the same or a similar task in that specific repository, Jules will reference its memory to better anticipate your needs and follow your established patterns, leading to more accurate results with less guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Settings:</strong> You can toggle memory on or off for the repo in the repo settings page under “Knowledge”</li>

<p>Jules is now able to read and respond to your comments on pull requests!</p>
<p>When you start a review, Jules will add a 👀 emoji to each comment to let you know it’s been read. Based on your feedback, Jules will then push a commit with the requested changes.</p>
<p>For more control, you can switch to <strong>Reactive Mode</strong> in your <a href="https://jules.google.com/settings">global Jules UI settings</a>. In this mode, Jules will only act on comments where you specifically mention <code dir="auto">@Jules</code>.</p> </article><article> <h2 id="all-hands-on-deck"> All Hands on Deck! </h2> <b id="thu-sep-18-2025-190000-gmt-0500-central-daylight-time"> September 19, 2025 </b> <p><img src="https://jules.google/docs/_astro/changelog-019.C2qW8uJn_Z3euJL.webp" alt="image upload" width="1200" height="675" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Ahoy, mateys! To celebrate International Talk Like a Pirate Day, we’ve given Jules a temporary map to the treasure.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jules Speaks Pirate: You’ll find your AI agent’s responses are a bit more… swashbuckling… for today only.</p>
</li>

<p>You can now upload images when creating a task in Jules. Use this to show frontend bugs, design inspiration, UI mocks, or any visual context you want Jules to consider while generating code.</p>
<p>For now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only JPEG and PNG formats are supported.</li>
<li>You can uplaod as many images as you want, as long as the total size is under 5MB.</li>
<li>Image upload is only supported at task creation (we’re working on enabling it for follow-up prompts soon).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If your task involves using assets (e.g. logos) directly in code, those must still be committed to your GitHub repo.</p>

<p>To improve the code review experience, we’ve introduced a new stacked layout for the diff viewer. This change displays diffs for multiple files vertically on a single screen. The stacked view makes it easier to see related changes across your codebase at a glance, providing better context and speeding up your review process.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The diff viewer now stacks file changes vertically by default</li>
<li>You can also toggle back to the previous tabbed diff viewer</li>
</ul> </article><article> <h2 id="improved-jules-critic"> Improved Jules Critic </h2> <b id="tue-sep-02-2025-190000-gmt-0500-central-daylight-time"> September 3, 2025 </b> <p><img src="https://jules.google/docs/_astro/changelog-016.DcExNlSl_ZDHzjl.webp" alt="Improved Critic" width="1200" height="675" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>We’ve shipped significant improvements to the Jules critic agent, making its feedback more insightful and reliable. To increase transparency and give you more insight into its evaluation process, you can now see the critic’s real-time analysis as it works.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The critic’s thought process is now visible in the UI, showing its step-by-step evaluation of the code in real-time.</li>
<li>The critic’s now incorporates more contextual information when making decisions, leading to more accurate and relevant feedback on potential bugs and logic flaws.</li>

<ul>
<li>Instant Visual Feedback: When Jules generates images (like charts, diagrams, or web UI screenshots), you’ll see the actual image in the diff, not just its code representation.</li>
<li>Streamlined Workflow: No need to switch between tools or download files to see the results. Jules keeps everything in one place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try it out! Ask Jules to render an output, like a graph based on data, and commit it to your repository. You’ll be able to see the generated image seamlessly within your diff viewer.</p> </article><article> <h2 id="export-at-any-time"> Export at any time </h2> <b id="thu-aug-14-2025-190000-gmt-0500-central-daylight-time"> August 15, 2025 </b> <p><img src="https://jules.google/docs/_astro/exportatanytime.CJ8dxdjQ_ZPOQjW.webp" alt="Export" width="1504" height="364" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>You’re now in full control of when your code gets to GitHub. No need to wait for a task to finish or ask Jules to do it for you. At any point during a task, just click the GitHub icon in the top right to publish the current work-in-progress as a new branch or open a pull request. This gives you more flexibility and control to review, test, or take over whenever you’re ready.</p> </article><article> <h2 id="increasing-the-vm-size-to-20gb"> Increasing the VM Size to 20GB </h2> <b id="thu-aug-14-2025-190000-gmt-0500-central-daylight-time"> August 15, 2025 </b> <p>We heard your feedback about running into disk space limits on larger projects. To address this, we’ve significantly increased the available disk space in the Jules VM to 20GB. This provides more room for large dependencies, build artifacts, and complex repositories, reducing disk-related failures so Jules can tackle bigger tasks. Happy Julesing!</p> </article><article> <h2 id="interactive-plan"> Interactive Plan </h2> <b id="thu-aug-07-2025-190000-gmt-0500-central-daylight-time"> August 8, 2025 </b> <p><img src="https://jules.google/docs/_astro/interactiveplan.BQJ_-8Fr_2dCy3W.webp" alt="Post Beta" width="1200" height="675" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>

<p>Jules can now proactively search the web for relevant content, documentation, or code snippets to help complete your tasks. This means Jules can get the information it needs, resulting in more accurate and successful task completion.</p>
<p>In Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jules can find the latest documentation for dependencies/libraries you’re using</li>
<li>Jules can proactively find examples or code snippets that can help inform its implementation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: web search works best when working on technical documentation. Queries like: “What is the latest news today?” are not supported.</p> </article><article> <h2 id="critic-agent"> Critic Agent </h2> <b id="thu-aug-07-2025-190000-gmt-0500-central-daylight-time"> August 8, 2025 </b> <p><img src="https://jules.google/docs/_astro/critic.M-N27lZA_ZXQtTP.webp" alt="Critic Agent" width="1200" height="675" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Great developers don’t just write code, they question it. And now, so does Jules. We’ve built the Jules critic agent to ensure that every line of code isn’t just functional, but robust, secure, and efficient. It acts as an internal peer reviewer, challenging every proposed change to elevate the quality of the final output.</p>
<p>Some high level notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Critic-augmented generation:</strong> The Jules critic is integrated directly into the generation process. Every proposed change undergoes adversarial review before completion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved code quality:</strong> The critic flags subtle bugs, missed edge cases, and inefficient code. Jules then uses this feedback to improve the patch in real-time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A new kind of review:</strong> The critic is not just another linter or test. It understands the intent and context behind code, similar to a human peer reviewer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Built on research:</strong> This feature draws on research into multi-step, tool interactive critiquing and actor-critic reinforcement learning, where an “actor” generates and a “critic” evaluates.</p>

<h2><a href="#abstract" role="doc-backlink">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This PEP introduces syntax for lazy imports as an explicit language feature:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>lazy</span> <span>import</span><span> </span><span>json</span>
<span>lazy</span> <span>from</span><span> </span><span>json</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>dumps</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Lazy imports defer the loading and execution of a module until the first time
the imported name is used, in contrast to ‘normal’ imports, which eagerly load
and execute a module at the point of the import statement.</p>
<p>By allowing developers to mark individual imports as lazy with explicit
syntax, Python programs can reduce startup time, memory usage, and unnecessary
work. This is particularly beneficial for command-line tools, test suites, and
applications with large dependency graphs.</p>
<p>This proposal preserves full backwards compatibility: normal import statements
remain unchanged, and lazy imports are enabled only where explicitly
requested.</p>
</section>
<section id="motivation">
<h2><a href="#motivation" role="doc-backlink">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>The dominant convention in Python code is to place all imports at the module
level, typically at the beginning of the file. This avoids repetition, makes
import dependencies clear and minimizes runtime overhead by only evaluating an
import statement once per module.</p>
<p>A major drawback with this approach is that importing the first module for an
execution of Python (the “main” module) often triggers an immediate cascade of
imports, and optimistically loads many dependencies that may never be used.
The effect is especially costly for command-line tools with multiple
subcommands, where even running the command with <code><span>--help</span></code> can load dozens of
unnecessary modules and take several seconds. This basic example demonstrates
what must be loaded just to get helpful feedback to the user on how to run the
program at all. Inefficiently, the user incurs this overhead again when they
figure out the command they want and invoke the program “for real.”</p>
<p>A somewhat common way to delay imports is to move the imports into functions
(inline imports), but this practice requires more work to implement and
maintain, and can be subverted by a single inadvertent top-level import.
Additionally, it obfuscates the full set of dependencies for a module.
Analysis of the Python standard library shows that approximately 17% of all
imports outside tests (nearly 3500 total imports across 730 files) are already
placed inside functions or methods specifically to defer their execution. This
demonstrates that developers are already manually implementing lazy imports in
performance-sensitive code, but doing so requires scattering imports
throughout the codebase and makes the full dependency graph harder to
understand at a glance.</p>
<p>The standard library provides the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.util.LazyLoader" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>LazyLoader</span></code></a> class to
solve some of these inefficiency problems. It permits imports at the module
level to work <em>mostly</em> like inline imports do. Many scientific Python
libraries have adopted a similar pattern, formalized in
<a href="https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0001/">SPEC 1</a>.
There’s also the third-party <a href="https://pypi.org/project/lazy_loader/">lazy_loader</a> package, yet another
implementation of lazy imports. Imports used solely for static type checking
are another source of potentially unneeded imports, and there are similarly
disparate approaches to minimizing the overhead. The various approaches used
here to defer or remove eager imports do not cover all potential use-cases for
a general lazy import mechanism. There is no clear standard, and there are
several drawbacks including runtime overhead in unexpected places, or worse
runtime introspection.</p>
<p>This proposal introduces syntax for lazy imports with a design that is local,
explicit, controlled, and granular. Each of these qualities is essential to
making the feature predictable and safe to use in practice.</p>
<p>The behavior is <strong>local</strong>: laziness applies only to the specific import marked
with the <code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword, and it does not cascade recursively into other
imports. This ensures that developers can reason about the effect of laziness
by looking only at the line of code in front of them, without worrying about
whether imported modules will themselves behave differently. A <code><span>lazy</span> <span>import</span></code>
is an isolated decision each time it is used, not a global shift in semantics.</p>
<p>The semantics are <strong>explicit</strong>. When a name is imported lazily, the binding is
created in the importing module immediately, but the target module is not
loaded until the first time the name is accessed. After this point, the
binding is indistinguishable from one created by a normal import. This clarity
reduces surprises and makes the feature accessible to developers who may not
be deeply familiar with Python’s import machinery.</p>
<p>Lazy imports are <strong>controlled</strong>, in the sense that deferred loading is only
triggered by the importing code itself. In the general case, a library will
only experience lazy imports if its own authors choose to mark them as such.
This avoids shifting responsibility onto downstream users and prevents
accidental surprises in library behavior. Since library authors typically
manage their own import subgraphs, they retain predictable control over when
and how laziness is applied.</p>
<p>The mechanism is also <strong>granular</strong>. It is introduced through explicit syntax
on individual imports, rather than a global flag or implicit setting. This
allows developers to adopt it incrementally, starting with the most
performance-sensitive areas of a codebase. As this feature is introduced to
the community, we want to make the experience of onboarding optional,
progressive, and adaptable to the needs of each project.</p>
<p>Lazy imports provide several concrete advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command-line tools are often invoked directly by a user, so latency – in
particular startup latency – is quite noticeable. These programs are also
typically short-lived processes (contrasted with, e.g., a web server). With
lazy imports, only the code paths actually reached will import a module.
This can reduce startup time by 50-70% in practice, providing a significant
improvement to a common user experience and improving Python’s
competitiveness in domains where fast startup matters most.</li>
<li>Type annotations frequently require imports that are never used at runtime.
The common workaround is to wrap them in <code><span>if</span> <span>TYPE_CHECKING:</span></code> blocks
<a href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a>. With lazy imports, annotation-only imports impose no runtime
penalty, eliminating the need for such guards and making annotated codebases
cleaner.</li>
<li>Large applications often import thousands of modules, and each module
creates function and type objects, incurring memory costs. In long-lived
processes, this noticeably raises baseline memory usage. Lazy imports defer
these costs until a module is needed, keeping unused subsystems unloaded.

<h2><a href="#rationale" role="doc-backlink">Rationale</a></h2>
<p>The design of this proposal is centered on clarity, predictability, and ease
of adoption. Each decision was made to ensure that lazy imports provide
tangible benefits without introducing unnecessary complexity into the language
or its runtime.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that while this PEP outlines one specific approach, we
list alternate implementation strategies for some of the core aspects and
semantics of the proposal. If the community expresses a strong preference for
a different technical path that still preserves the same core semantics or
there is fundamental disagreement over the specific option, we have included
the brainstorming we have already completed in preparation for this proposal
as reference.</p>
<p>The choice to introduce a new <code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword reflects the need for explicit
syntax. Import behavior is too fundamental to be left implicit or hidden
behind global flags or environment variables. By marking laziness directly at
the import site, the intent is immediately visible to both readers and tools.
This avoids surprises, reduces the cognitive burden of reasoning about
imports, and keeps lazy import semantics in line with Python’s tradition of
explicitness.</p>
<p>Another important decision is to represent lazy imports with proxy objects in
the module’s namespace, rather than by modifying dictionary lookup. Earlier
approaches experimented with embedding laziness into dictionaries, but this
blurred abstractions and risked affecting unrelated parts of the runtime. The
dictionary is a fundamental data structure in Python – literally every object
is built on top of dicts – and adding hooks to dictionaries would prevent
critical optimizations and complicate the entire runtime. The proxy approach
is simpler: it behaves like a placeholder until first use, at which point it
resolves the import and rebinds the name. From then on, the binding is
indistinguishable from a normal import. This makes the mechanism easy to
explain and keeps the rest of the interpreter unchanged.</p>
<p>Compatibility for library authors was also a key concern. Many maintainers
need a migration path that allows them to support both new and old versions of
Python at once. For this reason, the proposal includes the
<code><span>__lazy_modules__</span></code> global as a transitional mechanism. A module can
declare which imports should be treated as lazy (by listing the module names
as strings), and on Python 3.15 or later those imports will become lazy
automatically, as if they were imported with the <code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword. On earlier
versions the declaration is ignored, leaving imports eager. This gives authors
a practical bridge until they can rely on the keyword as the canonical syntax.</p>
<p>Finally, the feature is designed to be adopted incrementally. Nothing changes
unless a developer explicitly opts in, and adoption can begin with just a few
imports in performance-sensitive areas. This mirrors the experience of gradual
typing in Python: a mechanism that can be introduced progressively, without
forcing projects to commit globally from day one. Notably, the adoption can
also be done from the “outside in”, permitting CLI authors to introduce lazy
imports and speed up user-facing tools, without requiring changes to every
library the tool might use.</p>
<section id="other-design-decisions">
<h3><a href="#other-design-decisions" role="doc-backlink">Other design decisions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The scope of laziness is deliberately local and non-recursive. A lazy import
only affects the specific statement where it appears; it does not cascade
into other modules or submodules. This choice is crucial for predictability.
When developers read code, they can reason about import behavior line by
line, without worrying about hidden laziness deeper in the dependency graph.
The result is a feature that is powerful but still easy to understand in
context.</li>
<li>In addition, it is useful to provide a mechanism to activate or deactivate
lazy imports at a global level. While the primary design centers on explicit
syntax, there are scenarios – such as large applications, testing
environments, or frameworks – where enabling laziness consistently across
many modules provides the most benefit. A global switch makes it easy to
experiment with or enforce consistent behavior, while still working in
combination with the filtering API to respect exclusions or tool-specific
configuration. This ensures that global adoption can be practical without
reducing flexibility or control.</li>

<p>A new soft keyword <code><span>lazy</span></code> is added. A soft keyword is a context-sensitive
keyword that only has special meaning in specific grammatical contexts;
elsewhere it can be used as a regular identifier (e.g., as a variable name).
The <code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword only has special meaning when it appears before import
statements:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>import_name:
    | 'lazy'? 'import' dotted_as_names

import_from:

</pre></div>
<section id="syntax-restrictions">
<h4><a href="#syntax-restrictions" role="doc-backlink">Syntax restrictions</a></h4>
<p>The soft keyword is only allowed at the global (module) level, <strong>not</strong> inside
functions, class bodies, with <code><span>try</span></code>/<code><span>with</span></code> blocks, or <code><span>import</span> <span>*</span></code>. Import
statements that use the soft keyword are <em>potentially lazy</em>. Imports that
can’t be lazy are unaffected by the global lazy imports flag, and instead are
always eager.</p>

<section id="semantics">
<h3><a href="#semantics" role="doc-backlink">Semantics</a></h3>
<p>When the <code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword is used, the import becomes <em>potentially lazy</em>.
Unless lazy imports are disabled or suppressed (see below), the module is not
loaded immediately at the import statement; instead, a lazy proxy object is
created and bound to the name. The actual module is loaded on first use of
that name.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>sys</span>

<span>lazy</span> <span>import</span><span> </span><span>json</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'json'</span> <span>in</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>modules</span><span>)</span>  <span># False - module not loaded yet</span>

<span># First use triggers loading</span>
<span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>json</span><span>.</span><span>dumps</span><span>({</span><span>"hello"</span><span>:</span> <span>"world"</span><span>})</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'json'</span> <span>in</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>modules</span><span>)</span>  <span># True - now loaded</span>
</pre></div>
<p>A module may contain a <code><span>__lazy_modules__</span></code> attribute, which is a
sequence of fully qualified module names (strings) to make <em>potentially lazy</em>
(as if the <code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword was used). This attribute is checked on each
<code><span>import</span></code> statement to determine whether the import should be made
<em>potentially lazy</em>. When a module is made lazy this way, from-imports using
that module are also lazy, but not necessarily imports of sub-modules.</p>
<p>The normal (non-lazy) import statement will check the global lazy imports
flag. If it is “enabled”, all imports are <em>potentially lazy</em> (except for
imports that can’t be lazy, as mentioned above.)</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>__lazy_modules__</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"json"</span><span>]</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>json</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'json'</span> <span>in</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>modules</span><span>)</span>  <span># False</span>
<span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>json</span><span>.</span><span>dumps</span><span>({</span><span>"hello"</span><span>:</span> <span>"world"</span><span>})</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'json'</span> <span>in</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>modules</span><span>)</span>  <span># True</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If the global lazy imports flag is set to “disabled”, no <em>potentially lazy</em>
import is ever imported lazily, and the behavior is equivalent to a regular
import statement: the import is <em>eager</em> (as if the lazy keyword was not used).</p>
<p>For a <em>potentially lazy</em> import, the lazy imports filter (if set) is called
with the name of the module doing the import, the name of the module being
imported, and (if applicable) the fromlist. If the lazy import filter returns
<code><span>True</span></code>, the <em>potentially lazy</em> import becomes a lazy import. Otherwise, the
import is <em>not</em> lazy, and the normal (eager) import continues.</p>

<section id="lazy-import-mechanism">
<h3><a href="#lazy-import-mechanism" role="doc-backlink">Lazy import mechanism</a></h3>
<p>When an import is lazy, <code><span>__lazy_import__</span></code> is called instead of
<code><span>__import__</span></code>. <code><span>__lazy_import__</span></code> has the same function signature as
<code><span>__import__</span></code>. It adds the module name to <code><span>sys.lazy_modules</span></code>, a set of
fully-qualified module names which have been lazily imported at some point
(primarily for diagnostics and introspection), and returns a “lazy module
object.”</p>
<p>The implementation of <code><span>from</span> <span>...</span> <span>import</span></code> (the <code><span>IMPORT_FROM</span></code> bytecode
implementation) checks if the module it’s fetching from is a lazy module
object, and if so, returns a lazy object for each name instead.</p>
<p>The end result of this process is that lazy imports (regardless of how they
are enabled) result in lazy objects being assigned to global variables.</p>
<p>Lazy module objects do not appear in <code><span>sys.modules</span></code>, they’re just listed in
the <code><span>sys.lazy_modules</span></code> set. Under normal operation lazy objects should only
end up stored in global variables, and the common ways to access those
variables (regular variable access, module attributes) will resolve lazy
imports (“reify”) and replace them when they’re accessed.</p>
<p>It is still possible to expose lazy objects through other means, like
debuggers. This is not considered a problem.</p>
</section>
<section id="reification">
<h3><a href="#reification" role="doc-backlink">Reification</a></h3>
<p>When a lazy object is first used, it needs to be reified. This means resolving
the import at that point in the program and replacing the lazy object with the
concrete one. Reification imports the module in the same way as it would have
been if it had been imported eagerly, barring intervening changes to the
import system (e.g. to <code><span>sys.path</span></code>, <code><span>sys.meta_path</span></code>, <code><span>sys.path_hooks</span></code> or
<code><span>__import__</span></code>).</p>
<p>Reification still calls <code><span>__import__</span></code> to resolve the import. When the module
is first reified, it’s removed from <code><span>sys.lazy_modules</span></code> (even if there are
still other unreified lazy references to it). When a package is reified and
submodules in the package were also previously lazily imported, those
submodules are <em>not</em> automatically reified but they <em>are</em> added to the reified
package’s globals (unless the package already assigned something else to the
name of the submodule).</p>
<p>If reification fails (e.g., due to an <code><span>ImportError</span></code>), the exception is
enhanced with chaining to show both where the lazy import was defined and
where it was first accessed (even though it propagates from the code that
triggered reification). This provides clear debugging information:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># app.py - has a typo in the import</span>
<span>lazy</span> <span>from</span><span> </span><span>json</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>dumsp</span>  <span># Typo: should be 'dumps'</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"App started successfully"</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Processing data..."</span><span>)</span>

<span># Error occurs here on first use</span>
<span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>dumsp</span><span>({</span><span>"key"</span><span>:</span> <span>"value"</span><span>})</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The traceback shows both locations:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>App started successfully</span>
<span>Processing data...</span>
<span>Traceback (most recent call last):</span>
  File <span>"app.py"</span>, line <span>2</span>, in <span>&lt;module&gt;</span>
<span>    </span><span>lazy</span> <span>from</span><span> </span><span>json</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>dumsp</span>
<span>ImportError</span>: <span>deferred import of 'json.dumsp' raised an exception during resolution</span>

<span>The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:</span>

<span>Traceback (most recent call last):</span>
  File <span>"app.py"</span>, line <span>8</span>, in <span>&lt;module&gt;</span>
<span>    </span><span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>dumsp</span><span>({</span><span>"key"</span><span>:</span> <span>"value"</span><span>})</span>
<span>             </span><span>^^^^^</span>
<span>ImportError</span>: <span>cannot import name 'dumsp' from 'json'. Did you mean: 'dump'?</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This exception chaining clearly shows: (1) where the lazy import was defined,
(2) that it was deferred, and (3) where the actual access happened that
triggered the error.</p>
<p>Reification does <strong>not</strong> automatically occur when a module that was previously
lazily imported is subsequently eagerly imported. Reification does <strong>not</strong>
immediately resolve all lazy objects (e.g. <code><span>lazy</span> <span>from</span></code> statements) that
referenced the module. It <strong>only</strong> resolves the lazy object being accessed.</p>
<p>Accessing a lazy object (from a global variable or a module attribute) reifies
the object. Accessing a module’s <code><span>__dict__</span></code> reifies <strong>all</strong> lazy objects in
that module. Operations that indirectly access <code><span>__dict__</span></code> (such as
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>dir()</span></code></a>) also trigger this behavior.</p>
<p>Example using <code><span>__dict__</span></code> from external code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># my_module.py</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>sys</span>
<span>lazy</span> <span>import</span><span> </span><span>json</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'json'</span> <span>in</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>modules</span><span>)</span>  <span># False - still lazy</span>

<span># main.py</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>sys</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>my_module</span>

<span># Accessing __dict__ from external code DOES reify all lazy imports</span>
<span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_module</span><span>.</span><span>__dict__</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'json'</span> <span>in</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>modules</span><span>)</span>  <span># True - reified by __dict__ access</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>[</span><span>'json'</span><span>]))</span>  <span># &lt;class 'module'&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>However, calling <code><span>globals()</span></code> does <strong>not</strong> trigger reification – it returns
the module’s dictionary, and accessing lazy objects through that dictionary
still returns lazy proxy objects that need to be manually reified upon use. A
lazy object can be resolved explicitly by calling the <code><span>get</span></code> method. Other,
more indirect ways of accessing arbitrary globals (e.g. inspecting
<code><span>frame.f_globals</span></code>) also do <strong>not</strong> reify all the objects.</p>
<p>Example using <code><span>globals()</span></code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>sys</span>
<span>lazy</span> <span>import</span><span> </span><span>json</span>

<h3><a href="#bytecode-and-adaptive-specialization" role="doc-backlink">Bytecode and adaptive specialization</a></h3>
<p>Lazy imports are implemented through modifications to four bytecode
instructions: <code><span>IMPORT_NAME</span></code>, <code><span>IMPORT_FROM</span></code>, <code><span>LOAD_GLOBAL</span></code>, and
<code><span>LOAD_NAME</span></code>.</p>
<p>The <code><span>lazy</span></code> syntax sets a flag in the <code><span>IMPORT_NAME</span></code> instruction’s oparg
(<code><span>oparg</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0x01</span></code>). The interpreter checks this flag and calls
<code><span>_PyEval_LazyImportName()</span></code> instead of <code><span>_PyEval_ImportName()</span></code>, creating a
lazy import object rather than executing the import immediately. The
<code><span>IMPORT_FROM</span></code> instruction checks whether its source is a lazy import
(<code><span>PyLazyImport_CheckExact()</span></code>) and creates a lazy object for the attribute
rather than accessing it immediately.</p>
<p>When a lazy object is accessed, it must be reified. The <code><span>LOAD_GLOBAL</span></code>
instruction (used in function scopes) and <code><span>LOAD_NAME</span></code> instruction (used at
module and class level) both check whether the object being loaded is a lazy
import. If so, they call <code><span>_PyImport_LoadLazyImportTstate()</span></code> to perform the
actual import and store the module in <code><span>sys.modules</span></code>.</p>
<p>This check incurs a very small cost on each access. However, Python’s adaptive
interpreter can specialize <code><span>LOAD_GLOBAL</span></code> after observing that a lazy import
has been reified. After several executions, <code><span>LOAD_GLOBAL</span></code> becomes
<code><span>LOAD_GLOBAL_MODULE</span></code>, which accesses the module dictionary directly without
checking for lazy imports.</p>

<h3><a href="#lazy-imports-filter" role="doc-backlink">Lazy imports filter</a></h3>
<p>This PEP adds two new functions to the <code><span>sys</span></code> module to manage the lazy
imports filter:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><span>sys.set_lazy_imports_filter(func)</span></code> - Sets the filter function. The
<code><span>func</span></code> parameter must have the signature: <code><span>func(importer:</span> <span>str,</span> <span>name:</span> <span>str,</span>
<span>fromlist:</span> <span>tuple[str,</span> <span>...]</span> <span>|</span> <span>None)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span></code></li>
<li><code><span>sys.get_lazy_imports_filter()</span></code> - Returns the currently installed filter
function, or <code><span>None</span></code> if no filter is set.</li>
</ul>
<p>The filter function is called for every potentially lazy import, and must
return <code><span>True</span></code> if the import should be lazy. This allows for fine-grained
control over which imports should be lazy, useful for excluding modules with
known side-effect dependencies or registration patterns.</p>
<p>The filter mechanism serves as a foundation that tools, debuggers, linters,
and other ecosystem utilities can leverage to provide better lazy import
experiences. For example, static analysis tools could detect modules with side
effects and automatically configure appropriate filters. <strong>In the future</strong>
(out of scope for this PEP), this foundation may enable better ways to
declaratively specify which modules are safe for lazy importing, such as
package metadata, type stubs with lazy-safety annotations, or configuration
files. The current filter API is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate
such future enhancements without requiring changes to the core language
specification.</p>

<p>The global lazy imports flag can be controlled through:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code><span>-X</span> <span>lazy_imports=&lt;mode&gt;</span></code> command-line option</li>
<li>The <code><span>PYTHON_LAZY_IMPORTS=&lt;mode&gt;</span></code> environment variable</li>
<li>The <code><span>sys.set_lazy_imports(mode)</span></code> function (primarily for testing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Where <code><span>&lt;mode&gt;</span></code> can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><span>"default"</span></code> (or unset): Only explicitly marked lazy imports are lazy</li>
<li><code><span>"enabled"</span></code>: All module-level imports (except in <code><span>try</span></code>  or <code><span>with</span></code>
blocks and <code><span>import</span> <span>*</span></code>) become <em>potentially lazy</em></li>
<li><code><span>"disabled"</span></code>: No imports are lazy, even those explicitly marked with
<code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword</li>
</ul>
<p>When the global flag is set to <code><span>"enabled"</span></code>, all imports at the global level
of all modules are <em>potentially lazy</em> <strong>except</strong> for those inside a <code><span>try</span></code> or
<code><span>with</span></code> block or any wild card (<code><span>from</span> <span>...</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span></code>) import.</p>
<p>If the global lazy imports flag is set to <code><span>"disabled"</span></code>, no <em>potentially
lazy</em> import is ever imported lazily, the import filter is never called, and
the behavior is equivalent to a regular <code><span>import</span></code> statement: the import is
<em>eager</em> (as if the lazy keyword was not used).</p>

<p>These changes are limited to bindings explicitly made lazy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error timing.</strong> Exceptions that would have occurred during an eager import
(for example <code><span>ImportError</span></code> or <code><span>AttributeError</span></code> for a missing member) now
occur at the first <em>use</em> of the lazy name.<div><pre><span></span><span># With eager import - error at import statement</span>

</li>
<li><strong>Side-effect timing.</strong> Import-time side effects in lazily imported modules
occur at first use of the binding, not at module import time.</li>
<li><strong>Import order.</strong> Because modules are imported on first use, the order in
which modules are imported may differ from how they appear in code.</li>
<li><strong>Presence in ``sys.modules``.</strong> A lazily imported module does not appear in
<code><span>sys.modules</span></code> until first use. After reification, it must appear in
<code><span>sys.modules</span></code>. If some other code eagerly imports the same module before
first use, the lazy binding resolves to that existing (lazy) module object
when it is first used.</li>
<li><strong>Proxy visibility.</strong> Before first use, the bound name refers to a lazy
proxy. Indirect introspection that touches the value may observe a proxy
lazy object representation. After first use, the name is rebound to the real
object and becomes indistinguishable from an eager import.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="thread-safety-and-reification">
<h3><a href="#thread-safety-and-reification" role="doc-backlink">Thread-safety and reification</a></h3>
<p>First use of a lazy binding follows the existing import-lock discipline.
Exactly one thread performs the import and <strong>atomically rebinds</strong> the
importing module’s global to the resolved object. Concurrent readers
thereafter observe the real object.</p>
<p>Lazy imports are thread-safe and have no special considerations for
free-threading. A module that would normally be imported in the main thread
may be imported in a different thread if that thread triggers the first access
to the lazy import. This is not a problem: the import lock ensures thread
safety regardless of which thread performs the import.</p>
<p>Subinterpreters are supported. Each subinterpreter maintains its own
<code><span>sys.lazy_modules</span></code> and import state, so lazy imports in one subinterpreter
do not affect others.</p>

<p>Type checkers and static analyzers may treat <code><span>lazy</span></code> imports as ordinary

display lazy proxies before first use and the real objects thereafter.</p>

<p>The new <code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword will be documented as part of the language standard.</p>
<p>As this feature is opt-in, new Python users should be able to continue using
the language as they are used to. For experienced developers, we expect them
to leverage lazy imports for the variety of benefits listed above (decreased
latency, decreased memory usage, etc) on a case-by-case basis. Developers
interested in the performance of their Python binary will likely leverage
profiling to understand the import time overhead in their codebase and mark
the necessary imports as <code><span>lazy</span></code>. In addition, developers can mark imports
that will only be used for type annotations as <code><span>lazy</span></code>.</p>
<p>Below is guidance on how to best take advantage of lazy imports and how to
avoid incompatibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>When adopting lazy imports, users should be aware that eliding an import
until it is used will result in side effects not being executed. In turn,
users should be wary of modules that rely on import time side effects.
Perhaps the most common reliance on import side effects is the registry
pattern, where population of some external registry happens implicitly
during the importing of modules, often via decorators but sometimes
implemented via metaclasses or <code><span>__init_subclass__</span></code>. Instead, registries of
objects should be constructed via explicit discovery processes (e.g. a
well-known function to call).<div><pre><span></span><span># Problematic: Plugin registers itself on import</span>
<span># my_plugin.py</span>
<span>from</span><span> </span><span>plugin_registry</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>register_plugin</span>

<span>@register_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>"MyPlugin"</span><span>)</span>
<span>class</span><span> </span><span>MyPlugin</span><span>:</span>
    <span>pass</span>

<span># In main code:</span>
<span>lazy</span> <span>import</span><span> </span><span>my_plugin</span>
<span># Plugin NOT registered yet - module not loaded!</span>

<span># Better: Explicit discovery</span>
<span># plugin_registry.py</span>
<span>def</span><span> </span><span>discover_plugins</span><span>():</span>
    <span>from</span><span> </span><span>my_plugin</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>MyPlugin</span>
    <span>register_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>MyPlugin</span><span>)</span>

<span># In main code:</span>
<span>plugin_registry</span><span>.</span><span>discover_plugins</span><span>()</span>  <span># Explicit loading</span>
</pre></div>
</li>
<li>Always import needed submodules explicitly. It is not enough to rely on a
different import to ensure a module has its submodules as attributes.
Plainly, unless there is an explicit <code><span>from</span> <span>.</span> <span>import</span> <span>bar</span></code> in
<code><span>foo/__init__.py</span></code>, always use <code><span>import</span> <span>foo.bar;</span> <span>foo.bar.Baz</span></code>, not
<code><span>import</span> <span>foo;</span> <span>foo.bar.Baz</span></code>. The latter only works (unreliably) because the
attribute <code><span>foo.bar</span></code> is added as a side effect of <code><span>foo.bar</span></code> being
imported somewhere else.</li>
<li>Users who are moving imports into functions to improve startup time, should
instead consider keeping them where they are but adding the <code><span>lazy</span></code>
keyword. This allows them to keep dependencies clear and avoid the overhead
of repeatedly re-resolving the import but will still speed up the program.<div><pre><span></span><span># Before: Inline import (repeated overhead)</span>

<section id="faq">
<h2><a href="#faq" role="doc-backlink">FAQ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Q: How does this differ from the rejected PEP 690?</strong></p>
<p>A: PEP 810 takes an explicit, opt-in approach instead of <a href="https://pep-previews--4622.org.readthedocs.build/pep-0690/" title="PEP 690 – Lazy Imports">PEP 690</a>’s implicit
global approach. The key differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explicit syntax</strong>: <code><span>lazy</span> <span>import</span> <span>foo</span></code> clearly marks which imports are
lazy.</li>
<li><strong>Local scope</strong>: Laziness only affects the specific import statement, not
cascading to dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Simpler implementation</strong>: Uses proxy objects instead of modifying core
dictionary behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: What happens when lazy imports encounter errors?</strong></p>
<p>A: Import errors (<code><span>ImportError</span></code>, <code><span>ModuleNotFoundError</span></code>, syntax errors) are
deferred until first use of the lazy name. This is similar to moving an import
into a function. The error will occur with a clear traceback pointing to the
first access of the lazy object.</p>
<p>The implementation provides enhanced error reporting through exception
chaining. When a lazy import fails during reification, the original exception
is preserved and chained, showing both where the import was defined and where
it was first used:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Traceback (most recent call last):</span>
  File <span>"test.py"</span>, line <span>1</span>, in <span>&lt;module&gt;</span>
<span>    </span><span>lazy</span> <span>import</span><span> </span><span>broken_module</span>
<span>ImportError</span>: <span>deferred import of 'broken_module' raised an exception during resolution</span>

<span>The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:</span>

<span>Traceback (most recent call last):</span>
  File <span>"test.py"</span>, line <span>3</span>, in <span>&lt;module&gt;</span>
<span>    </span><span>broken_module</span><span>.</span><span>foo</span><span>()</span>
<span>    </span><span>^^^^^^^^^^^^^</span>
  File <span>"broken_module.py"</span>, line <span>2</span>, in <span>&lt;module&gt;</span>
<span>    </span><span>1</span><span>/</span><span>0</span>
<span>ZeroDivisionError</span>: <span>division by zero</span>
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Q: How do lazy imports affect modules with import-time side effects?</strong></p>
<p>A: Side effects are deferred until first use. This is generally desirable for
performance, but may require code changes for modules that rely on import-time
registration patterns. We recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use explicit initialization functions instead of import-time side effects</li>
<li>Call initialization functions explicitly when needed</li>
<li>Avoid relying on import order for side effects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: Can I use lazy imports with</strong> <code><span>from</span> <span>...</span> <span>import</span> <span>...</span></code> <strong>statements?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, as long as you don’t use <code><span>from</span> <span>...</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span></code>. Both <code><span>lazy</span> <span>import</span>
<span>foo</span></code> and <code><span>lazy</span> <span>from</span> <span>foo</span> <span>import</span> <span>bar</span></code> are supported. The <code><span>bar</span></code> name will be
bound to a lazy object that resolves to <code><span>foo.bar</span></code> on first use.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does</strong> <code><span>lazy</span> <span>from</span> <span>module</span> <span>import</span> <span>Class</span></code> <strong>load the entire module or just
the class?</strong></p>
<p>A: It loads the <strong>entire module</strong>, not just the class. This is because
Python’s import system always executes the complete module file – there’s no
mechanism to execute only part of a <code><span>.py</span></code> file. When you first access
<code><span>Class</span></code>, Python:</p>
<ol>
<li>Loads and executes the entire <code><span>module.py</span></code> file</li>
<li>Extracts the <code><span>Class</span></code> attribute from the resulting module object</li>
<li>Binds <code><span>Class</span></code> to the name in your namespace</li>
</ol>
<p>This is identical to eager <code><span>from</span> <span>module</span> <span>import</span> <span>Class</span></code> behavior. The only
difference with lazy imports is that steps 1-3 happen on first use instead of
at the import statement.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># heavy_module.py</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Loading heavy_module"</span><span>)</span>  <span># This ALWAYS runs when module loads</span>

<span>class</span><span> </span><span>MyClass</span><span>:</span>
    <span>pass</span>

<span>class</span><span> </span><span>UnusedClass</span><span>:</span>
    <span>pass</span>  <span># Also gets defined, even though we don't import it</span>

                                 <span># (and UnusedClass gets defined too)</span>
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Key point</strong>: Lazy imports defer <em>when</em> a module loads, not <em>what</em> gets
loaded. You cannot selectively load only parts of a module – Python’s import
system doesn’t support partial module execution.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What about type annotations and</strong> <code><span>TYPE_CHECKING</span></code> <strong>imports?</strong></p>
<p>A: Lazy imports eliminate the common need for <code><span>TYPE_CHECKING</span></code> guards. You
can write:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>lazy</span> <span>from</span><span> </span><span>collections.abc</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>Sequence</span><span>,</span> <span>Mapping</span>  <span># No runtime cost</span>

<span>def</span><span> </span><span>process</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>:</span> <span>Sequence</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Mapping</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Instead of:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>typing</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>TYPE_CHECKING</span>
<span>if</span> <span>TYPE_CHECKING</span><span>:</span>
    <span>from</span><span> </span><span>collections.abc</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>Sequence</span><span>,</span> <span>Mapping</span>

<span>def</span><span> </span><span>process</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>:</span> <span>Sequence</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Mapping</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Q: What’s the performance overhead of lazy imports?</strong></p>
<p>A: The overhead is minimal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero overhead after first use thanks to the adaptive interpreter optimizing
the slow path away.</li>
<li>Small one-time cost to create the proxy object.</li>
<li>Reification (first use) has the same cost as a regular import.</li>
<li>No ongoing performance penalty unlike <code><span>importlib.util.LazyLoader</span></code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Benchmarking with the <a href="https://github.com/facebookexperimental/free-threading-benchmarking/blob/main/results/bm-20250922-3.15.0a0-27836e5/bm-20250922-vultr-x86_64-DinoV-lazy_imports-3.15.0a0-27836e5-vs-base.svg">pyperformance suite</a> shows the implementation is
performance neutral when lazy imports are not used.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I mix lazy and eager imports of the same module?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes. If module <code><span>foo</span></code> is imported both lazily and eagerly in the same
program, the eager import takes precedence and both bindings resolve to the
same module object.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I migrate existing code to use lazy imports?</strong></p>
<p>A: Migration is incremental:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify slow-loading modules using profiling tools.</li>
<li>Add <code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword to imports that aren’t needed immediately.</li>
<li>Test that side-effect timing changes don’t break functionality.</li>
<li>Use <code><span>__lazy_modules__</span></code> for compatibility with older Python versions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q: What about star imports</strong> (<code><span>from</span> <span>module</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span></code>)?</p>
<p>A: Wild card (star) imports cannot be lazy - they remain eager. This is
because the set of names being imported cannot be determined without loading
the module. Using the <code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword with star imports will be a syntax
error. If lazy imports are globally enabled, star imports will still be eager.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do lazy imports interact with import hooks and custom loaders?</strong></p>
<p>A: Import hooks and loaders work normally. When a lazy object is first used,
the standard import protocol runs, including any custom hooks or loaders that
were in place at reification time.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens in multi-threaded environments?</strong></p>
<p>A: Lazy import reification is thread-safe. Only one thread will perform the
actual import, and the binding is atomically updated. Other threads will see
either the lazy proxy or the final resolved object.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I force reification of a lazy import without using it?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, accessing a module’s <code><span>__dict__</span></code> will reify all lazy objects in that
module. Individual lazy objects can be resolved by calling their <code><span>get()</span></code>
method.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What’s the difference between</strong> <code><span>globals()</span></code> <strong>and</strong> <code><span>mod.__dict__</span></code> <strong>for lazy imports?</strong></p>
<p>A: Calling <code><span>globals()</span></code> returns the module’s dictionary without reifying lazy
imports – you’ll see lazy proxy objects when accessing them through the
returned dictionary. However, accessing <code><span>mod.__dict__</span></code> from external code
reifies all lazy imports in that module first. This design ensures:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># In your module:</span>
<span>lazy</span> <span>import</span><span> </span><span>json</span>

<span>g</span> <span>=</span> <span>globals</span><span>()</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>[</span><span>'json'</span><span>]))</span>  <span># &lt;class 'lazy_import'&gt; - your problem</span>

<span># From external code:</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>sys</span>
<span>mod</span> <span>=</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>modules</span><span>[</span><span>'your_module'</span><span>]</span>
<span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>mod</span><span>.</span><span>__dict__</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>[</span><span>'json'</span><span>]))</span>  <span># &lt;class 'module'&gt; - reified for external access</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This distinction means adding lazy imports and calling <code><span>globals()</span></code> is your
responsibility to manage, while external code accessing <code><span>mod.__dict__</span></code>
always sees fully loaded modules.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why not use</strong> <code><span>importlib.util.LazyLoader</span></code> <strong>instead?</strong></p>
<p>A: <code><span>LazyLoader</span></code> has significant limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires verbose setup code for each lazy import.</li>
<li>Has ongoing performance overhead on every attribute access.</li>
<li>Doesn’t work well with <code><span>from</span> <span>...</span> <span>import</span></code> statements.</li>
<li>Less clear and standard than dedicated syntax.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: Will this break tools like</strong> <code><span>isort</span></code> <strong>or</strong> <code><span>black</span></code>?</p>
<p>A: Tools will need updates to recognize the <code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword, but the changes
should be minimal since the import structure remains the same. The keyword
appears at the beginning, making it easy to parse.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I know if a library is compatible with lazy imports?</strong></p>
<p>A: Most libraries should work fine with lazy imports. Libraries that might
have issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those with essential import-time side effects (registration,
monkey-patching).</li>
<li>Those that expect specific import ordering.</li>
<li>Those that modify global state during import.</li>
</ul>
<p>When in doubt, test lazy imports with your specific use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if I globally enable lazy imports mode and a library doesn’t
work correctly?</strong></p>
<p>A: <em>Note: This is an advanced feature.</em> You can use the lazy imports filter to
exclude specific modules that are known to have problematic side effects:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>sys</span>

<span>def</span><span> </span><span>my_filter</span><span>(</span><span>importer</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>fromlist</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Don't lazily import modules known to have side effects</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>name</span> <span>in</span> <span>{</span><span>'problematic_module'</span><span>,</span> <span>'another_module'</span><span>}:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>  <span># Import eagerly</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>True</span>  <span># Allow lazy import</span>

<span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>set_lazy_imports_filter</span><span>(</span><span>my_filter</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The filter function receives the importer module name, the module being
imported, and the fromlist (if using <code><span>from</span> <span>...</span> <span>import</span></code>). Returning <code><span>False</span></code>
forces an eager import.</p>
<p>Alternatively, set the global mode to <code><span>"disabled"</span></code> via <code><span>-X</span>
<span>lazy_imports=disabled</span></code> to turn off all lazy imports for debugging.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I use lazy imports inside functions?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, the <code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword is only allowed at module level. For
function-level lazy loading, use traditional inline imports or move the import
to module level with <code><span>lazy</span></code>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What about forwards compatibility with older Python versions?</strong></p>
<p>A: Use the <code><span>__lazy_modules__</span></code> global for compatibility:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># Works on Python 3.15+ as lazy, eager on older versions</span>
<span>__lazy_modules__</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'expensive_module'</span><span>,</span> <span>'expensive_module_2'</span><span>]</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>expensive_module</span>
<span>from</span><span> </span><span>expensive_module_2</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>MyClass</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code><span>__lazy_modules__</span></code> attribute is a list of module name strings. When
an import statement is executed, Python checks if the module name being
imported appears in <code><span>__lazy_modules__</span></code>. If it does, the import is
treated as if it had the <code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword (becoming <em>potentially lazy</em>). On
Python versions before 3.15 that don’t support lazy imports, the
<code><span>__lazy_modules__</span></code> attribute is simply ignored and imports proceed
eagerly as normal.</p>
<p>This provides a migration path until you can rely on the <code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword. For
maximum predictability, it’s recommended to define <code><span>__lazy_modules__</span></code>
once, before any imports. But as it is checked on each import, it can be
modified between <code><span>import</span></code> statements.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do explicit lazy imports interact with PEP-649/PEP-749</strong></p>
<p>A: If an annotation is not stringified, it is an expression that is evaluated
at a later time. It will only be resolved if the annotation is accessed. In
the example below, the <code><span>fake_typing</span></code> module is only loaded when the user
inspects the <code><span>__annotations__</span></code> dictionary. The <code><span>fake_typing</span></code> module would
also be loaded if the user uses <code><span>annotationlib.get_annotations()</span></code> or
<code><span>getattr</span></code> to access the annotations.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>lazy</span> <span>from</span><span> </span><span>fake_typing</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>MyFakeType</span>
<span>def</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>MyFakeType</span><span>):</span>
  <span>pass</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>__annotations__</span><span>)</span>  <span># Triggers loading the fake_typing module</span>
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Q: How do lazy imports interact with</strong> <code><span>dir()</span></code>, <code><span>getattr()</span></code>, <strong>and
module introspection?</strong></p>
<p>A: Accessing lazy imports through normal attribute access or <code><span>getattr()</span></code>
will trigger reification. Calling <code><span>dir()</span></code> on a module will reify all lazy
imports in that module to ensure the directory listing is complete. This is
similar to accessing <code><span>mod.__dict__</span></code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>lazy</span> <span>import</span><span> </span><span>json</span>

<span># Before any access</span>
<span># json not in sys.modules</span>

<span># Any of these trigger reification:</span>
<span>dumps_func</span> <span>=</span> <span>json</span><span>.</span><span>dumps</span>
<span>dumps_func</span> <span>=</span> <span>getattr</span><span>(</span><span>json</span><span>,</span> <span>'dumps'</span><span>)</span>
<span>dir</span><span>(</span><span>json</span><span>)</span>
<span># Now json is in sys.modules</span>
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Q: Do lazy imports work with circular imports?</strong></p>
<p>A: Lazy imports don’t automatically solve circular import problems. If two
modules have a circular dependency, making the imports lazy might help <strong>only
if</strong> the circular reference isn’t accessed during module initialization.
However, if either module accesses the other during import time, you’ll still
get an error.</p>
<p><strong>Example that works</strong> (deferred access in functions):</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># user_model.py</span>
<span>lazy</span> <span>import</span><span> </span><span>post_model</span>

<span>class</span><span> </span><span>User</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span><span> </span><span>get_posts</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span># OK - post_model accessed inside function, not during import</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>post_model</span><span>.</span><span>Post</span><span>.</span><span>get_by_user</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>

<span># post_model.py</span>
<span>lazy</span> <span>import</span><span> </span><span>user_model</span>

<span>class</span><span> </span><span>Post</span><span>:</span>
    <span>@staticmethod</span>
    <span>def</span><span> </span><span>get_by_user</span><span>(</span><span>username</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>"Posts by </span><span>{</span><span>username</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This works because neither module accesses the other at module level – the
access happens later when <code><span>get_posts()</span></code> is called.</p>
<p><strong>Example that fails</strong> (access during import):</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># module_a.py</span>
<span>lazy</span> <span>import</span><span> </span><span>module_b</span>

<span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>module_b</span><span>.</span><span>get_value</span><span>()</span>  <span># Error! Accessing during import</span>

<span>def</span><span> </span><span>func</span><span>():</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>"A"</span>

<span># module_b.py</span>
<span>lazy</span> <span>import</span><span> </span><span>module_a</span>

<span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>module_a</span><span>.</span><span>func</span><span>()</span>  <span># Circular dependency error here</span>

<span>def</span><span> </span><span>get_value</span><span>():</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>"B"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This fails because <code><span>module_a</span></code> tries to access <code><span>module_b</span></code> at import time,
which then tries to access <code><span>module_a</span></code> before it’s fully initialized.</p>
<p>The best practice is still to avoid circular imports in your code design.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will lazy imports affect the performance of my hot paths?</strong></p>
<p>A: After first use, lazy imports have <strong>zero overhead</strong> thanks to the adaptive
interpreter. The interpreter specializes the bytecode (e.g., <code><span>LOAD_GLOBAL</span></code>
becomes <code><span>LOAD_GLOBAL_MODULE</span></code>) which eliminates the lazy check on subsequent
accesses. This means once a lazy import is reified, accessing it is just as
fast as a normal import.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>lazy</span> <span>import</span><span> </span><span>json</span>

<span>def</span><span> </span><span>use_json</span><span>():</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>json</span><span>.</span><span>dumps</span><span>({</span><span>"test"</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>})</span>

<span># First call triggers reification</span>
<span>use_json</span><span>()</span>

<span># After 2-3 calls, bytecode is specialized</span>
<span>use_json</span><span>()</span>
<span>use_json</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You can observe the specialization using <code><span>dis.dis(use_json,</span> <span>adaptive=True)</span></code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>=== Before specialization ===
LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (json)
LOAD_ATTR                2 (dumps)

=== After 3 calls (specialized) ===
LOAD_GLOBAL_MODULE       0 (json)
LOAD_ATTR_MODULE         2 (dumps)
</pre></div>
<p>The specialized <code><span>LOAD_GLOBAL_MODULE</span></code> and <code><span>LOAD_ATTR_MODULE</span></code> instructions
are optimized fast paths with no overhead for checking lazy imports.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What about</strong> <code><span>sys.modules</span></code>? <strong>When does a lazy import appear there?</strong></p>
<p>A: A lazily imported module does <strong>not</strong> appear in <code><span>sys.modules</span></code> until it’s
reified (first used). Once reified, it appears in <code><span>sys.modules</span></code> just like
any eager import.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>sys</span>
<span>lazy</span> <span>import</span><span> </span><span>json</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'json'</span> <span>in</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>modules</span><span>)</span>  <span># False</span>

<span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>json</span><span>.</span><span>dumps</span><span>({</span><span>"key"</span><span>:</span> <span>"value"</span><span>})</span>  <span># First use</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'json'</span> <span>in</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>modules</span><span>)</span>  <span># True</span>

<section id="alternate-implementation-ideas">
<h2><a href="#alternate-implementation-ideas" role="doc-backlink">Alternate Implementation Ideas</a></h2>
<p>Here are some alternative design decisions that were considered during the
development of this PEP. While the current proposal represents what we believe
to be the best balance of simplicity, performance, and maintainability, these
alternatives offer different trade-offs that may be valuable for implementers
to consider or for future refinements.</p>
<section id="leveraging-a-subclass-of-dict">
<h3><a href="#leveraging-a-subclass-of-dict" role="doc-backlink">Leveraging a subclass of dict</a></h3>
<p>Instead of updating the internal dict object to directly add the fields needed
to support lazy imports, we could create a subclass of the dict object to be
used specifically for Lazy Import enablement. This would still be a leaky
abstraction though - methods can be called directly such as
<code><span>dict.__getitem__</span></code> and it would impact the performance of globals lookup in
the interpreter.</p>
</section>
<section id="alternate-keyword-names">
<h3><a href="#alternate-keyword-names" role="doc-backlink">Alternate keyword names</a></h3>
<p>For this PEP, we decided to propose <code><span>lazy</span></code> for the explicit keyword as it
felt the most familar to those already focused on optimizing import overhead.
We also considered a variety of other options to support explicit lazy
imports. The most compelling alternates were <code><span>defer</span></code> and <code><span>delay</span></code>.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="rejected-ideas">
<h2><a href="#rejected-ideas" role="doc-backlink">Rejected Ideas</a></h2>
<section id="modification-of-the-dict-object">
<h3><a href="#modification-of-the-dict-object" role="doc-backlink">Modification of the dict object</a></h3>
<p>The initial PEP for lazy imports (PEP 690) relied heavily on the modification
of the internal dict object to support lazy imports. We recognize that this
data structure is highly tuned, heavily used across the codebase, and very
performance sensitive. Because of the importance of this data structure and
the desire to keep the implementation of lazy imports encapsulated from users
who may have no interest in the feature, we’ve decided to invest in an
alternate approach.</p>
<p>The dictionary is the foundational data structure in Python. Every object’s
attributes are stored in a dict, and dicts are used throughout the runtime for
namespaces, keyword arguments, and more. Adding any kind of hook or special
behavior to dicts to support lazy imports would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prevent critical interpreter optimizations including future JIT
compilation.</li>
<li>Add complexity to a data structure that must remain simple and fast.</li>
<li>Affect every part of Python, not just import behavior.</li>
<li>Violate separation of concerns – the hash table shouldn’t know about the
import system.</li>
</ol>
<p>Past decisions that violated this principle of keeping core abstractions clean
have caused significant pain in the CPython ecosystem, making optimization
difficult and introducing subtle bugs.</p>
</section>
<section id="placing-the-lazy-keyword-in-the-middle-of-from-imports">
<h3><a href="#placing-the-lazy-keyword-in-the-middle-of-from-imports" role="doc-backlink">Placing the <code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword in the middle of from imports</a></h3>
<p>While we found <code><span>from</span> <span>foo</span> <span>lazy</span> <span>import</span> <span>bar</span></code> to be a really intuitive placement
for the new explicit syntax, we quickly learned that placing the <code><span>lazy</span></code>
keyword here is already syntactically allowed in Python. This is because
<code><span>from</span> <span>.</span> <span>lazy</span> <span>import</span> <span>bar</span></code> is legal syntax (because whitespace does not
matter.)</p>
</section>
<section id="placing-the-lazy-keyword-at-the-end-of-import-statements">
<h3><a href="#placing-the-lazy-keyword-at-the-end-of-import-statements" role="doc-backlink">Placing the <code><span>lazy</span></code> keyword at the end of import statements</a></h3>
<p>We discussed appending lazy to the end of import statements like such <code><span>import</span>
<span>foo</span> <span>lazy</span></code> or <code><span>from</span> <span>foo</span> <span>import</span> <span>bar,</span> <span>baz</span> <span>lazy</span></code> but ultimately decided that
this approach provided less clarity. For example, if multiple modules are
imported in a single statement, it is unclear if the lazy binding applies to
all of the imported objects or just a subset of the items.</p>
</section>
<section id="returning-a-proxy-dict-from-globals">
<h3><a href="#returning-a-proxy-dict-from-globals" role="doc-backlink">Returning a proxy dict from <code><span>globals()</span></code></a></h3>
<p>An alternative to reifying on <code><span>globals()</span></code> or exposing lazy objects would be
to return a proxy dictionary that automatically reifies lazy objects when
they’re accessed through the proxy. This would seemingly give the best of both
worlds: <code><span>globals()</span></code> returns immediately without reification cost, but
accessing items through the result would automatically resolve lazy imports.</p>
<p>However, this approach is fundamentally incompatible with how <code><span>globals()</span></code> is
used in practice. Many standard library functions and built-ins expect
<code><span>globals()</span></code> to return a real <code><span>dict</span></code> object, not a proxy:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><span>exec(code,</span> <span>globals())</span></code> requires a real dict.</li>
<li><code><span>eval(expr,</span> <span>globals())</span></code> requires a real dict.</li>
<li>Functions that check <code><span>type(globals())</span> <span>is</span> <span>dict</span></code> would break.</li>
<li>Dictionary methods like <code><span>.update()</span></code> would need special handling.</li>
<li>Performance would suffer from the indirection on every access.</li>
</ul>
<p>The proxy would need to be so transparent that it would be indistinguishable
from a real dict in almost all cases, which is extremely difficult to achieve
correctly. Any deviation from true dict behavior would be a source of subtle
bugs.</p>
</section>
<section id="reifying-lazy-imports-when-globals-is-called">
<h3><a href="#reifying-lazy-imports-when-globals-is-called" role="doc-backlink">Reifying lazy imports when <code><span>globals()</span></code> is called</a></h3>
<p>Calling <code><span>globals()</span></code> returns the module’s namespace dictionary without
triggering reification of lazy imports. Accessing lazy objects through the
returned dictionary yields the lazy proxy objects themselves. This is an
intentional design decision for several reasons:</p>
<p><strong>The key distinction</strong>: Adding a lazy import and calling <code><span>globals()</span></code> is the
module author’s concern and under their control. However, accessing
<code><span>mod.__dict__</span></code> from external code is a different scenario – it crosses
module boundaries and affects someone else’s code. Therefore, <code><span>mod.__dict__</span></code>
access reifies all lazy imports to ensure external code sees fully realized
modules, while <code><span>globals()</span></code> preserves lazy objects for the module’s own
introspection needs.</p>
<p><strong>Technical challenges</strong>: It is impossible to safely reify on-demand when
<code><span>globals()</span></code> is called because we cannot return a proxy dictionary – this
would break common usages like passing the result to <code><span>exec()</span></code> or other
built-ins that expect a real dictionary. The only alternative would be to
eagerly reify all lazy imports whenever <code><span>globals()</span></code> is called, but this
behavior would be surprising and potentially expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Performance concerns</strong>: It is impractical to cache whether a reification
scan has been performed with just the globals dictionary reference, whereas
module attribute access (the primary use case) can efficiently cache
reification state in the module object itself.</p>
<p><strong>Use case rationale</strong>: The chosen design makes sense precisely because of
this distinction: adding a lazy import and calling <code><span>globals()</span></code> is your
problem to manage, while having lazy imports visible in <code><span>mod.__dict__</span></code>
becomes someone else’s problem. By reifying on <code><span>__dict__</span></code> access but not on
<code><span>globals()</span></code>, we ensure external code always sees fully loaded modules while
giving module authors control over their own introspection.</p>
<p>Note that three options were considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calling <code><span>globals()</span></code> or <code><span>mod.__dict__</span></code> traverses and resolves all lazy
objects before returning.</li>
<li>Calling <code><span>globals()</span></code> or <code><span>mod.__dict__</span></code> returns the dictionary with lazy
objects present.</li>
<li>Calling <code><span>globals()</span></code> returns the dictionary with lazy objects, but
<code><span>mod.__dict__</span></code> reifies everything.</li>
</ol>
<p>We chose the third option because it properly delineates responsibility: if
you add lazy imports to your module and call <code><span>globals()</span></code>, you’re responsible
for handling the lazy objects. But external code accessing your module’s
<code><span>__dict__</span></code> shouldn’t need to know about your lazy imports – it gets fully
resolved modules.</p>

But <a data-offer-url="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26179462/rfi-performanceworkstatementncatc-perc-draft-20251002.pdf" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26179462/rfi-performanceworkstatementncatc-perc-draft-20251002.pdf&quot;}" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26179462/rfi-performanceworkstatementncatc-perc-draft-20251002.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">draft planning documents</a> show the scheme is ambitious: ICE wants a contractor capable of staffing the centers around the clock, constantly processing cases on tight deadlines, and supplying the agency with the latest and greatest subscription-based surveillance software.</p><p>The facilities at the heart of this plan are two of ICE’s three targeting centers, responsible for producing leads that feed directly into the agency’s enforcement operations. The National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center sits in Williston, Vermont. It handles cases across much of the eastern US. The Pacific Enforcement Response Center, based in Santa Ana, California, oversees the western region and is designed to run 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p><p>Internal planning documents show that each site would be staffed with a mix of senior analysts, shift leads, and rank-and-file researchers. Vermont would see a team of a dozen contractors, including a program manager and 10 analysts. California would host a larger, nonstop watch floor with 16 staff. At all times, at least one senior analyst and three researchers would be on duty at the Santa Ana site.</p><p>Together, these teams would operate as intelligence arms of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division. They will receive tips and incoming cases, research individuals online, and package the results into dossiers that could be used by field offices to plan arrests.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The scope of information contractors are expected to collect is broad. Draft instructions specify open-source intelligence: public posts, photos, and messages on platforms from Facebook to Reddit to TikTok. Analysts may also be tasked with checking more obscure or foreign-based sites, such as Russia’s VKontakte.</p><p>They would also be armed with powerful commercial databases such as <a data-offer-url="https://theintercept.com/2022/06/09/ice-lexisnexis-mass-surveillances/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://theintercept.com/2022/06/09/ice-lexisnexis-mass-surveillances/&quot;}" href="https://theintercept.com/2022/06/09/ice-lexisnexis-mass-surveillances/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LexisNexis Accurint</a> and Thomson Reuters CLEAR, which knit together property records, phone bills, utilities, vehicle registrations, and other personal details into searchable files.</p><p>The plan calls for strict turnaround times. Urgent cases, such as suspected national security threats or people on ICE’s Top Ten Most Wanted list, must be researched within 30 minutes. High-priority cases get one hour; lower-priority leads must be completed within the workday. ICE expects at least three-quarters of all cases to meet those deadlines, with top contractors hitting closer to 95 percent.</p><p>The plan goes beyond staffing. ICE also wants algorithms, asking contractors to spell out how they might weave <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a> into the hunt—a solicitation that mirrors other recent proposals. The agency has also set aside more than a million dollars a year to arm analysts with the latest surveillance tools.</p><p>ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Earlier this year, The Intercept revealed that ICE had floated <a data-offer-url="https://theintercept.com/2025/02/11/ice-immigration-social-media-surveillance/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://theintercept.com/2025/02/11/ice-immigration-social-media-surveillance/&quot;}" href="https://theintercept.com/2025/02/11/ice-immigration-social-media-surveillance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">plans for a system</a> that could automatically scan social media for “negative sentiment” toward the agency and flag users thought to show a “proclivity for violence.” Procurement records previously reviewed by 404 Media identified software used by the agency to <a data-offer-url="https://www.404media.co/inside-ices-database-derogatory-information-giant-oak-gost/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.404media.co/inside-ices-database-derogatory-information-giant-oak-gost/&quot;}" href="https://www.404media.co/inside-ices-database-derogatory-information-giant-oak-gost/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">build dossiers on flagged individuals</a>, compiling personal details, family links, and even using facial recognition to connect images across the web. Observers warned it was unclear how such technology could distinguish genuine threats from political speech.</p><p>ICE’s main investigative database, built by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-what-the-company-does/">Palantir Technologies</a>, already uses algorithmic analysis to filter huge populations and generate leads. The new contract would funnel fresh social media and open-source inputs directly into that system, further automating the process.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Planning documents say some restrictions are necessary to head off abuse. Contractors are barred from creating fake profiles, interacting with people online, or storing personal data on their own networks. All analysis must remain on ICE servers. Past experience, however, shows such guardrails can be flimsy, honored more in paperwork than in practice. Other documents obtained by 404 Media this summer revealed that police in Medford, Oregon, performed license plate reader searches for ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations division, while HSI agents later ran searches in federal databases at the request of local police—<a data-offer-url="https://www.404media.co/emails-reveal-the-casual-surveillance-alliance-between-ice-and-local-police/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.404media.co/emails-reveal-the-casual-surveillance-alliance-between-ice-and-local-police/&quot;}" href="https://www.404media.co/emails-reveal-the-casual-surveillance-alliance-between-ice-and-local-police/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">an informal back-and=forth</a> that effectively gave ICE access to tools it wasn’t authorized to use.</p><p>Other surveillance contracts have raised similar alarms. In September 2024, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-paragon-solutions-contract/">ICE signed a $2 million contract with Paragon</a>, an Israeli spyware company whose flagship product, Graphite, can allegedly <a data-offer-url="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/07/29/paragon-is-an-nso-competitor-and-an-american-funded-israeli-surveillance-startup-that-hacks-encrypted-apps-like-whatsapp-and-signal/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/07/29/paragon-is-an-nso-competitor-and-an-american-funded-israeli-surveillance-startup-that-hacks-encrypted-apps-like-whatsapp-and-signal/&quot;}" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/07/29/paragon-is-an-nso-competitor-and-an-american-funded-israeli-surveillance-startup-that-hacks-encrypted-apps-like-whatsapp-and-signal/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">remotely hack messaging apps</a> like WhatsApp and Signal. The Biden White House <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-paragon-contract-white-house-review/">quickly froze the deal</a> under an executive order restricting spyware use, but ICE reactivated it in August 2025 under the Trump administration.

Around the same time, the agency contracted with Babel Street for Locate X, which supplies <a data-offer-url="https://epic.org/documents/epic-v-ice-location-and-social-media-surveillance/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://epic.org/documents/epic-v-ice-location-and-social-media-surveillance/&quot;}" href="https://epic.org/documents/epic-v-ice-location-and-social-media-surveillance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">location histories from ordinary smartphone apps</a>, letting investigators reconstruct people’s movements without a warrant. ICE also adopted LexisNexis Accurint, used by agents to look up addresses, vehicles, and associates, though the scale of spending on that service is unclear. In September, ICE signed a <a data-offer-url="http://forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2025/09/08/ice-to-pay-10-million-for-clearview-facial-recognition-to-investigate-agent-assaults/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;http://forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2025/09/08/ice-to-pay-10-million-for-clearview-facial-recognition-to-investigate-agent-assaults/&quot;}" href="http://forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2025/09/08/ice-to-pay-10-million-for-clearview-facial-recognition-to-investigate-agent-assaults/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">multimillion-dollar contract with Clearview AI</a>, a facial recognition company that built its database by scraping billions of images from social media and the public web.</p><p>Throughout, ICE has leaned on Palantir’s Investigative Case Management system to combine disparate streams of data into a single investigative platform. Recent contract updates show the system lets agents <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-palantir-immigrationos/">search people using hundreds of categories</a>, from immigration status and country of origin to scars, tattoos, and license-plate reader data. Each surveillance contract ICE signs adds another layer—location trails, social networks, financial records, biometric identifiers—feeding into Palantir’s hub. ICE’s new initiative is about scaling up the human side of the equation, stationing analysts around the clock to convert the firehose of data into raid-ready leads.</p><p>ICE argues it needs these tools to modernize enforcement. Its planning documents note that “previous approaches … which have not incorporated open web sources and social media information, have had limited success.” The agency suggests that tapping social media and open web data helps identify aliases, track movements, and detect patterns that traditional methods often miss.</p><p>With plenty of <a href="https://www.aclu.org/surveillance-under-the-patriot-act">historical analogs</a> to <a data-offer-url="https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/360/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/360/&quot;}" href="https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/360/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">choose from</a>, privacy advocates warn that any surveillance that starts as a method of capturing immigrants could soon be deployed <a data-offer-url="https://publicsurveillance.com/papers/IJEP.pdf" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://publicsurveillance.com/papers/IJEP.pdf&quot;}" href="https://publicsurveillance.com/papers/IJEP.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">for ulterior purposes</a>. ICE’s proposal to track “negative sentiment” is a clear example of how the agency’s threat monitoring bleeds into the policing of dissent. By drawing in the online activity of not only its targets but also friends, family, and community members, ICE is certain to collect far more information outside its mandate than it is likely to publicly concede.</p></div></div></article><div><div data-testid="RowWrapper"><ul><li data-testid="LinkStackBullet"><p><strong>In your inbox:</strong> Our <a href="https://www.wired.com/newsletter/daily?sourceCode=BottomStories" target="_blank">biggest stories</a>, handpicked for you each day</p></li><li data-testid="LinkStackBullet"></li><li data-testid="LinkStackBullet"></li><li data-testid="LinkStackBullet"></li><li data-testid="LinkStackBullet"></li></ul></div><div data-testid="RowWrapper"><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/author/dell-cameron/"><span><picture><source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://media.wired.com/photos/663fe63cf59145e49d5e32df/1:1/w_80,c_limit/undefined 80w" sizes="100vw"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="https://media.wired.com/photos/663fe63cf59145e49d5e32df/1:1/w_90,c_limit/undefined 90w" sizes="100vw"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/663fe63cf59145e49d5e32df/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined" data-src="https://media.wired.com/photos/663fe63cf59145e49d5e32df/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined"></picture></span></a></p><div><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/author/dell-cameron/">Dell Cameron</a> is an investigative reporter from Texas covering privacy and national security.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>Even in a hopeless place, ants will find a way. No food, no light, no escape? No problem.</p><p>In the woods of western Poland lies a dismantled Soviet nuclear base, complete with two underground bunkers where nuclear ammunition was once kept. After the military complex was abandoned, these eerie human-made caves became great roosting places for overwintering bats.</p><p>In early 2010s, volunteers started visiting the bunkers to monitor the bat population in winter, and made a discovery of a different sort: A large mass of wood ants (<em>Formica polyctena</em>) trapped on the bunker floor, surviving without a queen or any of their usual creature comforts.</p><p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2019-11/oo_100896.jpg" alt="oo 100896" width="700" loading="lazy"><span>The bunker 'colony' with a 'cemetery' against the far wall. (Wojciech Stephan/Czechowski <em>et al., Journal of Hymenoptera Research</em>, 2016)</span></span></p><p>When it was first found in 2013, this 'colony' of underground ants already included up to a million live workers and several more million dead. They were not reproducing, though. Instead, the population was being replenished through sheer accident.</p><p>In the ceiling of the bunker sat a rusted ventilation pipe, connecting the dark cavern to the forest above. There, a giant ant colony had built a mound right above the bunker; as the metal rusted through, some of their ranks started falling into the concrete cavern below.</p><p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2019-11/oo_351426.jpg" alt="oo 351426" width="700" loading="lazy"><span>The ventilation pipe. (Rutkowski <em>et al., Journal of Hymenoptera Research,</em> 2019)</span></span></p><p>"In total darkness, they have constructed an earthen mound, which they have maintained all-year-round by moulding it and keeping the nest entrances open," researchers wrote <a href="https://doi.org/10.3897/jhr.51.9096">in a study in 2016</a>, noting these ants are "a&nbsp;far cry from a fully functional colony".&nbsp;</p><p>Investigating the limits of ant living conditions is a subject of keen interest for some entomologists. So, for several years, researchers made repeated trips to the bunker and watched in fascination as this isolated population continued to grow and survive despite a lack of light, heat, or obvious nourishment.</p><p>Now, scientists finally know how these trapped insects pulled it off: the mass consumption of their own imprisoned nest mates.</p><p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2019-11/oo_100894.jpg" alt="oo 100894" width="700" loading="lazy"><span>The colony built above the ventilation pipe. (Czechowski <em>et al., Journal of Hymenoptera Research,</em> 2016)</span></span></p><p>Cannibalism was obviously suspected; wood ants are, after all, the only major food source available in this tight spot, apart from the occasional dead mouse or bat. Plus, this particular species is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3619097/">known to consume</a> their own fallen dead during territorial "<a href="http://serious-science.org/ant-wars-6652">ant wars</a>" when food is often scarce.</p><p>To confirm this hunch, a team of researchers collected corpses from several ant 'cemeteries' scattered within the bunker. Closely examining 150 dead worker ants, the team noticed the vast majority of bodies (roughly 93 percent) had gnawed holes and bite marks.</p><p>The authors say these are clear signs of mass consumption, with practically no other organism in the bunker capable of making these marks.</p><p>"The survival and growth of the bunker 'colony' through the years, without producing own offspring, was possible owing to continuous supply of new workers from the upper nest and accumulation of nestmate corpses," the researchers&nbsp;<a href="https://jhr.pensoft.net/article/38972/">concluded in their study.</a></p><p>"The corpses served as an inexhaustible source of food which substantially allowed survival of the ants trapped down in otherwise extremely unfavourable conditions."</p><p>It seems that wood ants can handle remarkable adversity in their bid for survival. Although luckily for this colony, they no longer have to turn on their own: In 2016, researchers <a href="https://jhr.pensoft.net/article/38972/element/4/43//">installed a wooden boardwalk</a>&nbsp;(below) in the bunker, connecting the ventilation pipe to the ground. Within four months, nearly all the trapped ants had deserted the bunker floor.</p><p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2019-11/oo_351427.jpg" alt="oo 351427" width="700" loading="lazy"><span>The recently installed boardwalk. (Rutkowski<em> et al., Journal of Hymenoptera Research,</em> 2019)</span></span></p><p>Now, when any ants are unfortunate enough to fall into the dark chamber, they don't have to resort to cannibalism.&nbsp;They can just calmly walk the plank, all the way home.</p><p>The research was published in the <a href="https://jhr.pensoft.net/article/38972/"><em>Journal of Hymenoptera Research</em></a>.</p>

Today, demand is not just weak but structurally below trend, as firms automate more of the work that junior economists once did.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Cje4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4afceb8-a067-44ab-8f9e-53caaeb32ad1_1080x482.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Cje4!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4afceb8-a067-44ab-8f9e-53caaeb32ad1_1080x482.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Cje4!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4afceb8-a067-44ab-8f9e-53caaeb32ad1_1080x482.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Cje4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4afceb8-a067-44ab-8f9e-53caaeb32ad1_1080x482.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Cje4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4afceb8-a067-44ab-8f9e-53caaeb32ad1_1080x482.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Cje4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4afceb8-a067-44ab-8f9e-53caaeb32ad1_1080x482.webp" width="1080" height="482" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d4afceb8-a067-44ab-8f9e-53caaeb32ad1_1080x482.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:482,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:34498,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.chrisbrunet.com/i/174414048?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4afceb8-a067-44ab-8f9e-53caaeb32ad1_1080x482.webp&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Cje4!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4afceb8-a067-44ab-8f9e-53caaeb32ad1_1080x482.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Cje4!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4afceb8-a067-44ab-8f9e-53caaeb32ad1_1080x482.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Cje4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4afceb8-a067-44ab-8f9e-53caaeb32ad1_1080x482.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Cje4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4afceb8-a067-44ab-8f9e-53caaeb32ad1_1080x482.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><div><p> ‘‘What does the modal economist, or any non CS or DS person really, have to offer to a tech firm in 2025? Not all, but many tech companies are actively downsizing and laying off tons of workers with tech experience that you have to compete against. And few firms will really care about causal inference and any other data analytics jobs can be filled by data science masters grads with deeper programming skills and cheaper salary expectations. Not to mention there is a focus on developing and using AI these days and your intro to machine learning class isn’t going to cut it.’’</p><p>— Anonymous economist</p></div><p>The only seemingly stable landing spot left for economists is in banking and finance, but even here hiring is stagnant and remains well below its pre-pandemic trend. Counterintuitively, most private-sector banks and investment firms do not rely heavily on PhDs in economics.

The AI earned a “D” (this was 2 years ago), but soon enough, we all know it will be smart enough to earn an A.

Each step was wrong, and each was delivered with smug certainty. Ordinary people—who watched their rent, groceries, and gas bills skyrocket—saw a profession more invested in protecting Democratic policy narratives than in telling the truth. The result is a self-inflicted torching of trust.</p><p>The answer is no. An economics PhD is no longer an investment. It is a gamble with terrible odds. A handful of winners still exist, almost all of them minted at Harvard, MIT, Princeton, or Chicago.

From there, though, his piece becomes more distinctive and interesting, exploring the social dynamics and internal hierarchies of the profession. His conclusion is bleak for the discipline itself, but notably optimistic about the future of Substack:</span></p><blockquote><p>Do I think the PhD job market will bounce back?</p><p><span>Prognosticating too eagerly is a good way to land yourself a place in the Irving Fisher Hall of Forever Being Remembered For Having Said One Stupid Thing.</span><a href="https://www.global-developments.org/p/twilight-of-the-econs#footnote-4-170289520" rel=""><sup>4</sup></a><span> A 16% fall in jobs, while devastating, is not yet apocalyptic.

But for things to get better requires a causal mechanism. Reinstating science and academic funding would require either Republicans to reverse their stance on the value of higher education, or for Democrats to win back the Senate. I don’t have a great sense of if either will happen.</span><a href="https://www.global-developments.org/p/twilight-of-the-econs#footnote-5-170289520" rel=""><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>In this case, prediction may be less important than preparation. Placement chairs need to own up to the harshness of the labor market, and urge job market candidates to start prepping non-academic options. (Better yet, admissions chairs should consider paring back cohort sizes.) Candidates who would like a proper job after graduating should be networking, hard. And candidates resolutely committed to academia should steel themselves for long hibernations as post docs, to wait out the coming storm.</p><p>On second thought, I will venture one dark prediction, for at least the near future.</p><p><strong>We’re going to see a lot more Substacks.</strong></p></blockquote><p>The wager, then, is that the future of intellectual life will be increasingly decentralized. Platforms like Substack are already siphoning off the kind of energy and analysis that once flowed into journals or policy shops.</p><p>As for the economics profession, the only real fix would be radical: every PhD program would have to coordinate and act like a cartel to slash admissions to dramatically reduce supply. Without that discipline, the system will keep flooding the market with useless doctorates, a Ponzi scheme destined to collapse under its own weight.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.chrisbrunet.com/p/the-collapse-of-the-econ-phd-job?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.chrisbrunet.com/p/the-collapse-of-the-econ-phd-job?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.chrisbrunet.com/p/the-collapse-of-the-econ-phd-job/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.chrisbrunet.com/p/the-collapse-of-the-econ-phd-job/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

It makes the majority of its revenue selling subscriptions to ChatGPT, and apparently had<a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/640894/chatgpt-has-hit-20-million-paid-subscribers?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>20 million paid subscribers</u></a> (as of April) and<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/01/openai-raise-chatgpt-users.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>5 million business subscribers</u></a> (as of August,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/how-to-argue-with-an-ai-booster/#:~:text=Here%E2%80%99s%20a%20hint%20though%3A"> <u>though 500,000 of them are Cal State University seats paid at $2.50 a month</u></a>).</p><p>It also loses incredibly large amounts of money.</p><h3 id="openais-pathetic-api-sales-have-effectively-turned-it-into-any-other-ai-startup"><strong>OpenAI's Pathetic API Sales Have Effectively Turned It Into Any Other AI Startup</strong></h3><p>Yes, I realize that OpenAI also sells access to its API, but as you can see from the chart above, it is making a <em>teeny tiny sliver</em> of revenue from it in 2025, though I will also add that this chart has a little bit of green for "agent" revenue, which means it's very likely bullshit.<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/deep-impact/#:~:text=OpenAI%20is%20as,these%20tasks%20yourself.%22"> <u>Operator, OpenAI's so-called agent, is barely functional</u></a>, and I have no idea how anyone would even begin to charge money for it outside of "please try my broken product."</p><p>In any case, API sales appear to be a very, very small part of OpenAI's revenue stream, and that heavily suggests a lack of interest in integrating its models at scale.</p><p>Worse still, this effectively turns OpenAI <em>into an AI startup.</em></p><p>Think about it: if OpenAI can't make the majority of its money through "innovating" in the development of large language models (LLMs), then it’s just another company plugging LLMs into its software. While ChatGPT may be a very popular product, it is, by definition (and in its name!) a GPT wrapper, with the few differences being that OpenAI pays its own immediate costs, has the people necessary to continue improving its own models, and also continually makes promises to convince people it’s <strong><em>anything other than just another AI startup.</em></strong></p><p>In fact, the only<em> real</em> difference is the amount of money backing it. Otherwise, OpenAI could be literally any foundation model company, and with a lack of real innovation within those models, it’s just another startup trying to find ways to monetize generative AI,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/why-everybody-is-losing-money-on-ai/"> <u>an industry that only ever seems to lose money</u></a>.</p><p>As a result, we should start <em>evaluating </em>OpenAI as just another AI startup, as its promises do not appear to mesh with any coherent strategy, other than "<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai-onetrillion/"><u>we need $1 trillion dollars</u></a>." There does not seem to be much of a plan on a day-to-day basis, nor does there seem to be one about <em>what </em>OpenAI should be, other than that OpenAI will be a consumer hardware, consumer software, enterprise SaaS and data center operator, as well as running a social network.</p><p>As I've discussed<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/sam-altman-fried/#:~:text=Despite%20what%20fantasists"> <u>many</u></a><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/godot-isnt-making-it/#:~:text=data%20(April).-,I%20shared%20concerns,-in%20July%20that"> <u>times</u></a>, LLMs are inherently flawed due to their probabilistic nature."Hallucinations" — when a model authoritatively states something is true when it isn't (or takes an action that seems the most likely course of action, even if it isn't the right one) — are a "<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/4059383/openai-admits-ai-hallucinations-are-mathematically-inevitable-not-just-engineering-flaws.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>mathematically inevitable</u></a>" according to OpenAI's own research feature of the technology, meaning that there is <em>no fixing their most glaring, obvious problem</em>, even with "perfect data."</p><p>I'd wager the reason OpenAI is so eager to build out so much capacity while leaking so many diverse business lines is an attempt to get away from a dark truth: that when you peel away the hype, ChatGPT is a wrapper, every product it makes is a wrapper, <em>and OpenAI is pretty fucking terrible at making products.</em></p><p>Today I'm going to walk you through a fairly unique position: that OpenAI is just another boring AI startup lacking any meaningful product roadmap or strategy, using the press as a tool to pump its bags while very rarely delivering on what it’s promised. It is a company with massive amounts of cash, industrial backing, and brand recognition, and otherwise is, much like its customers, desperately trying to work out how to make money selling products built on top of Large Language Models.</p><p>OpenAI lives and dies on its mythology as the center of innovation in the world of AI, yet reality is so much more mediocre. Its revenue growth is slowing, its products are commoditized, its models are hardly state-of-the-art,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-case-against-generative-ai/"> <u>the overall generative AI industry has lost its sheen</u></a>, and its killer app is a mythology that has converted a handful of very rich people and very few others.</p><p>OpenAI spent,<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-first-half-results-4-3-billion-sales-2-5-billion-cash-burn?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>according to The Information</u></a>, 150% ($6.7 billion in costs) of its H1 2025 revenue ($4.3 billion) on research and development, producing<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/how-does-gpt-5-work/"> <u>the deeply-underwhelming GPT-5</u></a> and Sora 2, an app that I estimate costs it upwards of $5 for each video generation,<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>based on Azure's published rates for the first Sora model</u></a>, though it's my belief that these rates are unprofitable, all so that it can gain a few more users.</p><p>To be clear, R&amp;D is good, and useful, and in my experience, the companies that spend deeply on this tend to be the ones that do well. The reason why Huawei has managed to outpace its American rivals in several key areas — like automotive technology and telecommunications — is because it <a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20250902/5g/huawei-spending?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>spends around a quarter of its revenue</u></a> on developing new technologies and entering new markets, rather than stock buybacks and dividends.</p><p>The difference is that said R&amp;D spending is both sustainable and useful, and has led to Huawei becoming much a stronger business, even <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/05/21/2019-10616/addition-of-entities-to-the-entity-list?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>as it languishes on a Treasury Department entity list that effectively cuts it off from US-made or US-origin parts or IP</u></a>. Considering that OpenAI’s R&amp;D spending <em>was 38.28% of its cash-on-hand</em> by the end of the period (totalling $17.5bn, which we’ll get to later), and what we’ve seen as a result, it’s hard to describe it as <em>either</em> sustainable <em>or</em> useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI isn't <em>innovative,</em> it’s <em>exploitative, </em>a giant multi-billion dollar grift attempting to hide how deeply <em>unexciting</em> it is, and how nonsensical it is to continue backing it<em>.</em> Sam Altman is an excellent operator, capable of spreading his mediocre, half-baked mantras about<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/politico.com/post/3m25ob7qipc2s?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>how 2025 was the year AI got smarter than us</u></a>, or<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-ai-infrastructure-1-gw-per-week-stargate-2025-9?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>how we'll be building 1GW data centers each week</u></a> (something that, by my estimations, takes 2.5 years), taking advantage of how many people in the media, markets and global governments don't know a fucking <em>thing</em> about anything.</p><p>OpenAI is&nbsp; also getting desperate.</p><p>Beneath the surface of the media hype and trillion-dollar promises is a company struggling to maintain relevance, its entire existence built on top of hype and mythology.</p><p>And at this rate, I believe it’s going to miss its 2025 revenue projections, all while burning billions more than anyone has anticipated.</p>

Beyond Ctrl-C: The dark corners of Unix signal handling."><figcaption>Me speaking at RustConf 2023.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><p>I gave <a href="https://sunshowers.io/posts/beyond-ctrl-c-signals/">a talk</a> at RustConf a couple years ago talking about how async Rust is a great fit for signal handling in complex applications.</p></li><li><p>I’m also the author of <a href="https://nexte.st/">cargo-nextest</a>, a next-generation test runner for Rust, where async Rust is the best way I know of to express some really complex algorithms that I wouldn’t know how to express otherwise. I wrote <a href="https://sunshowers.io/posts/nextest-and-tokio/">a blog post</a> about this a few years ago.</p></li></ul><p>Now, I work at <a href="https://oxide.computer/">Oxide Computer Company</a>, where we make <em>cloud-in-a-box computers</em>. We make vertically integrated systems where you provide power and networking on one end, and the software you want to run on the other end, and we take care of everything in between.</p><p>Of course, we use Rust everywhere, and in particular we use async Rust extensively for our higher-level software, such as <a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/crucible">storage</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/maghemite">networking</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/">customer-facing management API</a>. But along the way we’ve encountered a number of issues around async cancellation, and a lot of this post is about what we learned along the way.</p><h2 id="1-what-is-cancellation">1. What is cancellation?<a href="#1-what-is-cancellation" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>What does cancellation mean? Logically, a cancellation is exactly what it sounds like: you start some work, and then change your mind and decide to stop doing that work.</p><p>As you might imagine this is a useful thing to do:</p><ul><li>You may have started a large download or a long network request</li><li>Maybe you’ve started reading a file, similar to the <code>head</code> command.</li></ul><p>But then you change your mind: you want to cancel it rather than continue it to completion.</p><h3 id="cancellations-in-synchronous-rust">Cancellations in synchronous Rust<a href="#cancellations-in-synchronous-rust" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h3><p>Before we talk about async Rust, it’s worth thinking about how you’d do cancellations in synchronous Rust.</p><p>One option is to have some kind of <em>flag</em> you periodically check, maybe stored in an atomic:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>!</span><span>should_cancel</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>Ordering</span>::<span>Relaxed</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>expensive_operation</span><span>();</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><ul><li>The code that wishes to perform the cancellation can set that flag.</li><li>Then, the code which checks that flag can exit early.</li></ul><p>This approach is fine for smaller bits of code but doesn’t really scale well to large chunks of code since you’d have to sprinkle these checks everywhere.</p><p>A related option, if you’re working with a framework as part of your work, is to <em>panic with a special payload</em> of some kind.</p><ul><li>If that feels strange to you, you’re not alone! But the <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">Salsa</a> framework for incremental computation, used by—among other things—<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a>, uses this approach.</li><li>Something I learned recently was that this only works on build targets which have a notion of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html">panic unwinding</a>, or being able to bubble up the panic. Not all platforms support this, and in particular, <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Wasm</a> doesn’t. This means that Salsa cancellations don’t work if you build rust-analyzer for Wasm.</li></ul><p>A third option is to <em>kill the whole process</em>. This is a <em>very heavyweight</em> approach, but an effective one in case you spawn processes to do your work.</p><p>Rather than kill the whole process, can you kill a single thread?</p><ul><li>While <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-terminatethread">some OSes have APIs</a> to perform this action, they tend to warn very strongly against it. That’s because in general, most code is <a href="https://sunshowers.io/posts/nextest-process-per-test/#appendix">just not ready</a> for a thread disappearing from underneath.</li><li>In particular, thread killing is not permitted by safe Rust, since it can cause serious corruption. For example, Rust mutexes would likely stay locked forever.</li></ul><p>All of these options are suboptimal or of limited use in some way. In general, the way I think about it is that there isn’t a <em>universal protocol</em> for cancellation in synchronous Rust.</p><p>In contrast, there <em>is</em> such a protocol in async Rust, and in fact cancellations are extraordinarily easy to perform in async Rust.</p><p>Why is that so? To understand that, let’s look at what a future is.</p><h3 id="what-is-a-future">What is a future?<a href="#what-is-a-future" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h3><p>Here’s a simple example of a future:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>// This creates a state machine.

</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>// Nothing executes yet. `future` is just a struct in memory.
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this future, you first perform a network request which returns some data, and then you process it.</p><p>The Rust compiler looks at this future and generates a state machine, which is just a struct or enum in memory:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>// The compiler generates something like:

It is simply to <em>drop</em> the future, or to not await it, or poll it any more. Since a future is just a state machine, you can throw it away at any time the poll function isn’t actively being called.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>future</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>some_async_work</span><span>();</span><span>

This is for two reasons.</p><ol><li><p>First, it’s just way too easy to quietly drop a future. As we’re going to see, there are all kinds of code patterns that lead to silently dropping futures.</p></li><li><p>Now this wouldn’t be so bad, if not for the second reason: that cancellation of parent futures propagates down to child futures.</p><p>Because of Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html">single ownership model</a>, child futures are owned by parent ones. If a parent future is dropped or cancelled, the same happens to the child.</p><p>To figure out whether a child future’s cancellation can cause issues, you have to look at its parent, and grandparent, and so on.

Analyzing cancellations<a href="#2-analyzing-cancellations" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>I’m going to cover some examples in a bit, but before we do that I want to talk about a couple terms, some of which you might have seen references to already.</p><h3 id="cancel-safety-and-cancel-correctness">Cancel safety and cancel correctness<a href="#cancel-safety-and-cancel-correctness" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h3><p>The first term is <strong>cancel safety</strong>. You might have seen mentions of this in the Tokio documentation. Cancel safety, as generally defined, means the property of a future that can be cancelled (i.e. dropped) without any side effects.</p><p>For example, a <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/time/fn.sleep.html">Tokio sleep future</a> is cancel safe: you can just stop waiting on the sleep and it’s completely fine.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>future</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>tokio</span>::<span>time</span>::<span>sleep</span><span>();</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>future</span><span>);</span><span> </span><span>// this has no side effects
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>An example of a future that is not cancel safe is <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html#method.send">Tokio’s MPSC send</a>, which sends a message over a channel:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>message</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>/* ... */</span><span>;</span><span>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>If this future is dropped, the message is lost forever.</p><p>The important thing is that cancel safety is a <em>local property</em> of an <em>individual future</em>.</p><p>But cancel safety is not all that one needs to care about. What actually matters is the context the cancellation happens in, or in other words whether the cancellation actually causes some kind of larger property in the system to be violated.</p><ul><li>For example, if you drop a future which sends a message, but for whatever reason you don’t care about the message any more, it’s not really a bug!</li></ul><p>To capture this I tend to use a different term called <strong>cancel correctness</strong>, which I define as a <em>global property</em> of <em>system correctness</em> in the face of cancellations. (This isn’t a standard term, but it’s a framing I’ve found really helpful in understanding cancellations.)</p><p>When is cancel correctness violated? It requires three things:</p><ol><li><p><em>The system has a cancel-unsafe future somewhere within it.</em> As we’ll see, many APIs that are cancel-unsafe can be reworked to be cancel-safe. If there aren’t any cancel-unsafe futures in the system, then the system is cancel correct.</p></li><li><p><em>A cancel-unsafe future is actually cancelled.</em> This may sound a bit trivial, but if cancel-unsafe futures are always run to completion, then the system can’t have cancel correctness bugs.</p></li><li><p><em>Cancelling the future violates some property of a system.</em> This could be data loss as with <code>Sender::send</code>, some kind of invariant violation, or some kind of cleanup that must be performed but isn’t.</p></li></ol><p>So a lot of making Rust async robust is about trying to tackle one of these three things.</p><p>I want to zoom in for a second on invariant violations and talk about an example of a Tokio API that is very prone to cancel correctness issues: <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.Mutex.html">Tokio mutexes</a>.</p><h3 id="the-pain-of-tokio-mutexes">The pain of Tokio mutexes<a href="#the-pain-of-tokio-mutexes" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h3><p>The way Tokio mutexes work is: you create a mutex, you lock it which gives you mutable access to the data underneath, and then you unlock it by releasing the mutex.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>guard</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>mutex</span><span>.</span><span>lock</span><span>().</span><span>await</span><span>;</span><span>

Cancelling a call to lock makes you lose your place in the queue.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, so not totally cancel safe, but the only kind of unsafety is fairness, which doesn’t sound too bad.</p><p>But the problems lie in what you actually do with the mutex. In practice, most uses of mutexes are in order to <em>temporarily violate invariants</em> that are otherwise upheld when a lock isn’t held.</p><p>I’ll use a real world example of a cancel correctness bug that we found at my job at Oxide: we had code to manage a bunch of data sent over by our computers, which we call sleds. The shared state was guarded by a mutex, and a typical operation was:</p><ol><li>Obtain a lock on the mutex.</li><li>Obtain the sled-specific data by value, moving it to an invalid <code>None</code> state.</li><li>Perform an action.</li><li>Set the sled-specific data back to the next valid state.</li></ol><p>Here’s a rough sketch of what that looks like:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>guard</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>mutex</span><span>.</span><span>lock</span><span>().</span><span>await</span><span>;</span><span>

</span></span><span><span>   = note: futures do nothing unless you `.await` or poll them
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But a code pattern I’ve sometimes made mistakes with is that the future returns a <code>Result</code>, and you want to ignore the result so you assign it to an underscore like so:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>some_async_work</span><span>();</span><span> </span><span>// future returns Result
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>If I forget to call <code>.await</code> on the future, Rust doesn’t warn me about it at all, and then I’m left scratching my head about why this code didn’t run.

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In synchronous Rust, this is a great API. But within async Rust, the <code>write_all</code> pattern is absolutely not cancel safe! If the future is dropped before completion, you have no idea how much of this buffer was written out.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>tokio</span>::<span>io</span>::<span>AsyncWriteExt</span><span>;</span><span>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>But there’s an alternative API that is cancel-safe, called <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/io/trait.AsyncWriteExt.html#method.write_all_buf"><code>write_all_buf</code></a>. This API is carefully designed to enable the reporting of partial progress, and it doesn’t just accept a <em>buffer</em>, but rather something that looks like a cursor on top of it:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>tokio</span>::<span>io</span>::<span>AsyncWriteExt</span><span>;</span><span>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>When part of the buffer is written out, the cursor is advanced by that number of bytes. So if you call <code>write_all_buf</code> in a loop, you’ll be resuming from this partial progress, which works great.</p><h3 id="not-cancelling-futures">Not cancelling futures<a href="#not-cancelling-futures" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h3><p>Going back to the three prongs: the second prong is about actually cancelling futures. What code patterns can be used to not cancel futures? Here are a couple of examples.</p><p>The first one is, in a place like a select loop, resume futures rather than cancelling them each time. You’d typically achieve this by <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/">pinning a future</a>, and then polling a mutable reference to that future. For example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>future</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Box</span>::<span>pin</span><span>(</span><span>channel</span><span>.</span><span>reserve</span><span>());</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>loop</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>tokio</span>::<span>select!</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>        </span><span>result</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>future</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>break</span><span> </span><span>result</span><span>,</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>        </span><span>_</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>other_condition</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>continue</span><span>,</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Coming back to our example of MPSC sends, the one asterisk with <code>reserve</code> is that cancelling it makes you lose your place in line. Instead, if you pin the <code>reserve</code> future and poll a mutable reference to it, you don’t lose your place in line.</p><p>(Does the difference here matter? It depends, but you can now have this strategy available to you.)</p><hr><p>The second example is to use tasks. I mentioned earlier that futures are Rust are diametrically opposed to similar notions in languages like JavaScript. Well, there’s an alternative in async Rust that’s much closer to the JavaScript idea, and that’s <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/">tasks</a>.</p><ul><li>Unlike futures which are driven by the caller, tasks are driven by the runtime (such as Tokio).</li><li>With Tokio, dropping a handle to a task does not cause it to be cancelled, which means they’re a good place to run cancel-unsafe code.</li></ul><p>A fun example is that at Oxide, we have an HTTP server called <a href="https://docs.rs/dropshot">Dropshot</a>. Previously, whenever an HTTP request came in, we’d use a future for it, and drop the future if the TCP connection was closed.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>// Before: Future cancelled on TCP close
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>handle_request</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>).</span><span>await</span><span>;</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This was really bad because future cancellations could happen due to the behavior of not just the parent future, but of a process that was running across a network! This is a rather extreme form of non-local reasoning.</p><p>We addressed this by spinning up a task for each HTTP request, and by running the code to completion even if the connection is closed:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>// After: Task runs to completion
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>tokio</span>::<span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>handle_request</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>));</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="systematic-solutions">Systematic solutions?<a href="#systematic-solutions" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h3><p>The last thing I want to say is that <strong>this sucks</strong>!</p><p>The promise of Rust is that you don’t need to do this kind of non-local reasoning—that you can analyze small bits of code for local correctness, and scale that up to global correctness. Almost everything in Rust, from <code>&amp;</code> and <code>&amp;mut</code> to <code>unsafe</code>, is geared towards making that possible. Future cancellations fly directly in the face of that, and I think they’re probably the <strong>least Rusty part of Rust</strong>. This is all really unfortunate.</p><p>Can we come up with something more systematic than this kind of ad-hoc reasoning?</p><p>There doesn’t exist anything in safe Rust today, but there are a few different ideas people have come up with. I wanted to give a nod to those ideas:</p><ul><li><em>Async drop</em> would let you run async code when a future is cancelled. This would handle some, though not all, of the cases we discussed today.</li><li>There’s also a couple different proposals for what are called <em>linear types</em>, where you could force some code to be run on drop, or mark a particular future as non-cancellable (once it’s been created it must be driven to completion).</li></ul><p>All of these options have really significant implementation challenges, though. This <a href="https://without.boats/blog/asynchronous-clean-up/">blog post from boats</a> covers some of these solutions, and the implementation challenges with them.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>In this post, we:</p><ul><li>Saw that futures are passive</li><li>Introduced cancel safety and cancel correctness as concepts</li><li>Examined some bugs that can occur with cancellation</li><li>Looked at some recommendations you can use to mitigate the downsides of cancellation</li></ul><p>Some of the recommendations are:</p><ul><li>Avoid Tokio mutexes</li><li>Rewrite APIs to make futures cancel-safe</li><li>Find ways to ensure that cancel-unsafe futures are driven to completion</li></ul><p>There’s a very deep well of complexity here, a lot more than I can cover in one blog post:</p><ul><li>Why are futures passive, anyway?</li><li>Cooperative cancellation: cancellation tokens</li><li>Actor model as an alternative to Tokio mutexes</li><li>Task aborts</li><li>Structured concurrency</li><li>Relationship to panic safety and mutex poisoning</li></ul><p>If you’re curious about any of these, check out <a href="https://github.com/sunshowers/cancelling-async-rust">this link</a> where I’ve put together a collection of documents and blog posts about these concepts. In particular, I’d recommend reading these two Oxide RFDs:</p><ul><li><a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/397">RFD 397 Challenges with async/await in the control plane</a> by David Pacheco</li><li><a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/400">RFD 400 Dealing with cancel safety in async Rust</a> by myself</li></ul><p><em>Thank you for reading this post to the end!

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/02/microsoft_maia_dc/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/02/microsoft_maia_dc/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45463642">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Microsoft buys a lot of GPUs from both Nvidia and AMD. But moving forward, Redmond's leaders want to shift the majority of its AI workloads from GPUs to its own homegrown accelerators.</p>
<p>The software titan is rather late to the custom silicon party. While Amazon and Google have been building custom CPUs and AI accelerators for years, Microsoft only <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/11/15/microsoft-holds-chip-makers-feet-to-the-fire-with-homegrown-cpu-and-ai-chips/">revealed</a> its Maia AI accelerators in late 2023.</p>
<p>Driving the transition is a focus on performance per dollar, which for a hyperscale cloud provider is arguably the only metric that really matters. Speaking during a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/microsoft-wants-to-mainly-use-its-own-ai-chips-in-the-future.html">fireside</a> chat moderated by CNBC on Wednesday, Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott said that up to this point, Nvidia has offered the best price-performance, but he's willing to entertain anything in order to meet demand.</p>

    

<p>Going forward, Scott suggested Microsoft hopes to use its homegrown chips for the majority of its datacenter workloads.</p>

        


        

<p>When asked, "Is the longer term idea to have mainly Microsoft silicon in the data center?" Scott responded, "Yeah, absolutely."</p>
<p>Later, he told CNBC, "It's about the entire system design. It's the networks and cooling, and you want to be able to have the freedom to make decisions that you need to make in order to really optimize your compute for the workload."</p>

        

<p>With its first in-house AI accelerator, the Maia 100, Microsoft was able to free up GPU capacity by shifting OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to its own silicon back in 2023. However, with just 800 teraFLOPS of BF16 performance, 64GB of HBM2e, and 1.8TB/s of memory bandwidth, the chip fell well short of competing GPUs from Nvidia and AMD.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/27/alibaba_ai_drive/">Alibaba unveils $53B global AI plan – but it will need GPUs to back it up</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/11/nvidias_graceblackwell_drives_arms_cpu/">Arm wrestles away 25% share of server market thanks to Nvidia's home-grown CPUs</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/11/sipearl_rhea1_reference_design/">SiPearl ships reference node design for Rhea1 high-spec Arm chip</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/01/arm_datacenter_cpu_market/">Arm reckons it'll own 50% of the datacenter by year's end</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft is <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-scales-back-ambitions-ai-chips-overcome-delays">reportedly</a> in the process of bringing a second-generation Maia accelerator to market next year that will no doubt offer more competitive compute, memory, and interconnect performance.</p>
<p>But while we may see a change in the mix of GPUs to AI ASICs in Microsoft data centers moving forward, they're unlikely to replace Nvidia and AMD's chips entirely.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Google and Amazon have deployed tens of thousands of their TPUs and Trainium accelerators. While these chips have helped them secure some high-profile customer wins, Anthropic for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/04/project_rainier_deep_dive/">example</a>, these chips are more often used to accelerate the company's own in-house workloads.</p>
<p>As such, we continue to see large-scale Nvidia and AMD GPU deployments on these cloud platforms, in part because customers still want them.</p>

        

<p>It should be noted that AI accelerators aren't the only custom chips Microsoft has been working on. Redmond also has its own CPU called <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/microsoft-wants-to-mainly-use-its-own-ai-chips-in-the-future.html">Cobalt</a> and a whole host of platform security silicon <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/26/microsoft_silicon_security/">designed</a> to accelerate cryptography and safeguard key exchanges across its vast datacenter domains. ®</p>

</p></div><div id="sm-page-widget-dXZrtT99" data-typeid="37955882" data-layout-column="0" data-layout-row="J"><p><span>The Faroe Islands are like the child that Denmark and Iceland had, but forgot to tell the world about. This group of eighteen small islands receives the least amount of sunshine in the world per year. Constant rain and heavy winds have always battered these lands.</span></p><p><span>Politically part of Denmark (for now) but fiercely independent in spirit, the Faroes exist in their own bubble of Nordic culture. Here, sheep outnumber humans two to one, villages of colorful houses cling to clifftops like they're holding on for dear life, and the weather can shift from apocalyptic storms to sunny calm in the space of an hour.</span></p></div><div id="sm-page-widget-KLNM5hjr" data-typeid="37955962" data-layout-column="0" data-layout-row="F"><div><p><span>Situated between Iceland, Norway and Scotland, the Faroes face the brunt of the North Atlantic weather system. Constant storms and crashing waves have sculpted the volcanic rock over millions of years into some of the most jaw-dropping (and vertigo-inducing) coastlines on Earth. These towering basalt cliffs can reach heights of over 400 meters, dropping straight into churning seas below.</span></p><p><span>What's most striking is how abruptly the land stops. </span><span>There are no sandy beaches or gentle slopes here—the islands simply plunge headfirst into the Atlantic. One step you're on grass-covered clifftops, the next you're staring down hundreds of meters of sheer volcanic rock to where waves explode against the base far below.</span></p></div><p><span>The weather here is unpredictable, and changes faster than you can put your raincoat on—one minute you're in thick fog, the next you're hit with winds and piercing rain that'll knock you sideways, then suddenly the clouds part to reveal views that'll make your camera work overtime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div><div id="sm-page-widget-ZH7xXVtm" data-typeid="37956016" data-layout-column="0" data-layout-row="qd"><div><p><span>Meet the true locals of the Faroes. These wooly sheep have been roaming the islands for over a thousand years, and they outnumber people on the islands. They couldn't care less about your hiking plans and will casually block paths or graze on the edge of 200-meter cliffs like it's the most natural thing in the world.</span></p><p><span id="yui_3_8_0_1_1751237474731_12967">Faroe's name comes from a combination of </span><span>fær</span><span> (sheep) and </span><span>eyjar</span><span> (islands).&nbsp;</span></p></div><p><span> Unlike their farm-bound cousins elsewhere, Faroese sheep roam completely free across the islands, somehow always managing to find the most photogenic spots for an impromptu rest.&nbsp;</span><span>This fellow right&nbsp; here is the only one that gave me any sort of attention. Otherwise, they are all busy grazing on all the grass they could ever ask for.</span></p></div><div id="sm-page-widget-sXQLR85m" data-typeid="37956238" data-layout-column="0" data-layout-row="R"><p><span>Why fight the landscape? For over a millennium, islanders have been topping their huts with birch bark and soil and let the grass grow wild. They act as insulation, and the thick roots are an excellent waterproof seal against the weather.</span></p><p><span>The grass grows quickly and does need tending every once in a while. In typical Faroese fashion, the solution is simple: put a sheep on top for an afternoon.</span></p></div><div id="sm-page-widget-MvFwhQxs" data-typeid="37956265" data-layout-column="0" data-layout-row="xx"><p><span>On the northern tip of Kalsoy lies the Kallur lighthouse. Like most regions on the islands, the land is privately owned. Hiking usually incurs a modest fee paid at the trailhead to the land owners, and the rest is up to you. Trails are just sheep paths, worn smooth by countless hooves over years rather than any official trail maintenance.</span></p><p><span>There are no guardrails, no warning signs, and definitely no liability waivers - just you, the weather, and whatever route the sheep decided made sense. The approach to Kallur is particularly gnarly, following a knife-edge ridge with steep drops on both sides before reaching the lighthouse perched dramatically on sea cliffs.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div id="sm-page-widget-vP2j2prb" data-typeid="37956732" data-layout-column="0" data-layout-row="B9"><p><span>In </span><span>No Time To Die (2021)</span><span>, </span><span>Daniel Craig's James Bond meets his end at the villain's lair, which happened to be here on Kalsoy. The Faroese then followed through with the obvious next step.</span></p>

<p dir="auto">Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right.
Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize.</p>
<p dir="auto">Every monitor has its own separate window strip.
Windows can never "overflow" onto an adjacent monitor.</p>
<p dir="auto">Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically.
Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there's always one empty workspace present all the way down.</p>
<p dir="auto">The workspace arrangement is preserved across disconnecting and connecting monitors where it makes sense.
When a monitor disconnects, its workspaces will move to another monitor, but upon reconnection they will move back to the original monitor.</p>

<p dir="auto">Niri is stable for day-to-day use and does most things expected of a Wayland compositor.
Many people are daily-driving niri, and are happy to help in our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#niri:matrix.org" rel="nofollow">Matrix channel</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Give it a try!
Follow the instructions on the <a href="https://yalter.github.io/niri/Getting-Started.html" rel="nofollow">Getting Started</a> page.
Have your <a href="https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar">waybar</a>s and <a href="https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fuzzel" rel="nofollow">fuzzel</a>s ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.
Also check out <a href="https://github.com/Vortriz/awesome-niri">awesome-niri</a>, a list of niri-related links and projects.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some points you may have questions about:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Multi-monitor</strong>: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.</li>
<li><strong>Fractional scaling</strong>: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.</li>
<li><strong>NVIDIA</strong>: seems to work fine.</li>
<li><strong>Floating windows</strong>: yes, starting from niri 25.01.</li>
<li><strong>Input devices</strong>: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens.
You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use <a href="https://opentabletdriver.net/" rel="nofollow">OpenTabletDriver</a>.
We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.</li>
<li><strong>Wlr protocols</strong>: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy.
You can check on <a href="https://wayland.app/" rel="nofollow">wayland.app</a> at the bottom of each protocol's page.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance.
I've seen someone use it fine on an Eee&nbsp;PC&nbsp;900 from&nbsp;2008, of all things.</li>
<li><strong>Xwayland</strong>: <a href="https://yalter.github.io/niri/Xwayland.html#using-xwayland-satellite" rel="nofollow">integrated</a> via xwayland-satellite starting from niri 25.08.</li>

<p dir="auto">If you'd like to help with niri, there are plenty of both coding- and non-coding-related ways to do so.
See <a href="https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> for an overview.</p>

<p dir="auto">Niri is heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM">PaperWM</a> which implements scrollable tiling on top of GNOME Shell.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the reasons that prompted me to try writing my own compositor is being able to properly separate the monitors.
Being a GNOME Shell extension, PaperWM has to work against Shell's global window coordinate space to prevent windows from overflowing.</p>
