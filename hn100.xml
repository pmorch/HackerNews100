<p>Elemental design—there is something intriguing about the integral qualities that make a design function. Uncompromised, precise, and authentic, these forms necessitate respect to achieve a desired result. Acoustic instruments have been crafted with this care for centuries and have remained unwavering from pop culture for their rich tonalities and emotive significance as a result. Most acoustic instruments are self-explanatory in the sense that audiences can see the action being performed to produce sound. Like the beat of a drum or the strum of a guitar, both have a clear cause and effect. However, instruments like the piano hold an air of mystery.</p>







<h4><strong>Origin Leading to Innovation</strong></h4>



<p>Since the 1700s, the concept of the piano (pianoforte and beyond) has lasted the test of time for its tried-and-true mechanics and physical form. With 88 keys, three pedals, and roughly 230 metal strings taut with 18 tons of tension, recreating the piano’s form while keeping its tonality is a feat. When our CEO and Founder, Dan Harden, had the creative urge to redesign something as deeply cultural as the piano, he tackled the joy of amending its shape and sentiment in turn. Inspired by the enigma of the reimagined piano while rooting itself in the instrument’s history, Ravenchord honors its rich heritage at a new tempo. Like the bird, “Raven” attests to the cleverness of the instrument, leaving the latter part of the name, “chord,” derived from past piano lineages, such as the clavichord or harpsichord.</p>







<h4><strong>Composing Graceful Form for Optimal Function</strong></h4>



<p>The biggest challenge of the design was the piano’s encumbering string layout. For practicality, Harden knew that the instrument must maintain the same familiarity and ergonomics of a traditional piano. Therefore, its anatomy had to change. Rather than have the strings stretch out in front of the player, like a grand piano, or have the strings raised and blocking the performer’s face, like an upright piano, Harden maneuvered these around the front of the instrument—bearing a resemblance to the shape of a bird wing.</p>

<p>Ravenchord’s edifice is as distinctive and aesthetically pleasing as it is logical. The strings are arranged based on pitch and organized to sprawl in a spiral-like shape around the front of the piano. As the pianist plays, audiences can see the hammers, dampers, and other inner workings move in real-time, exposing the magic of the piano’s timeless sound. These components sit on the center spine and are activated by solenoids, a proven technology even used on some Spirio Steinways. Thus, the design is communicative of the piano’s rich identity and successively more expressive by revealing its inner workings and extraordinary function. It liberates the instrument.</p>







<h4><strong>Crafting a Multisensory Masterpiece</strong></h4>



<p>All experiences are richer when they are multi-sensory. Ravenchord’s front-facing configuration transforms the piano into a fresh, emotive, logical being, providing an added layer of dimension to each performance. Like an electric keyboard, players are visible to the audience and are able to use Ravenchord as an extension of their emotions. For added aesthetic, there is an optional subtle light behind each string that illuminates as the hammers strike. This places clear visuals on the function of the instrument, making the overall sensory experience grander with sound amplified by sight. Ultimately, the vulnerability of the exposed instrument and performer bridges the visual disconnect from the piano’s past.</p>







<blockquote>
<h3>“Ravenchord’s front-facing configuration transforms the piano into a fresh, emotive, logical being, providing an added layer of dimension to each performance.”</h3>
<cite>Dan Harden, Designer</cite></blockquote>







<p>Visibly and aurally unrestrained, Ravenchord’s frontward projection offers a pure tone without the hindrance of reflecting sound via a piano lid or releasing through its floor. Like an average piano, the lacquered, hardwood frame can be removed for proper tuning, and the key deck remains at the standard 30” height. The design plays with the confines of a traditional acoustic frame at 84” long, 18” deep, and sitting at around 500 pounds. Moreover, the gloss-black, legless, diecast steel string frame is compact, making Ravenchord lighter, easier to move, and more convenient to fit in the home.</p>

<h4><strong>Passion in Performance</strong></h4>



<p>“The whole idea of actualizing a cultural pursuit has been a joy for me because it’s not solving a problem for a client or a current everyday problem,” says Harden. “Music is one of the greatest joys of life, and to design around that is very satisfying. Furthermore, to design something of beauty is immensely empowering, and I cannot think of a better product category than music in order to express that.”</p>



<p>Ravenchord was prompted with the most honest representation of a piano at heart to maintain the integrity of the instrument and honor its function for the finest sound. Keeping these elements in harmony created a frontward projection format, and this radical redesign is not lost on Harden, but rather, is used to enhance the dynamic experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He states, “Sometimes when one is designing, it is a product to solve a client problem that maybe only 1% of the population, or less, are going to see, use, or appreciate. But no matter where you are in the world, everyone knows what a piano is. Everybody loves music. Everybody wants to play the piano. So, if Ravenchord, through its design, can stimulate one to play or visit the symphony, it leaves a positive impact on society.”</p>



<p>Granting the piano product category a new life, audiences will appreciate the instrument in a fresh light, watching its intricacies of it unfold, hearing a purer sound, and emotionally engaging with the performer.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>WDL Excellence</strong></h4>



<p>Ravenchord is a concept prototype by Dan Harden, a proud contribution to the music industry, and a nod to another part of his legacy–the Whipsaw Design Lab (WDL). WDL acts as a creative space for Whipsaw industrial designers to be inventive and expand their horizons without the constraints of a second party. Fusing this with the love of music attests to the power of design liberation.</p>

<p dir="auto">C is a perfect programming language. These are its features!<br>
When you've finished reading through all the features, check out the <a href="https://github.com/TodePond/C/blob/main/Examples.md">examples</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Exclamation Marks!</h2>
<p dir="auto">Be bold! End every statement with an exclamation mark!</p>

<p dir="auto">If you're feeling extra-bold, you can use even more!!!</p>

<p dir="auto">If you're unsure, that's ok. You can put a question mark at the end of a line instead. It prints debug info about that line to the console for you.</p>

<p dir="auto">You might be wondering what C uses for the 'not' operator, which is an exclamation mark in most other languages. That's simple - the 'not' operator is a semi-colon instead.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Immutable Data</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>New for 2023!</strong><br>
Mutable data is an anti-pattern. Use the <code>const const const</code> keyword to make a constant constant constant. Its value will become constant and immutable, and will <em>never change</em>. Please be careful with this keyword, as it is very powerful, and will affect all users globally forever.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const const pi = 3.14!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>pi</span> = <span>3.14</span>!</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Naming</h2>
<p dir="auto">Both variables and constants can be named with any Unicode character or string.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const firstAlphabetLetter = 'A'!
var const 👍 = True!
var var 1️⃣ = 1!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>firstAlphabetLetter</span> = <span>'A'</span>!

<span>print</span>(<span>2</span> + <span>2</span> === <span>5</span>)! <span>//true</span></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Arrays</h2>
<p dir="auto">Some languages start arrays at <code>0</code>, which can be unintuitive for beginners. Some languages start arrays at <code>1</code>, which isn't representative of how the code actually works. C does the best of both worlds: Arrays start at <code>-1</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const scores = [3, 2, 5]!
print(scores[-1])! //3
print(scores[0])!  //2
print(scores[1])!  //5"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>scores</span> = [<span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>5</span>]!

<span>scores</span>[<span>0.5</span>] = <span>4</span>!
<span>print</span>(<span>scores</span>)! <span>//[3, 2, 4, 5]</span></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">When</h2>
<p dir="auto">In case you really need to vary a variable, the <code>when</code> keyword lets you check a variable each time it mutates.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var health = 10!
when (health = 0) {
   print(&quot;You lose&quot;)!
}"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> <span>health</span> = <span>10</span>!
<span>when</span> (<span>health</span> = <span>0</span>) {
   <span>print</span>(<span>"You lose"</span>)!
}</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Lifetimes</h2>
<p dir="auto">C has a built-in garbage collector that will automatically clean up unused variables. However, if you want to be extra careful, you can specify a lifetime for a variable, with a variety of units.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name<2> = &quot;Luke&quot;! //lasts for two lines
const const name<20s> = &quot;Luke&quot;! //lasts for 20 seconds"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span>&lt;<span>2</span>&gt; = <span>"Luke"</span>! <span>//lasts for two lines</span>
<span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span>&lt;<span>20</span><span>s</span>&gt; = <span>"Luke"</span>! <span>//lasts for 20 seconds</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">By default, a variable will last until the end of the program. But you can make it last in between program-runs by specifying a longer lifetime.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name<Infinity> = &quot;Luke&quot;! //lasts forever"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span>&lt;<span>Infinity</span>&gt;<span></span> = <span>"Luke"</span>! <span>//lasts forever</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Variable hoisting can be achieved with this neat trick. Specify a negative lifetime to make a variable exist before its creation, and disappear after its creation.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="print(name)! //Luke
const const name<-1> = &quot;Luke&quot;!"><pre><span>print</span>(<span>name</span>)! <span>//Luke</span>
<span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span>&lt;-<span>1</span>&gt; = <span>"Luke"</span>!</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Loops</h2>
<p dir="auto">Loops are a complicated relic of archaic programming languages. In C, there are no loops.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">To install C to your command line, first install the C installer.<br>
To install the C installer, install the C installer installer.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>New for 2022!</strong><br>
Due to the complicated installation process, you can now install the 'Create C App' app that installs everything for you!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Booleans</h2>
<p dir="auto">Booleans can be <code>true</code>, <code>false</code> or <code>maybe</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var keys = {}!

<p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Abstract: The exponential dependence of resistivity on temperature 
in germanium is found to be a great big lie.  My careful theoretical modeling and painstaking experimentation reveal 1) that my equipment 
is crap, as are all the available texts on the subject and 2) that this whole exercise was a complete waste of my 
time.
</b>
 </p>

<h3><u>Introduction</u></h3> 

<p> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Electrons in germanium are confined to 
well-defined energy bands that are separated by "forbidden regions" of zero charge-carrier density.  You can 
read about it yourself if you want to, although I don't recommend it.  You'll have to wade through an obtuse, convoluted discussion about considering an arbitrary number of 
non-coupled harmonic-oscillator potentials and taking limits and so on.  The upshot is that if you heat up a sample of germanium, electrons will jump from a
non-conductive energy band to a conductive one, thereby creating a measurable change in resistivity.  This 
relation between temperature and resistivity can be shown to be exponential in certain temperature regimes 
by waving your hands and chanting "to first order".  
 </p>
<h3><u>Experiment procedure</u></h3> 

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I sifted through the box of germanium crystals and chose the one that appeared 
to be the least cracked.  Then I soldered wires onto the crystal in the spots shown in figure 2b of Lab Handout 
32.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to solder wires to germanium?  I'll tell you: real goddamn hard.  The 
solder simply won't stick, and you can forget about getting any of the grad students in the solid state labs to 
help you out. 
<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Once the wires were in place, I attached them as appropriate to the second-rate  
equipment I scavenged from the back of the lab, none of which worked properly.  I soon wised up and swiped 
replacements from the well-stocked research labs.   This is how they treat undergrads around here: they give 
you broken tools and then don't understand why  you don't get any results.

</td></tr></tbody></table>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In order to control the temperature of the germanium, I attached the crystal to a 
copper rod, the upper end of which was attached to a heating coil and the lower end of which was dipped in 
a thermos of liquid nitrogen.   Midway through the project, the thermos began leaking.  That's right: I pay a cool ten grand a quarter to 
come here, and yet they can't spare the five bucks to ensure that I have a working thermos.  
</p>
<h3><u>Results</u></h3> 

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Check this shit out (Fig. 1).  That's bonafide, 100%-real data, my friends.  I took it 
myself over the course of two weeks.  And this was not a leisurely two weeks, either; I busted my
ass day and night in order to provide you with nothing but the best data possible.   Now, let's look a bit more closely
at this data, remembering that it is absolutely first-rate.  Do you see the exponential dependence?  I sure don't.  I see a bunch of crap.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Christ, this was such a waste of my time. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Banking on my hopes that whoever grades this will just look at the pictures, I drew an 
exponential through my noise.  I believe the apparent legitimacy is enhanced by the fact that I used a complicated computer program
to make the fit.  I understand this is the same process by which the top quark was discovered.
</p>
<h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3> 

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Going into physics was the biggest mistake of my life.  I should've declared CS.  I still 
wouldn't have any women, but at least I'd be rolling in cash.

<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> is a project I worked on to learn more about Linux containers and the Linux kernel, based on other guides on the internet.
<code>barco</code> enforces a minimal set of restrictions to run untrusted code, which is not recommended for production use, where a more robust solution should be used. Some permissions however are absolutely not safe, and those are enforced by <code>barco</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Linux containers are made up by a set of Linux kernel features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>namespaces</code>: are used to group kernel objects into different sets that can be accessed by specific process trees. There are different types of <code>namespaces</code>, for example,the <code>PID</code> namespace is used to isolate the process tree, while the <code>network</code> namespace is used to isolate the network stack.</li>
<li><code>seccomp</code>: is used to limit the system calls that a process can make (handled via syscalls)</li>
<li><code>capabilities</code>: are used to set limits on what uid 0 (root) can do (handled via syscalls)</li>
<li><code>cgroups</code>: are used to limit the resources (e.g. memory, disk I/O, CPU-tme) that a process can use (handled via cgroupfs)</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> can be used to run <code>bin/sh . </code> from the <code>/</code> directory as <code>root</code> with verbose output with the following command:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setup</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> requires a number of tools and libraries to be installed to build the project and for development.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Install all required tooling and dependencies
$ sudo apt install -y make

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependencies</h3>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> depends on the following "non-standard" libraries:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>libseccomp</code>: used to set up seccomp filters</li>
<li><code>libcap</code>: used to set container capabilities</li>
<li><code>libbsd</code>: used for <code>strlcpy</code></li>
<li><code>libcuni1</code>: used for testing with CUnit</li>
<li><a href="http://argtable.org/" rel="nofollow">argtable</a>: used to parse command line arguments</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rxi/log.c">rxi/log.c</a>: used for logging</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> uses a number of LLVM-18-based tools for development, linting, formatting, debugging and checking for memory leaks.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Build</h2>
<p dir="auto">The included <code>Makefile</code> provides a few targets to build <code>barco</code>.
The variable <code>debug=1</code> can be set to run any of the targets in "debug" mode, which builds the project with the with debug symbols and without optimizations. The debug build is especially useful for the debugger and valgrind.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Build barco (executable is in bin/)
# The default target also runs, &quot;make lint&quot; and &quot;make format&quot; to lint and format the code
$ make

$ make


<span><span>#</span> Build barco with debug flags</span>
$ make debug=1</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Development</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> is developed using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a>. The repository contains all the necessary configuration files to use these tools effectively.
<code>barco</code> relies on low-level Linux features, so it must be run on a Linux system. <a href="https://github.com/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a> acts weird at times when tweaking low-level container settings: I found <a href="https://getutm.app/" rel="nofollow">getutm.app</a> to work well with <a href="http://debian.org/" rel="nofollow">Debian</a> on my Mac when in doubt.</p>
<p dir="auto">The included <code>Makefile</code> provides a few targets useful for development:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Run tests
$ make test

# Run linter
$ make lint

# Run formatter
$ make format

# Run valgrind
$ make check

# Clean the build

<p dir="auto">Furthermore, the project includes a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Code</a> configuration in <code>.vscode/</code> that can be used to run the built-in debugger (at this moment it is "disabled" since <code>barco</code> should be run as <code>root</code> and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Code</a> does not have that option).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Structure</h2>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Testing and documentation</h2>
<p dir="auto">At the moment, the project does not contain any automated tests or tools to document the code.
In the future, suitable tools for automated testing and documentation might be added.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Limitations</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> assumes that the host system is running a Linux kernel at version 6.0.x or higher and with user namespaces and cgroupsv2 enabled. The project has been tested on Debian 13.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> does not handle network namespaces, so the container cannot access the network. Networking can roughly be setup as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>create a new network namespace</li>
<li>create a virtual ethernet pair</li>
<li>move one end of the pair to the new network namespace</li>
<li>assign an IP address to the interface in the new network namespace</li>
<li>setup routing and NAT</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In C this is usually done via the <code>rtnetlink</code> interface. Furthermore, network usage can be limited with the <code>net_prio</code> cgroup controller.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Improvements</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Investigate further, document and refactor: user and mount and cgroup namespaces, syscalls and capabilities</li>
<li>The functions in <code>cgroups.c</code>, <code>mount.c</code>, <code>sec.c</code>, <code>userns.c</code> are specific to <code>barco</code> and should be made more generic</li>
<li>CMake and Conan are industry standards, so they should be used eventually instead of Make and the current build system. Unfortunately, CMake and Conan also add a lot of complexity which is not needed at this time.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-wrap">
<p><strong>I’ll tell you a secret about working in a massage parlour:</strong> it’s a lot of waiting around, usually late at night. We’d wait, half a dozen of us, in the dressing room as the evening wore on. On edge and exhausted in equal parts, we perched on the low-slung couch, adjusted the straps of our babydolls, listlessly fluffed our hair, ready to spring into action.</p>
<p><i>Girl, I’m going insane.</i></p>
<p><i>Oh please, I’m already there.</i></p>
<p>Then, we’d hear the front door open, the low murmur of a man’s voice, the chirp of the receptionist from the parlour’s reception desk. Some of us would circle the dressing room door, ready in case he wanted to see the lineup, curious if he had booked someone specific. Then, the methodical thwack of the receptionist’s pumps would sound down the long hallway as the girls swivelled towards her from their respective stations—pulling towels from the dryer, applying lipstick at the vanity, melting into the couch in a cloud of cigarettes and Pink Sugar perfume.</p>
<p>The receptionist would thrust four twenty-dollar bills into someone’s hand; maybe mine, maybe not. “You’re up. Sixty minutes in room four.” For the rest of the girls, the night wore on, dark and still.</p>
<p>Honestly, that’s most of working in a massage parlour: waiting around, wondering how much money you will—or won’t— make on any given shift. I know because I made my living that way for five years.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>I was a university dropout in my early twenties when I started that gig, struggling to find my place in Toronto, a city where squalor and decadence collided behind the glass and steel of the downtown skyline. To get by, I took a job at a massage parlour in the northwest corner of the city, a place where factories stretched several blocks, separated by the odd strip mall full of nail salons, carpet dealers, banquet halls that morphed into after-hours clubs if you knew the right people. The garish yellow “M” of McDonald’s arched high over everything, like a gateway to another world. Because of the way Toronto zoning bylaws work, most body rub parlours are relegated to this part of the city, and after dark, “massage” signs wink and flash from almost every corner. <i>Finch Alley</i>, some people call it.</p>
<p>My regular shift at the parlour ran from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m., and I worked anywhere between three and six shifts a week, depending on how the cash was flowing. It was a job that was unbearably tangible at times, an onslaught of surgical scars and sun-damaged chests I rubbed oil over, the soft pallor of flesh under my hands that rarely saw the light of day. Yet it was also predicated on a precariously suspended reality, one I had to maintain with absolute precision to do my job well, to pretend that a profound mutual desire could be found for the low, low price of $80 in a strip mall off a freeway. In real life I wouldn’t dare be so giving. I can’t say I was particularly good at any of this by the time 2 a.m. rolled around, makeup melting off my face, puffiness blooming under my eyes, a rapidly dwindling patience for the reassurance some men desperately sought: <i>So, how was it for you?</i></p>
<p>The rabbit warren of hallways and thinly-walled rooms felt insular at that hour, the click of stilettos on laminate less urgent than during the day. A dampness I always associated with the night shift hung in the air, mingling with the smell of smoke and coconut air freshener. Night shift did not discriminate, and the men who wandered in after dark were as varied as they come: they were travelling on business or headed home from factory shifts, students taking a break from all-nighters, bros on their way back from the bar. They were tall and short and young and old, of every race and cultural background imaginable. You could never predict who would come in, except to say with certainty that they would want a level of womanly validation I was simply too tired to give. Half-dressed and exhausted, I often didn’t have the patience for their hands on me, the array of intimate requests they crept in seeking—<i>touch me, kiss me</i>, <i>make me an entirely different world than the one outside these doors</i>—when all I craved was the privacy of my own bed. My world outside the parlour was small—just a ground floor apartment in midtown Toronto that overlooked an alley, while a radiator clanked and hissed at all hours of the night and day. But it was a place where my thoughts, and my body, were my own.</p>
<p>Despite the demands of the job, there was a stillness to the nights I found alluring. There was a poise to the velvety darkness of parking lots, the soft buzz of neon lights shaped like palm trees, as if they were also waiting at attention for the inevitable flurry of activity that punctuated those long periods of quiet. People’s needs at 2 a.m. are equal parts fervent and fundamental, somehow stripped of all pretense by the cover of darkness. What do you need if you’re out seeking services at night? Food, sex, shelter. The staunch of a wound. Being part of that felt like a reprieve from the day’s complexities, a world which launched a steady barrage of information and demanded endless analyses, caring little for our overstimulated brains. The days were full of subway delays and deferred student loan payments, of agonizing small talk and headlines about inflation.</p>
<p>At night we’re just animals, I was reminded. The clients, yes, seeking release they couldn’t admit during daylight hours, but also the workers who manned the various portions of the strip mall after dark. The way we cared for each other, sometimes more in silent gestures than anything else, felt connected to our deepest instincts as pack animals. No matter how much I wanted to go home, there was some comfort in the simplicity of that connection.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Memory has a way of smoothing jagged edges, leaving us with a haze of nostalgia that overlooks the most painful parts of our past lives, so I can’t be sure how much I really miss the nights themselves and how much my brain is playing tricks on me. It defies logic that any part of me longs for the precarious earnings and long hours of massage parlour work, the exhaustive level of physical and emotional intimacy required, the shame that grew exponentially the farther away I slipped from what was once a promising journalism career. I do, however, know I miss the community it gave me membership to, the pack we inadvertently travelled in. I miss the silent language we developed, the way nothing was asked of me by other night shift workers, the sense that I was enough just by showing up.</p>
<p>Cab drivers—who are also paid in cash and depend on volume for their livelihood—would pick me up at the end of shift and commiserate, rosary beads swinging from their rearview mirrors as we pulled onto dark freeways. <i>How was </i><i>work? Busy?</i> They would ask. <i>No, not really</i>, I would say. <i>You</i>? As the cab whizzed down an eerily empty Gardiner Expressway, we’d laugh, try to unpack what made a slow shift or a busy one, what made people need us—or not. <i>A dearth of sports games. The end of the month. Tax refund season. Inertia</i>. Once, a cab broke down in a snowstorm on the highway while taking me home and the driver immediately phoned his friend, another driver, and gently walked me over to his cab, parked farther down the highway when it arrived. Snow hurled sideways at us, my driver’s tie flapping in the squall, his bare forearms braced against the cold. <i>Get home safe</i>, he told me, <i>please</i>.</p>
<p>Women filled my Styrofoam cup at the twenty-four-seven coffee shop across the street from the parlour, glancing wordlessly at the strip of bare skin between my coat and the tops of my stockings, but still making sure my cup was full to the top, passing me extra packets of sugar, sometimes a muffin from the day-old basket. Kids in their early twenties manned the counter at all-night fast-food joints, where I’d go between clients on slow shifts, needing something to wake up my neurons: salt, heat, grease. The shock of cold air on my legs at midnight. We knew so little about each other’s lives—how could we?—but forced into this strange cohort of ragged work hours, I felt we sometimes shared a look of recognition: of people whittling time away as we tended to the incessant hungers of others.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When I finally did leave the sex trade after finishing my bachelor’s degree as a mature student, I spent seven years working in “good” jobs in the corporate sector. This meant, as I understood it, that I didn’t work nights, that I was a salaried employee, and that I had dental benefits. I had a shiny access card that opened doors—to a gleaming, marble elevator bank, to planters full of plastic ferns, to blocks of cubicles illuminated by fluorescent lighting, a land of perpetual daytime.</p>
<p>Unlike sex work, my “good” jobs didn’t threaten to overthrow traditional power structures. Many sex workers, including myself, have long hypothesized that the reason so many people in power work to keep the commercial sex trade marginalized is because they’re threatened by it—by the idea that it’s the only field where women outearn men, that it’s an industry where women get to call the shots, and that women profit off something that men have been told they’re entitled to for free: sex and attention in equal parts. In my experience of the corporate landscape, there was none of this radical power structure, only an upholding of the traditional: men talking and women listening, men in powerful positions getting both credit and profit for the labour of women beneath them. <i>Is this what I worked so hard for?</i> I wondered daily.</p>
<p>As I moved through this new world, merging into the throng of daytime professionals that swelled throughout the downtown core, absorbed by their smartphone screens, and proffering the barest morsels of small talk, I felt little of the camaraderie I once did while working night shifts. I’m unsure why I felt this dissonance, and it occurs to me now that it could have been more self-imposed than anything. Perhaps my experience in the parlours of Finch Alley felt so removed from what I perceived as the experience of my corporate colleagues and their “good life choices” that I created that distance myself, imposter syndrome as thick as the steam that rose from the downtown subway grates during the winter. When I was assigned a crisis communications task, which was often part of my job, I would try to cheer myself up by silently joking that after everything, my livelihood somehow still depended on men employing bad judgement. But there was nobody around who would understand, so the joke fell flat, even in my head.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I headed home from the office, stuffed onto a packed streetcar, I remembered nights when our strip mall felt like a kingdom, where we scurried from block to block like savvy woodland creatures, coats zipped over our lingerie, faces alight under the weak yellow streetlamps, dispatching coffee orders or supplies from clerks at the late-night convenience stores. Condoms. Baby oil. Hot Cheetos. “We know where <i>she</i> works,” their faces said, but it felt less like a judgement and more like an acknowledgement. We were in it together; an ecosystem of tending to each other’s needs, brazen and intimate at the same time.</p>
<p>Once I sat on the leather couch in the dressing room, which was just an extension built onto the massage parlour that housed an industrial-sized washer and dryer, a makeup table, and a precarious utility shelf crammed with supplies: towels, mineral oil, rubbing alcohol, Kleenex. Nursing a black tea, I steeled myself before my last appointment of the night. It was booked as an hour-long shower session, which I hated. Sixty minutes with a regular who would never say a word to me, who just wanted to touch my breasts as we slowly turned to prunes under the tepid water, while I tried to make each stifled yawn look like it was, in fact, a shiver of ecstasy. “I don’t know if I can make it,” I said, half joking but half imploring the five other girls who sat wedged on the couch with me, or sprawled on threadbare Ikea chairs.</p>
<p>“Baby, come sit by me,” said Cheryl, an attendant from Newfoundland in her early fifties with sun-crinkled skin the colour of almonds and a voice like gravel. I plodded over to where she sat at the makeup table and pulled up a stool.</p>
<p>“At least let me fix your hair,” she said. I complied.</p>
<p>Cheryl brushed my hair extensions out with her fingers, acrylic nails flashing, pink as Malibu. Then she took out a wide-barrel curling iron and meticulously worked my unruly hair into waves, smiling and humming periodically at her handiwork. “There,” she said when she was finished. “So pretty.”</p>
<p>I felt so much care in that moment I could barely breathe, and it occurred to me that I’d never had a woman, before or since, handle my hair so tenderly.</p>
<p>Once, the fire alarm went off in the office tower where I worked downtown. We crammed into the stairwell, lurching down dozens of flights. It was the most unscripted moment I had encountered since starting that office job and for a moment I marvelled at the chaos of it all: the unvarnished panic and confusion on people’s faces, the small gesture of kindness when I dropped my elevator card and someone picked it up for me. <i>Maybe this is it</i>, I thought. <i>Maybe this is when the adrenaline and uncertainty give way to something more human, where we seek relief in collective company</i>. <i>Maybe we’ll all go out for a drink and watch the fire trucks tend to the real emergency.</i> But when the final door banged open on ground level, spitting us out into the alley behind a steakhouse, everyone dispersed in separate directions, scattering as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/what-experts-say-eric-adams-gets-wrong-about-low-skilled-workers.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMy%20low%20skill%20workers%20%E2%80%94%20my,We%20are%20in%20this%20together.%E2%80%9D">New York mayor Eric Adams was quoted</a> referring to cooks, fast-food workers, dishwashers and messengers as “low-skill workers,” proclaiming they simply don’t have the skills to “sit in a corner office.” Like Toronto, New York relies on a variety of minimum wage and night shift workers to keep its culture “vibrant”—a term often used in city-building and real estate circles—or at least convenient. In fact, according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2015/article/night-owls-and-early-birds.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, more than fifteen million Americans work night shifts. <a href="https://www.carexcanada.ca/profile/shiftwork-occupational-exposures/">In Canada</a>, it’s closer to 1.8 million, or 12 percent of the working population. Could not a single one of those people have the “skills” to work in a corner office? When I read Adams’ quote, I was back, for the briefest of seconds, in that dark parking lot under a red-lit “massage” sign, watching the outline of a coffee shop server across the street as she wiped down the midnight counter, over and over. I thought of her thankless work and the comfort she provided to so many people moving through that transient space, the way she may have wanted to do something—anything—else with her time, but perhaps was not afforded the opportunity to. What a world in which her labour went unvalued, perhaps unnoticed altogether.</p>
<p>Adams’ comments ricocheted through social media for months, at one point resulting in a tweet about how most corner office professionals wouldn’t be able to handle even one overnight shift at Waffle House. But Adams isn’t alone in his simplistic view; many of the jobs that require overnight shifts are considered “low skill” roles by those in power, regardless of how essential they might be. How quickly the discourse moves from “frontline workers” to “low-skilled labourers” as soon as the concepts of unions or minimum wage increase make an appearance. This idea of night shift jobs being less desirable, work people do because they “have to,” not because they want to, is true sometimes. It was obvious to me that many in my night shift network were working gigs as a stopgap on the way to something else, but to me that never made any of us less deserving. In reality, I thought of us as some of the strongest, the most resourceful, the most skilled at defusing confrontations that often come with late-night interactions.</p>
<p>“You’re better than this job,” clients sometimes said to me while I was working nights. Often they’d say it in the awkward and delicate moments immediately after a session, as we towelled off together and I stripped the massage table—moments where men were often fraught with shame, resignation, and satiation in equal parts, and words tumbled clumsily from their mouths. They meant it as a compliment, but it was a sentiment I hated. <i>You’re better than this</i>. As though somewhere, there was a woman who wasn’t.</p>
<p>I’ve seen security guards diffuse a knife fight. I once watched a fast-food server placate a violent customer with nothing more than her voice and a stale honey cruller at her disposal. I’ve met few professionals since who I think could handle those wearying hours and even fewer who could still react with tact and effectiveness under pressure, especially considering the low, precarious wages these gigs often pay. Plus, there’s a danger to working jobs with these hours and demands on a long-term basis. Statistics have long shown that <a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797%252814%252900623-0/fulltext">people who work night shifts are more likely to battle stress, illness, even premature death</a>. Whether those late-night needs—for food, for sex—are real or perceived, as long as there’s a demand, profit-driven businesses will want to capitalize on it, perhaps at the very expense of the workers who take those shifts. The price we pay to keep cities thrumming and hungers satiated at all hours of the night and day is steep.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>It’s been years since I held a job requiring those kinds of late-night shifts. I woke recently at exactly 2 a.m., as I often do, pulled from slumber by some unnameable cue. I poured a glass of water and stood at my apartment window, suspended high above a ribbon of expressway. From behind the glass, everything was hushed at that hour. Then I reminded myself that an entire ecosystem still hums and clanks and keeps the world stitched together quietly: the municipal salt truck scattering brine down the street. The yellow sign of the twenty-four-seven grocery down the block advertising milk, bread, cigarettes. The wink of a red taillight as it trails across the expressway and flashes out of sight. I can’t, of course, know who it might be; perhaps another aimless man not ready to go home yet, rootless and restless and looking for validation in all the wrong places; perhaps another night shift worker on her way home, forming an unspoken understanding with her cab driver. Sometimes I think I have nothing to show for those years spent tending to people’s needs after hours, a period of my life as brief and transient as the red glow of that receding taillight. But I know the stories of the city after dark, and I keep those with me, always.</p>

		<p>

						August 2, 2023

		<div id="post-19611">
				<p>For months, supporters of Bill C-18, the Online News Act, assured the government that Meta and Google were bluffing when they warned that a bill based on mandated payments for links was unworkable and they would comply with it by removing links to news from their platforms. However, what has been readily apparent for months became reality yesterday: Meta is now <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/06/changes-to-news-availability-on-our-platforms-in-canada/">actively blocking</a> news links and sharing on its Facebook and Instagram platforms. The announcement does not reference Threads, but it would not surprise if news links are ultimately blocked on that platform as well. The company says that the blocking will take several weeks to fully roll out to all users, suggesting that it has learned from the over-blocking mistakes made in Australia and is proceeding more cautiously in Canada. By the end of the month, the world’s largest social media platform will become a news desert in Canada, with links to all news – both Canadian and foreign – blocked on the platform.</p>
<p>It is worth revisiting that it was only a couple of months ago that some industry leaders, lobbyists, and academics were assuring the Senate that the Meta threat was just a bluff. Kevin Desjardins of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, referenced the Australian experience, and <a href="https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/Committee/441/TRCM/54EV-56205-E">told the Senate committee</a> studying the bill that “when legislated to do so, they will come to the table.” Sylvain Poisson of Hebdos Quebec <a href="https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/Committee/441/TRCM/54EV-56205-E">confidently</a> said “they made those threats in Australia and elsewhere and every time they back down.” Chris Pedigo of the U.S.-based Digital Context Next <a href="https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/Committee/441/TRCM/50EV-56141-E">assured the committee</a> “it’s important to understand what happens when these bills become law. In Australia, they moved quickly to secure deals. They have done similar work in Europe, and I expect it would happen quickly in Canada as well.” And Carleton professor Dwayne Winseck said “I am not worried. The threats they are making, they are doing this all around the world.”</p>
<p>Despite the assurances, the company was true to its word and blocking news links is now here. If this is a negotiation tactic, it’s a pretty strange one given that reports indicate the company is not talking to the government about potential changes to a law that has already received royal assent. Indeed, while the new Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge <a href="https://twitter.com/mgeist/status/1686486790054572032?s=20">urged the company to participate in the regulatory process</a>, there is nothing in the regulations that could alter the fundamental principle in the bill of mandated payments for links. At best, the government could toss aside its commitment to stay out of negotiations by using the regulations to dictate to the supposedly independent CRTC how much needs to be spent in order to avoid Bill C-18’s final offer arbitration provisions. Government negotiating total payment value and eviscerating the CRTC’s independence does not inspire confidence and Meta reasonably wants no part of it, since the time to fix Bill C-18 was before it received royal assent, not after.</p>
<p>It is difficult to overstate the harm that Bill C-18 will create for the media sector in Canada, with enormous losses that will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Indeed, just the exit of Meta will lead to the losses that include the cancellation of existing deals, lost links that accounts for as much as 30% of referral traffic, and no new revenues from Bill C-18 from one of the two platforms that were supposed to fall under the law. The move virtually guarantees that Bill C-18 will represent a setback for the sector and a cautionary tale for a government that blithely ignored the warning signs, seemed to welcome a fight with the tech companies, and had no Plan B. In fact, if Google follows suit, there will be even more cancelled deals, lost links, and absolutely no new revenues from the legislation given that those are the only companies subject to the law (former Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez’s insistence that there is value in links that deserve compensation while simultaneously excluding Microsoft, Apple, Twitter and other platforms from the law amply demonstrates how the argument stands on shaky grounds).</p>
<p>As disbelief has shifted to acceptance, Canadian media outlets are now rushing to promote direct access to their content via web, email or any other non-social media platform. The government is also seemingly hoping to drum up support for its ad boycott of Meta, yet given that the <a href="https://twitter.com/mgeist/status/1686489588976488448?s=20">Liberal party launched new ads on Facebook just this week</a>, that may be a hard sell. Instead, having rejected alternatives that could have avoided this outcome, the government has remarkably created a lose-lose-lose-lose scenario.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Canadian media is a loser, particularly the small and independent media outlets that are more reliant on social media to develop community and build their audience. The loss of Facebook links will take a serious toll and undermine innovative companies in Canada. The Internet platforms are losers as they comply with an unreasonable law by removing links and making their services objectively worse in order to do so. Individual Canadians who use the platforms to find links to news are losers since news links will be blocked from the platform. And the government is a loser, as having dismissed critics and ignored repeated warnings about the risks associated with its bill, it has now left Canada as the global example of digital policy disastrously gone wrong. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/">https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37023885">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>You might have used <code>libvirt</code>, a Linux daemon that provides an abstraction
and management layer for virtualization software. This daemon allows you
to submit an XML file containing a description of a VM, disk image or network.
<code>libvirt</code> is then able to configure, start it and keep it running.</p>
<p>There is a peculiar limitation in VMs started by <code>libvirt</code>:
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1408810">they can only support up to 14 hotpluggable PCIe slots</a>.
Attempting to start a VM with 15 PCIe slots will fail.</p>
<p>14 seems like an absurdly low number, so why exactly 14? It turns out
this is the result of a chain of events that began in 1970.</p>
<h2 id="datapoint-2200-and-intel-8008">Datapoint 2200 and Intel 8008</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/dp2200.jpg" alt="Datapoint 2200"></p>
<p>In June 1970, the Computer Terminal Corporation announced
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datapoint_2200">Datapoint 2200</a>, a programmable
computer terminal.</p>
<p>The Datapoint 2200 contained a primitive CPU, two of its instructions being <code>INP</code>/<code>OUT</code>.
These instructions were designed to read or write one byte of data from one
of 8 input/output ports.</p>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/8008.jpg" alt="Intel 8008"></p>
<p>Intel was tasked with consolidating a number of discrete modules in the Datapoint 2200
into one, and they came up with Intel 8008, a one-chip CPU that implemented the same
instruction set.</p>
<h2 id="intel-8080">Intel 8080</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/8080.jpg" alt="Intel 8080"></p>
<p>When Intel engineers had set out to develop a new product that eventually became
known as the Intel 8080, they were definitely inspired by the 8008 instruction set,
so the 8080 ISA contains the <code>IN</code>/<code>OUT</code> instructions, though they extended to 256
addresses.</p>
<p>I’m not a hardware engineer, so I’m not entirely sure why this CPU retained the
separate I/O address space instead of using memory-mapped peripherals like other CPUs.
I’ll defer to <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/a/25528">this explanation</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>it made peripherals cheaper</li>
<li>it didn’t hog the very limited address space; the 8080 only had 64 KiB available.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="intel-8086-pc-and-x86-64">Intel 8086, PC and x86-64</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/8086.jpg" alt="Intel 8086"></p>
<p>Intel 8086 was designed to simplify porting of software from the 8080, so it retained
the I/O instructions in the ISA. However, it expanded their addresses to full 16 bit,
allowing 65536 I/O ports.</p>
<p>The IBM PC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output_base_address">extensively used</a>
I/O ports for peripherals such as the interrupt controller, system timer and keyboard.
These ports have been enshrined in PC-compatible computers ever since, although
their usage has decreased over time.</p>
<p>However, unlike the memory address space, which grew from 64 KiB in 8080 to 1 MiB in 8086,
and to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_5-level_paging">128PiB in Ice Lake</a>, I/O address
space has remained fixed at 65536 addresses.</p>
<h2 id="pci">PCI</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/pci.jpg" alt="PCI"></p>
<p>In 1990, Intel started developing a new computer bus to replace MCA and EISA,
eventually known as PCI.</p>
<p>This bus acknowledged the need for peripherals to communicate with the host via shared
memory, however it also provided the option for a PCI device to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Component_Interconnect#PCI_address_spaces">reserve a range
of I/O ports</a>.
Unlike the orignial PC, this reservation is not fixed; however the reserved
range had to be continuous.</p>
<p>I can only guess why the new bus has such an x86-specific feature. It might have
been a design decision made to simplify the adaptation of hardware peripherals
that utilize I/O ports to a new bus. Or it might have been the result of Intel
engineers designing the specification to match Intel hardware.</p>
<h2 id="pci-bridges">PCI bridges</h2>
<p>I/O ports reservation would not be a big issue: it was an optional feature,
so if no cards were plugged in that requested it, no I/O ports would have
to be reserved.</p>
<p>However, engineers working on the PCI specification developed
<a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/551427/files/cer-2308933.pdf">PCI bridges</a>
as a way to increase the address space of the bus, as a PCI bus without bridges
can only contain 63 devices.</p>
<p>To handle PCI devices that request ranges of I/O ports, a PCI bridge
must reserve I/O ports for itself. PCI does not support dynamic port allocation,
so every bridge must reserve I/O ports upon powering on.</p>
<p>Moreover, PCI bridge specification states that the reservation granularity
of I/O ports is 4K, so every bridge must allocate a minimum of 4K of I/O ports
to handle a PCI card that requests as few as one port.</p>
<p>PCI bridges were quite static hardware, so this was not a major consideration
when the bridges were introduced. Several 4096 I/O port blocks were allocated
from a 65536 I/O address space, and provided the PCI bus was not extraordinarily
large, it generally worked out well.</p>
<h2 id="pcie">PCIe</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/pcie.jpg" alt="PCIe"></p>
<p>In 2003, the PCI Express bus was created to replace the PCI and maintain
backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>Due to compatibility considerations, any PCIe slot is represented in the PCI
hierarchy as a PCI bridge.</p>
<p>You can see where it is going:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PCI bridge must request at least 4K contiguous I/O ports to serve cards
that request I/O ports,</li>
<li>Every PCIe slot is a PCI bridge,</li>
<li>Thus, the maximum total number of PCIe slots in any PC is 16 (= 65536/4096).
However, the actual number will be less, given the presence of legacy PC devices,
especially in virtualized environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The designers of PCIe have recognized this limitation and stipulated that any
PCIe hardware must still be functional if its I/O port request is not fulfilled.</p>
<h2 id="qemu">QEMU</h2>
<p>QEMU <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/qemu-devel/patch/1501964858-5159-5-git-send-email-zuban32s@gmail.com/#20795751">has an option</a>
for PCIe root ports to disable I/O allocation.</p>
<p>I’m at loss as to why it’s off by default. Could there be configurations where
this is not going to work, such as PCI device plugged into PCIe-&gt;PCI bridge?</p>
<p>Anyway, the option is available, and if used, the amount of PCIe slots
in the QEMU machine won’t be limited to 16 (it will instead be limited by the number
of PCI bus numbers, as each PCI bridge uses one number, but that’s a different
story).</p>
<h2 id="libvirt">libvirt</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/libvirt.png" alt="libvirt logo"></p>
<p>Given that QEMU has provided this option for some time, one might think
it’s simply a matter of adding another option to the libvirt domain definition.</p>
<p>It already supports a number of obscure options (you can make QEMU claim to
support a CPU feature regardless of whether the host CPU supports it, really?), so
adding one more would fit in just fine.</p>
<p>Nope. <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1408810">“there are no plans to address it further or fix it in an upcoming release”</a>.</p>
<p>So if you wish to have more than 14 PCIe slots in your VM, you’ll have to use
QEMU directly.</p>

<p>Zoom is asking all of its employees to return to the office for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began, when the tech company blew up as one of the main means of communication for people forced to work from home.</p>



<p>Zoom, which remains a leader in the post-pandemic remote work trend, is now asking all employees within 50 miles of a company office to go in at least two days a week on a hybrid schedule.</p>



<p>“We believe that a structured hybrid approach – meaning employees that live near an office need to be onsite two days a week to interact with their teams – is most effective for Zoom,” a spokesperson <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-tells-employees-return-to-office-remote-work-video-conferencing-2023-8">told Business Insider</a> in a statement. “As a company, we are in a better position to use our own technologies, continue to innovate, and support our global customers.”</p>

<p>The San Jose-based company’s shares <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/01/zoom-shares-up-over-35-percent-after-monster-second-quarter/">skyrocketed</a> six-fold in 2020 when the pandemic left millions of employees who needed to connect with coworkers online stranded in their homes, according to the outlet. Zoom quickly emerged as the go-to video conferencing service.</p>



<p>Towards the end of 2021, however, Zoom’s stock <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/23/zoom-shares-drop-18-amid-slowed-revenue-growth/">plummeted</a> and the company has since lost at least $100 billion in market value.</p>



<p>The stock stagnated again this year as workers have returned to their offices across the country, cutting the reliance on video communications, Business Insider reported.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>Welcome to BIG, a newsletter on the politics of monopoly power. If you’d like to sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so </span><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/subscribe" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></em></p><p>Since 1890, there have been a few antitrust trials that shaped the biggest corporations in America. Standard Oil. American Tobacco. U.S. Steel. Alcoa. AT&amp;T. IBM. Microsoft. These cases are almost always against high-tech firms that control a key sector of the economy, and win or lose, they determine what our society looks like going forward.</p><p>Because of a ruling last week, we’re about to add Google to that list of famous corporations facing a monopolization claim by the government. For two months this fall, a judge named Amit Mehta, who is presiding over this antitrust case against Google, will become one of the most important economic policymakers in the world.</p><p><span>Judge Mehta will be this important because of Google’s outsized place in our society. The firm knows more about most people than their families, answering intimate questions from billions of us, every day, and controlling much of our communications to boot. It has 95% market share in search, annual revenue of a little less than $300 billion, and 15 products with more than 500 million users. We’ve perhaps never seen any corporate asset as powerful as Google search, with marketing professor Scott Galloway going so far as to say in 2017 that “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyH3LWJdmaE" rel="">Google is God</a><span>.” </span></p><p><span>And at trial, Google will use that dominance as its main narrative, essentially saying 'Why are you picking on us? Our search engine is awesome!

And that’s because of the historical importance of the AT&amp;T antitrust case, shown to all who enter the building and pass that hall. The D.C. district court matters because of big swings like that one, because of judges like Greene.</p><p>Greene was an immigrant, and an extraordinary American. Born in Germany in 1923, he fled the Nazis, enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II, and then went to night school. He ended up at the Justice Department, where he helped draft the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1978, Jimmy Carter put him on the court as a district judge. </p><p><span>A few years later, Greene issued a ruling finding that AT&amp;T was </span><a href="https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-american-tel-and-tel-co-4" rel="">monopolizing</a><span> a ‘broad variety’ of telecommunications equipment and services. AT&amp;T, realizing it was going to lose, agreed with the Justice Department to break itself up. Greene was a fair man, but no fool. He was highly attuned to the vagaries of political corruption and what Congress meant in passing various antitrust laws, such as the Tunney Act, to let judges block corrupt consent decrees between the government and powerful firms. Greene even disparaged earlier settlements with AT&amp;T by the Department of Justice as “blatantly inequitable and improper,” and demanded one that would fulfill the “goal of de-concentrating AT&amp;T's vast economic power.” </span></p><p><span>And so it did. The break-up delivered. Rates soon came down for consumers, but far more importantly, there was a </span><a href="https://www.promarket.org/2023/02/20/when-considering-breaking-up-big-tech-we-should-look-back-to-att/" rel="">massive explosion of innovation</a><span>, including, in all likelihood, the development of the internet and mobile telephony. It’s hard to overstate the impact of this decision, ushering as it did in the modern telecommunications era. (Greene was known for a time as the ‘father’ of telecommunications law.)</span></p><p><span>And this remarkably beneficial change happened because the case landed in the lap of a man with a deep perspective on power and life. “I guess my tendency is, in a sense, to be for the person who appears to be pushed around,” Greene </span><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0709/070916.html" rel="">said</a><span> in an interview about how he understood the law as an instrument of fairness for those without power. This isn’t to say Greene always ruled in favor of the little guy, he knew anyone could violate the law. But he did recognize the temptations of power, which he saw up close in Nazi Germany. “I never think my past experience has anything to do with my judicial philosophy,” he said, “but one thing you do learn living in a dictatorship is that there is no impartial law.” Fairness was intrinsic to Greene’s thinking, so he was willing to follow the statute laid out by Congress, even if that meant applying the law as written to an iconic center of concentrated power in America.</span></p><p><span>This fall, another immigrant jurist, Judge Amit Mehta, will take up Greene’s mantle, in the same building displaying a cartoon of the great man tangled up in phone cords. Last week, Mehta </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.626.0_2.pdf" rel="">ruled</a><span> that today’s giant monopoly, Google, must face the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, as well as state attorneys general, in a trial over whether it has monopolized the search market. Mehta issued an opinion on summary judgment in which he stated that the accusations laid out by the plaintiffs, if proved at trial, show that Google’s business model is illegal, and that the firm might need to be split up. </span></p><p>The case coming to trial was first brought under Trump in 2020 and continued by Biden. It is also the first monopolization case brought to trial by the Antitrust division in 25 years, since Microsoft in 1998. </p><p><span>What’s the allegation in the case? The government </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-a-google-antitrust-case-could" rel="">argues</a><span> that Google has a monopoly of general search and search advertising, roughly 90-95% of the market. Google has maintained this monopoly, the government alleges, not by making a better product, but by locking down everywhere that consumers might be able to find a different search engine option, and making sure they only see Google.</span></p><p><span>How does Google lock out rivals? Well, it pays </span><a href="https://fourweekmba.com/traffic-acquisition-cost/" rel="">$45 billion a year</a><span> to have distributors refuse to carry its competitor’s products, </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328941/download" rel="">signing deals</a><span> with “Apple, LG, Motorola, and Samsung; major U.S. wireless carriers such as AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon; and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb— to secure default status for its general search engine and, in many cases, to specifically prohibit Google’s counterparties from dealing with Google’s competitors.”</span></p><p>Essentially, Google has bought up all of the shelf space where search is placed in front of consumers, which is to say browsers and phones. This behavior is very similar to what Microsoft did in the 1990s, when it bundled its browser with its operating system, and signed deals with ISPs to block its browser rival Netscape from getting access to customers. The analogy isn’t a coincidence, as the Microsoft case is controlling precedent. </p><p><span>It should be a slam-dunk case, and not just because Google search has become much much worse over the last five to ten years, packed increasingly with ads and poor results. To understand why this case makes sense, look no further than the experience of Neeva, a search engine </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23802382/search-engine-google-neeva-android" rel="">whose quality</a><span> was as high or higher than that of Google, but died a few months ago because it just couldn’t get access to customers. Neeva, according to David Pierce in </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23802382/search-engine-google-neeva-android" rel="">the Verge</a><span>, was “running an AI product, a full-stack search engine, and a privacy-first browser… If people went through all the bother of switching, they became converts,” Pierce wrote. “The problem was that very few of them managed to make it past the thicket of default settings and redirections.”</span></p><p>I actually used Neeva, and it was excellent, an innovative service better than Google. But as all defaults are set to Google, there are an endless number of screens encouraging people to set their search engine to that of the search giant. So Neeva, despite its quality, couldn’t get in front of potential customers. It died.</p><p><span>These default settings and redirections are what’s on trial, because that’s what killed Neeva, and prevents anyone from investing in the next search competitor. If Google is found guilty and disciplined reasonably by being broken apart and having a </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-russian-antitrust-enforcers-defeated" rel="">choice screen</a><span> imposed, then the new technologies of machine learning/AI will be deployed in a competitive marketplace, with immense possibilities similar to those after the AT&amp;T break-up. And it’s not just newcomers like Neeva who could compete. In 2020, the Financial Times reported that </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fd311801-e863-41fe-82cf-3d98c4c47e26" rel="">Apple is preparing its own search engine</a><span> in case its deal with Google falls apart due to this very antitrust case.  </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png" width="578" height="431" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:431,&quot;width&quot;:578,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:72424,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>So if the government wins, we’ll see immense innovation and new entrants. If Google wins, however, then machine learning/AI will be deployed consistent with how Google, and perhaps Microsoft, chooses to deploy them, which is to say, slowly, un-creatively, and in service to monopoly power. </p><p>In many ways, cases like these are why Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, and why antitrust laws are considered the ‘Magna Carta of free enterprise.’ The inflection point here is like that of telecom in the 1980s - would we be a society of walled gardens controlled by AT&amp;T, or one with competition where consumers could get access to this thing called… the internet? That’s the question Greene answered, with courage and wisdom. And now Mehta gets his shot to answer that same question.</p><p>But the stakes, and the merits of the case, are about where the similarities between these two periods end. When Greene presided over the AT&amp;T trial, America was a much more equal society, and there simply weren’t very many monopolies. AT&amp;T was an anomaly, a regulated monopoly whose long distance business was being assaulted by MCI and new ways of carrying voice transmission. There was also a fairly robust regulatory apparatus - the Federal Communications Commission hadn’t yet been gutted, and many states regulated phone prices effectively as well. Moreover, antitrust precedent was pretty good, judges were mostly not libertarians, and the corporate world accepted the rule of law as a meaningful check on their behavior.</p><p><span>This is not to say the politics of the case were easy. The Defense Department and the Commerce Department opposed the case, and Ronald Reagan was highly and explicitly favorable to big business. Moreover, the case had been inherited from the Carter administration, and Reagan had a very different view of antitrust. Indeed, his antitrust chief, Bill Baxter, </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-secret-plot-to-unleash-corporate" rel="">mostly ended antitrust enforcement</a><span>, dropping the major IBM challenge that had been pursued since the 1960s. But in the case of AT&amp;T, Baxter sought to litigate this particular complaint “to the eyeballs.” There was a very Reaganite rationale to his aggression. Baxter did not care that AT&amp;T was a monopoly, but believed in deregulation, and thought the regulated part of AT&amp;T was unfairly cross-subsidizing its position in long distance. It was an unusual situation, not just Greene getting the case in his lap, but Baxter’s ideological inflexibility and genuine good faith.</span></p><p><span>Today, almost everything is different. Let’s start with the judge. Mehta is an immigrant, but other than that, his career tracks very much like the technocratic elites characterizing most of our judges. He does not have the experiences of Greene, who saw in the Nazis just how dangerous concentrated power truly can be. By contrast, Mehta grew up in a suburb of Maryland, worked at the big law firm Latham and Watkins for a few years of training, was a public defender in D.C., and then served as a white collar defense attorney. This isn’t to say Mehta is hostile to antitrust, he </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-in-google-lawsuit-presided-over-major-antitrust-case-11603293204" rel="">did block </a><span>the merger of Sysco and US Foods, though that one was fairly obvious. It’s just that Mehta is mostly a creature of D.C., and he doesn’t, as far as I can tell, have a strong record of recognizing the threat of concentrated corporations, or an instinctive skepticism of the powerful. </span></p><p><span>We can already see some problematic choices from Mehta. Google executives, including its CEO Sundar Pichai, have been found, in </span><a href="https://sfstandard.com/technology/judge-sanctions-google-for-deleting-internal-chat-logs-central-to-antitrust-cases/" rel="">multiple cases</a><span>, including this one, of </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-says-google-destroyed-evidence-related-to-antitrust-lawsuit-5dad2d6" rel="">destroying evidence</a><span> related to potential antitrust violations. Apparently, chat logs involving discussions over antitrust </span><a href="https://sfstandard.com/technology/group-suing-google-claims-ceo-sundar-pichai-involved-in-deleting-evidence/" rel="">show</a><span> “that Pichai personally asked whether a chat group’s history could be turned off and then attempted to delete that message.” A different judge in California sanctioned Google for this bad behavior, but not Mehta. Indeed, Mehta has fretted about document destruction, but so far has done nothing. This kind of bad faith behavior by Google, and lack of sanctioning from Mehta, is exactly what Judge Greene would never have tolerated. It is a statement through inaction that the law doesn’t apply to the powerful.</span></p><p><span>One reason for this kind of behavior is that the America in which Mehta is operating is different than the America of Greene’s era. In 1982, AT&amp;T was a one-off, a regulated monopoly in a generally competitive corporate American order. Google, by contrast, is a pace setter of an America that is now full of monopolies, because of the lack of antitrust enforcement for decades. Today, corporate executives see the law as mere suggestions, and generally believe they can get away with anything. Judges have adopted an attitude of deference to corporate power, as Mehta did on document destruction. (This isn’t unique to judges; Merrick Garland’s former spokesperson, Anthony Coley, is </span><a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyColey/status/1687553360478552065" rel="">a cheerleader for Google</a><span> and even implied his former boss is engaged in unethical actions in litigating a Trump-era case.) </span></p><p>There is also a loss of faith in American institutions writ broadly, which differs from the 1980s. At the same time as he’s been dealing with Google, Mehta is presiding over trials of January 6th perpetrators, a showcase of the deep fissures that simply did not exist decades earlier. One result is that the politics of corporate power is very different, and that antitrust is on a generational and bipartisan upswing. (Indeed, Trump’s Attorney General Bill Barr brought the case, Biden’s antitrust chief, Jonathan Kanter, is continuing it.)</p><p>The net effect is that Mehta is an important actor here, but not as important as Greene. The case is likely to be appealed, probably all the way to the Supreme Court. And if the Supreme Court erodes antitrust caselaw against Google, then Congress will be confronted with the reality that it is hard to use the existing antitrust laws to address big tech. But ultimately if no cases against dominant firms succeed, then eventually Congress will change the law. Moreover, this case isn’t a one-off; the environment is less like AT&amp;T in 1982, or even Microsoft in 1998, and more like that of the turn of the 19th century, when Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson brought dozens of cases against dominant firms. This is one chapter in the fight over corporate power, but not the only one.</p><p>So far, I’ve laid out the arguments in the case, and the historical context. But what about Google? What do they say about the allegations? Google’s essential argument is that search is about economies of scale, and that it owns the whole market because consumers prefer its search engine to rivals. While Google may engage in behavior to exclude competitors, it needs to do so to get the data to improve its search engine. </p><p><span>Fundamentally, Google argues, its ability to exclude others is a good deal for America. Consumers love Google search so much that its monopoly is legal. As Google lawyer John Schmidtlein put it, “conduct that is a superior product</span><em> </em><span>or competition on the merits cannot, as a matter of law, violate the antitrust laws, regardless of its effect</span><em>.</em><span>” Basically, Google argues, we can do whatever we want as long as we can show consumers are happy.</span></p><p><span>While this argument isn’t necessarily persuasive to me, it is a very strong narrative to someone like Mehta. To people like us, it’s clear that Google is coasting, and produces an increasingly shoddy product. (As one ex-Googler </span><a href="https://medium.com/@pravse/the-maze-is-in-the-mouse-980c57cfd61a" rel="">recently put it</a><span>, “Google has 175,000+ capable and well-compensated employees who get very little done.”) Google used to be magic, but that was 10 years ago. Today search increasingly sucks, full of too many ads and crappy results </span><a href="https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/google-search-results-prioritize-google-products-over-competitors" rel="">peddled for Google’s own self-interest</a><span>. For </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/19/google-search-results-monopoly/" rel="">instance</a><span>, as the Washington Post noted in 2020:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The </span><a href="https://archive.org/web/" rel="">Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine</a><span> stored some Google search results over the years. When we look back, a picture emerges of how Google increasingly fails us. There’s more space dedicated to ads that look like search results. More results start with answer “snippets” — sometimes incorrect — ripped from other sites. And increasingly, results point you back to Google’s own properties such as Maps and YouTube, where it can show more ads and gather </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13" rel="">more of your data</a><span>.</span></p></blockquote><p>Many judges believe what corporate executives say, and so Mehta is likely to hear from Google’s CEO that economies of scale are all that drives product quality, and he may buy that. </p><p>I bet Google executives believe that as well. Still, such an argument isn’t very different from what every monopoly has always argued; Standard Oil discussed how it brought cheap kerosene to the masses, AT&amp;T stressed its awesome quality and universal service, and Alcoa said that its control over aluminum was a result of its focus and dedication to America. Monopolists always believe they are serving humanity, but Congress made it clear by passing antitrust laws that monopolies, whatever they may say or think, are not actually doing that. And the evidence, from Standard Oil’s break-up leading to the development of gasoline to the suit against IBM creating the software industry, suggests Congress was right.</p><p>Last week, Mehta ruled in the summary judgment stage, which is the part where the judge decides what the trial will be about. Trials clear up factual and legal disputes, so the decision this week was about which disputes should be litigated. What Mehta ruled is most of the Antitrust Division’s case is good to go. </p><p>Google’s main argument to get the case dismissed was that the various contracts to set Google as the default search engine weren’t exclusive, since consumers and partners could technically choose other search engines to use if they wanted to. Mehta rejected this argument, and said that the issue would be decided at trial. That was a big loss for Google. There were a few technical areas where Google narrowed the path for the Antitrust Division to win, but the core of the case is on to trial.</p><p>The main win for Google was on the state attorneys general case, led by Colorado. Colorado made bigger claims than the DOJ, arguing that Google self-preferenced its own reviews ahead of Yelp’s, or its own travel services ahead of those like Expedia. Judge Mehta tossed these claims, saying that services like Yelp and Expedia aren’t general search engines and are therefore not in the same market as Google. It was a highly technical and annoying way to read certain legal questions, but bringing an antitrust case has become virtually impossible unless it’s done perfectly. Fortunately, a lot of the case survived.</p><p>The net effect is that a trial will start on September 12 and go for roughly two months. Depending on what happens, there may be additional time spent on a remedy, or it may go on appeal. As witnesses testify, from Google executives to rivals, we’re going to learn an enormous amount about how the internet developed, how advertising is sold, and why decisions about what we search for happen the way they do. It’s pretty disconcerting so much key evidence was destroyed, but it will still be a massively educational experience.</p><p><span>This trial, and even the case, isn’t the end. There are other cases that Google has to deal with into the fall and next year. For instance, Judge James Donato is allowing a class action trial over Google’s app store monopoly in November, which could cost Google tens of billions of dollars in damages. And in another case, Google has been trying to keep an antitrust claim from the state of Texas and a bunch of state AGs in New York, but a judicial panel </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/judicial-panel-refuses-pause-return-texas-lawsuit-against-google-2023-08-03/" rel="">just ruled</a><span> that the case will go back to be heard in Texas. Then there’s the Federal government’s trial in Virginia on Google’s monopolization of the software underpinning most online advertising. Other parts of the firm, like Google Maps, are </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/22/doj-google-maps-antitrust-probe-00084058" rel="">being investigated</a><span> as well. </span></p><p>I can’t say this trial will work out one way or the other. Given his passivity as Google destroyed documents, Judge Mehta has aways to go before he lives up to the legacy of Harold Greene. But I don’t want to assume anything, or be unfair to Mehta. After all, current antitrust caselaw is much weaker than it was in 1982. And frankly, the case is bigger than Mehta, or the D.C. Circuit judges who will hear an appeal, or perhaps even the Supreme Court. The public is actually engaged in a way they haven’t been in our lifetimes. Ten years ago, the FTC shut down a monopolization case against Google with a 5-0 vote, and zero controversy. That would never happen today. Indeed, regardless of how Mehta rules, it’s going to be a big deal.</p><p>Reviving laws to constrain corporate power takes time, as people within many institutions must change their minds, and come to grips with the choice of living in a free society or one dominated by monopolies. Fortunately, that change is happening. In September and October, we’ll start to see some of the fruits of that change. And hopefully, Judge Mehta will live up to the legacy of the D.C. district court, set forty one years ago by the courage of Harold Greene.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/08/06/baldurs-gate-3-prepared-for-100000-concurrent-players-theyve-gotten-700000/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/08/06/baldurs-gate-3-prepared-for-100000-concurrent-players-theyve-gotten-700000/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37023089">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion><p>Baldur's Gate 3</p></fbs-accordion><small>Larian</small></figcaption></figure>
<p>I am running out of ways to describe not just what a success Baldur’s Gate 3 is, but on a scale that no one, not even its developer Larian, predicted.</p>

<p>Larian’s Swen Vincke posted a tweet yesterday showing the game hitting 500,000 concurrent players, making it the third most played game on all of Steam behind only CSGO and DOTA 2. He said that he told IT to only expect 100,000 concurrents at max.</p>


<p>That gap has widened even further. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" target="_blank" title="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" aria-label="peak yesterday was 712,281 players">peak yesterday was 712,281 players</a>, surpassing games like DOTA 2, Rust, Apex Legends, GTA 5 and PUBG. Mind you, this is a single player, hardcore RPG.</p>


<p>Past that, Baldur’s Gate has now broken into the top 10 peak playercounts in Steam history. It’s currently #9, getting dangerously close to Hogwarts Legacy’s 879,308, a high water mark from earlier this year. Above those two are New World, Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Dota 2, Lost Ark, CSGO and PUBG. There are only four single players games out of the top 10, as others are MMOs or PvP games.</p>

<p>I think that Baldur’s Gate might push even higher later today, as I’ve seen playercounts peak for many games on Sundays. While it’s not impossible the following weekend is higher, that’s a bit unlikely, as these all-time peaks often happen early on. But anything can happen, and Baldur’s Gate has already defied all kinds of odds.</p>

<p>We don’t know what exact sales are for Baldur’s Gate 3’s PC-only release is, but they previously moved up the date to better avoid bigger fall games, and clearly it worked. The game does not have more than <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/baldurs-gate-3?ref=hp" target="_blank" title="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/baldurs-gate-3?ref=hp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/baldurs-gate-3?ref=hp" aria-label="four scored reviews">four scored reviews</a> in right now, but given all the praise, even in a year of a megahit like Tears of the Kingdom and a AAA blockbuster like Starfield coming up, there’s a serious chance Baldur’s Gate 3 could be in play for GOTY, and I imagine many individual outlets or creators may end up picking it in the end.</p>

<p>I think what’s the most shocking to me is the <em>kind</em> of game this is, a very enormous, detailed, turn-based RPG that simply doesn’t get made anymore. But while it may have fallen out of fashion with publishers and developers, that simply is not true for the general public, who raced to Baldur’s Gate 3 despite it being 20 years since the last one. Just wild to see. We’ll see what records it may break next.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
				<h2>From one dentist I got a quote of $460 for all of the work I needed to be done. From another, $29,850.</h2>
			</p><div>
		<p>From behind a door comes the whine of a highspeed drill. When my name is called, I am ushered into an examining room and welcomed with a nutcracker handshake by the dentist, a graying at the temples man.</p>
<p>Soon I am staring toward the white cork ceiling while my teeth are probed, poked, tapped, and tugged. The numbers of my teeth are called out to an assistant, who jots the information on a chart: “No. 11, crown; No. 13, MOD; No. 14, MO… ” A few minutes later comes the verdict: I need 11 crowns, plus other work. It will cost $8,347.</p>
<p>“Do this and you will have no worries about your teeth for the next 30 years, ” the dentist purrs. Somehow I doubt that. Then he adds, “You and I are going to become great friends.”</p>
<p>Somehow I doubt that too. I was there in Dayton, Ohio, as part of an assessment of the consistency and fairness of American dentistry. Since Americans spend about $42 billion a year on their teeth, it seemed like a reasonable assignment: visit 50 dentists, show them your teeth and a set of X-rays, and ask each what needs to be done.</p>
<p>Four months, 50,000 miles, and 50 exams later, I concluded that going to the dentist is nothing to smile about. Dentistry is a stunningly inexact science. Even expecting that different dentists would have different, yet valid, opinions did not prepare me for the astounding variation in diagnoses I received. Some wanted only $500 to bring me up to good dental health. Others wanted ten, 20, even 50 times that amount. Surely they could not all be right.</p>
<p>I randomly selected the dentists from the Yellow Pages in 28 states and the District of Columbia. At each of the offices, I told the same story: I was moving to the area and wanted to become a patient; I had recently come through successful gum surgery; my dental expenses were covered through a direct reimbursement program with my employer; I was interested in maintaining good oral health and was satisfied with the appearance of my teeth. Because I said I was in a direct reimbursement program, I got a written treatment plan and a cost estimate from each dentist.</p>
<p>Before embarking on my journey, I went to the Lebanon&nbsp; Pa., office of Warren Daugherty my personal dentist for the past 15 years, and a man I trust. “You look really good,” he said after examining me and my X-rays, “but I want to put a crown on No. 30. ”</p>
<p>“Roughly how much money are we talking about?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Under $500. ”</p>
<p>I asked several other dentists, who had no financial interest in my teeth, to assess their condition so that I would have a basis for comparison with what I found on the road. Joining Daugherty on my panel were Dr. John Mayes of Hershey, Pa., a fellow of the Academy of General Dentistry, who took the X rays; Dr. John Dodes of Woodhaven, N.Y., a practicing dentist and the dental expert for the National Council Against Health Fraud; and Dr. Alvin Morris of Pawley’s Island, S. C., the former dean of the University of Kentucky’s College of Dentistry and recipient of the Distinguished Service Award from the American Dental Association in 1985.</p>
<p>All agreed that my oral health was good and I had only one immediate problem, the No. 30 tooth, a molar that needed a cap or a filling. Each panelist said there was room for disagreement on tooth No. 18, but that the total should not exceed $1,500 if two crowns were recommended.</p>
<p>I began my odyssey in Madison, Wis., where my grave-faced examiner informed me that I needed five teeth crowned, including No. 30, plus additional work. The estimated cost was $3,110.</p>
<p>The next day I visited Davenport, Iowa, where the verdict was the same: five crowns. But one tooth was different from those singled out in Madison. The cost was a little lower: $2,555. Then this dentist volunteered, “Your dental work is lousy.”</p>
<p>In Moline, Il., however, I received reassuring news: “Whoever’s been working on your mouth really knows his stuff. ”</p>
<p>Dr. Pacit a Pumilia in Rockford, Il., agreed that I needed only No. 30 crowned. But in Dayton, Ohio, a dentist wanted to crown six teeth—Nos. 6 through 11 in the upper front—for cosmetic improvements. Moreover, he missed No. 30 entirely.</p>
<p>Americans’ dental health has improved dramatically since 1945, the year cavity-fighting fluoride was first added to local water supplies. Traditional dental practice—drill, fill, and bill—has fallen off dramatically. According to the National Institute of Dental Research, the number of children with cavities in their permanent teeth dropped by more than half between the early 1970s and early 1990s. Meanwhile, the population of dentists has grown by 50 percent.</p>
<p>“The decline in the incidence of cavities has led to increased competition among dentists, ” says Dr. Dodes. “Dentists, in turn, are seeking ever more ways to make money from their patients.” His role with the National Council Against Health Fraud is to help protect patients against overcharging, overtreatment, and outright quackery.</p>
<p>In Indianapolis, the practitioner said through his blue mask, “I want to take some pictures of your mouth. These are not X-rays. It’s an intra-oral camera.”</p>
<p>He placed a wandlike device in my mouth, which sent an image to the chairside television monitor and gave me a fullscreen view of my mouth in living color. He took four photographs. “These pictures are so we can show you where the problems are,” he explained. “You can take them home with you.”</p>
<p>There was no charge for the photographs. Later I learned why: the camera is considered a selling device for dentists and manufacturers claim it will pay for itself in a few months in the form of additional work. “Patients need to be sold TWICE—in the office and when they get home,” goes one bit of sales advice.</p>
<p>I was handed two estimates. One was for “necessities”: four crowns, not including No. 30, at a cost of $2,617. A separate listing for cosmetic work came to $8,665. The total: $11,282.</p>
<p>“If it’s covered, you may as well get the whole job so it’s done right,” my examiner said, lowering his voice.</p>

<p>It is an attitude I encountered a dozen times. Under the direct reimbursement program I claimed to be in, my employer would pay claims directly from an established company fund. Dentists like direct reimbursement because they get paid quickly and there is no third party, such as an insurance company, questioning their work.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, I was told: “Tell me what your insurance limits are, and we’ll proceed from there.”</p>
<p>Heading south, I hit one comforting practitioner in Marion, Ark., Dr. Henry Wah, who recommended $700 worth of work. Just a few miles away, in Memphis, Tenn., my examiner said I could squeak by with a barebones approach, “with absolutely no guarantees for the future, ” at a cost of $5,000. But what I really ought to do, he said, would be to crown all 28 teeth. (My four wisdom teeth have been extracted. ) Total cost : $13,440. He could, he assured me, do most of the job in a single day—with a 10 percent discount if I paid cash on that day.</p>
<p>In Salt Lake City, the dentist informed me solemnly, “You need a full-mouth&nbsp;reconstruction. ” Cost: $19,402. Nothing, I thought, could top this. Alas, I was wrong.</p>
<p>At a dental school, I heard about a newsletter, The Profitable Dentist, and became a subscriber. From this newsletter, I discovered that there’s a whole business devoted to telling dentists how to build up the “million dollar practice.” Dentists are flocking to courses on how to generate more profits by maximizing the use of hygienists, extending credit, stepping up collection practices, and persuading patients to accept expensive restoration work instead of fillings.</p>
<p>Not that dentists are near the poverty line. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), the average income for dentists in private practice for 1994, the last year for which figures are available, was $117,610.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, high fees and quality dentistry don’t always go hand in hand. Indeed, 15 of the 50 dentists who examined me missed my problem No. 30 entirely. And three of those dentists assured me that I had no problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>A good example of the inconsistencies I encountered was on the issue of jagged edges, also called margins. These are tiny spaces between the crown and the tooth surface, and in my case, they were exposed as a result of gum surgery.</p>
<p>Above downtown Seattle in a highrise overlooking Puget Sound, the dentist had a 15-minute look in my mouth, and when done he was somber. “Some of your crowns have jagged edges and need immediate attention. They will trap food and cause decay.” He wanted to do 17 crowns—though he missed No. 30—and other work at a cost of $13,774.</p>
<p>A few weeks after the urgency in Seattle, I was in Cambridge, Mass. “The downside of gum surgery is that you have a lot of exposed roots,” the dentist said. “It’s not necessary to change all the crowns if you keep them clean and practice a good daily routine.” She recommended one crown and four fillings at a cost of $1,220. In Washington, D. C., the margins were a $5,275 problem. They were not a problem in Cody, Wyo., and Lahaina, Hawaii. They were a problem in Albuquerque and Omaha.</p>
<p>The panelists? None of them thought the margins posed an immediate threat to my dental health.</p>
<p>There were signs of consistency and fairness in American dentistry. In a humble office in Burlington, Vt., I was checked thoroughly by Dr. David Blanck. The exam included an oral cancer and periodontal screening and a request to consult with my home periodontist. (My panel says all three should be part of a proper new patient exam.) He was among a dozen practitioners whose treatment plans were substantially the recommendations of my panel.</p>
<p>However, only nine of the 50 wanted to consult with the periodontist who performed my gum surgery; only 21 conducted the ADA recommended oral cancer screening, and only 14 did the ADA recommended periodontal screening. The cost of my exams ranged from $20 to $141, and the cost of a porcelain crown ranged from $329 to $1,150.</p>
<p>My final stop was on Park Avenue in New York City, a stone’s throw from Grand Central Terminal. A revolving door chopped rush hour crowds into people. Smooth as mercury, an elevator whisked me up the highrise, where I entered an impressive office—handsome furniture, art on the walls, oriental carpets on hardwood floors. Baroque music wafted from invisible speakers. The dentist was a trim, athletic man, and as he examined my teeth, he shook his head in displeasure. Finally, he sighed and invited me to a private conference room.</p>
<p>“The news is not good, and you’re lucky you have insurance,” he said. He handed me a treatment plan that said I needed 21 crowns and veneer on six lower front teeth.</p>
<p>It would cost $29,850.</p>
<p>I decided to get one extra exam. This one wouldn’t be from a dentist in private practice but from a dental school student whose principal impetus would be to get it right rather than to get rich. A week later I was sitting in the clinic of the Creighton University School of Dentistry in Omaha. My examiner was Larry Tran, a 25-year-old Californian in his third year of the four-year program. He did the oral cancer exam, the periodontal screening, and checked my bite. Then he proceeded, slowly, painstakingly. After about 30 minutes, he said: “You’re in good shape. You need a crown on No. 30, and I’d like to crown No. 18. The cost will be $460. Now I need to find my instructor. ”</p>
<p>A minute later he was back with Dr. John Thurmond, the chairman of oral diagnosis and radiology, who also examined me. “You got it right,” he said to Tran.</p>
<p>I asked the American Dental Association how the dentists I saw could draw such different conclusions from the same set of facts. They put me in touch with Dr. Leslie Seldin, a New York dentist and a consumer adviser for the ADA. He said he was not surprised by the inconsistencies. “Dentistry is an art based on scientific knowledge, and what’s most important to all of us is that we each use our professional judgment to design what we believe is the best solution for the patient.” But Dr. Morris, the former dean, said my findings are “disturbing” and notes that guidelines are needed to assist dentists in providing quality care. “Some doctors say we don’t need standards in dentistry because they already exist for who gets into dental school, who graduates, and who is admitted to practice. The problem with most measures, however, is they inevitably reach a minimally acceptable level, requiring not that one be good but that one not be bad. ”</p>
<p>The ADA recently developed a set of nonbinding treatment parameters. My panel’s Dr. Dodes calls them “mostly nebulous generalities that do little to guarantee patients adequate treatment.”</p>
<p>What, then, can Americans do to protect themselves from overtreatment and overcharging? Says the ADA’s Dr. Seldin, “We encourage patients to seek out—certainly if there’s a lot of work to be done—second or third opinions so they can have comfort with the practitioner’s recommendations.”</p>
<p>I got 50 opinions, and I am not comforted.</p>

<p>In the early 2010s, the economist Justin Lin Yifu, a former World Bank chief official with ties to the Chinese government, <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/growth-and-the-chinese-economy-s-latecomer-advantage-by-justin-yifu-lin-2013-08">predicted</a> that China’s economy would have at least two more decades of growth above 8%. He reckoned that since the country’s per capita income at that time was about the same level as Japan’s in the 1950s and South Korea’s and Taiwan’s in the 1970s, there was no reason China could not replicate the erstwhile successes of these other East Asian states. Lin’s optimism was echoed by the Western commentariat. The <em>Economist</em> projected that China would become the world’s biggest economy by 2018, surpassing the United States. Others fantasized that the Communist Party would embark on an ambitious programme of political liberalization. The <em>New York Times</em>’s Nicholas Kristof <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/opinion/sunday/kristof-looking-for-a-jump-start-in-china.html">wrote</a> in 2013 that Xi would ‘spearhead a resurgence of economic reform, and probably some political easing as well. Mao’s body will be hauled out of Tiananmen Square on his watch. Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning writer, will be released from prison’. The political scientist Edward Steinfeld likewise <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Playing_Our_Game.html?id=YCK-8b9CmDYC&amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;redir_esc=y">argued</a> in 2010 that China’s embrace of globalization would kickstart a process of ‘self-obsolescing authoritarianism’ resembling that of Taiwan in the 1980s and 90s. 　</p>



<p>Ten years later, the naivety of these forecasts is apparent. Even before the onset of Covid-19, the Chinese economy had slowed down and entered a domestic debt crisis, visible in the collapse of major real estate developers like Evergrande. After Beijing lifted all pandemic restrictions in late 2022, a widely anticipated economic rebound failed to materialize. Youth unemployment spiked at above 20%, surpassing that of every other G-7 nation (another estimate put it at above 45%). Data on trade, price, manufacturing and GDP growth all point to deteriorating conditions – a trend that fiscal and monetary stimulus has failed to reverse. The <em>Economist</em> now claims that China might never catch up with the US, and it is universally acknowledged that Xi is no liberal, having redoubled state intervention in the private sector and foreign enterprises while silencing dissenting voices (including those that had previously been tolerated by the Party).</p>



<p>It would be wrong to think that external factors have radically altered China’s prospects. Rather, the country’s gradual decline started more than a decade ago. Those who closely analysed the data, beyond the buzzing business districts and flashy building developments, detected this economic malaise as early as 2008. Back then, I wrote that China was entering a typical overaccumulation <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09692290701869654#:~:text=A%20full%2Dfledged%20overaccumulation%20crisis,weight%20in%20the%20global%20economy.">crisis</a>. Its booming export sector had raked in a huge amount of foreign reserves since the mid-1990s. In its closed financial system, exporters must surrender their foreign earnings to the central bank, which creates equivalent RMB to mop up the foreign currencies. This led to the rapid expansion of RMB liquidity in the economy, mostly in the form of bank loans. Because the banking system is tightly controlled by the party-state – with state-owned or state-connected enterprises serving as the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/columbia-scholarship-online/book/18891/chapter-abstract/177209413?redirectedFrom=fulltext">fiefdoms</a> and cash cows of elite families – the state sector enjoyed privileged access to state bank loans, which were used to fuel an investment spree. The result was rising employment, a temporary and localized economic boom, and a windfall for the elite. But this dynamic also left behind redundant and unprofitable construction projects: empty apartments, underused airports, excessive coal plants and steel mills. That, in turn, resulted in falling profits, slowing growth and worsening indebtedness across the main sectors of the economy.</p>



<p>Throughout the 2010s, the party-state periodically undertook new lending in an attempt to arrest the slowdown. But many enterprises simply took advantage of easy bank loans to refinance their existing debt without adding new spending or investment to the economy. These companies eventually became loan addicts; and as with any addiction, increasing doses were needed to generate diminishing effects. Over time, the economy lost its dynamism as zombie enterprises were kept alive through debt alone: a classic case of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-29/inventor-of-balance-sheet-recession-says-china-is-now-in-one">‘balance-sheet recession’</a> that roiled Japan after its boom ended in the early 1990s. Yet just as these woes became increasingly clear to insiders in the early 2010s, they were censored in official media, which amplified Lin’s upbeat assessment. Meanwhile in the Western world, a web of Wall Street bankers and corporate executives had reason to suppress more sceptical analyses, as they continued to profit off luring investors into China. The illusion of limitless high-speed growth thus ruled the day at the very moment when the economy entered its most serious crisis since the outset of the market reform era.</p>



<p>Beijing has long known what must be done to alleviate this crisis. An obvious step would be to initiate redistributive reform to boost household income and hence household consumption – which, as a share of GDP, has been among the lowest in the world. Since the late 90s, there have been calls to rebalance the Chinese economy in favour of a more sustainable growth model, by reducing its reliance on exports and fixed asset investment like infrastructure construction. This led to some reformist, redistributive policies under the Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao government of 2003–13, such as the New Labour Contract Law, the abolition of agriculture tax, and the redirection of government investment to inland rural regions. But the weight of vested interests (state enterprises, as well as local governments thriving on construction contracts and state bank loans fuelling those projects), and the powerlessness of social groups who stand to benefit from such rebalancing policy (workers, peasants and middle-class households), meant that reformism did not take root. The minimal gains in inequality reduction in the Hu–Wen period were duly reversed after the mid-2010s. More recently, Xi has made <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/02/mussolini-in-beijing">clear</a> that his ‘common prosperity programme’ is not a return to the egalitarianism of the Mao era, nor even a restoration of welfarism. It is, rather, an assertion of the state’s paternalistic role vis-à-vis capital: increasing its presence in the tech and real estate sectors, and aligning private entrepreneurship with the broader interests of the nation.</p>



<p>The party-state has been bracing itself for the social and political repercussions of this dire situation. In official policy speeches, ‘security’ has become the most frequently uttered word, eclipsing ‘economy’. The current leadership believes that it can survive an economic downturn by tightening its control over society, eradicating autonomous elite factions, and adopting a more assertive posture on the international stage amid rising geopolitical tension – even if such measures serve to aggravate its developmental problems. This helps to explain the abolition of the presidential term limits in 2018, the centralization of power within Xi’s hands, the relentless campaign to root out Party factions in the name of anti-corruption, the construction of a growing surveillance state, and the shifting basis of state legitimation: away from the delivery of economic growth and towards nationalist fervour. The current weakening of the economy and hardening of authoritarianism are not easily reversible trends. They are, in fact, the logical outcome of China’s uneven development and capital accumulation over the last four decades. This means they are here to stay.</p>

      Sandra Shuster, from Denver, took matters into her own hands when her lost bag was showing as being at Chicago O’Hare airport – but her airline, United, was doing nothing about it.

      Shuster and her 15-year-old daughter Ruby, who plays lacrosse, were flying back from Baltimore via Chicago on July 17, when their checked bag went missing.
  </p>

      The pair – who’d been to Baltimore for a tournament – had traveled with carry-on bags for their clothes, but had checked one bag containing Ruby’s lacrosse kit. When they arrived at Denver after midnight, the bag wasn’t on the belt. United representatives at Denver gave them a case number and told them the bag should arrive on the 8.30 a.m. flight from Chicago in just a few hours. When it didn’t, Shuster called the toll-free number for lost baggage that she’d been given.

      “They said, ‘Your bag’s going to come in later today on one of two flights.’ I said ‘OK, great,’ but it never came. So I called later that afternoon and they said ‘Your bag is still in Baltimore,’” says Shuster.

      There was just one problem: she already knew it wasn’t in Baltimore. Three months earlier, Shuster had bought an AirTag – Apple’s tracking devices – to know where her daughter’s bag was. “This is unique equipment, and we have to check it. Airlines are getting worse, rates of lost luggage are getting higher, and I wanted to know where it was – so I bought the tag,” she explains.

      “I told them I could see it at Terminal 1 baggage reclaim in Chicago, and they said ‘We have no record of it.’ I asked them to call Chicago, and they said ‘No, we’re not allowed.’ They said they’d put notes in the system and the baggage team would take care of it.”

      When the bag still didn’t arrive, and Shuster called a third time, she was told “We have no idea where it is.”

      They also told Shuster that she had the wrong claim number – impossible, she thought, because she still had the sticker that had been attached to her boarding pass. The other half was on the bag.

      In fact, they were right – sort of. The claim number was indeed the same as the tag that had been attached to her bag – but the check-in agent had attached the wrong tag. This one was for another passenger, who was traveling from Baltimore to Chicago only. That meant the bag had been taken off the plane at O’Hare and sent straight to the reclaim belt, instead of being loaded onto the Denver flight.

      Ruby plays goal in lacrosse, which meant there was kit totaling about $2,000 in that bag. Replacing it wasn’t just about the finances, says Shuster – a new stick needs to be restrung and then broken in, needing about a month in total. Meanwhile they were flying to San Francisco for another tournament in two days’ time. Ruby borrowed some kit for that trip.

      Returning from California, they stopped at the lost luggage desk in Denver with their reference number, and reiterated that the AirTag was still tracking at Chicago.

      After suggesting someone had stolen the bag and dumped the AirTag, she says, the United representative told her that most people immediately put in claims to replace items, get $1,000-2,000 in compensation, and then have their bag arrive in a few weeks.
  </p>

      But Shuster was convinced it was still there. “It had moved maybe 50 feet, and the AirTag was embedded in the bag – I doubted someone stole it,” she says. “He was implying it could be a double win but I wasn’t trying to game the system – to replace what was in that bag was much harder.”
  </p>

      So when she asked a Chicago friend if there was any way he could swing by the airport, and realized he was on vacation himself, Shuster took matters into her own hands and booked a flight with air miles.

      By this time, she’d made contact with United’s Twitter team, but been told they couldn’t locate it.

      They suggested she call United. As a frequent flyer, she called the priority line – and was told to submit an online claim. Three days on, she’d heard nothing – but less than 24 hours after CNN contacted United, the airline deposited her 30,000 miles back in her account (though not the taxes that she’d spent), along with an apology “for the inconvenience you experienced on your recent trip with United.”

      United said in a statement: “Unfortunately, this bag was incorrectly tagged at the start of the trip which contributed to the longer delay – we’ve apologized to Ms. Shuster, reimbursed the miles used and gave her an additional travel credit to use toward a future flight. Our teams work to reconnect our customers with their baggage as quickly as possible and we regret that we could not get this bag to Denver sooner.”

      So what lessons have been learned? Shuster says she’ll always check the claim ticket that’s placed on her bag, instead of assuming that check-in staff have got it right. She’ll also watch it down the conveyor belt.

<p>Welcome to Jupyter AI, which brings generative AI to Jupyter. Jupyter AI provides a user-friendly
and powerful way to explore generative AI models in notebooks and improve your productivity
in JupyterLab and the Jupyter Notebook. More specifically, Jupyter AI offers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An <code><span>%%ai</span></code> magic that turns the Jupyter notebook into a reproducible generative AI playground.
This works anywhere the IPython kernel runs (JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VSCode, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>A native chat UI in JupyterLab that enables you to work with generative AI as a conversational assistant.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for a wide range of generative model providers and models
(AI21, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, OpenAI, SageMaker, etc.).</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="jupyterlab-support">
<h2>JupyterLab support<a href="#jupyterlab-support" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Each major version of Jupyter AI supports <em>only one</em> major version of JupyterLab.</strong> Jupyter AI 1.x supports
JupyterLab 3.x, and Jupyter AI 2.x supports JupyterLab 4.x. The feature sets of versions 1.0.0 and 2.0.0
are the same. We will maintain support for JupyterLab 3 for as long as it remains maintained.</p>
<p>The <code><span>main</span></code> branch of Jupyter AI targets the newest supported major version of JupyterLab. All new features and most bug fixes will be
committed to this branch. Features and bug fixes will be backported
to work on JupyterLab 3 only if developers determine that they will add sufficient value.
<strong>We recommend that JupyterLab users who want the most advanced Jupyter AI functionality upgrade to JupyterLab 4.</strong></p>

<p>A few weeks ago I had the questionable pleasure of diving into the math exception handler of WIN87EM.DLL, the Windows 3.1 math emulator and FPU support library. Actually WIN87EM.DLL appears to have been first shipped with Windows 3.0, and the version in Windows 3.1 is more or less identical. The version shipped with Windows 3.11 is byte for byte identical to the one in Windows 3.1.</p>



<p>The main function of WIN87EM.DLL is, as the name suggests, an x87 floating-point emulator. It appears to be an outgrowth of the math emulation packages shipped with many Microsoft languages. But even on a system with x87 hardware, WIN87EM.DLL has some work to do.</p>



<p>Namely WIN87EM.DLL intercepts math errors (exceptions). Depending on the system type, WIN87EM.DLL hooks either NMI vector 2 (PC and PC/XT) or IRQ 13 (PC/AT and compatibles).</p>



<p>The math interrupt handler in WIN87EM.DLL is very, <em>very</em> strange. It bears all the hallmarks of code that was written, rewritten, rewritten again, hacked, tweaked, modified, and eventually beaten into submission even if the author(s) had no real idea <em>why</em> it finally worked.</p>



<p>Now, x87 math error handing is a very tricky subject where numerous details changed over FPU and CPU generations, and Intel had a fair share of bugs in this area. But the code in WIN87EM.DLL looks very much like the result of changes made in desperation until it worked <em>somehow</em>, even though the changes made little or no sense.</p>



<h3>What WIN87EM.DLL Does</h3>



<p>The IRQ 13 handler in WIN87EM.DLL performs the following steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Disable interrupts (CLI)</li>



<li>PUSH and POP the AX register 70 times, maybe it will slow things down</li>



<li>Write zero to I/O port F0h to clear the PC/AT FPU error latch</li>



<li>Mask a selection of interrupts</li>



<li>Write an EOI to the master interrupt controller (but not slave)</li>



<li>Execute the FNSTSW instruction to store the FPU status word (but only that)</li>



<li>PUSH and POP the AX register 16 times, because speed kills</li>



<li>Write zero to I/O port F0h again, in case it didn’t work the first time</li>



<li>Execute the FNCLEX instruction to clear pending FPU exceptions</li>



<li>Write zero to I/O port F0h again, because third time’s the charm</li>



<li>PUSH and POP the AX register 16 times, because it was so much fun last time</li>



<li>Execute the FNCLEX instruction again, just to be really sure</li>



<li>PUSH and POP the AX register 16 times, because it’s the thing to do</li>



<li>Write zero to I/O port F0h again, because three times might not have been enough</li>



<li>Finally jump to code that doesn’t look crazy</li>
</ul>



<p>The not so crazy looking code executes FNSTENV to store the FPU environment, swaps in the previously saved status word (which was subsequently changed by FNCLEX), examines the code at the stored FPU error pointer to see if instruction prefixes should be skipped (that is where things may crash), enables interrupts with STI, and finally jumps to common code that’s executed on both PCs and ATs and handles the actual math error.</p>



<p>All in all, the math error interrupt handler in WIN87EM.DLL makes very little sense. I am extremely doubtful that, for example, writing to I/O port F0h four times does anything useful, or that executing FNCLEX twice is better than doing it once. However, it is entirely possible that the extra time it takes might do something. Likewise the slowdown loops that push and pop AX are very unlikely to be necessary, but may have done something seemingly useful on some particular system.</p>



<p>The code really does look like a desperate attempt to make things work, and there is some possibility that it is the result of trying to support broken hardware. Other similar error handlers I looked at don’t appear nearly as convoluted and are much more “by the book”.</p>



<p>We’ll probably never know why the code ended up so crazy, but we can speculate.</p>

<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Hi, this is CoRecursive, and I’m Adam Gordon Bell. Each episode is the story of a piece of software being built.</p>
<p>Have you ever had a unique approach to a problem and been excited to use it, but you meet with skepticism. That’s today’s story. What happens if you take someone who’s passionate about a certain approach and put them in an organization where that’s just not the way things are done? Today is the story of getting LISP into space.</p>
<p>You know LISP, right? The language with all the parentheses and the macros and the treating code as data. Well, my guest today is a big fan, Ron Garrett. At the time this story starts, he’s wrapping up his PhD in robotics and AI. And the AI that we’re talking about here is not machine learning, it’s AI meaning autonomy, like autonomous robots for self-driving cars. We’re going back in time.</p>

<p>The year is 1988. The USSR still existed. Ronald Reagan was president of the United States and Ron under his thesis advisor was working on a prototype for a very iconic NASA project.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
My name is Ron Garrett.</p>
<p>Our goal was to develop the software that would allow NASA to send an autonomous rover to Mars. The challenge with operating on Mars, well, there are lots of challenges to operate on Mars, but one of them is that there’s a 40 minute round trip light time delay. And so you can’t just remotely operate a rover. The time lag is much, much, much, much too long. So it needs a certain level of autonomy because there’s going to be 40 minutes between when you tell it to do something and when you find out what it actually did as a result of what you told it. And so your productivity is going to improve the more that the rover can get done on each one of those cycles. So we were trying to push the level of autonomy so that it could go further on a single command cycle. And that was the goal.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
This all happened at the Jet Propulsion Lab, the JPL in Los Angeles, where Ron had a fairly standard cubicle.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
But around the corner, there was an electronic shop where I would sometimes go when we needed to build some hardware, which back in those days we often did have to build our own custom hardware. And a lot of the robots that we built were indoor robots and we just ran them around the office. But every now and then, we would go outside into, there’s a dry river bed called the Arroyo Seco, which literally means dry riverbed that is adjacent to the lab. And on occasion, we would go out there to run robots outdoors because the environment there is actually very similar to the environment that you get on Mars. And on a couple of occasions, we would actually go out to Death Valley and do experiments out there. And that was a lot of fun.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
How big are these robots?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So the smallest one was about the size of a shoebox, I guess. I should actually start out by telling you about a medium size one that we had, which was about the size of maybe half of a standard refrigerator, big and heavy. And if it ever ran into something, it could do some serious damage. And so we called it FANG, which was an acronym for Futuristic Autonomous Navigation Gizmo. And so the little shoebox sized one, we called Tooth.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Oh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
And then there were a couple of outdoor robots. The first one was this giant six wheeled behemoth that used truck tires. It was the size of an SUV and it called Robbie. And then there were a series of smaller rovers, which eventually turned into the first actual Mars rovers, the Sojourner rover. So a series of prototypes for that rover called Rocky, the Rocky series. So there was Rocky 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Sojourner would be the first Mars rover. And we know now it would like land on Mars in 1997 and be considered a great success. But nine years before then in 1988, rovers were just a research project. They were exploring what was possible and Ron’s team’s approach and their choice of programming languages, which was the LISP, it came right out of the academic research they were doing. One potential problem though is that using LISP really wasn’t how software was built at NASA.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
There was quite a bit of prejudice against LISP because it was weird and unfamiliar, and it had this strange garbage collection technology that you just never knew when it would just stop your process dead in its tracks. And that can be catastrophic when you’re dealing in an embedded environment where you have to respond in real-time. And also people thought that LISP was very memory hungry. But back in those days when eight megabytes of RAM was considered a huge amount of RAM. And there were people saying like, yo, you’re sure your research machines have eight megabytes, but you’ll never fly machines that big. Of course, nowadays a hundred mega megabytes is normal. And of course, this is all foreseeable because space qualified hardware follows Moore’s law. Just like everything else, it just lags behind a couple of years. So I found all this to be very frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
I get this. I’ve been this person before who thinks he has a great way to solve a problem, but hits a lot of barriers with getting people to adopt it. But Ron is talking about running LISP on embedded robots. And to do that, I think you really need a trick.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
On the larger robots that had a few megabytes of RAM, we actually ran LISP on the robot. So the actual code that controlled the robot was written in LISP. Now, the other way which LISP was used for the little robots was designing languages specifically for programming robots and compiling those languages down to embedded code that would run on small processors.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
As an outsider, this seems like a really cool approach. You could get down in the weeds of the robot hardware and try to write autonomous code at that level. But instead, Ron is raising the abstraction. He’s writing a custom language that can best specify the problem and then compiling that down to the actual hardware. It’s a neat trick where every problem becomes a compiler problem. It sounds like it will be a lot of work in most programming languages, but Ron’s using LISP, which he’s been doing since the mid eighties.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So you have to keep in mind that there is no Java, there is no Python, there is no JavaScript, there is no C++. There is Pascal and C and basic and machine code, and that’s pretty much it in terms of popular languages. And to get anything done in any of those languages is just really, really hard. And this by contrast gives you all of this high level abstraction that you can just use without having to worry about it. And so you don’t have to worry about memory management, you don’t have to worry about dangling pointers. It’s just so much faster and easier to get things done when the language you’re using provides you with some of these high level abstractions. And in a world where the only language that has that is LISP, knowing LISP really is like a superpower. It just blew everything else out of the water back in those days.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So Ron was a true believer, but he was also a talented developer and the stakes were high because NASA has a rival team also working on Mars rover prototypes. Ron’s team has to get Robbie and FANG self-driving if they want a chance at their approach being used on the real rover.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
And so we had this development environment where we would develop the code off board on Macintoshes in an environment that had a simulator for the robot, and we get things mostly working and then we’d run the same code on the robot to see if it worked on the real robot. And the reason for that was that running experiments on the real robot, especially on Robbie, was very expensive in terms of time. To all be carefully planned, we had to load Robbie onto a flatbed truck and drive him out into the Arroyo and unload him and get everything set up and all the support equipment. And it took a couple of hours to get set up and then we’d be out there for most of the day running experiments and then we had to pack everything up and put him away again at the end of the day.</p>
<p>So that was a big deal. And so running the code in simulation helped us make more effective use of that time.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Ron’s group and the work they did was groundbreaking in many ways.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
The goal was to get these rovers to move around in natural environments completely autonomously. So you would tell it, I want to go over there. So Robbie had a pair of stereo cameras. He was actually the first robot in the world to navigate using stereo vision. So in a way, Robbie was the precursor to a lot of the autonomous cars that we have nowadays. They don’t use stereo vision, they mostly use LIDAR, but some of them do use vision processing in order to do obstacle avoidance. So Robbie was the first robot to do this. And then there was the actual navigation code, which took 3D stereo data and the goal location and planned a path and executed it. And that was what I worked on.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So you’d take it out to wherever and put some location and then you kind of see what happens and…</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Right, exactly. And you have to keep in mind that Robbie moved very slowly. So yeah, he’s big and heavy, but he’s moving it less than one mile an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So he’s not really that dangerous. If he starts to do something wrong, there’s plenty of time to push the panic button, but you do have to be watching him constantly because he’s a big, expensive one off piece of research equipment and he is very easily capable of driving up onto a rock that would tip him over and that would probably destroy him if he fell over. It never happened, thankfully. But yeah, we had to be watching him all the time, but you didn’t have to worry about him going rogue and killing somebody.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Developing real-time software for robots in the 1980s, that can be a frustrating endeavor.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
It was cutting edge research code, so it was buggy and it crashed and things went wrong. We never had any catastrophes, thankfully. I think FANG once went rogue and put a hole in the drywall in the office. But that was the worst because FANG w as easily capable of moving fast enough to do some damage. So thankfully, he never hurt anybody.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Robbie, Rocky, Tooth and FANG, they were some of the most capable self-driving robots at the time. A lot of self navigation first happened on this team. But while Ron was heads down working on the code, things with the team started to go sideways.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
And telling this story would be a little touchy because it was to some extent political. I was young and naive and had my head down in the code and I was vaguely aware that there was all these political battles being fought, but I didn’t really know the details and I didn’t understand how political battles are fought. I’ve learned a lot about that since then, but at the time I was pretty oblivious.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
You see, there was a turf war between Ron’s researchy robotics group which was trying to push autonomy and that other group.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So their approach was not to just give it a goal and have the rover figure out how to get there, but to have an operator describe an exact path for the rover to follow, which it would then do. They have some level of autonomy, but there is an operator who’s sitting at a console where he has a 3D view of the terrain and describing exact path for the rover to follow on each cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Building a Mars rover prototype of any kind is, I’m sure, super challenging, but this other team’s approach where they’re describing an exact path, it’s a smaller problem than marking a destination and having the robot navigate to that goal, which is good, but also when it was deployed, there would be some challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
You don’t know whether you’ve succeeded for the better part of an hour after you’ve sent it to command. So you’re sitting there bitting your fingernails hoping that you didn’t screw something up.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
The operational burden of this approach is really high, whereas a totally self-driving approach has a much lower operations cost. In fact, if the robots could be self driven, potentially more and smaller robots could be sent. I mean, they would have to be very reliable, but each small robot could head out exploring on its own and then more could be done with less. But there is a political problem.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
There’s decades of operational experience that into the current ways of doing things. And it’s very labor intensive and developing a technology whose goal is to put these people out of work doesn’t immediately endear you to the people whose livelihoods depend on doing this work. There’s this whole infrastructure of people whose livelihood depends on this technology not existing.</p>
<h2 id="sojourner-on-mars"><strong>Sojourner on Mars</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So don’t lose hope because the story continues. This LISP code is going into space, but it did not make it into the first Mars rover, Sojourner. The low autonomy operator driven solution won the day, but that might not be a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Even today, I’m not entirely convinced that NASA made the wrong decision. And I base that just on what they’ve actually managed to accomplish. I look at the pictures that come back from these rovers and the science that comes back from these rovers, and it just boggles my mind and blows me away. It impresses me so much that I can barely find the words. Here I am sitting at my desk in my home, looking at photographs, high resolution, color photographs from another planet. That’s just such a spectacular thing to be alive at a time in human history when that is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Do you feel like it makes it real, like seeing these pictures? Does it seem more like a real place?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Oh yeah. The photos coming back today are just incredibly high quality and give you a real sense of the place. And one of the things that I find most striking is how similar it is to places on earth and in particular, how similar it is to the places in Death Valley, where we ran some of these early tests. And in particular, it can really, at least gives me a sense of what it would like to actually be there and walking around the there, and all this has me very convinced that I never want to go there. I’ve spent time in Death Valley and these places that are just like there except much more benign because you don’t actually have to be wearing a space suit to survive. I can tell you from semi firsthand experience that colonizing Mars is a pipe dream.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Really?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Yeah. We really need to take care of this planet that we have because no matter how bad things get here, it’s still going to be better here. It’s still going to be easier to terraform earth and to terraform Mars.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So Sojourner was a success, just without the LISP. The code it shipped with was written in C and the autonomy was very restricted. Ron’s group disbanded and many of them left the JPL, though not Ron. And a couple years later, it seemed like there was a new opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
There were some people who thought that maybe some of this autonomy technology could be used for actual spacecraft, flying in space, and that some of the theories of economies of scale could be applied there. And in particular, NASA got a new director around that time. He was an advocate of this idea of trying to pursue economies of scale in order to reduce mission costs. And he launched a pilot program called the New Millennium series. It was a series of missions, technology demonstration missions with the explicit goal of trying to demonstrate technologies that could be deployed at scale in order to reduce operating costs. And the autonomy technology that we had started developing for rovers was repurposed for that in a project called the Remote Agent that was done in collaboration with the Ames Research Center and some work that people were doing there in planners and diagnostic systems.</p>
<p>There were three or four, depending on how you count, major components of this thing that were developed at JPL and Ames. And one of them came from Carnegie Mellon that were all kind of all together to make the Remote Agent.</p>
<h2 id="deep-space-1-and-the-remote-agent"><strong>Deep Space 1 and The Remote Agent</strong></h2>

</div>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
It was called the Remote Agent because it was going to have agency. Just like the rover prototypes, it would have a goal and take actions to accomplish that goal. But this time it was a flight controller and not a rover controller.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So the New Millennium emissions were divided into two categories. There were the deep space missions which went out of earth orbits and the EO missions that were in earth orbit. And we were slated to fly on the first deep space mission, DS1, Deep Space 1, which was going to go to rendezvous with a comet and an asteroid. And they had a whole bunch of other cutting edge technologies that were going to fly on the same mission and get demonstrated in the same mission. And originally we were slated to control the entire mission with the Remote Agent.</p>
<h2 id="project-management-problems"><strong>Project Management Problems</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
But unfortunately problems occurred before things got that far.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
And this, again, is where it gets a little bit a touchy. And I have to be very careful here because I really don’t want to offend anybody who was on the team because everybody on the team was really good and really smart and worked incredibly hard. And the problems were more managerial than technical. So we were four different teams from three different institutions that had all been brought together to build the system and nobody was really in charge of designing and integrating the final system. It was just allowed to kind of happen organically. And so there was a lot of negotiating and cajoling and frankly infighting and arguing. And on the technological side, in particular, there was one component that the three of the four components were written in LISP and one of the four or components was written in C. And the component that was written in C early on kept crashing because when you write in C, you have to worry about all these low level details and this is just a thing that happens when you write in C.</p>
<p>And they eventually got that all worked out, but while things were crashing, that slowed down development because you’d be running an experiment and suddenly it would crash and you had to reboot and reload everything and that cost you 10 minutes and multiply that by a couple of dozen times a day and you’re running behind schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So then I assume everybody learned that you shouldn’t use C.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Well, you would think that would be the lesson that they would learn, but no, that lesson was not learned. Nowadays, the flight control software, I believe, is written in C and they have to code it very carefully and use a lot of testing and analysis tools in order to get it to work. And they have managed to make it work and they’ve managed to make it reliable, but it’s a tremendous amount of effort. And unfortunately at the time, I was not very skilled at playing politics and so I was a little bit more blunt about this than I should have been. I ended up off a lot of people and I think that had probably as much to do with the ultimate failure of the project as anything else because all these old timers who knew how to run spacecraft just didn’t like me and didn’t want to have this obnoxious brat around.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Sure. Ron’s certainty probably ruffled some feathers at the JPL, but it was the time to get these four systems integrated that actually caused the most delays and got this autonomous system downgraded to a flight experiment. Instead of controlling Deep Space 1 for the whole trip, it would control it for just three days. But still three days of controlling a spacecraft is no simple matter. And so the various teams worked hard to make sure the software was as solid as it could be.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Ron’s portion was called the executive.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So it was the software that decided, okay, this is what we’re going to do next in response to the input data and the possibility of various contingencies. It was the thing that decided what the spacecraft was going to do moment to moment. And it was programmed using another one of these custom languages that was written in LISP. And funnily enough, I can’t remember the name of the language now, which is really weird because that was like my baby. Why can’t I not remember its name? And this language was designed in such a way that at like LISP, the structure of language would prevent you from writing code that had certain kinds of issues. And the biggest issue that it was designed to prevent was the kinds of problems that you get when you have multi-threaded code, in other words, code that does more than one thing at the same time. That kind of code is notoriously difficult to manage.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of subtle problems that can arise that are sneaky and un-intuitive and can lead to problems like race conditions and deadlocks. And so this language was designed so that the very structure of the language prevented you from encountering these kinds of difficulties. And the code was even subjected to a formal analysis that we had a formal proof that the safety in variance that this language was designed to maintain were actually maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So we had a formal proof and of course, we had extensive ground testing. It was tested for days and days and days in simulation. And when I say simulation, this was running on a copy of the flight hardware and the only thing that was being simulated was that we weren’t actually in space, but all of the hardware was the same hardware or copy of the hardware that was actually going to fly. And so we had a formal proof of correctness and we had extensive ground testing with no problems.</p>
<p>So we were very confident that it was going to work and it didn’t work.</p>

<p>This was like the second day of the three day experiment. So people were sleeping during this time, but not very much. And my memory of the details here are fairly fuzzy, but it was an all hands on deck situation because the scenario had been designed with safeguards in place so that the odds of actually losing the spacecraft were very low, even if the Remote Agents screwed up.</p>
<p>But the fact that it screwed up was still orange alert, if not red alert.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
It stopped making decisions or it just freezes?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
There was a time at which it was supposed to do something and that time came and went and it didn’t do the thing it was supposed to do. And alarm bells rang and-</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Where was this?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
It was out in space. It was 150 million miles away. It was an hour round trip lifetime.</p>
<h2 id="debugging-code-in-space"><strong>Debugging Code in Space</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Whoa. So now it’s time to debug a production incident, but this isn’t code running on a server in the cloud, this code is one light hour round trip time away. This is code running in deep space and to fix the problem, there’s Ron who wrote the programming language, and then there’s this guy that he hired to help him do the spacecraft code.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So I hired the guy in part so that I could push the coding responsibilities off onto him and kind of back away from the process because I could tell that I wasn’t really being very effective. And I was young and foolish and a very, very bad manager at that point. And I did not do a very good job of handing this task off to him. I basically just said, here’s what needs to be done. Go do it.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
And he did do it. He got things built, but now this code that’s been proven deadlock free seems to be frozen 150 million miles from home. And so it’s time for Ron to jump back in and take control.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
This guy was frustrated with me. He’d really been in the trenches for months doing my dirty work for me. That was all hands on deck and so I was swooping back in as a white knight to try and fix the situation again the way I had so skillfully done so many times before. The guy told me to go F myself, which came as a surprise to me because I didn’t realize that things had reached that level of tension. And so I think in retrospect, his reaction was very understandable, but at the time it took me completely by surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Emotions are running high and it’s time to debug this issue. The more time passes, the more off target Deep Space 1 is.</p>
<h2 id="sending-s-expressions"><strong>Sending S-Expressions</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
We had no idea what was going on. All we knew was that this telemetry that it was supposed to send back hadn’t been received and now we had to decide how to proceed. And everything that we did when we decided to do something, we would do it and then we would sit around and wait an hour for the result.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So by the time you knew that it didn’t make that turn, that was already an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Well, it was a half an hour ago because it’s a half hour out and a half hour back. Things get really weird on how you reckon these things, right? So yeah, effectively, it was an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
How does this work? How do you communicate with it?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
That’s a good question. So you’re familiar with Python, right?</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
I am. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So when you’re programming a Python, you have a REPL, a read–eval–print loop. So you can program Python interactively in addition to just putting code in a file and running it like a regular program. Well, LISP pioneered that. So in this, the normal way of interacting with LISP was through a REPL and this was the first language to have that feature. And it was the only language to have that feature for decades. And that’s one of the reasons why it was such a big lever back in the early days, but this was REPL so we had a REPL running on the spacecraft and we could interact with the spacecraft through that REPL. Now accessing that REPL was not just a matter of sitting down at a terminal typing at it because to communicate with that REPL, you had to go through the Deep Space network and deal with this hour long round trip light time.</p>
<p>So what the process actually looked like is we’d sit around in a conference room and scratch our heads and argue and try to decide what commands to send it, and finally come to a consensus on what batch of commands that we should send. And those then went through a review process that consisted of a number of layers of management, all of whom had to sign off on it. And once they signed off, it was handed off to an actual operator who was trained in interacting with the Deep Space network. And they would sit down at the console that was connected to the Deep Space network and they would type in these commands and then push the big red button to send those commands up to the spacecraft. So it goes from the console in a building at JPL through a dedicated hardwired network to one of the Deep Space network antennas. And there are three of these around the world so that you have coverage of the entire sky.</p>
<p>And these are huge 70 meter antennas, just enormous pieces of infrastructure. And I don’t actually know the details of what happens at the station. I don’t know whether there’s another human in the loop at that point or whether it’s all automated, but eventually the signal goes out of this huge 70 meter antenna and goes flying through space at the speed of light where it’s received by the antenna on the spacecraft and goes through this very elaborate system on the spacecraft where the signal is decoded and turned into bits. And eventually those bits get fed into the LISP system in exactly the same as it would’ve been if you’d been sitting there physically with the terminal typing at it. And it was a very elaborate and formal process that involved people wearing these headsets that you see like in the movies, going through this very formal process, that we are now going to send this command to the spacecraft and somebody else saying, yes, you are go to send the command to the spacecraft.</p>
<p>And then finally the guy who was sitting at the console would push the big red button and then we’d sit around and wait for the results. And then we’d look at the results and do the whole thing over again.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
That’s crazy. You’re sending like a big tree of a LISP expression or what…</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Yeah. We were sending up S-Expressions.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
What do you tell it? Are you telling it to reload? It’s actively running. What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So the first thing that we told it was send us a back trace. Send us a dump of the system state, of all the processes that are running. The processes that are waiting for something to happen, what are they waiting for? So that was the first thing we did. That information came back and we looked at it and then it was actually almost immediately obvious what was going wrong because there was this one process that was waiting for something that should have already happened. And so that was a big clue as to what was going wrong. What turned out that the problem was that there was, in fact, a race condition, which was supposed to have been impossible.</p>
<h2 id="the-proof-and-the-assumptions"><strong>The Proof and the Assumptions</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
It was proved impossible, right?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
It was proved impossible, but the proof relied on an assumption. And the assumption was that when you were programming this thing, you were only using the constructs in the language. So the proof said, if you use the constructs in this specially design language, then you will not get deadlocks. So it’s kind of like nowadays you have rust where you have a safe part of the language and an unsafe part of the language. Well, we basically had that too, but we didn’t take that explicit. But what we hadn’t anticipated was that there was a guy who had been tasked to write some of the code-</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
This is the F off guy that Ron hired to build the software using his language.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
… and he had to make it do a particular thing and he couldn’t figure out how to make it do that using the constructs in the language so he just called a lower level construct in LISP in order to get it to work. And that did an end run around the safety guarantees of the language. And this was a failure on my part. I had not made this sufficiently clear to the guy that I hired to write this code who was working under my supervision. Basically just said, here’s what needs to be done. Go do it. And he did, but because I hadn’t impressed on him that it… In my own defense, I’ll say it was not really in the forefront of my mind that it needed to be said. I thought this guy would just figure it out. And that was obviously in retrospect an unrealistic expectation. I didn’t make it sufficiently clear that he wasn’t supposed to do this. And so he did it, not his fault, my fault, and that’s what was the cause of the bug.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-it"><strong>Fixing It</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Do you kill something or restart something or?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So then we had to decide whether to try to salvage this session by injecting some event to un-wedge it, which we actually did. So we actually managed to un-wedge it and have it continue through the scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So manually issuing the event worked. Thanks to the magic of LISP and the mind blowing idea of having a live REPL on a spacecraft, the mission was saved. And also, I feel like you have to think of the odds here. This code was tested extensively and it never hit a deadlock. If you ran this mission a hundred times, it may have only deadlocked that first time and never again. Deadlocks are artifacts of timing and obviously in test scenarios, the exact timing that exposed this deadlock never happened. The odds that this failure happened are really low, but the mission only happened once and it did deadlock. So for people outside the team, it certainly doesn’t look like a success.</p>
<h2 id="the-impact-of-the-deadlock"><strong>The Impact of the Deadlock</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
We didn’t lose the spacecraft and we did accomplish all of the mission objectives. So technically it was a success, but the development process was so painful and fraught with difficulty and again, there were politics. So despite the fact that we actually did manage to get it to work, the autonomy project was canceled after that and it never flew again.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
This whole process, as you can imagine, was very frustrating for Ron.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Frustrated is understating it quite a bit. It was extremely stressful and ultimately it led to me quitting. So I got more and more marginalized in my role and it became clearer and clearer to me that fewer and fewer people wanted to work with me and there was more and more pressure to collaborate.</p>
<h2 id="enter-google"><strong>Enter Google</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Around this time, while Ron was at a record low, he discovered this new search engine called Google.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
I was reading a Usenet newsgroup, in fact, comp line LISP. And somebody answered some obscure technical question, which I don’t remember what the question was anymore, but they, gave this answer and then followed up saying, thank God for Google. And I was like, what the heck is Google? And so I did what one did in those days when one encountered something that was unfamiliar, was pull up my Netscape navigator and type in www.google.com. And sure enough, it was a search engine kind of like AltaVista, except that after just five minutes of noodling around with it was, it was obvious to me that this was light years ahead of anything else that existed at the time. And it was so good and so fast that my jaw was just on the floor saying, how the heck did they do that? And at the bottom of the page, there was this link saying we’re hiring. So in a fit of what Alan Greenspan would call irrational exuberance, I dashed off a resume and 15 minutes later, my phone rang.</p>
<h2 id="is-lisp-worth-it"><strong>Is LISP Worth It?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So Ron left the JPL and started working at this tiny company called Google. But since this is CoRecursive and not the space exploration podcast, I wanted to find out now that it’s years and years later, is Ron still a LISP evangelist?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
One of the things that I learned is that LISP has an advantage for me because it happens to be a good impedance match to my mindset. One of the reasons that it has good impedance match to my mindset is because I started using it when I was in high school. And so I’ve just been steeped in LISPness for 40 years or more. But for somebody else, it’s really weird. All those parenthesis and the weird prefix notation, that can seem very foreign and especially in common LISP, that has a lot of historical baggage and a lot of weird corner cases and potential nasty surprises. And so productivity really has a lot more to do with matching your tools to your mindset than finding the one true tool because there is not a one true tool because different people have different mindsets and different approaches and different things that they resonate with.</p>
<p>The one thing that list does give you is a better understanding of how things work at their core. And with that understanding, it becomes easier to learn other things. But in terms of actually getting things done, it has a lot more to do with how well the tool fits your particular mindset than the actual merits of the tool.</p>
<h2 id="outro"><strong>Outro</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
A big thank you to Ron Garrett for being on the show. A link to his website is in the show notes. And if you want to hear more about Ron’s time at Google during the dot-com boom, then you’re in luck. I’ve released it as a bonus episode. So if you go to the supporters link in the show notes at corecursive.com/supporters, you can access the episode right now. Will this little startup, Google, make it through the dot-com crash of the 2000s. Will Ron convince them about the beauty of LISP? You don’t have to wait to find out. It’s right now available for supporters. And until next time, thank you so much for listening.</p>

<li><strong> PAYMENTS AND CHARGES </strong></li>
<p><strong>12.1 </strong><strong>Charges</strong>. You agree that Zoom may charge your credit card, debit card, or other payment mechanism selected by you and approved by Zoom (“<strong>Payment Method</strong>”) for all amounts due and owing in connection with your use of the Services, as set forth in the applicable Order Form or otherwise used or ordered by or for you through the Services, including set up fees, one-time fees, non-recurring fees, overages, per-use charges, subscription fees, recurring fees, and any other fees and charges associated with the Services or your account (“<strong>Charges</strong>”). As provided in Section 13, unless otherwise expressly specified an Order Form, all Charges are exclusive of Taxes and Fees. You agree to promptly update your Payment Method to allow for timely payment. Changes made to your Payment Method will not affect Charges that Zoom submits to your chosen Payment Method before Zoom could reasonably act on your changes. Additionally, you agree to permit Zoom to use any updated Payment Method information provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network and to charge your current primary Payment Method by using the details of such Payment Method saved in our system, even if such Payment Method is declined. Zoom further reserves the right to use your backup Payment Method to the extent one is provided. By adding a backup Payment Method, you authorize Zoom to process any applicable Charges on your backup Payment Method if your primary Payment Method is declined.</p>
<p><strong>12.2 </strong><strong>Non-Cancelable and Non-Refundable Charges</strong>. You agree that all payments are non-cancelable for the Initial Subscription Term or the then-current Renewal Term, as applicable, and are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise agreed to by Zoom, required by Law, or set forth in your Order Form.</p>

For changes to your Charges, Zoom will provide you with not less than (i) thirty (30) calendar days prior notice, or (ii) the time period prescribed by applicable Law (each, (i) and (ii), a “<strong>Rate Change Notice</strong>”). Unless prohibited by the terms of your Order Form, any changes to your Charges will be effective upon the commencement of your next Renewal Term or other date calculated in accordance with applicable Law. If you seek to terminate or modify the Services affected by a Rate Change Notice, then you must terminate or modify your affected Services within the applicable Rate Change Notice time period. If you do not terminate or modify the affected Services within the applicable Rate Change Notice time period, then you shall be deemed to have automatically accepted the change to your Charges, unless your affirmative, express consent to such change is required under applicable Law. If required by applicable Law, we will remind you of your termination and modification right, any applicable time-period, and the consequences of not terminating.</p>
<p><strong>12.4 Promotional Rates and Discounts</strong>. Prices specified in an Order Form may include a promotional rate, discount, sale, or special offer, which may be temporary and may expire (i) per the terms of the offer, or (ii) upon the commencement of a Renewal Term.

<p><strong>12.5 </strong><strong>Collection of Charges</strong>. You agree that if Zoom is unable to collect the Charges for the Services through your Payment Method, Zoom may, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, take any other steps it deems necessary to collect such Charges from you and that you will be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by Zoom in connection with such collection activity, including collection fees, court costs, and attorneys’ fees. You further agree that, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, Zoom may collect interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the highest amount permitted by Law on any Charges not paid when due.</p>
<p><strong>12.6 Support Services and Updates</strong>. Zoom will provide, at no additional costs, (i) standard support as set forth in our then-current Documentation (see <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362003-Zoom-Technical-Support">Zoom Help Center</a>), and (ii) standard updates to the Services and Software that are made generally available by Zoom to similarly situated customers in the same geographic region during the Initial Subscription Term or any applicable Renewal Term. In accordance with applicable Law and the terms of this Agreement, Zoom reserves the right to (a) modify its standard support and charge you for standard support and (b) charge you for any updates to the Services or for any premium features or functionality.</p>
<p><strong>12.7 Termination or Suspension for Nonpayment</strong>. Without limiting our rights in any other section of this Agreement, including 14.3, if any failure to pay Charges continues for five (5) calendar days following the due date, Zoom may terminate, suspend, or disconnect your Services immediately and without prior notice.</p>
<p><strong>12.8 Billing Communications</strong>. You agree that Zoom may contact you via email or otherwise at any time with information relevant to your use of the Services, including billing communications, regardless of whether you have opted out of receiving marketing communications or notices.</p>
<p><strong>12.9 Withdrawal; Cooling-Off Period</strong>. If under applicable Law you have a time period to terminate your Services based on a right of withdrawal, or a cooling-off period, you may request to terminate the affected Services in accordance with applicable Law and, if applicable, receive a pro rata refund of any prepaid and unused Charges. If the Services begin before any withdrawal or cooling-off period, or you fail to terminate your Services during the right of withdrawal or cooling-off period, then you acknowledge that you lose any termination rights under this Section 12.9. Nothing in this Section 12.9 is intended to limit or exclude any of your rights that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable Law.</p>
<li><strong> TAXES</strong></li>
<p><strong>13.1 Taxes and Fees</strong>. Unless otherwise expressly specified by Zoom as required by applicable Law, all prices shown by Zoom and Charges for the Services on your account are exclusive of Taxes and Fees. Where applicable, Taxes and Fees will be charged on the invoices issued by Zoom in accordance with applicable Laws. Zoom, in its sole discretion, will (i) calculate the amount of Taxes and Fees due, and (ii) change such amounts without notice to you.</p>
<p><strong>13.2 VAT Invoices</strong>. If required by Law, Zoom will issue a VAT invoice, or a document that the relevant taxing authority will treat as a VAT invoice, to you. You agree that this invoice may be issued electronically.</p>
<p><strong>13.3 Tax exemptions</strong>. If you are exempt from any Taxes and Fees, you will provide Zoom with all appropriate tax exemption certificates, and/or other documentation satisfactory to the applicable taxing authorities, to substantiate such exemption status. Zoom reserves the right to review and validate tax exemption documentation. If the tax exemption documentation is not provided or not valid, Zoom reserves the right to charge applicable Taxes and Fees to you.</p>
<p><strong>13.4 Payment of Taxes and Withholding</strong>. You will pay Zoom, and you are solely responsible for, any applicable Taxes and Fees. All payments made by you to us under this Agreement will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding Taxes and Fees, as may be required by applicable Law. If any such deduction or withholding Taxes and Fees (including domestic or cross-border withholding taxes) are required on any payment, you will pay such additional amounts as necessary, such that the net amount received by us is equal to the amount then due and payable under this Agreement. We will provide you with such tax forms as reasonably requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount of any withholding or deduction for taxes in respect of payments made under this Agreement. You also agree to provide Zoom with withholding tax certificates, upon Zoom’s request, to the extent a withholding certificate is required to be sent to Zoom under applicable Law, and you agree that Zoom may provide your withholding tax certificate to the appropriate taxing authority without further notice to you.</p>
<p><strong>13.5 Value-Added Tax – Customer Obligations</strong>. If Taxes and Fees are due towards the taxing authorities by you instead of Zoom, through the reverse charge or other similar mechanism, you will provide Zoom with all appropriate evidence for Zoom to demonstrate your business nature, such as a valid VAT registration number (or similar information required under the relevant VAT Laws). Zoom reserves the right to review and validate your VAT registration number. If the VAT registration number is not valid, Zoom reserves the right to nevertheless charge the applicable VAT to you. For the avoidance of doubt, if VAT is due by you to a taxing authority, through the reverse charge or other similar mechanism, you are solely responsible for paying those amounts to the relevant taxing authority, such that Zoom receives the full amount of payment required.</p>
<p><strong>13.6 Tax Determination</strong>. Tax determination is principally based on the location where you have established your business based on your Customer Data, or if you are an individual, where you permanently reside. This location will be defined by Zoom as your ‘Sold To’ address. Zoom reserves the right to cross reference this location against other available evidence to validate whether your location is accurate. If your location is inaccurate, Zoom reserves the right to charge you any outstanding Taxes and Fees.</p>
<p><strong>13.7 Use and Enjoyment</strong>. If you subscribe to any Services, and those Services are used and enjoyed by a subsidiary of you in a country that is different from your location as determined pursuant to Section 13.6, you confirm that, where required, you will treat this as a supply to your subsidiary. If you subscribe to the Services and those Services are used and enjoyed by a branch or individual in a country that is different to your location as determined pursuant to Section 13.6, you acknowledge that you will inform Zoom of the Services that have been allocated, and you acknowledge that Zoom reserves the right to charge Taxes and Fees based on the use and enjoyment of those Services.</p>
<p><strong>13.8 Disclosures to Taxing Authorities</strong>. In accordance with applicable tax Law, and notwithstanding any of Zoom’s notice obligations that may arise under this Agreement, including but not limited to, Section 17.4 or pursuant to our <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/trust/government-requests-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Government Request Guide</a>, we may disclose Customer information, including Customer Confidential Information, to a tax authority without notice to you before or after the disclosure.</p>
<li><strong> TERM; TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION </strong></li>
<p><strong>14.1 Term; Automatic Renewal</strong>. Each Order Form will specify your Initial Subscription Term and any applicable Renewal Term for the Services. Unless your Order Form expressly states otherwise or applicable Law prohibits automatic renewal, each Renewal Term for the Services will begin automatically at the end of the then-current Initial Subscription Term or Renewal Term, as the case may be, unless either party provides written notice of termination or modification of the Services provided under such Order Form (i) at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the commencement of the next Renewal Term, or (ii) within the notice period required by applicable Law (collectively, (i) and (ii), the “<strong>Renewal Notice Period</strong>”). In order to terminate or modify the affected Services, you must provide notice to Zoom, via the billing portal (if available for your account) or in an email to renewals@zoom.us, in accordance with the Renewal Notice Period.

<li><strong> LIMITATION ON LIABILITY</strong></li>
<p><strong><u>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT LIMITS OUR LIABILITY TO YOU.</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>ZOOM AND ITS AFFILIATES AND EACH OF THEIR LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES;</strong></li>
<li><strong>LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY;</strong></li>
<li><strong>UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, LOSS OF, DELETION OF, OR ALTERATION OF SYSTEM DATA, CUSTOMER CONTENT, OR CUSTOMER DATA;</strong></li>
<li><strong>COSTS RELATED TO THE PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES;</strong></li>
<li><strong>TERMINATION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE, OR DISCONNECTION OF THE SERVICES;</strong></li>
<li><strong>A FAILURE OF YOUR INTERNET SERVICES, DOWNTIME, OR MAINTENANCE;</strong></li>
<li><strong>OUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL OR OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES; OR</strong></li>
<li><strong>DAMAGES, IN THE AGGREGATE FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE SERVICES (IF ANY) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIMS. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THESE EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES AND LIMITATIONS ON AVAILABLE DAMAGES APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS, OBLIGATIONS, AND LIABILITIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND WHETHER ARISING IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), STATUTE, CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ZOOM, ITS AFFILIATES, OR OUR LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS  HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU AND EVEN IF YOUR REMEDIES FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. </strong></p>
<p><strong>BECAUSE SOME STATES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES OR LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION ONLY APPLIES TO YOU TO THE EXTENT THAT THE EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES OR LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY ARE NOT PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. </strong></p>
<li><strong> DISPUTE RESOLUTION, ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER </strong></li>
<p>You agree to resolve certain disputes with Zoom through binding arbitration (“<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”). Arbitration means that an arbitrator, and not a judge or a jury, will decide the dispute. <strong>The parties expressly waive the right to bring or participate in any kind of class, collective, or mass action, private attorney general action, or any other representative action</strong>. This Arbitration Agreement supersedes all prior versions.</p>
<p><strong>27.1 Covered Disputes</strong>. You and Zoom agree that any dispute or claim between you and Zoom arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services (a “<strong>Dispute</strong>”), including any related software, hardware, integrations, advertising or marketing communications, your account, or any aspects of your relationship or transactions with Zoom, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, a Dispute will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. LAWSUITS AND ARBITRATIONS HAVE BEEN FILED, OR MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD AFFECT YOU. YOUR AGREEMENT TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT COULD AFFECT YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THOSE ACTIONS.</p>
<p><strong>27.2</strong><strong> Exceptions to Arbitration</strong>. This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims brought by either you or Zoom: (i) small claims court actions, if the requirements of the court are met and the claims are only on an individual basis; and (ii) claims pertaining to intellectual property rights, including trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents.</p>
<p><strong>27.3 Informal Dispute Resolution First</strong>. We want to address any Disputes without needing arbitration. If you have a Dispute with Zoom, prior to initiating arbitration, you agree to mail an individualized request (“<strong>Pre-Arbitration Demand</strong>”) to ATTN: Litigation Department, Zoom Video Communications, Inc., 55 Almaden Blvd., San Jose, CA 95113 so that we can work together to resolve the Dispute. A Pre-Arbitration Demand is only valid when it pertains to, and is on behalf of, a single individual. A Pre-Arbitration Demand brought on behalf of multiple individuals is invalid as to all. The Pre-Arbitration Demand must include: (i) your name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address associated with your account; (ii) the name, telephone number, mailing address and email address of your counsel, if any; (iii) a description of your Dispute; and (iv) your signature. Likewise, if Zoom has a Dispute with you, Zoom will send an email with its individualized Pre-Arbitration Demand, including the requirements listed above, to the email address associated with your Zoom account. If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) calendar days of when either you or Zoom submitted a Pre-Arbitration Demand, an arbitration can be brought. If you or Zoom have a Dispute involving claims under the exception to arbitration in Section 27.2(2), then this Section 27.3 does not apply to such Dispute. You agree that compliance with this Section 27.3 is a condition precedent to commencing arbitration, and that the arbitrator shall dismiss any arbitration filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures.</p>
<p><strong>27.4 Arbitration Procedure</strong>. If, after completing the informal dispute resolution process set out in Section 27.3, either you or Zoom wishes to initiate arbitration, the initiating party must serve the other party with a demand for arbitration. Any demand for arbitration by you shall be sent to the Zoom Litigation Department address in Section 27.3. Zoom will send any arbitration demand to the email address associated with your Zoom account or to your counsel, if any. You and Zoom agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (“<strong>FAA</strong>”) governs this Arbitration Agreement. If the FAA cannot apply for whatever reason, then the state laws governing arbitration procedures where you reside apply.</p>
<p>The applicable arbitration provider depends on where you live. If you are a California resident, the arbitration shall be administered by ADR Services, Inc. (“<strong>ADR Services</strong>”) under its Arbitration Rules, available at <a href="https://www.adrservices.com/services-2/arbitration-rules/">https://www.adrservices.com/services-2/arbitration-rules</a>. If you are not a California resident, the arbitration shall be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“<strong>NAM</strong>”) under its operative Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, available at <a href="https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms">https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms</a>. This Agreement will govern to the extent it conflicts with the arbitration provider’s rules. If the applicable arbitration provider is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider. If the parties cannot agree on an appropriate alternative arbitration provider, then the parties will ask a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5. To the extent there is a dispute over which arbitration provider has jurisdiction, a NAM arbitrator shall be appointed to resolve that dispute.</p>
<p>Arbitration hearings will take place through videoconferencing by default, unless you and Zoom agree upon another location in writing. A single arbitrator will be appointed. The arbitrator may award damages, declaratory or injunctive relief, and recoverable costs. Any arbitration award may be enforced (such as through a judgment) in any court with jurisdiction. An arbitration award shall have no preclusive effect in another arbitration or court proceeding involving Zoom and a different individual. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive authority to resolve all threshold arbitrability issues, including whether this Agreement is applicable, unconscionable, or enforceable, as well as any defense to arbitration. However, a court has exclusive authority to rule on the Mass Action Waiver in Section 27.6, including any claim that the section is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that it has been breached.</p>
<p>If a request to proceed in small claims court (see Section 27.2(1)), is made after an arbitration has been initiated, but before an arbitrator has been appointed, such arbitration shall be administratively closed. Any controversy over the small claims court’s jurisdiction shall be determined by the small claims court. If you or Zoom challenges the small claims court election in your Dispute, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the small claims court election is unenforceable, then such election shall be severed from this Arbitration Agreement as to your Dispute. However, such court determination shall have no preclusive effect in another arbitration or court proceeding involving Zoom and a different individual.</p>
<p><strong>27.5 Jury Trial Waiver</strong>. <strong>You and Zoom hereby waive any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury</strong>. You and Zoom are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 27.2 above. Court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court.</p>
<p><strong>27.6 </strong><strong>Mass Action Waiver</strong>. <strong>You and Zoom agree that, except as specified in Section 27.7 below, each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not on a class, collective, representative, or mass action basis, and the parties hereby waive all rights to have any Dispute be brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated on a class, collective, representative, or mass action basis</strong>. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this Section 27.6 are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Zoom agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and shall be pursued in the state or federal courts located in San Jose, California. This subsection does not prevent you or Zoom from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p>
<p><strong>27.7 Bellwether Arbitrations</strong>. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Zoom agree that if there are fifty (50) or more individual arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature brought against either party by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations within a one hundred and eighty (180) day period (“<strong>Mass Filing</strong>”), the parties shall select sixteen (16) individual arbitration demands (eight (8) per side) for arbitration to proceed (“<strong>Bellwether Arbitrations</strong>”). Only those sixteen (16) arbitration demands shall be filed with the arbitration provider, and the parties shall hold in abeyance, and not file, the non-Bellwether Arbitrations. Zoom will pay the arbitration provider’s costs for the sixteen (16) Bellwether Arbitrations. The statutes of limitation, including the requirement to file within one (1) year in Section 27.10 below, shall remain tolled when non-Bellwether arbitration demands are held in abeyance. While the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated, no other demand for arbitration that is part of the Mass Filing may be processed, administrated, or adjudicated, and no filing or other administrative costs for such a demand for arbitration shall be due from either party to the arbitration provider. If, contrary to this provision, a party prematurely files non-Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the arbitration provider shall hold those demands in abeyance.</p>
<p>All parties agree that arbitration demands are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. Any party may request that the arbitration provider appoint a sole standing administrative arbitrator (“<strong>Administrative Arbitrator</strong>”) to determine threshold questions such as (i) whether the Bellwether Arbitration process is applicable or enforceable, (ii) whether particular demand(s) are part of a Mass Filing, and (iii) whether demands within a Mass Filing were filed in accordance with this Agreement, including Section 27.3. In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree that the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s costs shall be paid by Zoom.</p>
<p>The parties shall work in good faith with the arbitrator to complete each Bellwether Arbitration within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days of its initial pre-hearing conference. The parties agree that the Bellwether Arbitration process is designed to achieve an overall faster, more efficient, and less costly mechanism for resolving Mass Filings, including the claims of individuals who are not selected for a Bellwether Arbitration.</p>
<p>Following resolution of the Bellwether Arbitrations, the parties agree to engage in a global mediation of all remaining arbitration demands comprising the Mass Filing (“<strong>Global Mediation</strong>”). The Global Mediation shall be administered by the arbitration provider administering the Bellwether Arbitrations. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing within thirty (30) calendar days following the mediation, the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing shall be filed and administered by the arbitration provider on an individual basis pursuant to the arbitration provider’s rules, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise in writing. Any party may request that the arbitration provider appoint an Administrative Arbitrator to determine threshold questions regarding the newly filed demands.</p>
<p>The parties agree to cooperate in good faith with the arbitration provider to implement the Bellwether Arbitration process, including the payment of filing and administrative costs for the Bellwether Arbitrations, deferring any filing costs associated with the non-Bellwether Arbitration Mass Filings until the Bellwether Arbitrations and subsequent Global Mediation have concluded, and cooperate on any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (i) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (ii) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. This Bellwether Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective, or mass action of any kind, or an arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision. The statutes of limitation applicable to each arbitration demand within a Mass Filing, including the requirement to file within one (1) year in Section 27.10 below, shall remain tolled from the time a party makes a Pre-Arbitration Demand to the time when that party files the arbitration demand with the arbitration provider.</p>
<p><strong>27.8 Settlement Offers and Offers of Judgment</strong>. At least ten (10) calendar days before the date set for the arbitration hearing, you or Zoom may serve a written offer of judgment upon the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance shall be submitted to the arbitration provider, who shall enter judgment accordingly. If the offer is not accepted prior to the arbitration hearing or within thirty (30) calendar days after it is made, whichever occurs first, it shall be deemed withdrawn, and cannot be given as evidence in the arbitration. If an offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover their post-offer costs and shall pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer (which, solely for purposes of offers of judgment, may include reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent they are recoverable by statute, in an amount not to exceed the damages awarded).</p>
<p>The parties agree that any disputes with respect to settlement offer(s) or offer(s) of judgment in a Mass Filing are to be resolved by a single arbitrator to the extent such offers contain the same material terms. For arbitrations involving represented parties, the represented parties’ attorneys agree to communicate individual settlement offer(s) or offer(s) of judgment to each and every arbitration claimant or respondent to whom such offers are extended.</p>
<p><strong>27.9 Arbitration Costs</strong>. Except as provided for in a Mass Filing (see Section 27.7), your responsibility to pay any filing, administrative, and arbitrator costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable arbitration provider’s rules. If you have a gross monthly income of less than 300% of the federal poverty guidelines, you may be entitled to a waiver of certain arbitration costs.</p>
<p><strong>27.10 Requirement to File Within One Year</strong>. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, and notwithstanding any other statute of limitations, any claim or cause of action under this Agreement (with the exception of disputes under Section 27.2(2)) must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be permanently barred. The statute of limitations and any arbitration cost deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by Section 27.3 above.</p>
<p><strong>27.11 Opt-Out</strong>. You may reject this Arbitration Agreement and opt out of arbitration by sending an email to opt-out@zoom.us within (i) thirty (30) calendar days of April 1, 2023 if you are an existing user, or (ii) thirty (30) calendar days of the date you created your account if you are a new user. Your opt-out notice must be individualized and must be sent from the email address associated with your individual Zoom account. An opt-out notice that purports to opt out multiple parties will be invalid as to all such parties. No individual (or their agent or representative) may effectuate an opt out on behalf of other individuals. Your notice to opt-out must include your first and last name, address, the email address associated with your Zoom account, and an unequivocal statement that you decline this Arbitration Agreement. If you do decide to opt out, that opt out will apply to this Arbitration Agreement and all previous versions thereof, and neither party will have the right to compel the other to arbitrate any Dispute. However, all other parts of this Arbitration Agreement will continue to apply to you, and opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may enter into in the future with us.</p>
<p><strong>27.12 Severability</strong>. Except as provided in Section 27.6 above, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then that provision will be severed; however, the remaining provisions shall still apply and shall be interpreted to achieve the closest possible intent to the original intent of this section, inclusive of the severed provision.</p>

		<h2>Kennedy School study puts annual Mass. costs at $64 billion, hopes figure will be used as a comparison in mass-transit spending decisions</h2>	</p>

	<div>

				<p>If you think the cost of driving is borne only by individuals who own cars, you may want to think again.</p>
<p>And you might be surprised just how pricey it is.</p>
<p>A team of graduate students at the Harvard Kennedy School estimate that the annual price tag for maintaining <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/64-billion-massachusetts-vehicle-economy">Massachusetts’ car economy is roughly $64.1 billion</a>, with more than half of that coming from public funds. While they didn’t perform an analysis for all the states, the group notes that the cost structure would be similar.</p>
<p>“This is a huge number,” said the paper’s lead author, Stevie Olson, M.P.P. ’20. “It’s unexpected because the majority of drivers, citizens, consumers experience roads for free. You just drive out your parking lot, your driveway, and you’re on the road. No one’s charging you, but there’s all of these costs that are both public costs, indirect externalities that are also costs, and then private costs that people are incurring.”</p>
<p>The paper, which the students wrote as part of an applied lab course, found that costs are diffused across a number of areas and involve things people don’t often consider. Beyond those for individual drivers, road maintenance, snow removal, and policing, there are less-obvious ones, such as those associated with added pollution, value of land set aside for parking lots, lost productivity from sitting in traffic, and various costs associated with injuries and deaths on the road.</p>
<p>Using publicly available data, the authors put the annual public tab at $35.7 billion, which amounts to about $14,000 for every household in the state. Those that do own vehicles pony up an additional $12,000 on average in direct costs.</p>
<p>The authors say their goal is to demonstrate the total costs of driving so that information can be used for comparison when held up against other types of transit investments, like bus, subway, and train systems.</p>

<p>“If you think about it as an equation, this is a variable that has not been in the conversation, and it’s something that should we be considering as we think about what is the best way to provide transportation options to the public,” said Linda Bilmes, the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Senior Lecturer in Public Policy at the Kennedy School.</p>
<p>“We’re not trying to say that cars are bad or that we don’t need roads,” said Bilmes, who oversaw the study. “We’re just trying to say that if we think about the overall cost/benefit analyses around transportation when it comes to this conversation, not only is there a cost to the vehicle economy, but the cost is actually larger than we may have realized.”</p>
<p>For example, “When we think about the cost of investing in public transportation, we tend to think about it as if the alternative is free, as if we are spending several billion on the North-South Rail Link [a project connecting the Massachusetts’s largest railroad stations] as opposed to not spending any money,” Bilmes added.</p>
<p>The study was written as part of Bilmes’ “Greater Boston Applied Field Lab,” which provides students experiential learning opportunities working with state and local government. The lab takes on external clients who pose real-world questions relating to finance and operations. Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton ’01, M.P.A./M.B.A. ’11, suggested the study and helped connect the graduate students to officials in his district.</p>
<p>“I asked for this study because we lead the country in bad traffic, and the best solution to that problem is building a reliable, regional, electrified rail system,” Moulton said in an email. “But, a lot of people point to the cost of a rail system as the excuse not to do it. They advocate for wider roads and other short-sighted fixes, but the truth is we pay massive amounts to subsidize car travel and don’t even know it. Professor Bilmes and her students finally put a price tag on driving.”</p>
<p>In the paper, the students broke down the total costs into three buckets: direct budgetary costs, indirect social and economic costs (which include many of the more intangible costs), and private costs. The first two buckets make up the $35.7 billion the public pays and the third bucket is the additional $28.4 billion car owners foot. It accounts for driver expenses like gas, regular maintenance and repair, depreciation, and financing.</p>
<p>To get these figures students worked with the mayor’s office from the city of Lynn to average what the city spends on roads over five years. They then used that data to estimate what the state’s other 351 municipalities spend. The team also went through the overall state budget and those of various agencies like the Department of Conservation and Recreation to calculate all the money going to roads. Students also spoke to a number of scholars and experts in the vehicle economy to determine the most reliable statistics to use in their calculating model for figures not in the budgets they looked at.</p>
<p>The authors, some of whom have graduated, hope their model will be recreated in other states.</p>
<p>“While the $64 billion cost applies to Massachusetts, the costs of the vehicle economy are similar across states,” Olson said. “The price tag for this infrastructure is big in every state, and you can imagine collectively as a nation that the total is huge. We can use the study to think about urban travel, such as in a metropolitan area, but we can also use it to start thinking about interstate travel. The study illuminates tradeoffs that we make when investing in transportation infrastructure, and, rather than think of roads as free, we need to realize that significant resources go into the operation of the motor vehicle economy.”</p>
<p>“We need leaders in our state who look beyond the cars in front of us to make smart decisions about our transportation future,” Moulton said. “This study will help us do it.”</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Postgres Language Server</h2>
<p dir="auto">A Language Server for Postgres. Not SQL with flavors, just Postgres.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Status</h2>
<p dir="auto"><g-emoji alias="construction" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f6a7.png">🚧</g-emoji> This is in active development and is only ready for collaborators. The majority of work is still ahead, but we've verified that the approach works. We're making this public so that we can develop it in the open with input from the community.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" rel="nofollow">Language Server Protocol</a> is an open protocol between code editors and servers to provide code intelligence tools such as code completion and syntax highlighting. This project implements such a language server for Postgres, significantly enhancing the developer experience within your favorite editor by adding:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Semantic Highlighting</li>
<li>Syntax Error Diagnostics</li>
<li>Show SQL comments on hover</li>
<li>Auto-Completion</li>
<li>Code actions such as <code>Execute the statement under the cursor</code>, or <code>Execute the current file</code></li>
<li>Optionated Code Formatting</li>
<li>... and many more</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Motivation</h2>
<p dir="auto">Despite the rising popularity of Postgres, support for the PL/pgSQL in IDEs and editors is limited. While there are some <em>generic</em> SQL Language Servers<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-dfc07bdecba4ba3de7afb79a0e5b6345" id="user-content-fnref-1-dfc07bdecba4ba3de7afb79a0e5b6345" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> offering the Postgres syntax as a "flavor" within the parser, they usually fall short due to the ever-evolving and complex syntax of PostgreSQL. There are a few proprietary IDEs<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2-dfc07bdecba4ba3de7afb79a0e5b6345" id="user-content-fnref-2-dfc07bdecba4ba3de7afb79a0e5b6345" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> that work well, but the features are only available within the respective IDE.</p>
<p dir="auto">This Language Server is designed to support Postgres, and only Postgres. The server uses <a href="https://github.com/pganalyze/libpg_query">libg_query</a>, therefore leveraging the PostgreSQL source to parse the SQL code reliably. Using Postgres within a Language Server might seem unconventional, but it's the only reliable way of parsing all valid PostgreSQL queries. You can find a longer rationale on why This is the Way™ <a href="https://pganalyze.com/blog/parse-postgresql-queries-in-ruby" rel="nofollow">here</a>. While libg_query was built to execute SQL, and not to build a language server, any shortcomings have been successfully mitigated in the <code>parser</code> crate. You can read the <a href="https://github.com/supabase/postgres_lsp/blob/main/crates/parser/src/lib.rs">commented source code</a> for more details on the inner workings of the parser.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once the parser is stable, and a robust and scalable data model is implemented, the language server will not only provide basic features such as semantic highlighting, code completion and syntax error diagnostics, but also serve as the user interface for all the great tooling of the Postgres ecosystem.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Roadmap</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is a proof of concept for building both a concrete syntax tree and an abstract syntax tree from a potentially malformed PostgreSQL source code. The <code>postgres_lsp</code> crate was created to prove that it works end-to-end, and is just a very basic language server with semantic highlighting and error diagnostics. Before further feature development, we have to complete a bit of groundwork:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><em>Finish the parser</em>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The parser works, but the enum values for all the different syntax elements and internal conversations are manually written or copied, and, in some places, only cover a few elements required for a simple select statement. To have full coverage without possibilities for a copy and paste error, they should be generated from <code>pg_query.rs</code> source code. (<a href="https://github.com/supabase/postgres_lsp/pull/4" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/supabase/postgres_lsp/pull/4/hovercard">#4</a>)</li>
<li>There are a few cases such as nested and named dollar quoted strings that cause the parser to fail due to limitations of the regex-based lexer. Nothing that is impossible to fix, or requires any fundamental change in the parser though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Implement a robust and scalable data model</em>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This is still in a research phase</li>
<li>A great rationale on the importance of the data model in a language server can be found <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2023/05/06/zig-language-server-and-cancellation.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></li>
<li><code>rust-analyzer</code>s <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/tree/master/crates/base-db"><code>base-db</code> crate</a> will serve as a role model</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa"><code>salsa</code></a> crate will most likely be the underlying data structure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Setup the language server properly</em>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This is still in a research phase</li>
<li>Once again <code>rust-analyzer</code> will serve as a role model, and we will most likely implement the same queueing and cancellation approach</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Implement basic language server features</em>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Semantic Highlighting</li>
<li>Syntax Error Diagnostics</li>
<li>Show SQL comments on hover</li>
<li>Auto-Completion</li>
<li>Code Actions, such as <code>Execute the statement under the cursor</code>, or <code>Execute the current file</code></li>
<li>... anything you can think of really</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are two aspects to Zig's simple error handling: error sets and try/catch. Zig's error set are essentially a specialized enum that can be created implicitly:</p>
<pre><code>fn divide(dividend: u32, divisor: u32) !u32 {
  if (divisor == 0) {
    return error.DivideByZero;
  }
  return dividend / divisor;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which is, in effect, the same as making it explicit:</p>
<pre><code>const DivideError = error {
  DivideByZero
};

fn divide(dividend: u32, divisor: u32) !u32 {
  if (divisor == 0) {
    return DivideError.DivideByZero;
  }
  return dividend / divisor;
}
</code></pre>
<p>In both cases our function returns an <code>!u32</code> where the exclamation mark, <code>!</code>, indicates that this function can return an error. Again, we can either be explicit about the error(s) that our function returns or implicit. In both of the above case, we've taken the implicit route.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could have used an explicit return type: <code>error{DivideByZero}!u32</code>. In the 2nd case we could have used the explicit error set: <code>DivideError!u32</code>.</p>
<p>Zig has a special type, <code>anyerror</code>, which can represent any error. It's worth pointing out that the return types <code>!u32</code> and <code>anyerror!u32</code> are different. The first form, the implicit return type, leaves it up to the compiler to determine what error(s) our function can return. There are cases where the compiler might not be able to infer type where we'll need to be explicit, or, if you're lazy like me, use <code>anyerror</code>. It's worth pointing out that the only time I've run into this is when defining a function pointer type.</p>
<p>Calling a function that returns an error, as <code>divide</code> does, requires handling the error. We have two options. We can use <code>try</code> to bubble the error up or use <code>catch</code> to handle the error. <code>try</code> is like Go's tedious <code>if err != nil { return err }</code>:</p>
<pre><code>pub fn main() !void {
  const result = try divide(100, 10);
  _ = result; // use result
}
</code></pre>
<p>This works because <code>main</code> itself returns an error via <code>!void</code>. <code>catch</code> isn't much more complicated:</p>
<pre><code>const result = divide(100, 10) catch |err| {
  // handle the error, maybe log, or use a default
}
</code></pre>
<p>For more complicated cases, a common pattern is to switch on the caught error. From the top-level handler in <a href="https://github.com/karlseguin/http.zig/blob/bda55c35c6167d073f3ec5e870b6fce89651d35b/src/httpz.zig#L289">http.zig</a>:</p>
<pre><code>self.dispatch(action, req, res) catch |err| switch (err) {
  error.BodyTooBig =&gt; {
    res.status = 431;
    res.body = "Request body is too big";
    res.write() catch return false;
  },
  error.BrokenPipe, error.ConnectionResetByPeer =&gt; return false,
  else =&gt; self._errorHandler(req, res, err),
}
</code></pre>
<p>Another somewhat common case with <code>catch</code> is to use <code>catch unreachable</code>. If <code>unreachable</code> is reached, the panic handler is executed. Applications can define their own panic handler, or <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/1c7798a3cde9e8dad31c276aab4c1affb2043ad2/lib/std/builtin.zig#L733">rely on the default one</a>. I use <code>catch unreachable</code> a lot in test code.</p>
<p>One final thing worth mentioning is <code>errdefer</code> which is like <code>defer</code> (think Go's <code>defer</code>) but it only executes if the function returns an error. This is extremely useful. You can see an example of it in the <a href="https://github.com/karlseguin/zuckdb.zig/blob/master/src/conn.zig#L27">duckdb driver</a></p>
<pre><code>pub fn open(db: DB) !Conn {
  const allocator = db.allocator;

  var slice = try allocator.alignedAlloc(u8, CONN_ALIGNOF, CONN_SIZEOF);

  // if we `return error.ConnectFail` a few lines down, this will execute 
  errdefer allocator.free(slice);

  const conn: *c.duckdb_connection = @ptrCast(slice.ptr);

  if (c.duckdb_connect(db.db.*, conn) == DuckDBError) {
    // if we reach this point and return an error, our above `errdefer` will execute
    return error.ConnectFail;
  }

  // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>A serious challenge with Zig's simple approach to errors that our errors are nothing more than enum values. We cannot attach additional information or behavior to them. I think we can agree that being told "SyntaxError" when trying to parse an invalid JSON, with no other context, isn't great. This is currently an <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2647">open issue</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, for more complex cases where I want to attach extra data to or need to attach behavior, I've settled on leveraging Zig's tagged unions to create generic Results. Here's an example from a PostgreSQL driver I'm playing with:</p>
<pre><code>pub fn Result(comptime T: type) T {
  return union(enum) {
    ok: T,
    err: Error,
  };
}

pub const Error = struct {
  raw: []const u8, // fields all reference this data
  allocator: Allocator, // we copy raw to ensure it outlives the connection

  code: []const u8,
  message: []const u8,
  severity: []const u8,

  pub fn deinit(self: Error) void {
    self.allocator.free(self.raw);
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>Because Zig has exhaustive switching, we can still be sure that callers will have to handle errors one way or another. However, using this approach means  that the convenience of <code>try</code>, <code>catch</code> and <code>errdefer</code> are no longer available. Instead, you'd have to do something like:</p>
<pre><code>const conn = switch (pg.connect()) {
  .ok =&gt; |conn| conn,
  .err =&gt; |err|  // TODO handle err
}
</code></pre>
<p>The "TODO handle err" is going to be specific to the application, but you could log the error and/or convert it into a standard zig error.</p>
<p>In our above <code>Error</code> you'll note that we've defined a <code>deinit</code> function to free <code>self.raw</code>. So this is an example where our error has additional data (the <code>code</code>, <code>message</code> and <code>severity</code>) as well as behavior (freeing memory owned by the error).</p>
<p>To compensate for our loss of <code>try</code> and <code>catch</code>, we can enhance or <code>Result(T)</code> type. I haven't come up with anything great, but I do tend to add an <code>unwrap</code> function and a <code>deinit</code> function (assuming either <code>Error</code> or <code>T</code> implement <code>deinit</code>):</p>
<pre><code>pub fn unwrap(self: Self) !T {
  switch(self) {
    .ok =&gt; |ok| return ok,
    .err =&gt; |err| {
      err.deinit();
      return error.PG;
    }
  }
}

pub fn deinit(self: Self) void {
  switch (self) {
    .err =&gt; |err| err.deinit(),
    .ok =&gt; |value| {
      if (comptime std.meta.trait.hasFn("deinit")(T)) {
        value.deinit();
      }
    },
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike Rust's <code>unwrap</code> which will panic on error, I've opted to convert <code>Error</code> into an generic error  (which can then be used with Zig's built-in facilities). As for exposing <code>deinit</code> directly on <code>Result(T)</code> it just provides an alternative way to program against the result. Combined, we can consume <code>Result(T)</code> as such:</p>
<pre><code>const result = pg.connect();
defer result.deinit();  // will be forwarded to either `T` or `Error`
const conn = try result.unwrap();
</code></pre>
<p>In the end, the current error handling is sufficient in most cases, but I think anyone who tries to parse JSON using <code>std.json</code> will immediately recognize a gap in Zig's capabilities. You can work around those gaps by, for example, introducing a <code>Result</code> type, but then you lose the integration with the language. Of particular note, I would say losing <code>errdefer</code> is more than just an ergonomic issue.</p>
