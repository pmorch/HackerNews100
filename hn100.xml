                          </figure><p>None of this is accidental. For years, Google has been watching users tack on "Reddit" to the end of search queries and finally decided to do something about it.</p><p>Google <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/products/search/more-content-by-people-for-people-in-search/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">started dropping hints</a> in 2022 when it promised to do a better job of promoting sites that weren't just chasing the top of search but were more helpful and human.</p><p>Last August, Google rolled out a big update to Search that seemed to kick this into action. Reddit, Quora, and other forum sites started getting more visibility in Google, both within the traditional links and within a new "discussions and forums" section, which you may have spotted if you're US-based.</p><p>The timing of this Reddit bump has led to some conspiracy theories. In February, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/expanded-reddit-partnership/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">Google and Reddit announced</a> a blockbuster deal that would let Google train its AI models on Reddit content. Google said the deal, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/reddit-ai-content-licensing-deal-with-google-sources-say-2024-02-22/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">reportedly worth $60 million</a>, would "facilitate more content-forward displays of Reddit information," leading to some speculation that Google promised Reddit better visibility in exchange for the valuable training data. A few weeks later, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reddits-ipo-set-to-take-front-page-of-internet-public-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Reddit also went public</a>.</p><p>A Google spokesperson told BI: "Our agreement with Reddit absolutely did not include ranking its content higher on Search."</p><p>Indeed, SEO experts have watched this Reddit bump since August when Google rolled out a crucial search update six months before the deal was announced. </p><p>It's not just Reddit. Q&amp;A forum Quora is getting a huge visibility bump in Google search results, per Semrush and Sistrix data. Google says "hundreds" of other forums and communities across the web are also getting the bump.</p><p>Still, given Reddit's size, its rise is the most noticeable. Per Sistrix data, Reddit is now as visible in top Google Search results as Instagram.</p><figure data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

Reddit's main competitors are Wikipedia, YouTube, and Fandom, Paine said, and it also competes in "high-value commercial searches," putting it up against Amazon. The "real competitors," he said, are the subreddits that compete with brands on the web. </p><h2>Giving the people what they want</h2><p>Why is Google doing this, and why <em>now</em>?</p><p>The company's stance here is simple: it's giving users what they want.</p><p>"Our research has shown that people often want to learn from others' experiences with a topic, so we've continued to make it easier to find helpful perspectives on Search when it's relevant to a query," a Google spokesperson told BI. "Our systems surface content from hundreds of forums and other communities across the web, and we conduct rigorous testing to ensure results are helpful and high quality."</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1775580045278597617" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">Responding to a post on X</a>, Google search liaison Danny Sullivan said users not only like seeing "forum content" but that they "proactively seek it out."</p><p>This shift in search behavior has already been happening for several years.

                        </section><p>"It's obvious that Google has this vision that they need more user-generated content," said Aleyda Solis, an SEO consultant for Orainti, who added that this is one way Google can respond to the rise in TikTok, Instagram, and other social spaces.</p><p>While Google might not be pumping Reddit results in exchange for training data, Google's AI systems would benefit from the more up-to-date information Reddit can give, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-uses-ai-search-queries-links-answers-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">especially when SGE rolls out in full</a>. </p><p>Furthermore, <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03214.pdf" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">a paper written by several Google employees</a>, published in late 2023, claims that pulling information from an internet search can better improve the accuracy of chatbots.</p><p>Named FreshPrompt, the method would incorporate "relevant and up-to-date information retrieved from a search engine" to improve a chatbot such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-gemini-explainer-ai-model-2023-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Google's Gemini</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chat-gpt-2023-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">OpenAI's ChatGPT</a>.</p><h2>Grifters can hijack search</h2><p>The question is whether this Reddit bump will continue or Google will nerf it. There are risks associated with Reddit, which relies on unpaid moderators to police unsavory content and spam.</p><p>Google told BI its systems work on all websites, including Quora and Reddit. Still, there's evidence that people are already abusing the rise of these sites in Google rankings. In a <a target="_blank" href="https://detailed.com/forum-serps/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">February study</a>, SEO blogger Glen Allsopp found that 51% of Reddit's top-ranking threads in Google Search's forums sections contained spam as a top comment.</p><p>YouTube already has heaps of videos offering advice on hijacking Reddit to rise to the top of Google Search. One of the most popular videos right now teaches viewers to purchase abandoned Reddit accounts, seek out popular Reddit posts to post comments filled with affiliate links, and then artificially inflate their popularity using "upvotes" purchased from third-party websites. This way, they can feasibly rocket to the top of Google.</p><p>It might not be that difficult. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/reddit-post-ranks-within-minutes" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">Search Engine Journal reported</a> this week that one Reddit user climbed to top-ranking Google Search results in minutes (BI could confirm the post ranked in the top 10, but couldn't independently verify the time it took to get there).</p><p>A Google spokesperson said the company's anti-spam policies apply to all content and that it takes particular attention to searches for sensitive topics such as health or finance.</p><p>Still, it's unclear how much Google's spam-attacking systems, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-update-march-2024/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">which just got a boost</a>, work right now. Reddit is "heavily manipulated at the end of the day," and people can easily take advantage of it by posting content there, Solis said.</p><p>Lily Ray, vice president of SEO strategy and research for marketing agency Amsive, told BI she is concerned that Google is "shifting the burden" of monitoring abuse onto Reddit moderators. Neglected subreddits risk getting spammed with unhelpful or even false content.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lily-ray-44755615_reddit-seo-google-activity-7183851130827784192-iE_A/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">Ray wrote on LinkedIn last week</a> that she found an example of Reddit ranking prominently at the top of Google when she searched "How to lose 10 pounds in a week".</p><p>"A redditor suggested 'cutting your arm off,'" she wrote.</p><p>This raises questions about whether Google can keep bad content from being eaten by its AI-generated search engine, which often sources its responses from the top search results. Already, Google is fighting an influx of AI-generated content flooding the web. At the same time, rivals such as OpenAI and Perplexity try to steal Google's lunch with AI chatbots that work like search engineers.</p><p>A Google spokesperson told BI that the company's analysis did not find that more harmful content on Search comes from forums.</p><figure data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject">

In Switzerland, where Nestlé is headquartered, such products are sold with no added sugar. These are the main findings of a new investigation by Public Eye and the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN), which shed light on Nestlé’s hypocrisy and the deceptive marketing strategies deployed by the Swiss food giant.</strong></span></p>

                      <p>Meagan Adonis was 23 when she became blind as a result of a serious health condition. That same year she found out that she was pregnant, and was worried about the challenges of being a blind mum. She has now found her motherhood feet, and recently gave birth to a second child. Based in Johannesburg, South Africa, the “blind goddess” – as she calls herself – now documents her life for more than 125,000 followers on social media and chronicles her daily routine with her new baby.</p>

                      </figure>
                      <p>Last year, Meagan posted several videos on TikTok promoting Cerelac infant cereals for babies from six months of age. “As you can see, I have a very active baby”, she <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@meaganadonis/video/7317231120582577414" target="_blank">explains</a> in a video in December. “As a blind mum, feeding time is always an adventure! […] Now let’s go and prepare his favourite meal of the day. Little bodies need big support with Nestlé Cerelac being the perfect addition to our mealtime,” she assures her audience in a cheerful tone – while omitting to mention that this maternal counsel comes as part of a paid partnership with Nestlé.</p>
                      <p>Thousands of kilometres away, in Guatemala, a father films his energetic little daughter. “There’s no greater satisfaction than seeing a strong, healthy child”, says Billy Saavedra, a <em>reggaeton </em>artist better known as <em>Billy the Diamond</em>. “That’s why we prefer Nido 1+, which supports the development of her bones and muscles, as well as her immune system”, he adds in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CqGPA4vgN_5/" target="_blank">video</a> promoting the brand’s formulas for young children in March on his Instagram account, which has more than 550,000 followers.</p>

                      <p>The use of influencers, such as Meagan or Billy (and their children), is at the core of Nestlé’s marketing strategy to boost sales of its baby foods. This approach, which has become increasingly important in many sectors, allows companies to reach a broad audience, building on a sense of identification and relatability. Coming from parents with similar experiences, advertising messages are regarded as benevolent advice that can be trusted.</p>
                      <h2><strong>A growing market</strong></h2>
                      <p>Fifty years after the “baby killers” infant formula scandal, Nestlé <a href="http://claims/" target="_blank">claims</a> to have learned from the past and <a href="https://www.nestle.com/media/news/breast-milk-substitutes-who-code-compliance-report-2022" target="_blank">proclaims</a> its “unwavering commitment” to the “responsible marketing” of breast-milk substitutes.</p>

                      <p>The food giant is doing everything it can to present itself as the world leader in infant nutrition, meticulously targeting each stage in a child’s first years of life. It currently controls 20 percent of the baby-food market, valued at nearly $70 billion.</p>
                      <p>Cerelac and Nido are some of Nestlé’s best-selling baby-food brands in low- and middle-income countries. According to exclusive data obtained from Euromonitor, a market analysis firm specializing in the food industry, their sales value in this category was greater than $2.5 billion in 2022.</p>
                      <p>In its own communications or via third parties, Nestlé <a href="https://www.nestle.com/csv/global-initiatives/healthier-kids/nestle-products-brands" target="_blank">promotes</a> Cerelac and Nido as brands whose aim is to help children “live healthier lives”. Fortified with vitamins, minerals and other micronutrients, these products are, according to the multinational, tailored to the needs of babies and young children and help to strengthen their growth, immune system and cognitive development.</p>
                      <p>But do these infant cereals and powdered milks really offer “the best nutrition,” as Nestlé claims? That’s what Public Eye and the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) wanted to find out, by focusing on one of the key public enemies when it comes to nutrition: sugar.</p>

                      <p>Spoiler alert: Our investigation shows that, for Nestlé, not all babies are equal when it comes to added sugar. While in Switzerland, where the company is headquartered, the main infant cereals and formula brands <a href="https://www.nestlebaby.ch/fr/nestle-baby" target="_blank">sold</a> by the multinational come without added sugar, most Cerelac and Nido products marketed in lower-income countries do contain added sugar, often at high levels.</p>
                      <p>For example, in Switzerland, Nestlé promotes its biscuit-flavoured cereals for babies aged from six months with the claim “no added sugar”, while in Senegal and South Africa, Cerelac cereals with the same flavour <a href="https://www.shoprite.co.za/All-Departments/Baby/Baby-Food/Baby-and-Toddler-Breakfast/Nestl%C3%A9-Cerelac-Baby-Cereal-With-Milk-Biscuit-Flavour-250g/p/10782004EA" target="_blank">contain</a> 6 grams of added sugar per serving.</p>

                      <p>Similarly, in Germany, France and the UK – Nestlé’s <a href="https://www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/2023-03/2022-annual-review-en.pdf" target="_blank">main European markets</a> – all formulas for young children aged 12-36 months sold by the company contain no added sugar. And while some infant cereals for young children over one year old contain added sugar, cereals for babies aged six months do not.</p>
                      <p>Cerelac wheat-based cereals for six-month-old babies sold by Nestlé in Germany and the UK has no added sugar, while the same product contains over 5 grams per serving in Ethiopia and 6 grams in Thailand.</p>

                      <p>“There is a double standard here that can’t be justified,” said Nigel Rollins, scientist at the World Health Organization (WHO), when presented with our findings. For Rollins, the fact that Nestlé does not add sugar to these products in Switzerland but is quite happy to do it in lower resources settings “is problematic both from a public health and ethical perspective.” Rollins says that manufacturers may try to get children accustomed to a certain level of sugar at a very early age, so that they prefer products high in sugar. “This is totally inappropriate,” he believes.</p>

                      <h2><strong>On the trail of hidden sugar</strong></h2>
                      <p>The amount of added sugar is often not even disclosed in the nutritional information available on the packaging of these kinds of products. In most countries, including Switzerland and across Europe, companies are only required to indicate the amount of total sugars, which also includes those naturally present in milk or whole fruit, and are <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/04-03-2015-who-calls-on-countries-to-reduce-sugars-intake-among-adults-and-children" target="_blank">not considered</a> harmful to health.</p>
                      <p>While Nestlé prominently highlights the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients contained in its products using idealizing imagery, it’s not transparent when it comes to added sugar. To uncover these “hidden sugars,” we obtained Cerelac and Nido products from a number of countries to examine their labels and, in some cases, have them analyzed by a specialized laboratory.</p>

                      <p>This turned out to be more complicated than expected. Several laboratories approached in Switzerland refused to conduct the sugar analysis of Nestlé products. One lab even wrote that it could not take part in the project because the results “could potentially have a negative impact” on its existing customers. Stonewalled, we decided to approach a lab based in Belgium. The results are edifying.</p>

                      <p>Cerelac is the world’s number one baby cereal brand, with sales exceeding $1 billion in 2022, according to Euromonitor. We examined 115 products sold in Nestlé’s main markets in Africa, Asia and Latin America. No less than 108 of them (94 percent) contained added sugar.</p>
                      <p>For 67 of these products, we were able to determine the amount of added sugar. On average, our analysis found almost 4 grams per serving, or about one sugar cube.

                      <p>In India, where sales surpassed $250 million in 2022, all Cerelac baby cereals contain added sugar, on average nearly 3 grams per serving. The same situation prevails in South Africa, the main market on the African continent, where all Cerelac baby cereals contain four grams or more of added sugar per serving. In Brazil, the world’s second-largest market, with sales of around $150 million in 2022, three-quarters of Cerelac baby cereals (known as Mucilon in the country) contain added sugar, on average 3 grams per serving.</p>

                      <p>“This is a big concern,” comments Rodrigo Vianna, epidemiologist and Professor at the Department of Nutrition of the Federal University of Paraíba in Brazil. “Sugar should not be added to foods offered to babies and young children because it is unnecessary and highly addictive. Children get used to the sweet taste and start looking for more sugary foods, starting a negative cycle that increases the risk of nutrition-based disorders in adult life. These include obesity and other chronic non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes or high blood-pressure,” laments the expert.</p>

                      <h2><strong>“A form of colonization”</strong></h2>
                      <p>Although less pronounced, this trend is confirmed with the Nido<em> </em>brand, the most <a href="https://www.nestle.com/brands/baby-foods/nido" target="_blank">popular</a> on the growing-up milks market. In 2022, global sales of Nido products for young children aged one to three had exceeded $1 billion according to Euromonitor. We examined 29 of these products sold by Nestlé in some of the main markets in low- and middle-income countries. The result: 21 of them (72 percent) contain added sugar<em>.</em></p>
                      <p>For ten of these products, we were able to determine the amount of added sugar. On average, our analysis found almost two grams per serving. The maximum value – 5.3 grams per serving – was detected in a <a href="https://www.nestleagustoconlavida.com/nido-1" target="_blank">product</a> sold in Panama.</p>

                      <p>With sales at around $400 million in 2022, Indonesia is the world’s leading market for Nido, known locally as Dancow. The two products for children aged one and over sold in the country contain added sugar – more than 0.7 grams per serving.</p>

                      <p>While the multinational is quick to highlight that these products are “without added sucrose,” they do contain added sugar in the form of honey. However, honey and sucrose are both considered by the WHO as sugars that should not be added to baby food. Indeed, Nestlé itself <a href="https://www.nidokids.co.za/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/sugar-fact-fiction-quiz" target="_blank">explains</a><a href="https://www.nidokids.co.za/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/sugar-fact-fiction-quiz"> </a>it very well in an educational quiz on Nido’s website in South-Africa: replacing sucrose with honey has “no scientific health benefit”, as both can contribute “to weight gain and possibly obesity”.</p>
                      <p>In Brazil, the world’s second-largest market for Nido, Nestlé <a href="https://www.ninho.com.br/ninho-fases1" target="_blank">claims</a> not to add sugar to its products out of concern for children’s health and diet: “It’s ideal to avoid consuming these ingredients in childhood, as the sweet flavour can influence a child’s preference for this type of food in the future,” warns the food giant on the brand’s website in Brazil.</p>

                      </figure>
                      <p>However, in most Central American countries, where Nestlé aggressively promotes Nido using influencers, the formulas for children aged one year and above contain over a sugar cube per serving. In Nigeria, Senegal, Bangladesh and South Africa – where Nido is very popular – all products for young children aged one to three contain added sugar.</p>
                      <p>“I do not understand why products for sale in South Africa should be different from those that are sold in high-income settings,” states Karen Hofman, Professor of Public Health at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and a qualified paediatrician. “It is a form of colonization and should not be tolerated,” she adds. “There is no valid reason to add sugar to baby food anywhere,” Hofman insists.</p>

                    <h2><strong>The first two years of life</strong></h2>
                  </p>
                </div>
        <div id="section-82hnrCQGG0" data-effects="eyJ0ZXh0UGVyTGluZSI6ZmFsc2UsImhhc0VmZmVjdHMiOmZhbHNlLCJuZWVkc0JhY2tncm91bmRDbG9uZSI6ZmFsc2UsImVuY29kZWQiOiIifQ==">
                      <p>This view is shared by the WHO, which has <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/07/1042441" target="_blank">warned</a> for several years now about the high added-sugar content in baby-food products. “This study stresses the need for urgent action to reshape the food environment for children,” Dr Francesco Branca, Director of the WHO Department of Nutrition and Food Safety, told Public Eye and IBFAN. “Eliminating added sugars from food products for young children would be an important way to implement early prevention of obesity.”</p>
                      <p>The WHO is <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/obesity" target="_blank">alarmed</a> that obesity is dramatically on the rise, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where it has now reached “epidemic proportions” and is fuelling an increase of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. Increased consumption of ultra-processed foods, often high in sugar, is singled out as one of the main causes of this epidemic.</p>
                      <p>Youngest children are not immune to this scourge: childhood obesity has increased tenfold over the past four decades, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight" target="_blank">according to the UN agency.</a> It’s estimated that 39 million children under the age of 5 are overweight or obese, the vast majority of which live in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
                      <p>“The first two years of a child’s life are particularly important, as optimal nutrition during this period lowers morbidity and mortality, reduces the risk of chronic disease, and fosters better development overall,” <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/infant-and-young-child-feeding" target="_blank">explains</a> the WHO. In 2022, the UN agency <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/364678/WHO-EURO-2022-6681-46447-67287-eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y" target="_blank">called for</a> a ban on added sugars and sweeteners in food products for babies and children under the age of three, and <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/364678/WHO-EURO-2022-6681-46447-67287-eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y" target="_blank">urged</a> industry to “be proactive” and “support public health goals” by reformulating its baby food products.</p>
                      <p>But Nestlé seems to be turning a deaf ear to these appeals. While the multinational publicly <a href="https://www.bebe.nestle.fr/introduire-nourriture-bebe" target="_blank">recommends</a> avoiding baby foods containing added sugar, these wise words don’t seem to apply to low- and middle-income countries, where Nestlé continues to add high levels of sugar to some of its most popular products.</p>
                      <p>Nestlé did not respond to specific questions about this double standard. But the company told Public Eye and IBFAN that it “has reduced by 11% the total amount of added sugars in [its] infant cereal portfolio worldwide” over the past decade and that it will “further reduce the level of added sugars without compromising on quality, safety and taste”. Nestlé also indicated that it is phasing out sucrose and glucose syrup of its Nido “growing up milks” globally. The company added that its products “fully comply” with the Codex Alimentarius and local laws.</p>
                      <h2><strong>Weak regulation</strong></h2>
                      <p>These baby-food products with added sugar are permitted under national legislation despite the fact that they go against WHO guidelines. National legislation is often based on the Codex Alimentarius, a collection of international standards developed by an intergovernmental commission based in Rome. The stated aim is to protect consumers’ health and ensure fair practices in the food trade. These standards, which gained importance as reference points for trade disputes following the establishment of the World Trade Organisation in 1995, tolerate added sugar in baby foods up to certain limits specific for each type of product – up to 20 percent in infant cereals.</p>

                      </figure>
                      <p>Codex standards for baby foods have been strongly <a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/260137/9789241513470-eng.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank">criticized</a> by the WHO, which deems them “inadequate”, particularly concerning sugar, as children establish their food preferences early in life. The agency has called for the standards to be updated and brought into line with WHO guidelines, with a particular focus on banning the addition of sugars. Current Codex standards are insufficient to determine whether a food is appropriate for promotion for infants and young children, according to the UN agency.</p>
                      <p>“WHO recommendations are independent of all industry influence,” Nigel Rollins told Public Eye and IBFAN. “At Codex, you have substantive lobbying: the sugar industry, the baby-food industry, and others are all present in the rooms where the decisions are taken.” Although the Codex Commission is an intergovernmental body, industry representatives may participate as observers, or even as members of national delegations. At a recent review of the standard for follow-up formula, industry lobbyists <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9309967/" target="_blank">accounted for</a> over 40 percent of participants. For Rollins, this is the main reason why Codex standards – and by extension national laws – are less protective than WHO guidelines.</p>

                    <h2><strong>Controversial marketing practices</strong></h2>
                  </p>
                </div>
        <div id="section-JHuGeAM4xh" data-effects="eyJ0ZXh0UGVyTGluZSI6ZmFsc2UsImhhc0VmZmVjdHMiOmZhbHNlLCJuZWVkc0JhY2tncm91bmRDbG9uZSI6ZmFsc2UsImVuY29kZWQiOiIifQ==">
                      <p>Our investigation shows that Nestlé uses aggressive marketing methods to promote Nido and Cerelac in low- and middle-income countries, despite the WHO’s International Code which <a href="https://www.who.int/tools/elena/interventions/regulation-breast-milk-substitutes" target="_blank">prohibits</a> the commercial promotion of such products. The Code, originally adopted in 1981 in the wake of the “baby killers” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/nestle-baby-milk-scandal-food-industry-standards" target="_blank">scandal,</a> and clarified and strengthened by later Resolutions, bans all promotion of infant formula in order to protect breastfeeding. The ban also <a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/260137/9789241513470-eng.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank">applies</a> to formulas for young children and baby foods that, like Cerelac, do not meet nutrition guidelines and contain “high levels of sugar”.</p>
                      <p>Nestlé responds that it “complies with the WHO Code and subsequent WHA resolutions as implemented by national governments everywhere in the world.” “Where local law is less stringent than our Policy for implementing the Code, we adhere to our strict Policy,” Nestlé adds.</p>
                      <p>In practice, while 70% of countries have adopted laws based on the Code, many contain loopholes and implementation is generally <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2023/06/20/default-calendar/global-congress-on-implementation-of-the-international-code-of-marketing-of-breast-milk-substitutes" target="_blank">weak</a> in low- and middle-income countries, often as a result of pressures from the baby-food industry and exporting countries. Furthermore, the Nestlé policy neither applies to formulas for children aged one year or more, nor to other baby foods, although these are all covered by the Code.</p>
                      <p>What’s more, Nestlé promotes its Nido and Cerelac products as healthy and essential for children’s development, although they contain added sugar and carry many risks for children’s health and development. “Often manufacturers’ health claims are not supported by the science,” says Rollins, in response to reading our report. “If you have a pharmaceutical product for which you want to claim that it improves brain development in babies, or improve growth in babies, you would have to pass very high standards of evidence,” he explains. “But because it’s a food, you don’t have to pass those standards.”</p>

                      <p>Nutrition and health claims “idealize the product, imply that it is better than family foods, and mask the risks,” the WHO <a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/260137/9789241513470-eng.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank">explained</a> in a recent report that warns of baby-food marketing practices that compromise the progress made in infant and young-child nutrition. They mislead consumers as to the real content of these foods and should not be made, according to the UN agency. Yet Nestlé has made them a core pillar of its marketing strategy.</p>
                      <h2><strong>“Grow smart”</strong></h2>
                      <p>“Grow smart”. Huge billboards in the centre of Jakarta and other main Indonesian cities display the slogan. It’s at the heart of Nestlé’s campaign to promote its Nido brand, known in the country as Dancow, as the “parents’ partner for children’s growth and development”. “Inspired by mum’s love for baby nutrition, Dancow is the healthiest choice”, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DancowIndonesia/" target="_blank">claims</a> Nestlé, while failing to disclose that its product contains added sugar.</p>

                      <p>Last year, Nestlé launched a <a href="https://www.dancow.co.id/dpc/akudankausukadancow" target="_blank">campaign</a> aimed at “supporting the potential of children of 1 year and above in Indonesia”. The campaign managed to engage 2 million mothers in sharing “exciting moments” with their children on social media, effectively turning them into unpaid advertisers and brand ambassadors. “Thank you @dancow for accompanying my child’s growth and development,” writes one of the mothers.</p>
                      <p>Nestlé deploys the same, finely honed strategy in Brazil to promote its Cerelac (Mucilon) infant cereal brand. Its campaign is based on the concept of “nutrition enriched by Mucilon and chosen by mothers,” <a href="https://grandesnomesdapropaganda.com.br/anunciantes/nova-campanha-mostra-o-amor-dos-pais-e-a-nutricao-fortificada-por-tras-de-cada-colherada-de-mucilon/" target="_blank">muses</a> Dani Ribeiro, director of the advertising agency in charge. It plays on parents’ love for their babies, and highlights “the benefits of nutrients that contribute to babies’ immunity and brain development,” she explains. “Parents are nourished by the fact that they are making the right choice for their children,” Ribeiro adds.</p>

They are not necessary. They are inferior to real food,” he stated. “These types of products are part of a global nutrition transition to an ultra-processed diet which is associated with weight gain and obesity, but also many other adverse health outcomes."</p>

                      <p>Nestlé pioneered “medical marketing,” involving a set of techniques that have become standard practice in the industry today, says Phillip Baker, a senior research fellow at the University of Sydney in Australia and author of numerous studies on the subject. The strategy is based on strengthening links with health professionals and obtaining the endorsement of leading scientific authorities, while positioning the company as a partner for parents in the nutrition and development of their children.</p>
                      <p>While the main goal is to increase sales on the baby-food market itself, it plays another key role for Nestlé: developing loyal consumers for life. Baker describes it as a “cradle-to-grave marketing strategy.” “The idea being to get consumers from a very young age, develop that brand loyalty, develop those taste preferences for their products”, he explains.</p>
                      <p>Nestlé has created Baby and Me, an “educational platform” available in over 60 countries, with the stated aim of promoting healthy eating for babies and offering “expert-backed” information. Parents looking for information on infant nutrition may be directed to this platform and be exposed to content that steers them towards Nestlé products.</p>

                      </figure>
                      <p>“Parenteam,” the Filipino version of the scheme, offers ovulation and pregnancy calendars as well as a due-date calculator. In South Africa, parents can access a “major moment checklist” to help them “win in every aspect of modern parenting”. Mexico has an allergy calculator and Brazil a guide to finding the perfect name. These websites are packed with advice, tools and recipes designed to attract parents. But ads for Nestlé products and “buy now” buttons are never far away.</p>
                      <h2><strong>Experts in white coats</strong></h2>
                      <p>Nestlé regularly organizes events on the Nido and Cerelac online channels with health professionals. Although most of the time the experts speak about child-nutrition related issues and do not directly promote the products, the Nido and Cerelac brands feature prominently, leading parents to believe that these products are endorsed by eminent scientific authorities and that Nestlé’s health and nutrition claims have scientific support.</p>
                      <p>Our investigation also uncovered cases of experts in white coats directly promoting Nestlé products. “Nido’s specialized nutrition system is designed to protect every stage of your child’s development,” explains nutritionist Kenia Lawrence in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2_ILm-rMhp/" target="_blank">video</a> posted on Instagram in Panama. “Nido1+ helps protect and strengthen the immune system, thanks to probiotics and prebiotics, and contains key nutrients for child development.” Not a word on the one and a half sugar cubes added to each portion of the product in question.</p>
                      <figure>
                        
                        <figcaption></figcaption>
                      </figure>
                      <p>For Baker, it is evident that “by using health professionals, the companies powerfully shape parents’ decision making”. An influence that “can very often be harmful,” he believes. This practice also goes against WHO <a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/374182/9789240084490-eng.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank">guidelines,</a> which state that manufacturers must not encourage healthcare professionals to support and recommend their brands and products.</p>
                      <p>In a <a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/353604/9789240046085-eng.pdf?sequence=2" target="_blank">recent report,</a> the UN agency severely criticized the marketing practices used by the baby-food industry to promote its products online, pointing the finger at the use of various strategies that are often not identifiable as advertising. These include the use of baby-clubs, as well as the use of health professionals and influencers such as Meagan Adonis and Billy Saavedra. The UN agency <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-04-2022-who-reveals-shocking-extent-of-exploitative-formula-milk-marketing" target="_blank">called</a> on manufacturers to put an end to their “exploitative marketing practices”.</p>
                      <p>Nothing can justify the double standards highlighted by the Public Eye and IBFAN investigation. If Nestlé truly intends to act responsibly, it must follow the recommendations and guidelines of the WHO and stop getting babies and young children hooked on sugar, regardless of the country in which they were born.</p>

      <p>A possibly new algorithm for LLM Inference</p>
      <section>
        <p>
        With Effort you can adjust smoothly - and in real time - how many calculations you'd like to do during inference of an LLM model. 
        </p><p>
          At 50% calculations it is as fast as regular matrix multiplications on Apple Silicon chips. At 25% effort it's twice as fast and still retains most of the quality.
          </p><p>
            You can also freely choose to skip loading the least important weights.
          </p><p>
            It is implemented for Mistral now, it should work for all the other models just as well. No retraining needed, just conversion to a different format and some precomputation.

          </p><p>
          <img src="https://kolinko.github.io/effort/ryc/ryc0.1.png">
</p><p>
You can download the implementation here - <a href="https://github.com/kolinko/effort">from Github</a>. It should run right after fetching the converted weights.
</p><p>
The implementation is done for FP16 only for now. The multiplications are fast, but inference overall is still slightly lacking because some non-essential parts - softmax etc - need improvement.

</p><p>Mixtral and Q8 are in the works. 
</p><p>
Oh, and it also allows to <b>dynamically decide how much of the model you want to load into the memory</b>. You can skip the least important 10-20-30% weights while loading. It doesn't require any conversion steps - it just loads less data. Sort of an ad-hoc distillation, you could say.
</p><p>
  Let's see it in action now.
  </p><figure id="demo">
 
  


The actual speed is constrained by the implementation overhead. Even on 0%, it still takes 15ms on my machine (and a few seconds on M1 Air) to produce a single token. These parts are done in &lt;1ms in Llama.cpp/Ollama, and I could use help from a Swift/Metal engineer to fix this.
</figure>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/kolinko/effort">You can download and test it yourself from Github.</a>
</p><p>
  Getting back to benchmarks...
</p><figure>
          <img src="https://kolinko.github.io/effort/ryc/ryc0.2.png">

The pink line is actual speed, with a suboptimal implementation of the overhead (calculating norms, attn scores etc). There is a ~15ms overhead to every token that I didn't manage to fix, but Llama.cpp/Ollama/MLX don't seem to have. Help would be appreciated here from someone proficient in Metal/Swift.
</figure>
  <p>
  Let's talk quality now. 
  </p><p>
    First, of the multiplication approximation itself.
  </p><figure>
<img src="https://kolinko.github.io/effort/ryc/ryc0.3.png">
Tracked by taking a sample input state vector, multiplying it by say wq, or w1. Some Matrixes seem to be easier to approximate using this method, some are slightly more difficult. But more or less the output looks like here.
  </figure>
  <p>
And now for the model itself.
</p><figure>
  <img src="https://kolinko.github.io/effort/ryc/ryc0.4.png">
  Measured by generating a 500 token text first, and then comparing predictions of the tokens when this text would be given as an input. Perplexity score would be nice here, see notes at the end why it's not yet done.
</figure>
<p>
  And basic QA tests:
  </p><figure>
  <img src="https://kolinko.github.io/effort/ryc/ryc0.5.png">
  BasicQ is a list of a few tricky QA prepared by GPT-4. Hopefully this and the working demo are enough to show the potential. Performing HumanEval and HellaSWAG needs fixes in the implementation first - see below.
</figure>
<p>
If you're still sceptical - as I would be - please head out to the <a href="https://kolinko.github.io/effort/pesky.html">Help Needed!</a> section to see what's needed for the better tests to be performed.
</p><p>
  The initial results (and undocumented experiments with Mixtral) seem to be robust enough to warrant publication. I hope though that the above is enough to convince you to <a href="https://github.com/kolinko/effort">play with the 0.0.1B version</a>.

Embeddings are just arrays of numbers, but they contain a compressed form of a considerable amount of human knowledge and shrink features that used to be substantial specialized projects into ones that individual product engineers can take on.</p><p>There are a ton of tooling options available to use embeddings. I’ll highlight our choices and note where you might want to make different ones for your situation.

It’s pretty short and sweet. We have icon sets you can query, bookmark, and add to your project.</span></p><p><span>There are a bunch of </span><a href="https://lakefs.io/blog/12-vector-databases-2023/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">specialized vector databases</a><span> to choose from. Instead, we chose Postgres with </span><a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">pgvector</a><span> to blend embedding search with business logic like filtering and scoring. While it’s not the fastest vector database, we didn’t want to have to compare results across multiple data sources. Pgvector probably already has </span><a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">a library for your favorite database client</a><span>. Our project was Typescript through and through, and we used </span><a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-node?tab=readme-ov-file#drizzle-orm" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">drizzle-orm</a><span>. The docs will be a more robust place for setup documentation, so I’m leaving out that part to focus on the features you can build.</span></p><p>Once set up with pgvector, we created a strategy for encoding our icon data into vector embeddings. Embeddings are points in many-dimensional space, up to thousands of dimensions. Unfortunately, the axes of that grid are not humanly grokable ideas like “size” or “brightness.” They’re a bit of a black box. Luckily, like any good abstraction, they’re a black box with a good API.</p><p>The best practice seems to be finding the details that best represent what people want to search for and creating a function that outputs that as a string. Our icons can be a part of many use-case-based ‘categories’ and have many descriptive ‘tags’ associated with them. We encoded that information along with the icon name because that best represents what the icon is. Whereas the name of the icon set the icon belongs to, or its dimensions aren’t relevant. The strings we generated looked basically like this:</p><pre><code>const createIconEmbeddingsString = (icon) =&gt; `icon: "${icon.name}", categories: [${categories}] tags: [${tags}]`;</code></pre><p><span>Next, we chose an embedding model. </span><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OpenAI’s embedding models</a><span> will probably work just fine. We’re using their `text-embedding-3-small`. If you want to dive in, check out the </span><a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">leaderboard</a><span> and pick the model that best meets your needs. Whether you use an embeddings API or self-host an open source option, the interface should be text in and embeddings out.</span></p><p><span>Many sites implement search, but most icon sites implement search by </span><a href="https://icon-sets.iconify.design/?query=woof" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">text</a><span> </span><a href="https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/search/#q=woof" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">matching</a><span> or full-text search. If you’re looking for a dog icon, they search over the icon metadata for icons that have ‘dog’ in them. If they want to get </span><a href="https://fontawesome.com/search?q=woof&amp;o=r" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">craftier</a><span>, they come up with a bag of words related to ‘dog,’ like maybe ‘k9’, ‘puppy,’ and ‘woof’ to catch near misses. That’s pretty fragile. Someone has to choose tags for each icon; if they miss an important one, users won’t find what they’re looking for.</span></p><p><span>Our app gets relevant results when searching for ‘</span><a href="https://www.v0.app/search?g=popularity&amp;q=dog&amp;qid=nmezx8efde3pvydym2f2sk9n" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">dog</a><span>.’ We also get solid results for ‘</span><a href="https://www.v0.app/search?g=popularity&amp;q=puppy&amp;qid=v27kjdebk8ex7n30qe4b5tfs" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">puppy</a><span>’ without a bag of words by measuring the cosine similarity between the embeddings of your search query and each icon. There are multiple ways to measure how similar embeddings are to each other, but OpenAI’s embeddings are designed to work well with cosine distance. Cosine similarity is just the opposite of cosine distance. Order by cosine distance wherever you can to take advantage of </span><a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#why-isnt-a-query-using-an-index" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">indexes</a><span>.</span></p><pre><code>cosine_similarity(x,y) = 1 - cosine distance(x,y)</code></pre><p><span>You can even try dog breeds like ‘</span><a href="https://www.v0.app/search?q=hound" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">hound</a><span>,’ ‘</span><a href="https://www.v0.app/search?q=poodle" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">poodle</a><span>,’ or my favorite ‘</span><a href="https://www.v0.app/search?q=samoyed" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">samoyed</a><span>.’ It pretty much just works. But that’s not all; it also works for other languages. Try ‘</span><a href="https://www.v0.app/search?g=popularity&amp;q=chien&amp;qid=mcbp6rk9z3y8lb1emt1zblev" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">chien</a><span>’ and even ‘</span><a href="https://www.v0.app/search?g=popularity&amp;q=%E7%8A%AC&amp;qid=hd8whx733f3rljhadasgfzb9" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">犬</a><span>’</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-143207380" href="https://bawolf.substack.com/p/embeddings-are-a-good-starting-point#footnote-1-143207380" target="_self" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">1</a></span><span>! With pgvector, we can get these results with simple SQL queries.</span></p><pre><code>SELECT
  1 - cosine_distance (search_query.embedding,
    icon.embedding) as similarity,
  *
FROM
  icon
  join search_query on search_query.text = 'dog'
ORDER BY

LIMIT 50;</code></pre><p>Since we’re ordering by distance, every search returns every result in the table in order of closeness. We cut off results by a fixed number to make this manageable, limiting the query to the top 50. Using an arbitrary distance cut-off is tempting, like querying for results with a cosine similarity of less than 0.8. Unfortunately, the absolute distance for one query to produce correct-feeling results might differ drastically from another. We limit by the number of results, not by a minimum value, whenever possible.</p><p><span>If we only wanted similarity search, any vector database would be fine, but Postgres allowed us to layer more features on top. The initial search looks across </span><em>all icons</em><span> in </span><em>all  icon sets</em><span>, but our user’s style might only match some of the icon sets. We can filter by values like in any other Postgres query.</span></p><pre><code>SELECT

  cosine_distance (search_query.embedding,
    icon.embedding) ASC
LIMIT 50;</code></pre><p>This is deterministic; everyone searching for a ‘dog’ will get the same results. However, the inputs are still unbounded, so embedding search doesn’t guarantee that the best results will be produced for every input. We can try different embedding models or ways of encoding icons into embeddings to improve the system.</p><p>The embedding search usually puts the correct icon on the page, but the correct icon isn’t always the first result. We could make a simple algorithm that adjusts to user feedback and improves over time. To do this, we’d count every time a user clicks on an icon for a particular search query. When ranking search results, we’d create a score for each icon that combines the embedding search with the click data.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Here’s a simple ranking algorithm.

You can also limit your search to be above or below a certain distance threshold. That doesn’t seem super reliable. Relative distances seem more meaningful than discrete amounts. If you’re set on using a threshold, I’d recommend keeping it pretty wide, like 0.1 or 0.05, and using it with a limit. You may get some mileage using a wide range to avoid returning irrelevant long-tail results.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Early last year, a twice-weekly newspaper in Park City, Utah, published <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/news/state-legislature-strips-land-use-authority-from-park-city-city-decries-overreach/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="article">a story</a> on the rejection of a state <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://le.utah.gov/~2023/bills/sbillint/SB0271S01_ComparedWith_SB0271.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Utah bill revision">measure</a> that would’ve allowed tech billionaire Matthew Prince to build an 11,000-square-foot mansion on a hill with little say from locals.</p><p>It was the first time the Park Record had ever written about Prince’s mansion. And then something curious happened: The paper started covering Prince’s plans more regularly, and positively. In January, it reported on Prince describing his future home as “<a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/news/proposed-home-overlooking-old-town-will-be-something-to-be-proud-of-owner-says-planning-commission-prepares-for-hearing-possible-decision-in-february/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Proposed home overlooking Old Town will be ‘something to be proud of,’ owner says; Planning Commission prepares for hearing, possible decision in February">something to be proud of</a>.” Then it <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/news/planning-commission-takes-up-castle-on-hill/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="article">suggested</a> the city was putting Prince’s home through a longer review than normal because of his “celebrity nature.” A week later, it called out a local official for trying to “<a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/news/dissenting-planning-commissioner-rehashes-prince-proposal-at-session-to-ratify-edits-of-approval-conditions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Dissenting planning commissioner rehashes Prince proposal at session to ratify edits of approval conditions">re-legislate</a>” his project after it was approved.  </p><p>One major change had occurred at the Park Record between the time of that first story and the rest: Prince <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/news/tatiana-and-matthew-prince-set-to-acquire-the-143-year-old-park-record-newspaper/%23:~:text=The%20Princes%20are%20acquiring%20the,alike,%E2%80%9D%20said%20Tatiana%20Prince." rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="article">bought </a>the paper. And Don Rogers, the editor Prince <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/news/the-park-record-names-a-new-editor/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Article on hiring">hired</a> to run it, is living rent-free in one of his properties at the moment. </p><p>Rogers says he doesn’t believe Prince’s ownership of the paper (or his current living arrangements) poses a conflict of interest. The Park Record identifies its owner in coverage. Even so, this arrangement is one of the multiple ways that Prince has irked some Park City denizens. They accuse him of steamrolling his way into a new sprawling home that would eclipse surrounding residences and challenge local height and size limits. They’ve painted him as a bully who turns petty when he doesn’t get his way. And at an April 30 review to consider an appeal of his project’s approval, they plan to fight back. </p><p>In Park City, “billionaires can’t just buy what they want,” said Jim Doilney, a resident and former city council member. </p><figure data-component="article-image"><figcaption data-component="caption" data-testid="caption"><span>The new family home billionaire Matthew Prince has proposed in Park City, Utah.</span><span>Source: Park City Planning Commission</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bruce Baird, an attorney for Prince, said he doesn’t agree with the characterization of Prince as a bully. If anything, he said, Prince is being bullied by his neighbors who are “trying to play the victim card.”</p><p>Prince, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Cloudflare Inc., a cybersecurity company valued at more than $30 billion, is certainly not the first tech billionaire to get into dust-ups with his neighbors. At a much grander scale, Salesforce Inc. CEO Marc Benioff has been buying tracts of land on Hawaii’s Big Island, raising <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-05/benioff-gives-150-million-to-hawaii-hospitals-after-buying-land" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Benioff Gives $150 Million to a Pair of Hawaii Hospitals (2)">concerns</a> from locals about property prices and local culture. Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison’s purchase of the Hawaiian island of Lanai <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-oracle-larry-ellison-lanai-hawaii-plans-tourism/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Larry Ellison’s Hawaii Paradise Is Infuriating Locals">infuriated</a> residents, who learned seemingly overnight that he’d become their boss, landlord, or both.</p><p>Prince’s own conflict with locals in Park City began after he bought a property on 220 King Road in late 2020 where he proposed to build a larger, taller home, a pool and “accessory” buildings. His new home would cut into a mountainside just beneath an open space that taxpayers had <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/news/park-city-completes-64-million-acquisition-of-treasure/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="article">bought</a> for $64 million to fend off future development. </p><p>After many discussions of rules and regulations, city officials eventually cleared Prince’s plans. But a group of locals led by residents Eric and Susan Hermann have appealed, maintaining that his house would violate ordinances. </p><p>What has arguably bothered locals just as much as Prince’s project itself is how he’s gone about it. His failed effort to slip a bill through the state legislature — brought to light by the <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.sltrib.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Salt Lake Tribune</a> — was not well received. Nor was the way he tried to rally support.</p><p>At a Feb. 14 hearing, one of Prince’s supporters described himself as a neighbor but didn’t mention that he’d co-founded a tech company with Prince and had known him for years.  Prince submitted a letter of support for his plans signed on behalf of a neighboring property — a property that he himself owned. “It’s not uncommon for people to comment on public matters without revealing all relationships,” Baird said.</p><p>Shortly after the Hermanns appealed the city’s approval of the Prince house, Prince filed a complaint against their two Bernese Mountain dogs, Sasha and Mocha. He accused the dogs of chasing people and called for a ban against them on a nearby trail. He also sued the Hermanns over a rock wall between their properties.  “We are disappointed (albeit not surprised) that he would stoop to such tactics,’’ Eric Hermann said by email.</p><figure data-component="article-image"><figcaption data-component="caption" data-testid="caption"><span>Sasha and Mocha</span><span>Source: Susan Fredston-Hermann</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, “Save Sasha and Mocha” stickers are being distributed around town, and residents have flocked to the Instagram page of a local radio station to support the dogs. </p><p>“If it hadn't gotten to the stage where the Hermanns were doing what they're doing,” Baird said, “perhaps neighbors could have sat down and talked about it.”</p><p>In February, Prince’s Park Record newspaper published a letter to the editor from local freelance journalist Michelle Deininger, who criticized Prince’s plans and chastised the paper itself for its “one-sided” coverage. </p><p>“The Princes say their finished home will be “something to be proud of,”’ Deininger <a data-component="link" href="https://archive.ph/o/uFfMP/https://www.parkrecord.com/opinion/letters-for-print/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Letter">wrote</a>. “But will anyone feel that way about the local paper by then?” </p><p>Alongside her letter, the Park Record ran three letters in support of the Prince house.</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <p><strong>(2005–2024)</strong></p><p>Established in 2005, initially for a 3-year period, the Future of Humanity Institute was a multidisciplinary research group at Oxford University.&nbsp; It was founded by Prof Nick Bostrom and brought together a select set of researchers from disciplines such as philosophy, computer science, mathematics, and economics to study big-picture questions for human civilization, attempting to shield them from ordinary academic pressures and create an organizational culture conducive to creativity and intellectual progress.</p><p>During its 19-year existence, the team at FHI made a series of research contributions that helped change our conversation about the future and contributed to the creation of several new fields and paradigms.&nbsp; FHI was involved in the germination of a wide range of ideas including existential risk, effective altruism, longtermism, AI alignment, AI governance, global catastrophic risk, grand futures, information hazards, the unilateralist’s curse, and moral uncertainty.&nbsp; It also did significant work on anthropics, human enhancement ethics, systemic risk modeling, forecasting and prediction markets, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and on the attributes and strategic implications of key future technologies.&nbsp; One major contribution was in showing that it was even possible to do rigorous research on big picture questions about humanity’s future.</p><p>Over time FHI faced increasing administrative headwinds within the Faculty of Philosophy (the Institute’s organizational home).&nbsp; Starting in 2020, the Faculty imposed a freeze on fundraising and hiring.&nbsp; In late 2023, the Faculty of Philosophy decided that the contracts of the remaining FHI staff would not be renewed.&nbsp; On 16 April 2024, the Institute was closed down.</p><p>Over the course of its nineteen years, FHI inspired the emergence of a vibrant ecosystem of organizations where the kinds of questions that FHI investigated can be explored.&nbsp; FHI alumni will continue to research these questions both within Oxford and at other places around the world.&nbsp; Topics that once struggled to eke out a precarious existence at the margins of a single philosophy department are now pursued by leading AI labs, government agencies, nonprofits, and specialized academic research centers (with many more in the process of creation).</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/libxev">https://github.com/mitchellh/libxev</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40065821">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">libxev</h2><a id="user-content-libxev" aria-label="Permalink: libxev" href="#libxev"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">libxev is a cross-platform event loop. libxev provides a unified event loop
abstraction for non-blocking IO, timers, signals, events, and more that
works on macOS, Windows, Linux, and WebAssembly (browser and WASI). It is
written in <a href="https://ziglang.org/" rel="nofollow">Zig</a> but exports a C-compatible API (which
further makes it compatible with any language out there that can communicate
with C APIs).</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Project Status: 🐲 Unstable, alpha-ish quality.</strong> The feature list is quite
good across multiple platforms, but there are plenty of missing features.
The project hasn't been well tested in real-world environments and there
are lots of low-hanging fruit for performance optimization. I'm not promising
any API compatibility at this point, either. If you want a production ready,
high quality, generalized event loop implementation check out
<a href="https://libuv.org/" rel="nofollow">libuv</a>, libev, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why a new event loop library?</strong> A few reasons. One, I think Zig lacks
a generalized event loop comparable to libuv in features ("generalized"
being a key word here). Two, I wanted to build a library like this around
the design patterns of <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/what_is_io_uring.html" rel="nofollow">io_uring</a>,
even mimicking its style on top of other OS primitives (
<a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/a-friendly-abstraction-over-iouring-and-kqueue/" rel="nofollow">credit to this awesome blog post</a>).
Three, I wanted an event loop library that could build to WebAssembly
(both WASI and freestanding) and that didn't really fit well
into the goals of API style of existing libraries without bringing in
something super heavy like Emscripten. The motivation for this library
primarily though is scratching my own itch!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Cross-platform.</strong> Linux (<code>io_uring</code> and <code>epoll</code>), macOS (<code>kqueue</code>),
WebAssembly + WASI (<code>poll_oneoff</code>, threaded and non-threaded runtimes).
(Windows support is planned and coming soon)</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactor_pattern" rel="nofollow">Proactor API</a>.</strong> Work
is submitted to the libxev event loop and the caller is notified of
work <em>completion</em>, as opposed to work <em>readiness</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Zero runtime allocations.</strong> This helps make runtime performance more
predictable and makes libxev well suited for embedded environments.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Timers, TCP, UDP, Files, Processes.</strong> High-level platform-agnostic APIs for
interacting with timers, TCP/UDP sockets, files, processes, and more. For
platforms that don't support async IO, the file operations are automatically
scheduled to a thread pool.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Generic Thread Pool (Optional).</strong> You can create a generic thread pool,
configure its resource utilization, and use this to perform custom background
tasks. The thread pool is used by some backends to do non-blocking tasks that
don't have reliable non-blocking APIs (such as local file operations with
<code>kqueue</code>). The thread pool can be shared across multiple threads and event
loops to optimize resource utilization.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Low-level and High-Level API.</strong> The high-level API is platform-agnostic
but has some  opinionated behavior and limited flexibility. The high-level
API is recommended but the low-level API is always an available escape hatch.
The low-level API is platform-specific and provides a mechanism for libxev
users to squeeze out maximum performance. The low-level API is <em>just enough
abstraction</em> above the OS interface to make it easier to use without
sacrificing noticable performance.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Tree Shaking (Zig).</strong> This is a feature of Zig, but substantially benefits
libraries such as libxev. Zig will only include function calls and features
that you actually use. If you don't use a particular kind of high-level
watcher (such as UDP sockets), then the functionality related to that
abstraction is not compiled into your final binary at all. This lets libxev
support optional "nice-to-have" functionality that may be considered
"bloat" in some cases, but the end user doesn't have to pay for it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Dependency-free.</strong> libxev has no dependencies other than the built-in
OS APIs at runtime. The C library depends on libc. This makes it very
easy to cross-compile.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Roadmap</h3><a id="user-content-roadmap" aria-label="Permalink: Roadmap" href="#roadmap"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are plenty of missing features that I still want to add:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Pipe high-level API</li>
<li>Signal handlers</li>
<li>Filesystem events</li>
<li>Windows backend</li>
<li>Freestanding WebAssembly support via an external event loop (i.e. the browser)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">And more...</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Performance</h3><a id="user-content-performance" aria-label="Permalink: Performance" href="#performance"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There is plenty of room for performance improvements, and I want to be
fully clear that I haven't done a lot of optimization work. Still,
performance is looking good. I've tried to port many of
<a href="https://github.com/libuv/libuv">libuv benchmarks</a> to use the libxev
API.</p>
<p dir="auto">I won't post specific benchmark results until I have a better
environment to run them in. As a <em>very broad generalization</em>,
you shouldn't notice a slowdown using libxev compared to other
major event loops. This may differ on a feature-by-feature basis, and
if you can show really poor performance in an issue I'm interested
in resolving it!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example</h2><a id="user-content-example" aria-label="Permalink: Example" href="#example"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The example below shows an identical program written in Zig and in C
that uses libxev to run a single 5s timer. This is almost silly how
simple it is but is meant to just convey the overall feel of the library
rather than a practical use case.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Documentation</h2><a id="user-content-documentation" aria-label="Permalink: Documentation" href="#documentation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">🚧 Documentation is a work-in-progress. 🚧</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, documentation is available in three forms: <strong>man pages</strong>,
<strong>examples</strong>, and <strong>code comments.</strong> In the future, I plan on writing detailed
guides and API documentation in website form, but that isn't currently
available.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Man Pages</h3><a id="user-content-man-pages" aria-label="Permalink: Man Pages" href="#man-pages"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The man pages are relatively detailed! <code>xev(7)</code> will
give you a good overview of the entire library. <code>xev-zig(7)</code> and
<code>xev-c(7)</code> will provide overviews of the Zig and C API, respectively.
From there, API-specifc man pages such as <code>xev_loop_init(3)</code> are
available. This is the best documentation currently.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are multiple ways to browse the man pages. The most immediately friendly
is to just browse the raw man page sources in the <code>docs/</code> directory in
your web browser. The man page source is a <em>markdown-like</em> syntax so it
renders <em>okay</em> in your browser via GitHub.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another approach is to run <code>zig build -Dman-pages</code> and the man pages
will be available in <code>zig-out</code>. This requires
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc" rel="nofollow">scdoc</a>
to be installed (this is available in most package managers).
Once you've built the man pages, you can render them by path:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ man zig-out/share/man/man7/xev.7"><pre><code>$ man zig-out/share/man/man7/xev.7
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">And the final approach is to install libxev via your favorite package
manager (if and when available), which should hopefully put your man pages
into your man path, so you can just do <code>man 7 xev</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h3><a id="user-content-examples" aria-label="Permalink: Examples" href="#examples"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are examples available in the <code>examples/</code> folder. The examples are
available in both C and Zig, and you can tell which one is which using
the file extension.</p>
<p dir="auto">To build an example, use the following:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ zig build -Dexample-name=_basic.zig
...
$ zig-out/bin/example-basic
..."><pre><code>$ zig build -Dexample-name=_basic.zig
...
$ zig-out/bin/example-basic
...
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>-Dexample-name</code> value should be the filename including the extension.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Code Comments</h3><a id="user-content-code-comments" aria-label="Permalink: Code Comments" href="#code-comments"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Zig code is well commented. If you're comfortable reading code comments
you can find a lot of insight within them. The source is in the <code>src/</code>
directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Build</h2><a id="user-content-build" aria-label="Permalink: Build" href="#build"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Build requires the installation of the latest <a href="https://ziglang.org/download/" rel="nofollow">Zig nightly</a>.
<strong>libxev has no other build dependencies.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Once installed, <code>zig build install</code> on its own will build the full library and output
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard" rel="nofollow">FHS-compatible</a>
directory in <code>zig-out</code>. You can customize the output directory with the
<code>--prefix</code> flag.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tests</h2><a id="user-content-tests" aria-label="Permalink: Tests" href="#tests"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">libxev has a large and growing test suite. To run the tests for the current
platform:</p>

<p dir="auto">This will run all the tests for all the supported features for the current
host platform. For example, on Linux this will run both the full io_uring
and epoll test suite.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>You can build and run tests for other platforms</strong> by cross-compiling the
test executable, copying it to a target machine and executing it. For example,
the below shows how to cross-compile and build the tests for macOS from Linux:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ zig build -Dtarget=aarch64-macos -Dinstall-tests
...

$ file zig-out/bin/xev-test
zig-out/bin/xev-test: Mach-O 64-bit arm64 executable"><pre>$ zig build -Dtarget=aarch64-macos -Dinstall-tests
...

$ file zig-out/bin/xev-test
zig-out/bin/xev-test: Mach-O 64-bit arm64 executable</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>WASI is a special-case.</strong> You can run tests for WASI if you have
<a href="https://wasmtime.dev/" rel="nofollow">wasmtime</a> installed:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ zig build test -Dtarget=wasm32-wasi -Dwasmtime
..."><pre><code>$ zig build test -Dtarget=wasm32-wasi -Dwasmtime
...
</code></pre></div>

They don't need to be engaged—they are fairly balanced. And they'd love to be challenged if working within the existing system wasn't so difficult. "I have my projects outside of work to be challenged; thank you very much." So, the normal playbook doesn't work. It feels condescending and paternalistic.</p><p><em>(Note: Before continuing, I want to note that skilled pragmatists often have the privilege of being ABLE to be somewhat detached yet still earn a living. Many people do not enjoy the privilege of fading into the background and are subject to much more scrutiny, stress, gaslighting, and doubt.)</em></p><p>Let's explore an example of a prototypical skilled pragmatist to make this real.</p><p>It is very clear to Maria that her team is spinning in circles. She watches with mild amusement as managers struggle in vain to push back on reactive feature requests. She's skilled and makes decent progress with the spaghetti codebase the team inherited, but she knows she could be a lot more productive.</p><p><span>At standups, Maria doesn't waste energy calling out things beyond her (and the team's) immediate control. Yes, software engineering is her passion, but she's not about to burn a lot of social capital by rocking the boat—she sees what happens to&nbsp;</span><em>those&nbsp;</em><span>people. She has some co-workers who have extremely strong careerist tendencies. In some cases, they game the performance management system to the Nth degree to the detriment of customer outcomes. She knows moving up takes a bit longer, but she has also had good luck shifting companies every couple of years to get a raise and promotion. It's almost like new hiring managers sense she has been under-utilized.</span></p><p>Maria is a skilled pragmatist. She is not a pushover or an underperformer. She is a human navigating the weird sociotechnical systems we call "Companies."</p><p>Here's the problem, however. Instead of figuring out how to tap into the incredible potential of the Maria's, companies:</p><ul><li><p>Hear the loud voices in the room, with strong opinions about what is broken. You are missing out on a whole source of information about how to fix the problem.</p></li><li><p>Focus on the obvious "poor performers". This is funny because you might have ~5% of employees who are low performers. Yet have 60-80% Marias.</p></li><li><p>Focus on rewarding 10x heroics and the cutthroat careerists</p></li><li><p>Incorrectly see the issue as an "engagement" problem.</p></li><li><p>Blame front-line managers for not engaging Maria when the issues exist elsewhere. Maria becomes a “management problem” vs. a leadership problem.</p></li><li><p>Diminish Maria's contributions because they are less visible and showy.</p></li><li><p>Promote people who actively poke and prod the system OR who are politically savvy enough to navigate the system—which has the byproduct of perpetuating whatever dysfunctions exist. Why change things when the people in power positions are adept at navigating things?</p></li></ul><p>Companies are doing layoffs when they are sitting on a goldmine of talent, motivation, and people who want to be challenged but aren't being challenged!</p><p>If you want a Part 2 here on how to solve this. Here are some closing thoughts for now.</p><p>I was thinking about what drew me to tech in the first place. Fun! How incredible is it to be paid to be a problem/puzzle solver and build/make things with other similarly curious people that can impact humans? That's incredible. Sometimes I have to pinch myself.</p><p>I've realized that one of my big triggers is incoherence, dissonance, and waste. Many companies are filled with talented people who love to solve problems, yet we're only scratching the surface regarding harnessing their potential.</p><p>And we make it SO HARD on ourselves. It is like we sabotage ourselves. I'm not sure why—maybe humans will be human, maybe it is power and money, maybe it is the natural entropy of companies and products—but many of the problems we face at work are very addressable. Yet, for whatever reason, it has to be difficult.</p><p>Or does it?</p><p>And with that…consider the untapped Maria potential in your company.</p><p><span>Update: I’ve written </span><a href="https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-272-the-biggest-opportunity-part" rel="">Part 2</a><span>.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-node="14pvo7lhbrk6">
		
<p>This week we announced the retirement of our hydraulic Atlas and unveiled what comes next—a fully electric Atlas robot designed for real-world applications. The next generation of the Atlas program builds on decades of research and furthers our commitment to delivering the most capable, useful mobile robots solving the toughest challenges in industry today: with Spot, with Stretch, and now with Atlas.</p>



<p>A decade ago, we were one of the only companies putting real R&amp;D effort into <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/atlas">humanoid robots</a>. Now the landscape in the robotics industry is very different. Our customers have seen success with Spot and Stretch and they are eager to tackle the next challenge with Atlas. Given our track record of successful commercialization, we are confident in our plan to not just create an impressive R&amp;D project, but to deliver a valuable solution. </p>



<p>This journey will start with Hyundai—in addition to investing in us, the Hyundai team is building the next generation of automotive manufacturing capabilities, and it will serve as a perfect testing ground for new Atlas applications. In the months and years ahead, we’re excited to show what the world’s most dynamic humanoid robot can really do—in the lab, in the factory, and in our lives.</p>











<h2>The Journey with Atlas</h2>



<p>Having a meaningful impact outside of the lab requires collaboration beyond our walls. Following the commercial deployment of both Spot and Stretch, we know how to deliver real value for customers. Similar to our Stretch rollout, we will be partnering with a small group of innovative customers, beginning with Hyundai, to test and iterate Atlas applications over the next few years. This is the first look at a real product, but it certainly isn’t the last.</p>



<p>The electric version of Atlas will be stronger, with a broader range of motion than any of our previous generations. For example, our last generation hydraulic Atlas (HD Atlas) could already lift and maneuver a wide variety of heavy, irregular objects; we are continuing to build on those existing capabilities and are exploring several new gripper variations to meet a diverse set of expected manipulation needs in customer environments.</p>











<p>Moreover, a capable robot is only one of the pieces required for a successful commercial solution. Scaled <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/webinars/how-to-deploy-mobile-robots-for-industrial-inspection/">autonomous mobile robot deployments</a> are part of the broader digital transformation ecosystem, requiring IT infrastructure, employee buy-in, connectivity, workflows, safety standards, and operational processes for the robots and the data they generate and rely on. With over 1,500 deployments, Spot is already teaching hundreds of companies how to work alongside autonomous mobile robots. We believe that humanoids will be most effective if they are deployed with in-depth models of a facility and lots and lots of data about how it operates. You can start creating these types of digital twins with Spot today, using Spot, Stretch, and Boston Dynamics to facilitate this operational sea change for your organization.</p>



<p>And we are not just delivering industry-leading hardware. Some of our most exciting progress over the past couple of years has been in software. In addition to our decades of expertise in simulation and model predictive control, we have equipped our robots with new AI and machine learning tools, like <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/blog/starting-on-the-right-foot-with-reinforcement-learning/">reinforcement learning</a> and computer vision to ensure they can operate and adapt efficiently to complex real-world situations.</p>



<p>We also recently launched our <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/products/orbit/">Orbit™</a> software, which provides a centralized platform to manage your entire robot fleet, site maps, and digital transformation data. Today it’s available for Spot, but Stretch and Atlas will also be integrated into this enterprise solution. With a robust team of ML experts shaping our products, we are prepared to bring impactful AI to market immediately—we’ve already started with Spot, and it will get even better and faster with Atlas.</p>



<h2>The Role of a Humanoid Robot</h2>



<p>This latest iteration of the Atlas robot builds on a long <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/legacy">history of innovation</a> and R&amp;D pushing the limits of whole-body mobility and bimanual manipulation. From PETMAN testing protective clothing to the recently retired HD Atlas performing parkour, we have spent over a decade moving the state of the art forward with humanoid robotics.</p>



<p>Traditionally, we have focused on legged robots because we wanted to build robots that could balance and move dynamically—robots that could navigate unstructured, unknown, or antagonistic terrain with ease. The humanoid form factor is a useful design for robots working in a world designed for people.</p>



<p>However, that form factor doesn’t limit our vision of how a bipedal robot can move, what tools it needs to succeed, and how it can help people accomplish more. We designed the electric version of Atlas to be stronger, more dexterous, and more agile. Atlas may resemble a human form factor, but we are equipping the robot to move in the most efficient way possible to complete a task, rather than being constrained by a human range of motion. Atlas will move in ways that exceed human capabilities. Combining decades of practical experience with first principles thinking, we are confident in our ability to deliver a robot uniquely capable of tackling dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks in real applications.</p>



<p>Commercialization takes great engineering, but it also takes patience, imagination, and collaboration. Boston Dynamics has proven that we can deliver the full package with both industry-leading robotics and a complete ecosystem of software, services, and support to make robotics useful in the real world.</p>

<p>We discuss a recent (best-paper award) publication at ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA24) which gives a near-linear running time deterministic algorithm for the fundamental optimization problem of finding a minimum cut in weighted graphs.</p>

<div>
        <p data-block-key="ef8si">A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">graph</a> is a ubiquitous data structure used in computer science that consists of nodes (or vertices) and edges between pairs of nodes to capture objects and their relations. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_cut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimum cut problem</a> (often referred to as “min-cut”) is a basic structural question about the connectivity of a graph that asks: what is the least expensive way to disconnect a network? More formally, given an input graph where edges have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(graph_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no orientation</a> (i.e., the graph is <i>undirected</i>) and are associated with positive weights quantifying the importance of the edges (e.g., capacity of a road, or strength of a relationship, level of similarity between the endpoints, etc.), a cut is a partition of the nodes into two sides. The size of a cut is the total weight of edges connecting nodes on different sides of the cut, and the min-cut problem is to find a cut of the minimum size.</p><p data-block-key="8gv1h">Solving it efficiently has been one of the most fundamental problems in algorithmic graph theory. Moreover, min-cut has diverse applications in practice such as image restoration, stereo and segmentation in computer vision, and network resilience analysis (such as for roads or power grids). It is also generally very useful when the underlying graph data is too large and needs to be partitioned into smaller components to be processed in a divide-and-conquer manner.</p><p data-block-key="20u0d">In the theory of algorithm design, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_computational_complexity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asymptotic complexity</a> for any problem that requires reading the entire input (which is the case for min-cut) is at least linear in the size of the input (since that is the time needed to read the input). A <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~gurevich/Opera/82.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly-linear time</a> algorithm essentially achieves this lower-bound, and thus is canonically viewed as the optimal result one can achieve. For the min-cut problem, existing nearly-linear time algorithms are either randomized (which may output an incorrect answer with some probability) or only work for the special case when the graph is <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SimpleGraph.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simple</a> (which cannot model many real-world applications), so its optimal complexity remains an open problem.</p><p data-block-key="3mnj3">In “<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611977912.111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deterministic Near-Linear Time Minimum Cut in Weighted Graphs</a>”, which co-won the best paper award at the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (<a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SODA2024</a>), we design the first nearly-linear algorithm for the min-cut problem that is deterministic (i.e., always finds the correct answer) and that also works for general graphs, thus settling the optimal complexity for the min-cut problem.</p>

<div>
        <h2 data-block-key="ef8si">Technical insights</h2><p data-block-key="er3ve">Our result is the culmination of a long line of research, and algorithmic advances on this problem (including ours) are usually motivated by structural discoveries of graph connectivity. In particular, a seminal result by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/237814.237829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Karger in 1996</a> gave a nearly-linear time randomized algorithm that finds a min-cut with high probability, and a critical insight from that work was the existence of a much smaller graph that largely preserves all cuts’ size. This is useful since one can afford to run a slower algorithm with the smaller graph as input, and the slower running time (in terms of the size of the smaller graph) can still be nearly-linear in the size of the original (larger) graph. Indeed, many of the structural discoveries on the min-cut problem are along this direction, and the high-level idea of reducing problem size while preserving structures of interest has been widely impactful in algorithm design.</p>

        <h2><span>Cut-preserving graph sparsification</span></h2>
<p><span>We start by discussing the structural insight used by Karger in more detail. Starting with a graph </span><span><em><span>G</span></em></span><span> with</span><em><span> <span>n</span></span></em><span> nodes, the cut-preserving sparsification by </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0207078.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Benzur and Karger</span></a><span> established the existence of a sparse </span><em><span>weighted</span></em><span> graph </span><em><span><span>G</span>’</span></em><span> on the same set of nodes with a smaller number of edges such that with high probability, every cut </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span>’s size in </span><em><span><span>G</span>’</span></em><span> is roughly the same as its size in </span><span><em><span>G</span></em></span><span>. This idea is illustrated below, where the original graph consists of two complete graphs connected by a single edge (i.e., the dumbbell graph), and the sparsified graph has fewer, but larger weight, edges, while all the cut sizes are approximately preserved. </span></p>

<div>
        
<p><span>To algorithmically construct such a sparser graph, Benzur and Karger used the approach of sampling edges independently, where each edge in </span><span><em><span>G</span></em></span><span> is included in </span><em><span><span>G</span>’</span></em><span> with some probability, and its weight in </span><em><span><span>G</span>’</span></em><span> is scaled up by the reciprocal of the sampling probability (e.g., an edge of original weight </span><span>1 </span><span>in </span><span><em><span>G</span></em></span><span> would have a weight of </span><span>10 </span><span>in </span><em><span><span>G</span>’</span></em><span> if it’s included with a </span><span>10%</span><span> chance). It turns out that with high probability, this remarkably simple (and nearly-linear time) method can successfully construct a cut-preserving graph sparsification.</span></p>
<p><span>The cut-preserving graph sparsification, along with several other creative algorithmic ideas, yielded Karger's breakthrough result. However, Karger’s algorithm is a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Monte Carlo algorithm</span></a><span>, i.e., the output may be incorrect with (small) probability, and there is no known way to tell if the output is correct other than comparing it with an actual known min-cut. Since then, researchers have been on the quest to resolve the open question of a nearly-linear time deterministic algorithm. In particular, the construction of the cut-preserving graph sparsification is the only component in Karger’s algorithm that is randomized, and an apparent recipe is to find a deterministic construction (a.k.a. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm#Derandomization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>derandomization</span></a><span>) of the sparsification in nearly-linear time.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2015, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.5123.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Kawarabayashi and Thorup</span></a><span> achieved a major milestone with such a deterministic nearly-linear time algorithm for simple graphs, i.e., graphs that have at most one edge between every pair of nodes and all edge weights equal to </span><span>1</span><span>. The key observation in that work is a connection between min-cut and another important graph structure known as a low-conductance cut (explained below). This connection also turned out to be critical in later efforts to derandomize Karger’s algorithm on graphs of general edge weights, which eventually culminated in our result.</span></p>

<div>
        <h2><span>Alignment of min-cut and low-conductance cut</span></h2>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductance_(graph)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>conductance</span></a><span> of a cut </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> is defined as the ratio of the cut size of </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> over the volume of </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> (assuming </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> is the smaller volume side of the cut and is non-empty), where the volume of </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> is the sum of the degree of the nodes in </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span>. A cut </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> of low conductance intuitively captures a bottleneck in a network, as there is only a small number of edges (relative to its volume) connecting </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> to the rest of the graph. The conductance of a graph is defined as the min conductance of any cut in the graph, and a graph of large conductance (a.k.a. an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>expander graph</span></a><span>) is considered well-connected as there is no bottleneck inside. </span></p>

        <p data-block-key="02c3n">The cut represented by the red dotted line has size 2, and the smaller side (the bottom) has volume 24, so its conductance is 1/12, which is also the graph’s conductance.</p>

<div>
        <p><span>Kawayabarashi and Thorup made the observation that any non-trivial (i.e., both sides have at least two nodes) min-cut must have low conductance in a simple graph where the min node degree is large. Following this observation, if one can partition the graph into well-connected clusters, the partitioning must be consistent with every non-trivial min-cut in the sense that each cluster must lie entirely on one side of every such cut. One can then contract each cluster into a single node, and work on the smaller graph where all non-trivial min-cuts of the original graph are intact.</span></p>
<p><span>However, for weighted graphs the same observation no longer holds, and the same partitioning used in the simple graph case may not be exactly consistent with non-trivial min-cuts. Nonetheless, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05513" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Li 2021</span></a><span> observed that such a partitioning is still approximately consistent with non-trivial min-cuts as illustrated in the figure below. In particular, for a non-trivial min-cut </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span>, there exists a cut </span><em><span><span>S</span>’</span></em><span> that is not too different from </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> such that </span><em><span><span>S</span>’</span></em><span> is consistent with the clusters. Li further observed that this property of the partitioning can be exploited to efficiently derandomize the construction of cut-preserving graph sparsification. </span></p>

<section>
    
    <p><span>In our new result, we devise an algorithm to construct such a partitioning tailored to our use case of finding min-cut. Compared to the more generic off-the-shelf method used by Li in the previous work, our tailored construction is much more precise, so that the original min-cut </span><span><em><span>S</span></em></span><span> and its corresponding cluster-consistent cut </span><em><span><span>S</span>’</span></em><span> (in the figure above) are guaranteed to have more similar cut sizes. Moreover, our algorithm is faster than off-the-shelf methods, which comes by improving previous clustering techniques developed solely for simple graphs (by </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01254" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Henzinger, Rao and Wang</span></a><span> in 2017) to work more broadly on weighted graphs. The stronger precision and running time guarantees achieved by the new construction ultimately lead to our nearly-linear time deterministic algorithm for the min-cut problem.</span></p>

<p>The LXQt team announces the release of LXQt 2.0.0, the Lightweight Qt Desktop Environment.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
  <li>LXQt 2.0.0 is based on Qt ≥ 6.6. For supporting styling and LXQt File Dialog with Qt5-based apps, <code>libqtxdg-3.12.0</code>, <code>lxqt-qtplugin-1.4.1</code> and <code>libfm-qt-1.4.0</code> can be installed alongside their Qt6-based versions in LXQt 2.0.0.</li>
  <li>PCManFM-Qt’s desktop module, LXQt Runner and LXQt Desktop Notifications are completely ready to be used under Wayland compositors which support the “layer shell protocol”, like LabWC, Wayfire, kwin_wayland, Hyprland, Sway,…</li>
  <li>Wayland will be the main target for LXQt 2.1.0, as Qt6 was for LXQt 2.0.0. The components which are <em>not</em> ready for Wayland yet include ScreenGrab, LXQt Global Shortcuts, LXQt Panel’s task-bar and keyboard indicator (but LXQt Panel can be used under Wayland without those plugins), some input settings, and settings of monitor, power button, and screen locker. However, most Wayland compositors have tools that can be used instead of them, such that an LXQt-Wayland session is already possible for advanced users.</li>
  <li>LXQt Panel has a new default application menu called Fancy Menu, featuring “Favorites”, “All Applications”, and an improved search.</li>
  <li>QTerminal is the only app whose Qt6 port will be released separately – complications were encountered due to the removal of legacy encodings from Qt6. Until then, its Qt5 version 1.4.0 could be used.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE for Distros:</strong> For having Qt5 styling and Qt5 file dialog with LXQt 2.0.0, the installable packages of Qt5-based <code>lxqt-build-tools</code>, <code>libqtxdg</code>, <code>lxqt-qtplugin</code> and <code>libfm-qt</code> may need to be renamed, such that they can be installed in parallel with their Qt6 versions. Also, the point release of the Qt5-based <code>lxqt-qtplugin-1.4.1</code> is needed for a correct Qt5 font setting (see its release note).</p>

<h3 id="libfm-qt--pcmanfm-qt">LibFM-Qt / PCManFM-Qt</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The desktop module is completely ready for Wayland, thanks to <code>layer-shell-qt6</code>. Now, PCManFM-Qt can give you a real desktop not only with desktop-agnostic X11 windows managers, but also with Wayland compositors which implement “layer shell protocol”, like those based on <code>wlroots</code> or KWin. Also, see <a href="https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt/wiki#using-desktop-under-wayland">Using Desktop under Wayland</a> in Wiki.</li>
  <li>The MIME types of LXQt Archiver and Arqiver are updated in LibFM-Qt.</li>
  <li>Some menu icons are added.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lxqt-panel">LXQt Panel</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fancy Menu is added as the new default application menu. (The old menu is kept, but it is not the default menu anymore.)</li>
  <li>Wayland support is added for positioning the panel by using layer shell.</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous fixes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lxqt-runner">LXQt Runner</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Full Wayland support is added.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lxqt-desktop-notifications">LXQt Desktop Notifications</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Full Wayland support is added.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="release-notes">Release Notes</h2>

<p>Please see the release page of each LXQt component for its release note.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“A contract is only as good as the people who sign it,” was a saying often quoted by an elderly attorney I worked with for the first fifteen years of my practice and I always nodded in his general direction when he said that and smiled as if agreeing. I liked and respected him, he had won more cases than there were months in my life at the time and he had lived in a legal and business world in which the entire community knew one another and knew who to trust.</p>

<p>That world is long gone, with our population quadrupled in terms of business people and multiplied by ten in terms of attorneys practicing. The odds are good you now deal with strangers, know little about them, and simply cannot trust that the influence of the community will direct their actions.</p>

<p>But even in his smaller, kinder, world, I wondered how accurate his quotation was. Why bother with a contract, then, I always thought.&nbsp; Simply rely on people to do “the right thing.”&nbsp; Since that lawyer had written thousands of contracts, his actions belied his words.</p>

<p>When people are angels perhaps contracts will not be needed. That time is not now and any business which does not have its battery of contracts is not long for this world.</p>

<p>But it’s not just the contract that is useful for business-the very process of getting a contract can teach you a great deal about the person who you are thinking about joining in a business venture. Indeed, if done correctly, before you sign on the dotted line, the negotiation itself will tell you what is likely to happen.</p>

<p>As I saw with a doctor who now lives in Tuscany, in part because he and I learned all we needed to know about a man waving a million dollars in his face and begging him to take it.</p>

<p>The doctor turned him down cold and it was “the best deal he never made,” as he told me a year later.</p>

<p>Doctors are notoriously difficult for lawyers to work with…at least according to lawyers…who find that the doctor’s &nbsp;scientific background gives them little patience for the maneuvers and subtleties that mark the usual business negotiation. To many doctors, the answer to a legal or business question should be as straight forward as a simple diagnosis.</p>

<p>And as more and more doctors are forced to become business people, they confront more and more “grey” areas of business and employment law which are imposed upon their consciousness whether they like it or not. That doctor called it being forced to slide into the “…mire of complex chemical bonding of inarticulate and unintelligible legal jargon.” &nbsp;I didn’t argue when he said that because he was a genius and I had learned not to argue with a genius.</p>

<p>He was a research scientist who had invented a device that measured some microscopic part of one’s intestine that somehow was going to make him and his partners rich. At least that’s what he thought and since one of his partners knew a big time venture capitalist (“VC”) with a lot of successes to his name, that might just happen since he would have the capital to bring it to market.</p>

<p>But the problem was we had to negotiate how to get that VC into the company without giving the company away and the VC had a reputation for coming in with lots of money…then suing everyone in sight long enough that, broke and distraught, they threw the asset in his direction and gave up control of the product. One of my law partners called him the “’poison pill” of VCs since once you took him in, it was only a matter of time until your control of your company died. &nbsp;We needed his money and my task was to find a way to have the money but not the turmoil.</p>

<p>“You think he is trying to trap us like he did the others?” asked my doctor client.</p>

<p>“Don’t know. VCs get a bad rap no matter what they do. Inventors like you always blame them for coming in and trying to protect their investment by putting controls into the company. VCs always blame the inventors for thinking that because they can invent something, they can run a business. It’s hard to know what the guy is really all about.”</p>

<p>He was annoyed that I had hinted he was bad at business.&nbsp; He paused, then snapped, “So…test him.”</p>

<p>He had that exasperated look on his face he got whenever he was forced to say something that he considered self evident to us mere mortals. That always annoyed me and since we were old friends I let him see that.</p>

<p>“Right. &nbsp;Good idea. Written or oral?”</p>

<p>“Anything can be tested. That’s the nature of reality.&nbsp; There must be a relatively objective method available.”</p>

<p>Of course he had a point but I was curious to see what he thought would work.&nbsp; “Lie detector test? Perhaps we can torture him to get him to admit his motivations? I’m sure…”</p>

<p>“Not scientific,” broke in the doctor, not smiling. “Polygraphs seldom are reliable and torture is useless to find the truth. The subject merely tells you whatever you want to hear to stop the torture. No, use a scientific test for good faith. After. what, a thousand, five thousand contracts, you must have one. Use it.”</p>

<p>I stared at him and he stared right back. &nbsp;A long moment of silence. “You still don’t get that law is not medical research. There are no sure fire tests…No patented devices for honesty and integrity. Perhaps that could be your next invention…”</p>

<p>He pressed. “I do not believe that you have not developed a series of questions or methods by which to accurately gauge the good faith of a prospective investor and I suspect you are teasing me because you are annoyed with me.”&nbsp; He would talk like that, you see.&nbsp; Then he grinned.&nbsp; “I am told you are brilliant at this. This should give you an excellent opportunity to demonstrate it.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;Anyone calling me brilliant can mollify me so I explained, “There are some methods, some pretty good ones. &nbsp;But they are not objective, I suppose. We don’t put it into a test matrix, doctor. Besides, we have little bargaining position you tell me. We need his money. You only have one source now available. What do you do if he fails my test?”</p>

<p>He stood up, all five feet six of him, one finger in the air. “You find out if he is interested in working in good faith as a team or not. If the latter, the money I lose in rejecting him is trivial compared to the trouble I would have in accepting him. There are other sources of money out there…” He paused for effect “…but only one product that can do what this does.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course he was wrong in that, several other competing products came out a few years later….but he was dead right in that there are some pretty good tests that anyone can use to determine if a potential business partner is more interested in seizing power than sharing profits, as can be seen by what happened in this negotiation.</p>

<p>The VC never used a lawyer for the initial negotiations, only when it was time to close the deal and after ten minutes in the room, I could see why. This was during &nbsp;the High Tech boom times when wearing a suit and tie was considered an antique fashion and most of the young brilliants wore “Banana Republican” Khakis and pastel shirts, no tie, loafers. That is what I expected but he appeared in a conservative three piece business suit, horn rimmed glasses and reminded me of Clark Kent on a mission. Soft spoken, almost shy but clearly with an agenda.</p>

<p>And he knew his stuff. He had a scientific background, a sharp mind, and had done his homework. He had signed all the confidentiality agreements I had insisted upon without demur, without change, even agreeing to clauses prohibiting him from entering the particular medical field we were servicing if our deal did not go through. That surprised me. VCs don’t like to be restricted in such a broad fashion. But as I watched him work the doctor, I realized why. He had no intention of not buying the product and was convinced we would sell it to him since he was the only game in town.</p>

<p>The doctor liked him. They were both tech nerds, both loved the elegant simplicity of the device, both were happy it was going to make a huge difference in medicine, and neither was only in it for the money. I might as well have been in another building as they poured over the specs and discussed the European market. I let it go on for an hour then threw my monkey wrench into the love fest with my first question.</p>

<p>“How much will you put in for how much interest, Mr. Oswald (not his real name)?”</p>

<p>They both looked at me as if I had uttered a profanity. &nbsp;I smiled.&nbsp; “Sorry, but that’s what my job is, you know. Money and power. Unpleasant things but necessary to consider.”</p>

<p>Oswald paused a moment, then opened another file. “Our firm has standard criteria for determining how much to invest and when.”</p>

<p>“And those criteria indicate that you will put in a little money now, and only be obligated to invest more if certain milestones are met in a timely manner and if they are not met, you gain control of the company?”</p>

<p>He looked at me a moment, then smiled. “Of course. We do not write blank checks. But we are reasonable in those criteria. I can see your client owns a very valuable product and has done a great deal by taking it this far on the business plan. I am very impressed.” He looked at the doctor to show him he was impressed. The doctor looked back to show him he liked that.</p>

<p>“We are delighted you agree that we are well along in our plan,” I said, fiddling with my own papers, “and, of course, we need to know specific amounts and specific criteria in some detail. We are not interested in losing control because we are a few weeks late in the implementation of the business plan.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. You will find we are reasonable and I am talking about a million dollars upfront money right now…within two days of our execution of the documents…with an additional two million upon prototype being finished within six months and a final three million upon approval by governmental authorities. &nbsp;For twenty percent. That is quite reasonable, I believe. &nbsp;One seat on the board unless criteria are not met. Three seats on the board if criteria is not met after ninety additional days. And you will find our timelines are more conservative than yours. And the doctor remains CEO.”</p>

<p>I nodded but thought, “Until we blow a deadline. Which we will, business being what it is…and you get the control of the company ninety one days after that happens.” But what I said was, “That seems something we can use to start our discussions, certainly.”&nbsp; He nodded, realizing that the Dance of Negotiations had begun and waited for our counter. Instead, I used my first test.</p>

<p>“It is unusual to begin at the enforcement of contracts end of our discussions, I realize, but it is important for us to know if the document we eventually create is practical from our point of view.”&nbsp; He was a bit surprised and raised his eyebrows. I went on. “The best contract in the world is of no use to us if the expense to enforce it is beyond our capacity. And dangerous to us if our adversary has funds to enforce it and we do not.&nbsp; We like efficient and inexpensive methods for enforcement.”</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair, considering. “You are speaking of arbitration, perhaps? Avoiding formal court and discovery and all that for a private judge?”</p>

<p>“Smart boy, “ I thought, and wondered how he would turn it down. I nodded.</p>

<p>He shook his head sadly. “We once thought that would be an excellent alternative to the law courts. It certainly had its advantages. Without depositions, without the need for long court law and motion matters, we did save tens of thousands.” He looked at the doctor, very sincere. “But we discovered why discovery and those formal court procedures exist. They exist for a reason, you know. That’s how you discover the truth.”</p>

<p>The doctor had immediately understood that he was witnessing the “test” he had asked for and, like any good scientist, did not interfere with the test in progress. He merely looked back, interested but noncommittal. Oswald saw that and turned back to me.</p>

<p>“We like to know what the other side is going to present and not be surprised at the hearing.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I could agree with you…but that is a moot point. We can always agree in our arbitration agreement to allow depositions or other forms of discovery. Limit them to save expense, but allow critical discovery. So that’s no real problem, is it?”</p>

<p>He tried another approach. “No appeal. And the arbitrator is not even bound to follow the law. Is that not true?”</p>

<p>“Somewhat true. The Courts are lenient in overturning their decisions. Give the arbitrators great latitude.”</p>

<p>“Yes. &nbsp;Such laxity that in our case, despite the appellate court knowing that the arbitrator was wrong on the law, he still upheld the award. We were outraged.”</p>

<p>I bet you were, I thought. “That seems most unfortunate. But I have been in hundreds of arbitrations and that has never happened. Most arbitrators do their best to follow the law and apply it. I know of no exceptions. You must have been very unlucky.”</p>

<p>He said nothing, just watched me do my stuff.</p>

<p>I went on. “It’s simple, really, &nbsp;A small contract case will take two to three years and cost at least a hundred thousand dollars to try and there can be two more years of appeal. That same matter in arbitration would cost half as much and take six months. The odds of a bad arbitrator are really not much worse than the odds of a bad judge or jury, are they?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, but we get full appeal rights in court. Almost none in arbitration. We just won’t go along with taking that chance again. That is a deal killer.” He watched me to see what I would do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I paused and did nothing waiting to see if he was firm. He said nothing, I still said nothing and the doctor looked at me to see if this test was enough to kill the deal.</p>

<p>It was not. Oswald had a good point and I knew plenty of very good attorneys and business people who hated arbitration, figuring that arbitrators, largely unafraid of the appellate courts, could be tyrants and dangerous and who wanted unlimited discovery so they would not be surprised by evidence at the arbitration.</p>

<p>But one could always put discovery into the arbitration clause if that was important and most arbitrators, including myself, were pretty good at following the law. Arbitration is not perfect. Neither are the courts. But we could afford arbitration and it was a real question if we could afford a real fight against such a well funded opponent if push came to shove. A contract without power to enforce it…is not worth the paper it is written on. I smiled as I thought that and the VC wondered what was going through my head.</p>

<p>What was going through my head was the real test I was planning to use now. And this test was the important one, the “acid test” and I went to it immediately.&nbsp; “Well, if we cannot use relatively inexpensive methods of enforcement, we can still avoid some of the problem by simply providing that the winning party in any dispute gets attorney fees from the losing party. Simple as that. It stops fights before they begin since both sides only go to court if they are convinced they will win.&nbsp; No insincere fights since if you lose you pay for your opponent’s attorney fees as well.”</p>

<p>And was the great equalizer as well.&nbsp; To win a fight and get a million dollars but spend two million to get it means you lost even if you won. A big budget opponent knows that and can destroy your case by simply forcing you to spend money. But if the winning side can get attorney fees from the other side…well, the cost benefit ratio then allows even the party with less money to take on a giant…if they are convinced they will win.</p>

<p>He tapped his fingers, face blank. I went on. “That’s the law in Germany and in quite a few European nations, you know. That’s one reason they have so little litigation. No nuisance suits. Here, as I am sure you know, in most cases you don’t get awarded attorneys fees if you win unless &nbsp;you put it in the contract. We almost always do that in our contracts.”</p>

<p>He sighed, glanced at the doctor, then answered, eyes on his file. “Well, that has not been our experience at all. Indeed, not. Indeed, attorney’s fees being awarded to the winning party encourages litigation in our experience.”</p>

<p>I leaned back in the chair. “Really? We seem to have a very different history. What would be the rationale for people starting nuisance actions if they knew they would not only pay their attorney but yours as well? One would expect that to be…a disincentive, no?”&nbsp; I wondered what nonsense he would develop.</p>

<p>“One would think so, but people are irrational. They think it will give them more when they win.”</p>

<p>“As it would. And if both sides think they will win, that is a fight that should go forward and the one that is right will be made whole. That seems only right to us.”</p>

<p>Another silence. In reality, we both knew what the real issue was. If he had a lot of money and our client did not, an attorneys fees clause such as we proposed would allow us to fight him if he started a suit just to force us to capitulate because the fees were so high. Any party really intending to work in good faith should have no hesitation in such an obviously useful clause-a clause that truly makes the wronged party whole if there is litigation.</p>

<p>“Anything that makes it easier to go to court hurts business relationships, “ he said to the doctor, “and this clause encourages people to take their chance in court rather than work out their differences.”</p>

<p>The doctor looked at me, saw my expression, and turned back to the VC. “Utter nonsense, Mr. Oswald, and I am upset that you think such weak arguments would sway me. Of course we must have an attorney fee shifting clause or I could never approach your litigation budget and you could use your in house staff of attack dogs to force me to accept any position you take.”</p>

<p>“Attack dogs? “ I asked, a little upset.</p>

<p>“Attack dogs?” Oswald said, equally upset.</p>

<p>“Present company excepted, of course,” went on the doctor, not even looking at me. “Mr. Oswald, I am not a nincompoop. I am aware that if you have a hand gun with bullets and I have a hand gun without bullets, that all your expressions of good will and interest in my project mean little for if we have a falling out, you will win. I see this clause as loading my gun…which neither will hopefully ever use. Please do not insult me by pretending otherwise.”</p>

<p>The doctor was outwardly calm but I could see he was inwardly furious. He felt he was being played for a fool, had been set up by the interest in his project shown by Oswald who was simply pulling a con job on him.&nbsp; I was not upset…this is all part of the game and any VC who did not bargain in this manner was not much of a VC. The doctor was new to this and still emotionally involved.</p>

<p>Oswald also saw the dynamics and tried to save the day. “Doctor we have a difference of opinion. This is not an insult, merely what allows fruitful negotiations.”</p>

<p>“Again, &nbsp;nonsense. If you treat me as a man of above average intelligence, you would have honestly stated that you, with more funds, wish to be able to bludgeon me into submission if we have a legal fight, knowing that I will never get back the fees I spend for my own legal counsel and that my only hope is to meet all criteria religiously. That is your actual position, is it not?”</p>

<p>Oswald was getting angry and I was seeing this negotiation collapse and was looking for a way to break into their argument. Oswald leaned forward. “Doctor, you invented a fine device. You know I like it. It is not proof of business acumen or negotiation skill.”</p>

<p>“That is certainly true, “I interjected, and gave the doctor a look telling him to shut up before Oswald walked.</p>

<p>The doctor leaned back in his chair, seeing that I wanted him to calm down, but before I could say something, looked at me and simply asked, “That is your test, correct?”</p>

<p>Silence in the room. Oswald, looking confused, was staring at me.</p>

<p>“Well…yes.”</p>

<p>“Then this is a waste of time since he has failed it. Let us end this now.”</p>

<p>Oswald could not believe it. &nbsp;He held up his file. “I have a million dollars in an account ready to be deposited into your company the moment we agree. Our terms are certainly within the range of your thinking are they not?</p>

<p>The doctor was already packing his briefcase. “Yes, they are. Not where we want them, but close enough.” Then he looked hard at Oswald. “But you are not, Mr. Oswald. In two ways. Counsel had one test to see if you wished power rather than cooperation and you failed that. But I had my own test. Would you equivocate why? I perhaps could work with a man of power interested in power if he was honest with me and we set the rules up clearly. But a man of power who does not tell me his true motivations? That is too much.”</p>

<p>And he left the room.</p>

<p>Oswald shook his head at me, slowly. “Your client is being very foolish, you know. I see it all the time. These scientists…”</p>

<p>Was he? Well, Oswald crushed the next two inventors he worked with…tossing them some money after he had pushed them out the door of their own companies. The doctor…well, he’s in Tuscany, though it took him an extra two years to raise the money. Two years in which his competitors almost beat him out.</p>

<p>And during that time I often asked him if he had second thoughts. He did not. “I may fail, but I will fail because my product or my business thinking is not good enough. I will not fail because my own backer stabs me in the back. I have no regrets.”</p>

<p>Well, he’s in Tuscany. I’m still here.</p>

<p>Doing my acid tests…</p>

I'm working in South Africa currently and I showed the image to some of our fossil preparation specialists today. Everybody agreed it is pretty cool! </p><p>The Reddit user who posted the story (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kidipadeli75/?ref=johnhawks.net">Kidipadeli75</a>) has followed up with some updates over the course of the day. The travertine was sourced in Turkey, and a close search of some of the other installed panels revealed some other interesting possible fossils, although none are as strikingly identifiable as the mandible. A number of professionals have reached out to offer assistance and I have no doubt that they will be able to learn a lot about the ancient person whose jaw ended up in this rock. </p><p>This naturally raises a broader question: How many other people have installed travertine with hominin fossils inside? </p><p>Travertine is a limestone that forms near natural springs. Spring water that emerges from lime-rich bedrock often carries a high concentration of dissolved calcium carbonate. When the water evaporates or cools—especially near hot springs—this calcium carbonate precipitates as rock and may form very large deposits around the spring. Travertine has an interesting internal texture when polished, and often has color bands and inclusions of calcite crystals, which make it an appealing choice for decorative flooring or wall covering. </p><p>Travertine also commonly includes fossils. Many are fossil inclusions of algae, plants, and small animals—especially molluscs and crustaceans—that live within the spring water. Much larger animals may be found and humans are no exceptions: Several well-known hominin fossil discoveries are from travertine deposits. Most of these discoveries have happened because of quarrying of the travertine deposits for use in construction. </p><p>For example, the Steinrinne site is on a terrace of the Wipper River near Bilzingsleben, Germany. The site was quarried from the Middle Ages onward into the twentieth century. Naturalists took notice of the fossils there in the nineteenth century, and straight-tusked elephants, woolly rhinos, and macaques all occur in great numbers, dating to an interglacial period sometime between 470,000 and 280,000 years ago. Many of the archaeological discoveries at the site were made by Dietrich Mania starting in 1969. Excavations since then have identified stone tools and many animal bones with cutmarks from ancient humans who butchered them—even stone handaxes made from elephant bone. </p><figure><img src="https://johnhawks.net/content/images/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1756" height="1042" srcset="https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 600w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 1000w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 1600w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 1756w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Bilzingsleben cranial reconstructions by Vlček. Photo from Landesmuseum fur Vorgeschichte Halle (Saale), Germany</span></figcaption></figure><p>Parts of at least two hominin skulls and a mandible were uncovered in the travertine during Mania's excavations. The remains were first studied by Emanuel Vlček, who created reconstructions of the two skulls. They have many similarities with <em>Homo erectus</em>, as Vlček emphasized, including the thick cranial bone, thick and pronounced browridges, and highly angled occipital bone at the back of the skull. Today's scientists, while recognizing these aspects, more often consider the skulls as representatives of an early Neandertal or related population, which sometimes is known as <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em>. </p><p>Another fossil human was discovered in an even more dramatic way. In 2002, Mehmet Cihat Alcicek was examining fossils recovered from travertine quarries of the Denizli Basin of southwestern Turkey when he identified a cross-section of a hominin cranium. The upper and lower surfaces where the fossil was cut are well preserved, suggesting that more of the skull had likely been present but no more was found. Dating of the travertine by Anne-Marie Lebatard and collaborators in 2014 suggests that the individual lived sometime between 1.6 million and 1.2 million years ago. The quarry that produced the fossil is near the village of Kocabaş, and that is the name by which the fossil has been designated. </p><blockquote>“Given the nature of its discovery in a factory workshop, the hominin was unfortunately reduced to a standard rough-cut tile thickness of about 35 mm…” —John Kappelman and coworkers&nbsp;</blockquote><p>The shape of this portion of the Kocabaş skull and its thick supraorbital torus have led most researchers to identify it as a <em>Homo erectus</em> individual. The endocranial surface of the frontal bone has granular impressions that were initially suggested as possible evidence of tuberculosis infection. While this is still possible, later work suggested that these impressions may rather reflect a common condition in which the cranial bone remodels due to arachnoid cell growth.</p><p>The Kocabaş skull points to the most obvious question that Reddit posters shared: Why didn't anybody notice a human jaw in the travertine before it was installed in someone's house? </p><p>This question isn't so hard to answer. Quarries rough-cut travertine and other decorative stone into large panels, doing basic quality checks for gaps and large defects on the rough stone before polishing. Small defects and inclusions are the reason why people want travertine in the first place, so they don't merit special attention. Consumers who buy travertine usually browse samples in a showroom to choose the type of rock, and they don't see the actual panels or tile until installation. Tile or panels that are polished by machine and stacked in a workshop or factory for shipping are handled pretty quickly. </p><p>What this means is that there may be lots more hominin bones in people's floors and showers. </p><p>Most will be hard to recognize. Random cross-sections of hominin bones are tough to make out from other kinds of fossils without a lot of training. Noticing a fossil is not so hard, but I have to say that I've often been surprised at what the rest of a fossil looks like after skilled preparators painstakingly extract it from the surrounding rock. The ways that either nature or a masonry saw may slice a fossil don't correspond to an anatomy book, and a cross-section through part of a bone doesn't usually resemble an X-ray image of a whole bone. </p><p>Believe me, anthropologists don't want to hear about every blob of bone in your tile. Bones from other kinds of animals <strong>massively</strong> outnumber hominin bones in  large travertine deposits. Most tile and panels are cut thin enough that if a fossil not clearly identifiable from its exposed surface, the thin portion beneath the surface is not likely to identify it either. Nobody wants to drill into your shower wall on a wild goose chase. </p><p>But certainly somebody has more pieces of the mandible from the Reddit post, and more pieces of the Kocabaş individual are probably installed in hotel bathrooms all across Europe. If you take another look at your shower wall and suspect an ancient human is looking back at you, it might actually be one. </p><p>The broader point is that a lot of the archaeological and fossil record has emerged as a result of industrial processes and construction. Paleontologists are in an uneasy symbiosis with quarries. The work of the rockcutters exposes underground sections that scientists would never know for centuries, yet at the same time it destroys evidence that might be recovered with enough paleontological labor. It helps for workers to have some training to notice potentially interesting finds as they encounter them, and for paleontologists and archaeologists to be engaged with the industries and construction projects that often encounter ancient remains. </p><p>And if you do happen find a jawbone in your bathroom, my suggestion is first to contact the local authorities. Sure, a fossil in travertine likely comes from hundreds of thousands of years ago. It isn't a crime scene. But depending on your state or nation of residence, laws governing discovery of human remains on your property may be complicated and having the paperwork in order with the police, sheriff, or coroner is the first step for most investigations. </p><p>For myself, I'll be following the Reddit story with interest—I expect there will be many twists and turns in the story of this jawbone. With some teeth preserved and abundant surrounding rock, I expect that specialists will be able to learn a great deal about the life of this individual and when he or she lived. </p><p>Assuming, that is, the parents wouldn't rather keep it where it is installed now. </p><hr><p><em><strong>Notes:</strong> I've included some references for the Kocabaş and Bilzingsleben discoveries below. There is much more to say about both of them. Investigation of Middle Pleistocene and earlier travertine deposits is one of the most promising avenues to understand ancient environments in which human ancestors and relatives lived. </em></p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>Kappelman, J., Alçiçek, M.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="entry-content" itemprop="text">
<p>According to the latest draft text of the controversial <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-11-conseil-csam-compromis-9-avril.pdf">EU Child Sexual Abuse Regulation proposal </a>leaked by the French news organization Contexte, <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/dokument/XXVII/EU/179658/imfname_11360113.pdf">which the EU member states discussed</a>, the EU interior ministers want to exempt professional accounts of staff of intelligence agencies, police and military from the envisaged scanning of chats and messages (Article 1 (2a)). The regulation should also not apply to “confidential information” such as professional secrets (Article 1 (2b)). The EU governments reject the idea that the new EU Child Protection Centre should support them in the prevention of child sexual abuse and develop best practices for prevention initiatives (Article 43(8)).</p>
<p>“The fact that the EU interior ministers want to exempt police officers, soldiers, intelligence officers and even themselves from chat control scanning proves that they know exactly just how unreliable and dangerous the snooping algorithms are that they want to unleash on us citizens,” commented Pirate Party MEP Patrick Breyer. “They seem to fear that even military secrets without any link to child sexual abuse could end up in the US at any time. The confidentiality of government communications is certainly important, but the same must apply to the protection of business and of course citizens communications, including the spaces that victims of abuse themselves need for secure exchanges and therapy. We know that most of the chats leaked by today’s voluntary snooping algorithms are of no relevance to the police, for example family photos or consensual sexting. It is outrageous that the EU interior ministers themselves do not want to suffer the consequences of the destruction of digital privacy of correspondence and secure encryption that they are imposing on us.”</p>
<p>“The promise that professional secrets should not be affected by chat control is a lie cast in paragraphs. No provider and no algorithm can know or determine whether a chat is being conducted with doctors, therapists, lawyers, defence lawyers, etc. so as to exempt it from chat control. Chat control inevitably threatens to leak intimate photos sent for medical purposes and trial documents sent for defending abuse victims.”</p>
<p>“It makes a mockery of the official goal of child protection that the EU interior ministers reject the development of best practices for preventing child sexual abuse. It couldn’t be clearer that the aim of this bill is China-style mass surveillance and not better protecting our children. Real child protection would require a systematic scientific evaluation and implementation of multidisciplinary prevention programmes, as well as Europe-wide standards and guidelines for criminal investigations into child abuse, including the identification of victims and the necessary technical means. None of this is planned by the EU interior ministers.”</p>
<p>The EU governments want to adopt the chat control bill by the beginning of June.</p>

<p><span><strong>Quick Note: I’m Going to CES and SPIE AR/VR/MR 2024</strong></span></p>



<p><span>Before getting to the article, I wanted my readers to know that I plan to attend CES from January 9th through the 12th. My schedule is just forming up as of this writing, so I currently have many time slots available. Most AR/VR/MR-specific companies exhibiting publicly will be in LVCC Central Hall or the Venetian like last year. While I am primarily there to meet with companies and see products, I always have some time to meet with blog fans.   </span></p>



<p><span>I will also attend the SPIE AR/MR/VR conference from January 29th through the 31st. It is much easier to meet at this conference as everything is in one building for the conference and exhibits. </span></p>



<p><span>If you want to meet up with me at either event, please email me at <strong>meet@kgontech.com</strong> </span></p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Humane AI (<strong>Humane</strong>, hereafter) combines the mid-2010s failed concept of using a laser projector to project on the body with the early 2000s failed projector phone (something <a href="https://kguttag.com/2013/08/04/whatever-happened-to-pico-projectors-embedding-in-phones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wrote about in 2013</a>), only they left out the phone’s flat panel display and have more feeble processing than a good smartphone. Rational people wonder what this does that a good smartphone can’t do much better, and you can count me as one of these people. </p>

<p>This blog has been written about various laser projector scams since the beginning of 2011. Scammers like to associate “laser” with near-mystic powers that violate all the laws of physics and rational thought. The other favorite word to deceive people is “Hologram” (when they are not). The new favorite buzzword is “AI .” </p>



<p>It looks like Humane started with an abysmally poor-quality laser projector in a phone-like device, and by saying it does “AI,” it is magically something new. Their picture was good enough to raise $230 million from SK Networks (Korea), Microsoft, LG, Volvo, Qualcomm, Open AI founder Sam Alman, and others. Granted, with so many big-name companies, the stakes were chump change for each giant company giant, but it does show foolishness on a grand scale. </p>



<h2>Humane Adds AI to the Laser Projection (Hype Squared)</h2>



<p>At first glance, Human AI looks like it started with a monochrome laser projector, and realizing that that wouldn’t sell venture capital companies (VCs), they wrapped it in the current hype surrounding AI. Humane co-founders Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri (left) have the “Steve Jobs” black shirt costume down like other famous Silicon Valley scammers, Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos, Sam Bankman-Fried founder of FTX, and Ronnie Abovitz, founder of Magic Leap. I have learned to be suspicious of the Steve Jobs pretender look through the years; it’s not a complete tell, but it should make you suspicious. </p>

<p>This blog has <a href="https://kguttag.com/?s=Laser+Projection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documented for over 12 years</a> how <strong>laser scanning is a terrible way to generate a display image</strong>. In short, <strong>the scanning process is too slow and inaccurate to generate a high-resolution image</strong>, and the lasers can’t be controlled fast and accurately enough to give good color depth, not to mention the poor power efficiency. </p>

<h3>The fundamental problems with pico projection include:</h3>



<p>1. <strong>Where will you project from?</strong> Humane’s “big concept” is that they will magnetically pin the projector to your shirt or jacket,  ignoring that it will sag a normal shirt and flop around as one moves. For the Humane’s introduction video, they pinned it on a heavy leather (or leather-like) jacket to give support (what do you do in the summer?).</p>

<p>2. <strong>What and where will you project on?</strong> Humane’s “big concept,” taken from laser projector scams of the past (more on this later), is to project on the skin. But the skin is a lousy, non-smooth projection screen with crevices and poor reflective qualities.  Worse yet, it <strong>requires a person to hold their hand up wherever the projector happens to be pointing</strong> as it flops around hanging on your “shirt.” Unlike a phone display, you can hold where you want or sit down. </p>



<p>3. <strong>Ambient light is the biggest killer for pico projectors due to the loss of contrast</strong>. Humane has not specified the projector’s brightness (in lumens), but it has a class 2 laser, so it can’t be that bright when projecting an image compared to the brightness of daylight. Humane demonstration videos are “staged” to put the hand’s projection surface in shadow or a dark environment. The Humane display is guaranteed to be invisible in outdoor daylight, about 100 times brighter than typical indoor lighting. Unlike flat panel displays that absorb ambient light, projection displays directly compete with it.</p>



<p>4. <strong>Humane’s projector lacks color and grayscale depth.</strong> Humane’s display a monochrome cyan (blue-green). There is no ability to even highly anything with color. Secondly, they demonstrated very limited grayscale depth; they showed just “on,” “off,” and a half-level. Even if grayscale is theoretically possible with the Humane projector, the ability fo see a grayscale image is severely hampered by using skin as a screen and the lack of contrast due to ambient light.  </p>



<p>5. <strong>Laser projection’s focus-free is a double-edged sword</strong>. While using laser scanning allows the projected image to be “focus-free,” it also means that the smallest objects blocking the projected image cast a harsh shadow blocking part of the image. </p>

<h3>Humane’s Poor Image Quality &amp; 720p Resolution Lie</h3>



<p>Human claims to have a 720p (1280 x 720 pixel) <strong>monochrome</strong> resolution. <strong>All laser projector resolution claims I have seen through the years lie about their resolution</strong>, typically by about 2x horizontally and vertically. But <strong>Humane seems to have topped them by claiming about 4x of the horizontal and vertical resolution they can deliver</strong>. A picture of a 502- x 410-pixel Apple Watch Ultra 2 is on the right. Humane’s image quality is worse than a cheap 1960s B&amp;W TV (see the series of pictures below).  </p>



<p>Humane’s website and other promotional material have a series of <strong>fake still images </strong>(“Photoshopped” images overlayed on hands). While even these pictures are pretty low-resolution (much less than a true 720p image), they turn out to be much better than what is seen in the videos of the Humane projector. I fear that AI will soon make it easy to make fake images and videos that are less obvious, but these fakes from Humane did not use its “AI” technology. </p>

<p>The images below are still frames from the Humane Introduction Video, “<a href="https://youtu.be/9lNIwOOMVHk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is the Humane Ai Pin</a>.” In addition to the lower resolution and contrast than the fake stills above. Notice how the crevices in the skin break up the image and don’t just darken it. In the the third from the left still below, the hand has been turned upward, catching more light (but nothing compared to a bright room or sunlight); notice how the image looks even more faded due to the ambient light.</p>

These videos were taken in a much darker environment, so the contrast of the projection is better. I want to see a demo in daylight (not in the shade).

<h3>But, but, but, it is all about voice recognition and speech.</h3>



<p>Voice recognition has been on smartphones for about a decade with Siri (2011) and Alexa (2014). People have all experienced the good and bad of voice input and output. Certainly, voice can be a good adjunct input, but it can also be very frustrating and difficult to correct when it does not understand you correctly. AI will likely improve the recognition, but it will not be perfect. In many situations, voice input is insecure, disruptive, and/or impractical (due to, say, noise or wind). What is one supposed to do with the Humane device in such situations? </p>



<p>Humane’s <a href="https://youtu.be/9lNIwOOMVHk">introduction video</a> was a fiasco in that it highlighted the combined voice and image recognition problems. The founders looked stilted, trying to time everything and speaking slowly with preplanned questions to the “AI engine,” and sometimes the device gave erroneous answers. When asked about the best place to see the next solar eclipse, it gave a location too far south, and when asked to estimate how much protein is in a small number of almonds, it said that “half a cup has 15 grams.” A spokesperson for Humane has responded that it got the date correct on the eclipse but that the location was a “bug” and that while the “AI” missed the question’s intent on the almonds, the answer was technically correct on the grams per cup. </p>



<p>The AI answered like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Clavin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cliff Clavin</a> (bar know-it-all from the TV series Cheers who constantly gave erroneous information but showed full confidence in what he was saying – <a href="https://youtu.be/k6GTZrcoWEM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example, video clip</a>). Apple uses “Siri” to trigger their audio response; maybe Humane could use “Cliff.” </p>

<p>Just for fun, I asked my iPhone’s Siri, “Where is the best place to watch the next solar eclipse?” and it came back with a series of links to articles (that included color pictures and maps) that I could scroll through on my phone but would never be able to read on Humane’s terrible display or would want read back to me. </p>



<p>In the real world, speech recognition is much more complex than Humane’s simplistic examples. The environment is going to be more complex and often noisy. When speaking, people are not careful to say each word clearly, particularly when they have to whisper to avoid disturbing the people around them too much. As has been widely discussed, AI will often answer questions with wrong information. </p>



<h2>Old Scam with Slightly New Twist</h2>



<p>Back in the days before Streaming, DVDs, and VHS tapes, the Disney company found they could rerelease their animated features every seven years, and a new generation of kids would think they were new. Disney then followed a similar pattern and put their VHS and later DVD releases in the “Disney Vault” between rereleases.</p>



<p>This pattern of letting memories fade away before reintroducing them as “new” also holds in high-tech. In 2016, this blog wrote about eyeHand in <a href="https://kguttag.com/2016/10/05/wrist-projector-scams-ritot-cicret-the-new-eyehand/">Wrist Projector Scams – Ritot, Cicret, the new eyeHand</a>. These companies showed some comically bad fake images that included “projecting black,” violating all laws of physics. </p>

<p>The scams by the small companies got big companies like Dell and Hilton to buy into the scammer’s marketing hype, and they released several “concept videos” seemingly based on these scams (see below from that <a href="https://kguttag.com/2016/10/05/wrist-projector-scams-ritot-cicret-the-new-eyehand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same article</a>).</p>

<p>In 2018, Haier and ASU revisited the concept (see <a href="https://kguttag.com/2018/02/17/2018-ces-haier-laser-projector-watch-wrist-projector-scams-revisited/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 2018 CES Haier Laser Projector Watch – (Wrist Projector Scams Revisited)</a>). Haier showed a prototype at CES 2018, enabling me to photograph the difference between the less obviously fake images and their real appearance (see article for more details). </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>Once you get past the contrived demonstrations and crappy displays, Humane’s problem is convincing real people that what they have is better than a smartphone. A modern smartphone has a better onboard processor and, orders of magnitude, a better display, supports audio and video input, and can communicate with the internet for AI or related speech recognition and answers. A phone does not force one to wear clothes that will be able to support it or make me hold my hand out to see a crappy image. </p>



<p>Few will believe a startup company has better speech recognition and information database technology than Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other giant companies. If Humane really had better technology, why didn’t they release it as a software application rather than developing this terrible device? </p>



<p>Humane has no advantages and massive disadvantages compared to a smartphone, and it seems most people in technology have come to the same conclusion based on my reading of the responses. There are a few “everyone gets a trophy” and “anything is possible” people who have an open (or empty?) mind to this concept. </p>



<p>How so many business people could get their companies to fork over a combined $230M confounds me. I’m waiting for the AI program that can explain it . . . Not really; it is probably a combination of ego, unwillingness to do good due diligence, and fear of missing out (FOMO), all very human problems. These same “businesspeople” will run most startups through the wringer for a few million in VC money and then hold a cash bonfire with Humane AI and Magic Leap (<a href="https://kguttag.com/2020/05/03/magic-leap-starts-to-auger-in-with-3-7x-the-money-as-theranos-i-tried-to-warn-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another company that originally told investors that a key technology was laser projection</a>). Thankfully, at least this time, they are not stealing money from individuals on Kickstarter or Indigogo like Ritot, Cicret, and eyeHand did, even if the amount is two orders of magnitude higher. </p>

One of the most puzzling symptoms in those early days was something called "brain fog"&nbsp;— cognitive issues like confusion, forgetfulness, and trouble focusing.</p><div dir="ltr"><p>And while other symptoms have changed as the virus mutated, brain fog is still a common complaint of COVID sufferers not only during the initial illness, but&nbsp;extending for months or even&nbsp;years afterwards.&nbsp;Several recent studies have been trying to understand exactly what this virus is doing to our brains — and how to stop it.</p><p>  Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly,&nbsp;the chief of research and development at the VA St. Louis Health Care System,&nbsp;spoke with <em>Quirks &amp; Quarks</em> host Bob McDonald about what he's seeing in his research on COVID and the brain.

We see a lot of people with headache disorders, sleep disturbances, sleep problems. A lot of people come back to the clinic with tingling of the extremities, tingling in the legs or sometimes in the arms. In rare cases, seizure disorders. So really a variety of health problems in the brain.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Is COVID actually affecting the way the brain functions?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">There are <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2311330" target="_blank">studies that have been done</a> comparing people who&nbsp;had COVID-19, versus people who didn't, and then gave&nbsp;them cognitive testing to measure their ability to cognitively process information and test their IQ.

And we also don't really know whether those cognitive losses that I just described, that three-point IQ loss, we don't really know how permanent that is.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What about brain aging?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It's very, very clear that in some individuals they do experience structural abnormalities and some other abnormalities of imaging that are commensurate with what normal people experience with about <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217232120" target="_blank">seven years of brain aging</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Now the hope is that those effects are not are not long lasting and then the brain with neuroplasticity and other other sort of mechanisms will be able to restore itself back to normal health. But I think that really remains to be characterized and seen in studies.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How is the virus that&nbsp;comes in through the lungs affecting the brain so much?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04569-5" target="_blank">induces inflammation of the brain</a>. One of the clear signals from the studies that we've done and a lot of other people have done over the past several years is that&nbsp;clearly in some people it can provoke inflammatory reactions in the brain or neuroinflammation and that may explain some of the symptoms that are&nbsp;experienced by some individuals.</p><div dir="ltr"><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A hand points to brain scans." srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg" data-cy="image-img"></p><figcaption>In one study, researchers found that the protective blood-brain barrier was leaky after a COVID infection, which could drive changes in neural function.<!-- --> <!-- -->(sfam_photo / Shutterstock)</figcaption></figure></div><p dir="ltr">It can affect multiple substances on which the brain really depends to function normally. One of them is cortisol. So <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06651-y#:~:" target="_blank">people have studied this out of Yale University</a> and have shown that people with long COVID or people after SARS-CoV-2 infection can experience inappropriately low level of cortisol and that's actually an important hormone&nbsp;for a lot of certain normal physiologic processes, including cognitive performance, and a lower cortisol level than where it should be can explain some of the cognitive dysfunction&nbsp;that is seen in some people after SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are some studies also done on <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2811556" target="_blank">showing low serotonin levels</a>&nbsp;and that can also explain some of the symptoms.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>But doesn't the brain have a protective mechanism, the so-called blood brain barrier?&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">By inducing that inflammation of the brain, that actually&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9" target="_blank">makes that barrier leaky</a>, so it starts leaking things into the brain that shouldn't be there. And things from the brain to outside the brain that also should not exit outside the brain. So a leaky blood brain barrier can also explain, you know, some of the manifestations that we see after COVID-19 infection.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How is this changing over time as the virus mutates?&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We're in a different phase of the pandemic now than what we all experienced in March 2020. We have a different virus. We have availability of vaccines now. We have antivirals. So all of these drivers&nbsp;have now sort of reduced overall the burden of long COVID.</p><div dir="ltr"><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Woman rests her hands on handle bars of an exercise bike used to strengthen muscle tone for fatigue after COVID-19." srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/long-covid.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/long-covid.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/long-covid.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/long-covid.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/long-covid.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/long-covid.jpg" data-cy="image-img"></p><figcaption>A woman rides on an exercise bike to strengthen muscle tone for fatigue related to long COVID at the Department of Rehabilitative Cardiology in Genoa, Italy.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div><p dir="ltr">That doesn't mean that SARS-CoV-2 infection is benign, is inconsequential. We still see people in the hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we still see people with strokes and heart attacks and, you know, brain fog and all other manifestations. But overall, I think the risk has sort of declined over the course of the pandemic.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How unique are these other effects on the body and the brain and the heart to COVID?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The big revelation or the big aha moment in this pandemic was the realization that SARS-CoV-2 infection can produce this really large basket of long-term adverse health effects. When we went back and started thinking about what happened to people after the Spanish flu, we found historical accounts that sort of resemble, to a large degree, what we described now after SARS-CoV-2 infection, people having increased risk of Parkinson's disease, headaches, brain fog etcetera.</p><p dir="ltr">I think one of the major lessons that I learned from this pandemic is that there are long tails to pandemics. And yes, we can focus all we want on the acute phase, or the tip of the iceberg, but the reality is that there is a really much larger chunk of disability and disease beneath that tip of the iceberg.</p><hr><p><em>Q&amp;A edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div><div><h2>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2><div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7103151.1706893380!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_300/amanda-buckiewicz-headshot.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7103151.1706893380!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_460/amanda-buckiewicz-headshot.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7103151.1706893380!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_620/amanda-buckiewicz-headshot.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 258pxpx) 258pxpx" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7103151.1706893380!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_620/amanda-buckiewicz-headshot.jpg" data-cy="author-image-img"></p></figure></div><p>Amanda Buckiewicz is an award-winning science journalist with CBC Radio's legendary science show, Quirks &amp; Quarks.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re thrilled to announce that <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/ssh">Tailscale SSH</a> is now Generally Available. Tailscale SSH allows Tailscale to manage the authentication and authorization of SSH connections on your tailnet. From the user’s perspective, you use SSH as normal—authenticating with Tailscale according to configurable rules—and we handle SSO, MFA, and key rotation, and allow you to enforce precise permissions in ACLs. Combined with other enterprise features like user and group provisioning with SCIM, you can use Tailscale SSH to craft a fully zero-trust remote access solution.</p><p>Thanks to that flexibility and strong security-by-default, Tailscale SSH has already become a key component of many of our users’ workflows, including as a foundational piece of enterprise ZTNA strategies.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://csvbase.com/blog/8">https://csvbase.com/blog/8</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40060728">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>There is no hard limit on table size in csvbase.  Within reason, they can be as
big as you like.  And if you go off and run your own instance you can do
whatever you want.  Big Data isn't always Better Data, but it's nice to have
the option.</p>
<p>That said, wouldn't it be nice to have those tables cached, so that if you read
it twice you don't have to fully download it again the second time?</p>
<h2>Cache-control header - with max-age</h2>
<p>Perhaps this HTTP server header?:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Cache-Control: max-age</span><span>=</span><span>86400</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>The above header says "keep using this file for a day [86400 seconds] before
re-downloading it".  Great!</p>
<p>Hang on though.  If someone changes that table you'd be stuck looking at the
old version for up to 24 hours.  Being <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1435417.1435432">eventually
consistent</a> was once very trendy.
But it's no longer hip - even Amazon S3 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-strong-read-after-write-consistency/">no longer returns stale
data</a>.
So serving stale data just won't do for csvbase.</p>
<h2>HTTP/1.1 has a lot of caching features</h2>
<p>The elden ones <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2000.839382">thought deeply about
caching</a>.  DNS <a href="https://www.internethalloffame.org/2012/07/23/why-does-net-still-work-christmas-paul-mockapetris/">is a
cache</a>.
<a href="https://www.linuxatemyram.com/">Virtual memory</a> is a cache.  And if you've
ever wondered why HTTP/1.0 got a patch release (HTTP/1.1) less than a year
after it came out: more caching.</p>
<p>HTTP/1.0 had almost nothing in the way of caching.  In HTTP/1.1, a whole new
top-level section on the subject was added to the standard.  This was essential
because, back in the day, the repeated re-downloading of unchanged files was a
real headache.</p>
<p>This needless re-downloading was especially bad for popular sites, whose pages
would be massively re-downloaded over and over - even though they hadn't
changed - by many, many people.  Enough to start cause problems for the
internet as a whole.</p>
<p>One of the <em>cool new features</em> in HTTP/1.1 (implemented in Netscape Navigator 4.0,
available from all reputable software stockists) is the <code>ETag</code> header.  It
works like this:</p>
<p>The HTTP server generates a unique id for each version of a file.  'Version' in
this context means not just revision but also format, so CSV files get
different ids from Parquet files even if served from the same URL (csvbase
<a href="https://csvbase.com/blog/2">does this</a>).  The HTTP server returns this id in
the <code>ETag</code> header.</p>
<p>When an HTTP client requests the file again, it provides that same id in the
<code>If-None-Match</code> header.</p>
<p>If that ETag is up-to-date, the server just sets the status to <code>304 Not Modified</code> and returns absolutely nothing.  The client then knows that it should
use the file it already has.</p>
<p>This is a way to both keep a cache <em>and</em> avoid stale data.</p>
<h2>Generating the ETag</h2>
<p>How should the ETag be generated?  That is up to the server - up to csvbase.
csvbase could just md5sum the file and put that in the header.  That would be
valid and it would work.</p>
<p>Well, except.  Except, csvbase is not actually a database of CSV files.  The
name is a bit of a trick.  csvbase doesn't keep the CSV files on some
filesystem (or in an <a href="https://calpaterson.com/s3.html">object store</a> for that
matter).  Instead, uploaded CSV files are fully parsed and then put into a SQL
database.  When csvbase returns you a CSV file it's being generated <em>on the
fly</em>.  That's how csvbase returns other formats like Parquet, JSONlines, JSON, etc.</p>
<p>It would be quicker for csvbase not to have to regenerate the CSV file (or
Parquet file) each time, just in order to check whether the md5sum of that file
matched the <code>If-None-Match</code> header.</p>
<p>So instead of hashing the contents of the file, we'll create the ETag by
hashing a key:</p>
<p><code>(table id, last change time, file format, page number [if any])</code></p>
<p>That key represents both the version of the file plus what page is being looked
it (the JSON and HTML formats are paginated).  And if your table is changed,
last change time is different and the ETag changes too.  Fab.</p>
<h2>How long to cache for?</h2>
<p>At this point we have a caching system that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Spares the client downloading the file<ul>
<li>though they must make a tiny request</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also avoids the server regenerating the file</li>
<li>Prevents any stale results (ie: avoids <a href="https://calpaterson.com/ttl-hell.html">"TTL
hell"</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The only question now is how long we tell clients to cache stuff.  How long?</p>
<p>The answer is forever.  csvbase sets no <code>max-age</code>.  Clients can cache stuff as
long as they like, <strong>providing that they revalidate each time</strong> the use that
data.</p>
<p>Here's what csvbase's response looks like</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>HTTP/1.1</span><span></span>
<span>content-type: text/csv</span><span></span>
<span>etag: &lt;some gobbledegook string&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>cache-control: no-cache, must-revalidate</span><span></span>
<span>[ then loads of CSV data ]</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>The operative bit here is the <code>no-cache</code> pragma.  Despite the misleading name,
this tells clients that they can in fact cache this file, <em>but</em> that they must
revalidate each time they use it.  Here's how
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#response_directives">MDN</a>
describes it (emphasis is mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The no-cache response directive indicates that the <strong>response can be stored in
caches</strong>, but the response must be validated with the origin server before each
reuse, even when the cache is disconnected from the origin server."</em></p>
<p><em>"If you want caches to always check for content updates while reusing stored
content, no-cache is the directive to use. It does this by requiring caches
to revalidate each request with the origin server."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>must-revalidate</code> is probably not necessary but the original RFC suggests that
maybe caches might choose, in exceptional circumstances, yadda yadda yadda, to
actually serve stale data anyway.  <code>must-revalidate</code> bans that.
<code>must-revalidate</code>'s name actually makes sense so I probably don't need to quote
chapter and verse, but here, anyway, again from MDN:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>HTTP allows caches to reuse stale responses when they are disconnected from
the origin server. must-revalidate is a way to prevent this from happening -
either the stored response is revalidated with the origin server or a 504
(Gateway Timeout) response is generated.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No TTL necessary.  And browsers really support this stuff.  It all works.</p>
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/csvbase-client/"><code>csvbase-client</code></a> also supports
this.  You can test it out this way:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>

<span># read the table</span>
<span>df1</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>"csvbase://calpaterson/opcodes-6502"</span><span>)</span>

<span># read it again (this came from your local cache)</span>
<span>df2</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>"csvbase://calpaterson/opcodes-6502"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And if you prefer just to use <code>curl</code>, here's how to test it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl <span>\</span>
--etag-compare opcodes-6502-etag.txt <span>\</span>
--etag-save opcodes-6502-etag.txt <span>\</span>
https://csvbase.com/calpaterson/opcodes-6502.parquet
<span>\-</span>O
</pre></div>
<h2>What else is possible with ETags?</h2>
<p>A bit more.  Join me next time when I use ETags as an effective form of
concurrency control.  Until then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try out csvbase and, really, really, importantly: <a href="mailto:cal@calpaterson.com">send me your
feedback</a></li>
<li>
Join the underground conspiracy on the <a href="https://discord.gg/zXHZNvv22N">csvbase discord
server</a><ul>
<li>memes to be kept to a socially acceptable level of dankness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leaf through <a href="https://github.com/calpaterson/csvbase">the source code</a></li>
<li>Or come and meet me in person at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/helpy-meetups/events/300305921/">Helsinki Python's May
meetup</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>See also</h2>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://calpaterson.com/ttl-hell.html">another article on caching</a> a
couple of years ago.  The subject bit different but the aim is the same: caching but
without correctness problems.</p>
<p>I loved Eric's Brewer's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E91oEn1bnXM">2004 lecture on
Inktomi</a>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inktomi">Inktomi</a> was effectively a primordial
Google who tried white-labelling instead of running the search engine
themselves.  They later changed to being a content distribution network and at
<a href="https://youtu.be/E91oEn1bnXM?si=zt5vj1TPSBOMkKzG&amp;t=3434">around 57 minutes</a>
Brewer relays the story of the release of the Starr report which vindicated
much of the effort put into web caching since HTTP/1.1 was released.  He is
very emotional throughout as Inktomi had gone spectacularly bust a couple of
years before.</p>
<p>One wrinkle I have not discussed is that many caching reverse proxies don't
have exactly have spectacular support for cache revalidation.  The going advice
on Varnish is to use some <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/default-cache-behavior/">quite complicated
config</a>.
Cloudflare <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/cache-control/#origin-cache-control-behavior">do the wrong thing with
<code>no-cache</code></a>
but it's possible to work around it.  What can't be worked around, for csvbase,
is their <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/20/cloudflare-does-not-consider-vary-values-in-caching-decisions/">lack of support for
<code>Vary</code></a>.
This is all HTTP/1.1 stuff - from 1997 - and browsers overwhelmingly support
it.  But reverse proxies don't, for some reason.</p>

  <p>12 Apr 2024</p>
  <p>As a query optimization researcher, I’ve spent the last 10 years of my life playing with, learning from, and building on top of the most sophisticated open source query optimizer out there, <a href="https://postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. I recently wondered how much PostgreSQL had improved over the decade since I started working on databases. While changelogs and opinion pieces were plentiful, I couldn’t find any strong empirical comparisons, so I decided to run the <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol9/p204-leis.pdf">join order benchmark</a> (JOB)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> on PostgreSQL 8 through 16. I recorded the 90th percentile query latency for each database version.</p>

<p><img src="https://rmarcus.info/blog/assets/pg_over_time/job.svg" alt="Graph of P90 tail latency for different PostgreSQL versions. Speed improves drastically over time."></p>

<p>I built each version<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> of PostgreSQL using GCC 13.2 inside a Docker container with Arch Linux. Since I wanted to measure the quality of the query optimizer, and not index/IO performance, I set <code>shared_buffers</code> to 8GB (large enough to hold the entire database). I also set <code>work_mem</code> to 8MB for all versions. Each query is executed once to warm the cache, then the median latency of 5 additional runs in recorded.</p>

<p>Overall, <strong>PostgreSQL’s tail performance has improved drastically</strong>, although versions 13 through 16 have been mostly stable. Comparing version 8 to version 16, <strong>PostgreSQL’s optimizer has dropped tail latency by nearly half in the last 10 years!</strong></p>

<p>We can also investigate the entire query distribution (note the log scale):</p>

<p><img src="https://rmarcus.info/blog/assets/pg_over_time/box.svg" alt="Box plots of query latency for each major version. There is a slight slope downwards."></p>

<p>We can use regression analysis to (1) confirm that the downward slope in latency is significant, and (2) quantify how much improvement is brought by each version of PostgreSQL. If we regress the PostgreSQL major version number against query latency, we see that each new major version of PostgreSQL brings, on average, a <strong>15% performance improvement</strong> on the Join Order Benchmark (<span id="il180"></span>). However, a linear model is arguably a poor measure of the change (<span id="il181"></span>).</p>

<p>Of course, not all of these improvements are attributable to the query optimizer. Improvements to the execution engine – from parallel workers to just-in-time (JIT) compilation – also play a role. It would be interesting to investigate how each query plan in JOB has changed over the year… maybe next time!</p>

<p>Quantifying the improvement aside:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Upgrade your database! Going from PostgreSQL 8 to 16 has the potential to massively improve your workload’s tail latency.</li>
  <li>Researchers should note that PostgreSQL is a bit of a moving target. Learned query optimization research has compared with different versions of PostgreSQL over time (e.g., Neo and Bao compare with version 11, whereas newer work compare with version 14, 15, or 16.) So just because an older technique improves on PostgreSQL by 30%, and a newer technique only improves on PostgreSQL by 25%, the newer technique may be comparing against a stronger PostgreSQL.</li>
</ul>

      <p><a href="https://ajkprojects.com/">Home</a></p>
      
      <p>Advice for myself around leisure activities.</p>
      <p>You aren’t famous. Anything you do or create will probably receive little to no attention, so stop optimizing for a non-existent audience and instead focus on what makes you enjoy the activity. </p>
      <p>Want to try a craft or artistic hobby? Focus on mastering the skill and enjoy the variety it can provide. You don’t need to build a personal style. No one will care. Want to do photography and think black and white photos are cool? Great! You don’t need to create an Instagram branded all around your moody black and white photos. Most likely you’ll get bored of it and want to try a different type of photography, and that’s great. You aren’t Ansel Adams, no one will care if your “style” is all over the place.</p>
      <p>Do you want to build an app or website but don’t enjoy the process of designing? Then make it ugly. Who cares! Design is for an audience and you don’t have one. Functionality is more important right now. Maybe a designer will notice and want to improve it for you, but until then take pride in your crappy UI. </p>
      <p>Blogging is fun and therapeutic. Grammar and editing aren’t. As long as your thoughts are coherent, don’t worry too much about writing mistakes or filtering yourself. Just use Grammarly to fix elementary-level errors and move on. It’s more about the writing process than the final product.</p>
      <p>The most egregious thing you can do with any activity is daydream about how you can make money off of it. That’s the quickest way to optimize for the wrong things and suck the fun right out of it. Most likely you will stop doing the activity almost immediately, so save the money-making schemes for work.</p>
      <p>In the end, find something you enjoy doing and just do it because you enjoy it. If you have to, make some goals for yourself, but never for your “audience”.</p>

		<p>Anniversaries are strange: no one but those involved have any reason to even know they exist, which makes them easy to skip; for example, last year I mostly ignored the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/welcome-to-stratechery/">10 year anniversary of starting Stratechery</a> because I was more eager to write about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/chatgpt-learns-computing/">ChatGPT Getting a Computer</a>. That leaves today, April 16, as my last chance to mark a tin anniversary: ten years ago Stratechery <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/welcome-stratechery-20/">added a subscription option</a>, making this my full-time job.</p>
<p>It was, for the record, a miserable day: I had a convoluted plan to offer different site experiences for subscribers and non-subscribers: the former would receive daily linked-list updates (a la <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a>) while the latter would still have access to longer-form Articles; I scrapped the concept <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/free-stratechery-daily-email/">two days later</a> in favor of simply sending subscribers a daily email, and so the paid newsletter model was born.</p>
<p>That accident of history ended up being why this anniversary is actually more meaningful to me: while I am most well-known for Stratechery, I am equally proud of the paid newsletter model — services like Substack <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/platforms/platform-profiles/substack-newsletter-platform/">were based on Stratechery</a> — and gratified that so many writers are making a living connecting directly with readers.</p>
<p>Of course newsletters aren’t the only medium where this happens (and, in fact, I’ve never viewed Stratechery as a newsletter; it’s a blog that you can read via email); there are also podcasts (which <a href="https://stratechery.com/stratechery-plus/">Stratechery has expanded into</a>) and YouTube (like and subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Stratechery">Stratechery</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SharpTechPodcast">Sharp Tech</a> channels!). The king of the latter, at least when it comes to tech, is Marques Brownlee, aka <a href="https://twitter.com/mkbhd">MKBHD</a>.</p>
<h3>The Humane AI Pin</h3>
<p>Humane introduced the wearable AI Pin at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMsQO5u7-NQ">a TED Talk 11 months ago</a>,  painting the vision of a future without screens, powered by AI. I was, for the record, pretty skeptical: most new tech categories layer on top of what came before, as opposed to outright replacing them; Humane’s proposal of a wearable device that was completely independent of the phone in your pocket seemed unlikely to succeed. Still, I was cheering for them: I applaud any company trying to build something new, and AI provides the opening for new experimentation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, last week the reviews of the AI Pin came out and they were universally terrible; The Verge’s headline summed up the sentiment: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126502/humane-ai-pin-review">Humane AI Pin review: not even close</a>. David Pierce wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I came into this review with two big questions about the AI Pin. The first is the big-picture one: is this thing… anything? In just shy of two weeks of testing, I’ve come to realize that there are, in fact, a lot of things for which my phone actually sucks. Often, all I want to do is check the time or write something down or text my wife, and I end up sucked in by TikTok or my email or whatever unwanted notification is sitting there on my screen. Plus, have you ever thought about how often your hands are occupied with groceries / clothes / leashes / children / steering wheels, and how annoying / unsafe it is to try to balance your phone at the same time? I’ve learned I do lots of things on my phone that I might like to do somewhere else. So, yeah, this is something. Maybe something big. AI models aren’t good enough to handle everything yet, but I’ve seen enough glimmers of what’s coming that I’m optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>  That raises the second question: should you buy this thing? That one’s easy. Nope. Nuh-uh. No way. The AI Pin is an interesting idea that is so thoroughly unfinished and so totally broken in so many unacceptable ways that I can’t think of anyone to whom I’d recommend spending the $699 for the device and the $24 monthly subscription.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Brownlee agreed; he said at the start of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA&amp;t=18s">YouTube review</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>
  So this is the Humane AI Pin. It is a brand new product in a really interesting new form factor of an ultra-futuristic wearable computer. In a time of all these crazy gadgets and Vision Pro and wearable glasses, it’s so sick that we get so many genuinely new first generation products like this to give a shot.</p>
<p>  Unfortunately it’s also the new worst product I think I’ve ever reviewed in its current state. There’s just so many things bad about it. It’s so bad, in fact, that I actually think it’s kind of distracting to understand what the point of the device is as we go through it, so I’m going to have to separate it out for this video. First, I’m going to tell you what it is and what it’s supposed to do, and then I’ll tell you what my experience has actually been using it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Brownlee proceeded to do just that: he presented Humane’s vision, detailed how poorly it lived up to it (including the probably fatal flaw inherent in its decision to pretend smartphones don’t exist), and granted that future software updates might improve the experience. I thought it was a fair,<sup id="rf1-12783"><a href="#fn1-12783" title="Actually, the deference Brownlee gave the vision and the potential of future upgrades was arguably generous" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> if brutal, review, but what had some people up in arms was the title and thumbnail:</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>I don’t tweet much these days — if you want one of my tips for lasting over a decade, that is one of them, for my own peace of mind more than anything —&nbsp;but Vassallo’s sentiment bothered me enough to fire off a response:</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-dnt="true">

</div>
<p>I honestly think I had this anniversary on my mind: I remember when I first started, with only a few hundred followers on Twitter, armed with nothing but my honest takes about tech; my only hope was that those takes would be original enough and valuable enough to build an audience. That they were didn’t diminish the desire to be honest; indeed, one of the biggest challenges creators face as they grow is retaining their edge even when they know people are actually paying attention to what they have to say.</p>
<h3>MKBHD’s Responsibility</h3>
<p>The more interesting Vassallo tweet, though, and the one that inspired this Article, was this exchange in response to his original tweet:</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">MKBHD is not the market. He *significantly* influences the market.</p>
<p>If a single person can affect the stock price of a company, we usually restrict what they can say or when. MK should be cognizant of the unconstrained power he has (for now).</p>
<p>— Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1779785621760069810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Ignore the vaguely threatening “for now” ; Vassallo is touching on something profound about Brownlee, that I myself understand intimately: what the Internet has made uniquely possible is total loyalty to your customers, and that is threatening.</p>
<p>Let me start with myself: every dollar of income I have comes from my subscribers,<sup id="rf2-12783"><a href="#fn2-12783" title="I previously spoke for pay, and even more previously offered consulting, and even more previously than that had ads; however, I ended ads in 2014, consulting in 2015, and haven’t accepted any paid speaking opportunities since 2017. This is all covered on <a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/about/&quot;>my about page</a>." rel="footnote">2</a></sup> all of whom pay the same price.<sup id="rf3-12783"><a href="#fn3-12783" title="$12/month or $120/year for the last five years, increasing to $15/month and $150/year on April 22" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> If someone doesn’t like what I write, I make it easy to unsubscribe; if they accuse me of writing for favor or illegitimate profit I am happy to unsubscribe them myself, and refund their money. After all, to use Brownlee’s reponse to Vassallo:</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We disagree on what my job is</p>
<p>— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1779928058746617912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>My job is to make my subscribers happy, and the best way I’ve found to do that is to stay as true as I can to what I set out to do in the beginning: write things that are original and valuable. When I succeed I’m happy, and the numbers take care of themselves; when I publish something I’m not happy with, I have trouble sleeping. When tech companies or investors or anyone else is mad, I am free to not pay them any attention.</p>
<p>Brownlee, though, is, to Vassallo’s point, something else entirely: 18 million subscribers is an incredible number, even if only — “only” — 3.5 million people have viewed his Humane video. If Humane’s AI Pin wasn’t already dead in the water, it’s fair to say that <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1779842724771893524">@levelsio</a> is right:</p>

<p>Who, though, is to blame, and who benefited? Surely the responsibility for the Humane AI Pin lies with Humane; the people who benefited from Brownlee’s honesty were his viewers, the only people to whom Brownlee owes anything. To think of this review — or even just the title — as “distasteful” or “unethical” is to view Humane — a recognizable entity, to be sure — as of more worth than the 3.5 million individuals who watched Brownlee’s review.</p>
<p>This is one of the challenges of scale: Brownlee has so many viewers that it is almost easier to pretend like they are some unimportant blob. Brownlee, though, is successful because he remembers his job is not to go easy on individual companies, but inform individual viewers who will make individual decisions about spending $700 on a product that doesn’t work. Thanks to the Internet he has absolutely no responsibility or incentive to do anything but.</p>
<h3>Media and the Internet</h3>
<p>While Stratechery mostly covers tech, I also spend a lot of time on media; in the early days of Stratechery, this mostly meant newspapers, and my argument was that was in fact a particularly useful angle on the impact of technology broadly: the fact that newspapers were text meant that they felt the impact of the Internet almost immediately, effects that would, as devices became more powerful and ubiquitous, and broadband faster and more reliable, impact everything. And, of course, Stratechery was a written product, so I had a stake in the game.</p>
<p>To that end, I wrote a series of Articles in the run-up to April 16, 2014, laying the groundwork for why I thought my subscription offering would work. The last of these was entitled <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/newspapers-are-dead-long-live-journalism/">Newspapers Are Dead; Long Live Journalism</a>, where I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Remember how the New York Times was started as&nbsp;<a href="http://archive.org/stream/historyofnewyork00davi/historyofnewyork00davi_djvu.txt">a means of making money</a>? After the first year the paper had a circulation of 26,000 in a city of over half a million, but had incurred up-front capital costs of $50,000, and first-year expenses of $78,000 (In 1851 dollars; the modern equivalent would be $1.4 million and $2.2 million respectively). Compare that to this blog (which, by happy coincidence, turns&nbsp;<a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/welcome-to-stratechery/">one year old</a>&nbsp;tomorrow, making this comparison timely):&nbsp;<a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/fivethirtyeight-end-average/">FiveThirtyEight and the End of Average</a>, the first article in this series, has been read by over 30,000 people; meanwhile, I’ve spent less than $2,000. More readers, way less money.</p>
<p>  You may consider the comparison unfair — an entire newsroom putting out a daily edition as compared to a solo blogger posting one Article — but&nbsp;<em>the unfairness is the point</em>. No one shared my article because it was from Stratechery, but then again, no one shares an article today just because it’s from the New York Times; all that matters is the individual article and its worth to the reader and potential sharer. As a writer,&nbsp;<em>this is amazing.</em>&nbsp;When it comes to reader attention, I am competing on an equal footing with The New York Freaking Times! Unfortunately for The New York Times, when it comes to making money they’re competing with Google and Facebook. Most distressingly, though, when it comes to costs, they’re competing with the last 150 years. Everything from printing presses to sales and marketing is deadweight if advertising is not a sustainable model.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The New York Times has, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/the-new-york-times-ai-opportunity/">to its immense credit</a>, figured out how to go direct to readers; most other newspapers have <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/the-local-news-business-model/">struggled</a>: cost structures that were predicated on owning printing presses and delivery trucks simply don’t make sense in a world where <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/economic-power-age-abundance/">distribution is free</a>.</p>
<p>Free distribution, meanwhile, made Stratechery possible: I just needed to write compelling content on my own website. Brownlee, meanwhile, got his free distribution from YouTube (and, to the extent you want to complain about his accurate but attention-grabbing headline, the realities of the YouTube algorithm, the one non-viewer incentive Brownlee needs to respond to, looms large). The key point is that he could do everything else on his own, starting with the webcam on his HP Pavilion laptop that he used to record <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gk_rl3y_SU">his first video</a>:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9gk_rl3y_SU?si=hlgLhuPF1LAqLXUw&amp;controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Today Brownlee has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz_qFyTrS8w">top-of-the-line studio</a> and a staff, but the fundamental principle remains: in media one person can do it all, and build a thriving business that makes everyone from Humane to Apple care deeply about what he or she has to say — far more than they care about any traditional publication.</p>
<h3>AI and Intelligence</h3>
<p>I mentioned at the beginning that last year I wrote about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/chatgpt-learns-computing/">ChatGPT Gets a Computer</a> in lieu of an anniversary post; that Article, which was built around OpenAI’s announcement of (now-discontinued) ChatGPT plugins, was about the nature of the brain and how large learning models did or did not compare.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Computers are deterministic: if circuit X is open, then the proposition represented by X is true; 1 plus 1 is always 2; clicking “back” on your browser will exit this page. There are, of course, a huge number of abstractions and massive amounts of logic between an individual transistor and any action we might take with a computer — and an effectively infinite number of places for bugs — but the appropriate mental model for a computer is that they do exactly what they are told (indeed, a bug is not the computer making a mistake, but rather a manifestation of the programmer telling the computer to do the wrong thing).</p>
<p>  I’ve already mentioned Bing Chat and ChatGPT; on March 14 Anthropic released another AI assistant named Claude: while the announcement doesn’t say so explicitly, I assume the name is in honor of the aforementioned Claude Shannon. This is certainly a noble sentiment — Shannon’s contributions to information theory broadly extend far beyond what Dixon laid out above — but it also feels misplaced: while technically speaking everything an AI assistant is doing is ultimately composed of 1s and 0s, the manner in which they operate is emergent from their training, not proscribed, which leads to the experience feeling fundamentally different from logical computers — something nearly human — which takes us back to hallucinations; Sydney was interesting, but what about homework?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I added in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/chatgpt-enterprise-connectors-and-small-businesses-nvidia-competitors/">an August Update</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The point of that Article was that ChatGPT’s plugin architecture gave hallucinating creative LLMs access to determinative computers to ascertain truth, not dissimilar to the way a creative being like you or I might use a calculator to solve a math problem. In other words, the LLM is the interface to the source of truth, not the source of truth itself.</p>
<p>  That is exactly what this “coming soon” feature is all about: you don’t make an LLM useful for your business by adding your business’s data to the LLM; that is simply a bit more text in a sea of it. Rather, you leverage the LLM as an interface to “computers” that deterministically give you the right answer. In this case, those computers will be “connecting the applications you already have”, which sounds to me an awful lot like enterprise-specific plug-ins.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The specifics of product implementations are not the point, but rather the distinction between a natural language interface based on probabilities and computers based on deterministic calculations; I think using the former to access the latter will remain one of the most important applications of large language models.</p>
<p>There is, though, one more piece: who actually tells the AI what to do, such that it needs access to a computer of its own? In <em>ChatGPT Gets a Computer</em>, which analogized large language models to Jeff Hawkin’s theory of the brain, I expressed hope that the beliefs he expressed about the nature of intelligence in <a href="https://www.numenta.com/resources/books/a-thousand-brains-by-jeff-hawkins/">A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence</a> extended to large language models. Hawkins writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Intelligence is the ability of a system to learn a model of the world. However, the resulting model by itself is valueless, emotionless, and has no goals. Goals and values are provided by whatever system is using the model. It’s similar to how the explorers of the sixteenth through the twentieth centuries worked to create an accurate map of Earth. A ruthless military general might use the map to plan the best way to surround and murder an opposing army. A trader could use the exact same map to peacefully exchange goods. The map itself does not dictate these uses, nor does it impart any value to how it is used. It is just a map, neither murderous nor peaceful. Of course, maps vary in detail and in what they cover. Therefore, some maps might be better for war and others better for trade. But the desire to wage war or trade comes from the person using the map.</p>
<p>  Similarly, the neocortex learns a model of the world, which by itself has no goals or values. The emotions that direct our behaviors are determined by the old brain. If one human’s old brain is aggressive, then it will use the model in the neocortex to better execute aggressive behavior. If another person’s old brain is benevolent, then it will use the model in the neocortex to better achieve its benevolent goals. As with maps, one person’s model of the world might be better suited for a particular set of aims, but the neocortex does not create the goals.
</p></blockquote>
<p>To the extent this is an analogy to AI, large language models are intelligent, but they do not have goals or values or drive. They are tools to be used by, well, anyone who is willing and able to take the initiative to use them.</p>
<h3>AI and the Sovereign Individual</h3>
<p>I don’t think either Brownlee or I particularly need AI, or, to put it another way, are overly threatened by it. Yes, ChatGPT would have written several thousands words far more quickly than the hours it took me to write this Article, but I am (perhaps foolishly) confident that they would not be original and valuable enough to take away my audience; I think it’s the same for Brownlee.</p>
<p>The connection between us and AI, though, is precisely the fact that we haven’t needed it: the nature of media is such that we could already create text and video on our own, and take advantage of the Internet to — at least in the case of Brownlee — deliver finishing blows to $230 million startups.</p>
<p>How many industries, though, are not media, in that they still need a team to implement the vision of one person? How many apps or services are there that haven’t been built, not because one person can’t imagine them or create them in their mind, but because they haven’t had the resources or team or coordination capabilities to actually ship them?</p>
<p>This gets at the vector through which AI impacts the world above and beyond cost savings in customer support, or whatever other obvious low-hanging fruit there may be: as the ability of large language models to understand and execute complex commands — with deterministic computing as needed — increases, so too does the potential power of the sovereign individual telling AI what to do. The Internet removed the necessity — and inherent defensibility — of complex cost structures for media; AI has the potential to do the same for a far greater host of industries.</p>
<hr>
<p>Brownlee’s 2nd most popular video is only two months old: it’s his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak">overview of the Apple Vision Pro</a>; it’s not, if fiction is our guide, an accident that Meta is developing the Quest and Apple has released the Vision Pro just as AI seems poised to threaten an ever-increasing number of jobs. This was the world painted by Pixar’s Wall-E:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/walle"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-2.png?resize=640%2C268&amp;ssl=1" alt="Humans in Pixar's Wall-E" width="640" height="268" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-2.png?resize=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-2.png?resize=1024%2C428&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-2.png?resize=768%2C321&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-2.png?resize=1200%2C502&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>It’s funny, because before I looked up this photo, I could have sworn the humans in the film, lulled to insouciance by an AI that addressed all of their physical needs, were wearing headsets; I guess Pixar overestimated our ability to build space-faring cruise ships and underestimated the relentless progression of consumer electronics.</p>
<p>My suspicion, however, is that Pixar got it wrong, and this famous photo of Mark Zuckerberg at Mobile World Congress in 2016 is closer to the truth of the matter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10102665120179591&amp;set=pcb.10102665126861201"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-1.png?resize=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1" alt="Mark Zuckerberg at Mobile World Congress" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-1.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-1.png?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-1.png?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mkbhd-1.png?resize=946%2C630&amp;ssl=1 946w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Wall-E erred by assuming that every human was the same, all gleefully enslaved by AUTO, the ships AI. In fact, though, I suspect humanity will be distributed bi-modally, with the vast majority of people happily wearing their Vision Pros or watching their streaming service or viewing their TikTok videos, while increasingly sovereign individuals, aided by AI, pilot the ship.</p>
<p>That may sound extreme, but again, this is why it is useful to look to media first: Brownlee — one man, who started out by reviewing a media center remote on his HP laptop — does in fact hold the fate of entire companies and products in his hand. My bet is not that AI replaces Brownlee, but that AI means Brownlee’s for everything, not just media.</p>
<p>As for me, I plan on documenting it every step of the way, thanks to every person who has supported Stratechery over the last 10 years, and to whom I alone owe accountability, and gratitude.</p>

        <p>Every so often, somebody rediscovers my story of <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050824-11/?p=34463"> buying an entire Egghead Software store</a>. One question that comes up is the issue of taxes. (You can never avoid taxes. Taxes are due today for most people in the United States.)</p>
<p>If the employees were allowed to keep the software provided they tested the program and filed bugs against it, did that count as work compensation that became taxable income?</p>
<p>The thing is, nobody ever checked whether you tested the program you took, and it was obvious to everybody participating in the activity, seeing as you just picked up the software and walked out of the room without filling out any paperwork. You were assumed to be a well-meaning member of the team who wouldn’t show up for an activity without any intention of doing it. The expectation that you test the program was just that: An expectation. It wasn’t a condition.</p>
<p>My understanding is that this makes the software count as a gift that falls under the <i>de minimis</i> rule of the United States tax code. This was a one-time thing, so the frequency criterion is met. The value of the software was well under $100, so that requirement was met. And since nobody actually kept track of who took which software, the administrative impracticality requirement was also satisfied.</p>
<p>But really, this was just a development manager taking it upon himself to do some unconventional application compatibility test coverage and to instill camaraderie at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: During one of the many iterations of this story being retold, someone remarked that they got a copy of the video game <i>Wing Commander III</i> through this exercise. I immediately remembered that they fulfilled their expectation by filing a bug against Windows 95: When you earned the cloaking device on level 58 or something, you couldn’t activate it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they provided a save-game at level 58, so I didn’t have to play all the way to level 58 by myself.</p>
<p>The problem was that the hotkey for activating the cloaking device was <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, and that conflicted with the use of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to cancel an active clipboard paste operation into an MS-DOS session. Normally, Windows 95 realized that there was no active paste active and replayed the hotkey into the MS-DOS session. However, the replay of the hotkey was apparently too fast for this game to recognize, so it never activated the cloaking device.</p>
<p>I fixed it by changing Windows 95 so that it installed the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> hotkey handler only when a clipboard paste operation was active, and removed it when the paste operation completed. That way, when you hit it outside of a paste operation, the keys were visible to the game at human speeds, and this allowed it to engage the cloaking device.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.maggieslepian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maggie Slepian</a> | Longreads | April 2, 2024 | 5,423 words</em></p>



<p>Spring in Montana is a season of waiting, trapped in a limbo of rotten snow and inaccessible trails. It makes me feel desperate: a rare warm day followed by another sleet storm, the high-octane days of summer still impossibly far away.</p>



<p>In May 2019, I was crawling out of my skin. The high-elevation north-facing trails were still sheets of ice and the south-facing trails were shoe-sucking mud. I was so sick of my gym routine that I’d sit in the parking lot for 20 minutes, willing myself to go inside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’d moved to Montana from the northeast nearly a decade before, drawn to lofty mountains to reinvent my tame life in suburban New Hampshire. I immediately began compiling a résumé of outdoor activities: I learned to mountain bike, became a strong climber, checked peaks off my list, and worked as a horseback guide. Backcountry recreation was the social currency and my value hinged on accepting every invitation, so I did my best to learn everything.</p>



<p>But no matter how many skills I picked up, my struggles with asthma meant I often fell behind. I was the last one to the top of the switchbacks, watching my lean, muscled friends vanish over the ridge as I sucked air through a windpipe that felt like a crumpled straw.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I made up for those cardio challenges with an uncanny ability to reject fear. I volunteered to go first on intimidating climbing routes, humming to stay calm as I gripped miniscule edges and pressed my feet against glassy slabs of rock. I fell often, once catching my leg behind the rope and flipping upside down, my head ringing as I smashed into the wall. My belayer called up in a panic and offered to lower me, but I was already pulling myself up the rope before I’d stopped swinging. My self-worth banked on being the most fearless, camping in winter storms, grabbing the reins of the horse who had thrown me, pulling pebbles out of my knees and joking about how hard I’d hit the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>That frenetic activity level of summer and winter made spring’s dullness harder to bear. I craved movement in the backcountry and the social life that came with it. Kadin texted me one of those afternoons when I was flopping around the climbing gym mats delaying my workout. He was a climbing partner, decently good friend, river guide, and enough of an enigma that I wasn’t sure whether I had a crush or he just had enough mystique to seem appealing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He asked if I had a kayak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I responded right away. <em>Yeah, an old river runner. You looking to get out this week?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>My kayak was a 15-year-old Wave Sport Frankenstein I’d picked up at a pawn shop the year before. I’d spent that summer paddling the reservoir south of town, occasionally running a calm section of the Madison River. The boat was narrow and prone to tipping. I planned to take a roll clinic the following summer, as I was determined to gain aptitude in yet another outdoor sport—just enough to feel confident on beginner whitewater.</p>



<p>The section of the Gallatin River that Kadin wanted to run was near my house, easily accessible and less intimidating than anything in the canyon. Despite being an open section of water, it was still technically early-season conditions, ice cold and scattered with hazardous deadfall. I accepted the invitation immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Despite being an open section of water, it was still technically early-season conditions, ice cold and scattered with hazardous deadfall. I accepted the invitation immediately.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>I didn’t consider whether or not I was comfortable paddling that stretch. Along with the desire to keep up with my peers, my ability to assess risk was skewed after years of narrow backcountry escapes, a well-documented phenomenon where your risk perception shifts after successfully navigating unpredictable situations. From outrunning lightning storms to losing the trail to tackling climbs well above my grade, I’d encountered plenty of tenuous scenarios and always figured it out, scraping by without too much damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="http://simonpriest.altervista.org/DOWNLOADS/ChangesPerceivedRCADVENTURE.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adventure Experience Paradigm</a> describes this well; it uses a simple line graphic to show the interplay of risk and competence. When the risk is low and the skills are high, the person is toward the bottom of the chart in the “realm of exploration and experimentation.” When competence and risk are balanced, the participant is in the middle, and when risk exceeds competence, the outcome can be catastrophic. The more experience someone has with navigating risky situations, the more confident they become, skewing the variables. My boating experience was minimal and that section of river was not for beginners, but I had scraped by enough times that my risk assessment was dangerously off-kilter. It was a really, really bad combination.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>My boating experience was minimal and that section of river was not for beginners, but I had scraped by enough times that my risk assessment was dangerously off-kilter. It was a really, really bad combination.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>None of this was on my mind a few days later as I grabbed my kayaking gloves and neoprene booties and dragged my boat out of the garage. I raked a finger through the cobwebs stretching across the seat as Kadin’s truck rumbled into my driveway. We crammed both boats in the bed of my truck, shuttled his truck to the takeout, and I drove us back to the start.</p>



<p>The wind was brisk as we unloaded the boats, whipping my hair against my face and pushing puffy white clouds across the sky. I inched down the embankment toward the blown-out river, swollen from snowmelt and moving faster than I thought. Icy water splashed my toes and I slipped in the slick mud.</p>



<p>“I’m glad I brought the booties,” I shouted over the water. Kadin gave me a thumbs up and tossed his spare spray skirt in my direction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The river at this time would have been around 40 degrees, frigid with snowmelt and choked with trees and other obstacles lodged in the current. These lodged obstacles, called “strainers,” make normally moderate sections extremely dangerous, allowing water through but not a boat. Getting pinned underwater against a wall of debris is just one of the ways you can die on a river. It didn’t occur to me to be scared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To a casual observer, the fact that I owned a boat and a few kayaking accessories gave the appearance I knew what I was doing. But technical boating is a far cry from my mellow paddling experience. I lacked the reflexes and skills to navigate faster water, plus my boat was outdated and difficult to stabilize. But the excitement of finally getting outside, the relative rarity of an invitation from Kadin, plus my other narrow escapes pushed out any seed of doubt. I lowered myself into my kayak.</p>



<p>Kadin’s spare spray skirt barely fit over the cockpit and I couldn’t get enough leverage to secure it. He crouched over my boat, wrestling with the neoprene until it strained across the opening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Can you pull that off if you have to?” He secured his own spray skirt and pushed himself toward the water.</p>



<p>“I don’t know,” I answered honestly. “It’s kind of tight.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He paused. “Do you want to practice?”</p>



<p>His hesitancy annoyed me.</p>



<p>I knew I should make sure I could release it, but my brain raced through two scenarios: if I couldn’t pull the spray skirt, it would be clear we shouldn’t run this section—I’d be trapped underwater if I flipped my boat and couldn’t roll. But if I pulled it on shore and couldn’t put it back on, Kadin would have to help me again and I’d look silly and inexperienced. I shook my head and dug my paddle into the embankment.</p>



<p>“It’s fine, let’s go. I’m not going to flip my boat.”</p>



<p>My boat wasn’t cooperating the instant I dropped into the river. The water was too fast and&nbsp;unpredictable. Every time I tried to adjust course, I was buffeted by the current. I scolded myself to paddle like I knew how, but this wasn’t the type of kayaking I was used to—my reflexes were slow and instincts incorrect. My boat’s slim bow dipped and rose, and I flexed my legs against the thigh braces in an attempt to stabilize. An icy splash of water streamed down my jacket. I knew I shouldn’t be on the water.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>I knew I shouldn’t be on the water.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>I was desperate to be off the river but I also wasn’t in control. That realization turned into panic as I was catapulted forward in the current, glancing sidelong at the bank rushing by and knowing I didn’t have the skills to eddy out. Too much was happening too quickly. The spray skirt felt like a vise around my waist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A wave hit me in the face and I gasped, swiping a hand across my eyes as I heard Kadin yell behind me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Stay to the left! Maggie, the left!” he shouted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I turned to hear him better, and when I looked forward I had dropped into a trough and the current swept me to the right.</p>



<p>I blinked to clear water from my eyes and saw why Kadin had yelled to stay left. I was heading right toward a massive strainer, topped by a downed tree at head height. It was as thick as my torso, the gnarled root ball creating a dam for a jagged pile of broken logs.</p>



<p>I threw my arm out and collided with the tree with a sickening whack. Before I could take a breath, my boat flipped and I was underwater.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Oh no, </em>I thought. <em>I am in so much trouble.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>It was silent underwater, yellowish-green and brighter than I would have thought. Fist-sized rocks bouncing next to my head were the only indication of how fast I was moving.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>You’re moving, which means you’re not pinned against the strainer. Get air. You have to roll.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I’d never practiced rolling a kayak—the roll clinic was still on my long list of goals—but I knew to snap my hips into the side of the boat and leverage with the paddle. My boat was built to roll, but I had no muscle memory to draw from to actually execute the move. I also had no paddle—it had been ripped from my hands when I hit the tree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I threw my hips into the side of my boat. It rocked a few inches, then settled back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I fought panic. <em>Try again</em>, <em>you need to get air.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I threw my hips harder into the side of the boat. Nothing. The effort took energy and energy took oxygen. A countdown started in my head. I only had a few minutes to get out of the boat. How long had I been underwater?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Wet exit</em>. <em>Pull the spray skirt.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I frantically felt for the grab loop, but I was upside down and disoriented. When I found it after wasting more precious seconds, I leaned back and pulled as hard as I could. It didn’t budge. More seconds went by. My heart started thudding more rapidly and I felt that familiar aching burn when you stay underwater too long.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A thought came into my head, momentarily paralyzing me: <em>these might be your last few minutes</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My clumsy gloved hands scrabbled uselessly at the edges of the neoprene trapping me in the boat. As I realized I couldn’t release the spray skirt that way either, panic, regret, and sorrow flooded my brain.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>As I realized I couldn’t release the spray skirt that way either, panic, regret, and sorrow flooded my brain.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p><em>Please no. Please don’t let it end like this.</em></p>



<p>This is where my brain split into two tracks running at the same time: a sadness track and an action track.</p>



<p>The sadness track focused on my family. My parents and three younger siblings all still lived in the Northeast. They supported me but didn’t understand my drive to keep pushing, and they continuously begged me to be careful. I thought about my mother, wracked with nerves whenever I’d casually recount another close call. I thought about my dad. His cancer had just relapsed; my family was already suffering. My drowning would destroy them.</p>



<p><em>I’m sorry.</em> <em>I’m so sorry for my family, I made a mistake and I wish I hadn’t come here and I’m sorry.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The action track said: <em>keep trying until it’s over.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I smashed my hip into the side of my boat again, and this time I rocked it enough to hear the roar of the water and feel air on one side of my face. I sucked in a half-breath, half-mouthful-of-water before rolling under again, buying myself incrementally more time. I wondered if Kadin had seen me roll, if he knew what was happening.</p>



<p>My heart sped up even more and I felt a new sensation in my chest: a dark hole with a deep burn around the edges. Still being pulled downriver, I watched my hourglass run out as I tried one last time to roll, but I was too tired and barely moved the boat.</p>



<p>I knew then that I didn’t want my last few minutes to be full of sadness and regret. If I wasn’t going to survive this, I didn’t want my final thoughts to be berating myself for a bad choice.</p>



<p><em>It’s OK, </em>I thought<em>. You didn’t mean for this to happen. You are going to die and you should just be grateful for the time you had.</em></p>



<p>The heavy, black ache in my chest fully replaced the burn. I forced myself to keep my eyes open and watch the sunbeams like I’d seen a thousand times before, when I’d been underwater by choice and could come up for air when I wanted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My vision spotted and wavered. I thought about my family one more time, trying to send a message through the river and into the air I couldn’t reach: <em>I’m so sorry, I love you, I didn’t mean to hurt you.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I read somewhere that we’re all unreliable narrators, even for our own stories. It’s impossible to remember fully accurate details and our brain fills the gaps where our memories fail.</p>

<p>This means I can’t tell you what order in which things happened: whether I felt Kadin collide with my boat or whether I was still unconscious when he dragged me to the surface. I just know I opened my eyes to the blue sky studded with clouds I thought I’d never see again, and that I felt the spring air whipping against my face. He told me I made a noise, a choking moan that sounded like a dying animal. He thought: <em>she still might not make it</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things came into focus one at a time: Kadin’s arm across my chest, the bruising strike of his legs as he lifeguard-dragged me to an eddy, my head propped out of the water on his shoulder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once I fully came to, I thrashed away from him, swimming an adrenaline-fueled freestyle to the bank and digging my hands into the mud to pull myself out. I collapsed in a heap, threw up river water, tried to stand, fell down. Kadin leaned over me and pressed my shoulders down, his eyes darting over my face, his own hollow with fear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m OK, I’m fine.” My voice sounded like it was run through a grater. Once I started shivering, I couldn’t stop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Mags, I thought you were a goner.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What happened,” I asked, “how did you get to me?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He told it like this: he saw me collide with the strainer and flip my boat. He paddled after me as fast as possible, watching my upside-down kayak, waiting for me to roll. He kept a countdown in his head, and when I didn’t surface, he beached his boat on a sandbar, ripped off his spray skirt, and dove into the current, swimming as hard as he could until he reached me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He grabbed my boat as it flew downriver with my unconscious body dangling underneath. He tried to roll me, but my dead weight made it impossible, so he hung on the rounded hull until he found the grab loop to release the spray skirt and rip me out upside down.</p>



<p>I didn’t know how long I was underwater. You can suffer irreversible brain damage after five minutes without oxygen, but my half-breath had bought me more time. If Kadin hadn’t seen me flip, missed my boat in the current, or taken another minute to reach me, it would have been over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We staggered along a dirt road, cut through a field, then followed another road to where we’d dropped his truck. We didn’t talk.</p>



<p>“Do you need me to go home with you?” he asked when we got back to my truck. His hands trembled on the steering wheel. We were both freezing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, go home. I’m fine,” I said. I was always fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It took three tries to get the key into the ignition. The sound of the engine made me jump.</p>



<p>Foot on brake. Reverse. Drive. Gas. My leg trembled so hard on the pedal the truck shuddered.</p>



<p>I drove home with both hands on the wheel; I left my drenched clothes in a heap in the entryway. I turned the shower on, but the sound of the water sent shock waves through my body and I slapped the knob back off. Reeking of river water, I crawled into bed and willed the shaking to stop.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>The next few days passed in a blur. I emptied the trash, checked the mail. Fed my cat in the morning and evening, responded to the most basic work emails. Dazedly coordinated an upcoming potluck dinner that I didn’t think to cancel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I told friends what happened, I called it “the kayak accident” and kept it flippant. I told them that yes I’d nearly drowned, but no they shouldn’t worry, care, or ask about it. When they did worry, care, and ask about it, I snapped like a cornered dog. <em>No questions. I said I didn’t want to talk about it.</em></p>



<p>I maintained this barbed facade, but inside I was coming apart. I woke up each night gasping for air. Sometimes my face was buried in my pillow and sometimes I’d been holding my breath. <em>How</em> <em>do our bodies know to keep breathing? </em>I wondered. <em>Is it safe to fall asleep?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Bruises blossomed from my thighs to my shins. My hips ached from slamming into the boat, and I was so tired I had to hold onto the wall walking upstairs. When I showered, I huddled terrified against the wall, trying to wash my hair without the water hitting my face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I hosted the dinner party a week later. To cancel would have meant I was exhausted and scared, and if I was exhausted and scared, I was weak. If I was weak, I was worthless. So instead of calling Kadin and telling him I wasn’t OK, or asking him if he also wasn’t OK, or talking to my family, or writing in a journal, I opened my front door to a dozen friends and drifted through the warm noise of music and conversation. <em>Where are the serving bowls? Do you want me to put this in the oven? Does Maggie have an ice maker?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Halfway through the night I grabbed a bowl of food scraps to toss in the compost. The din dulled to near-silence as I stepped into my backyard and pulled the slider shut. Loud to quiet. Above water to under water. OK to not OK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like dripping wax, the patio and window glow melted together, and a muted thrumming pounded in my ears. I slid down the side of my house as pinpricks spotted my vision and my breathing went ragged and gasping. It was my first panic attack from the accident, but it wouldn’t be my last.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>&nbsp;It was my first panic attack from the accident, but it wouldn’t be my last.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It got worse after that. I was haunted by a newfound fear of consequences, made worse by a desperation to maintain my fearlessness, the basis of my self-worth. I still went outside, but I was terrified. A creak overhead meant a branch was about to crush me, clouds gathering over a distant peak meant a lightning strike. I camped at an alpine lake and lie awake in my tent, picturing yellow eyes watching from the trees. I never got back in my kayak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More distressing than this new timidness were the dissociative episodes that started shortly after the accident. Multiple times each day I would find myself drifting out of reality, wondering how everyone was coping after my death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My final thought before losing consciousness had been accepting my own death, and part of my brain still existed in the space where I never woke up. I’d stare at my hands in yoga, splayed like pale starfish on the mat, and wonder what flowers my mom had chosen for my memorial. A stab of anguish as I walked to the mailbox: had my little cat been brought back to the animal shelter, or had one of my friends taken him in? Then I’d blink and be back in yoga class or standing in front of my mailbox with the key held limply in my hand.</p>



<p>These flashes of dissociation became more frequent. I had to remind myself every day that I hadn’t died—I still lived in my house with the flowering perennial bed and mismatched thrift-store furniture. My family hadn’t gathered in Montana to sort out the accumulation of debris that made up my life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seemed too dramatic to call it PTSD. Was I so fragile that a few minutes underwater had such an impact?&nbsp; I didn’t even know if the accident could be classified as a near-death experience. I hadn’t seen the light at the end of a tunnel or felt myself leaving my body. I hadn’t even needed to be resuscitated—hypoxia caused me to plummet into unconsciousness, but as soon as I reoxygenated, my body started to function and I could breathe on my own. I felt weak and fragile, unable to quantify what was happening and too ashamed to confront the poor decisions that led me there.</p>



<p>Despite my denial, what was happening to my brain <em>was</em> a form of dissociation from the traumatic event, and a noted element of PTSD. People who have come close to death report more dissociative responses than other trauma survivors, and while the episodes typically do eventually fade, the more I tried to pretend I was OK, the longer they would last.</p>



<hr>



<p>It took weeks to tell my family what had happened, and I did it in a rush through the crackly Bluetooth connection on my way to the grocery store.</p>



<p>“I had a close call kayaking a few weeks ago,” I told my mom, rattling through the bullet points before she could interject. <em>Hit a downed log, flipped my boat, trapped underwater, my friend got to me in time, it was fine.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>She responded, slowly, but I wasn’t listening. The words I wanted to say felt lodged in my throat, and I ran them through my head like dialogue with the mic cut off.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<em>I don’t kno</em><em>w if I’m dead or alive. Every night I wake up feeling like I’m suffocating and if a loud room goes quiet I have a panic attack. I’m sad and scared and I don’t know why I didn’t die or if there’s a reason I survived and why I ignored all of the risk and almost killed myself.</em></p>



<p>I didn’t say any of that, but I did surprise myself by blurting out an apology before I hung up.</p>



<p>“I’m really sorry,” I said, horrified as I got choked up. “I love you guys and I won’t do anything stupid like that again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kadin was the only one I thought I trusted to talk about it, though when he finally called me one evening a few weeks later, I still couldn’t drop my veneer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I just think . . . you know . . . you could have died, and I’m sorry,” he said. “It really scared me seeing you not come up for air, and I don’t know how to talk about it and I’m sorry I brought you out there.” I paced around in my kitchen, holding my phone at arm’s length like I could be electrocuted through the speaker.</p>



<p>I fumbled a response, still managing not to say anything honest or raw. <em>I’ll thank him later, </em>I told myself, <em>when I tell him what’s been going on in my brain. Maybe he’s going through the same thing.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>After that conversation we settled into a quiet understanding: two guarded people who had narrowly escaped a serious consequence.</p>



<hr>



<p>Once we established a different rapport, I saw a lot of Kadin. What would have thrilled me before (acceptance) was now a relief (someone who understood).&nbsp;</p>



<p>We climbed together and took long drives into the mountains. We hiked picnic food up to a remote lake, and once we recovered the kayaks from the river, I stored them both in my garage. I felt deeply connected to him, though I fought the idea since he was still the enigma that kept me chasing the end of a string, picking at the knot to see if it could be unraveled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No one else heard the noise I made as the air came back into my lungs. No one else had beached their boat and swam toward me as alpine runoff deadened their limbs. No one else kept their eyes on my upside-down boat and no one else risked the current and strainers to drag an unconscious girl out of a kayak. If he’d waited another few beats, missed the sandbar, not connected with my boat as the current carried him past, I would have died.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You two have some sort of weird bond,” my friend muttered as I slide-tackled Kadin on the gym mats one day that fall.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I mean, he saved my life.” At that point, she knew to nod and not ask me to elaborate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He was still Kadin, though, trauma bonded or not. He’d disappear for a month at a time, not return my calls, skip our planned yoga classes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My brain had reached more of an equilibrium by then. I still drifted in and out of reality, wondering who had taken over my house and which one of my friends had my cat. But I’d just smile apologetically to whoever I was with as I startled back to reality.</p>



<p>“Sorry, can you repeat that? I was spacing out.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>Fall rolled into winter and our boats hadn’t left my garage. I brushed off the cobwebs and hung them on hooks, telling myself I’d talk to Kadin in the spring and confront the accident, possibly ask if he wanted to take the roll clinic with me. I’d feel safer with him there. Maybe it would close the gap and allow me to move on.</p>



<p>In the meantime, I spent that winter trying to understand the event from a clinical perspective.</p>



<p>I replayed the accident obsessively in my head, ashamed at my choices while trying to understand where they’d come from. I blamed my personality, I blamed living in a mountain town, I blamed incorrect risk perception after too many close calls, I blamed wanting to impress Kadin. If I could create a flowchart of decisions and personality traits that led me to the river that day, I would guarantee that it never happened again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I knew my reduced risk inhibition came from too many narrow escapes, and having a more experienced partner had created an “expert halo” that tipped the adventure-experience scale to a dangerous imbalance. At the same time, I hadn’t been looking to push my limits like the sensation-seeking personalities I kept reading about, people who needed big thrills to feel things. Those people often have lower trait anxiety, which means they feel less anxious in day-to-day life. While I loved being outside and did seek certain types of adventure, I have always had high anxiety and didn’t <em>enjoy</em> the feeling of fear. I’d just learned to ignore it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually I talked to Jerry Johnson, a professor in town who researches backcountry risk assessment. Nothing about my story seemed to surprise him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You wonder how these accidents don’t happen more frequently in towns like this, where the bar is so high,” he said. “You’re responding to social cues. How you perform in these sports contributes to your self-worth and value. You want to be able to keep up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I nodded, slowly. He was so matter-of-fact. It wasn’t what I wanted to hear, but it was the truth. I wasn’t a thrill seeker; I was someone who wanted to fit in and was scared of being left behind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The brain split was the other major element I wanted to untangle. The dissociative episodes were still part of my life on a near-daily basis, but that winter, no one I spoke to had any idea what I was talking about.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry,” a counselor said over the phone. “I’ve never heard of anything like that.”</p>



<p>Eventually, long after my initial outreach, I heard back from another counselor I reached out to. Not for therapy, but for more information about this split. Parker Schneider specializes in acute and complex trauma, and has a background in adventure-based programming. They offered precise, pertinent feedback about what I was describing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Near-death experiences are almost always traumatic and can be incredibly profound,” Schneider said. “[They leave] the nervous system grappling with processing the intense emotions and sensations involved in the experience.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schneider seemed familiar with what I had been experiencing, and told me that dissociation can be a way for someone to get through during the near-death experience (NDE), as well as a way to cope afterward while the brain works to integrate the experience.</p>



<p>“After an NDE, dissociation might manifest as the mind alternating between different perceptions of reality,” Schneider told me. “This could involve oscillating between a reality in which an individual survived the event and one in which they died.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between this measured explanation of my lapses in reality, and Johnson’s quiet understanding of my need to keep up, I felt more tethered to reality. I also felt like I could begin to forgive myself.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>It was January, eight months after the accident, and Kadin had bailed on another yoga class. I was bristling, tired of his flakiness and though I didn’t want to admit it, stung by the perceived rejection.</p>



<p>I had just gotten home when a mutual friend called.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Mags, you’re going to want to go to the hospital. It’s Kadin. I thought you’d want to know.”</p>



<p>I wasn’t part of Kadin’s primary friend group, so I wasn’t included in the communications from the past few days. The only thing I knew was that he was in the hospital and he wasn’t going to make it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I drove across town in a hysterical frenzy, racing through wing after wing until I found the right room. I grabbed his hand in the hospital bed, dissolving into despair and guilt. He was in front of me—his curly sandy-colored hair and climbers’ forearms and calf tattoo—but inaccessible. I sobbed and thanked him and apologized for not saying it enough. I said everything I’d wanted to say since May but it was too late, he couldn’t hear me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I pictured him swimming the current to my boat, releasing the spray skirt and grabbing me under the arms to pull me out, the countdown clock also running through his head. <em>How long has she been underwater?</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I had been inches from him, unconscious in my boat in that liminal space between life and death. And now, here he was in front of me, in between but already gone. There was no current to swim and I couldn’t pull him out of a boat and bring him to the surface. My time stretches into the future but his is over.</p>



<p>This is what he knew: he knew he saved me from drowning, that I cared about him, that we were trauma bonded and that maybe I loved him for saving me. But I was too mired in regret and terror to tell him that when I woke up suffocating in my sleep, then realized I could breathe, the panic gave way to gratitude for being alive.</p>



<p>I am sorry for my choices and grateful for my second chances. I’ve never gone back on that river and I’ve never truly untangled the web of decisions that made me agree to go boating that day. Maybe someday I’ll be able to face it. Until then, I accept that fear helps protect me and I appreciate every day for being one I didn’t think I’d have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s been five years. Both of our boats still hang from hooks in my garage. Every few months I clear off the cobwebs.&nbsp;</p>

  <p><time datetime="2024-04-16T19:21:08-0400">Tuesday April 16, 2024</time> <span>[<a href="https://jerry.wtf/tags/blog">blog</a>]</span></p>
  <p><img src="https://jerry.wtf/img/potions.jpg" alt="Potions"></p>
<p>I find that when I play RPG games, I often hoard single-use items like potions and scrolls, saving them for some future critical moment. I finish games like Skyrim with a backpack full of unspent resources, reserved for a crisis that never actually arrives. What’s the point, then, of all these items?</p>
<p>Just like I save items in games, in real life I too am reluctant to ask for favors or promote my own projects. (Sometimes I even save all my favourite treats and I never eat the last one). I treated these social and professional resources as if they were single-use “magical items”, not to be wasted but reserved for some important-yet-undefined future magnum opus event.</p>
<p>Recently I played Baldur’s Gate 3 and I decided to try something new: I would actually <em>gasp</em> use my items as needed, as they were intended, without undue reservation. Not only was it actually <em>fun</em> to use my fireball scrolls and blow stuff up, but I also discovered new layers and hidden quests. For instance, using a ‘Speak with the Dead’ scroll on a certain suspicious corpse unveiled a questline I would have otherwise missed.</p>
<p>With the same mindset, I’ve been trying to adjust in my personal and professional life.</p>
<p>To my surprise, these actions didn’t exhaust my social or professional capital; instead, they allowed me to derive benefits and opened new avenues, much like in the game. A friend forwarded my resume within their network, and my posts connected me with others who shared my interests.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s far more important in life that you use the resources available to you, because you’re on a clock. You need to optimize for your gains wherever you can take them, before you or your resources expire.</p>
<p>And remember, people in your life actually want to help you. They also stand to benefit, and any sort of social capital isn’t necessarily “single-use”, more like “on a cooldown”, able to be requested again after a suitable delay or returning a favor.</p>
<p>Resources, whether in games or in life, are meant to be utilized. Hoarding them out of fear of depletion prevents us from discovering new opportunities and connections. That’s a scarcity mindset that we don’t need to employ. Life thrives not on conservation but on strategic and bold usage of what we do have.</p>
<p>We should not view our capabilities and opportunities as limited-use potions to be saved for the perfect moment. Instead, we should see them as tools (sometimes with a cooldown) and aptly use them to unblock ourselves and move ahead whenever possible, in the very short time that we have on Earth.</p>
