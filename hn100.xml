<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Olympiads are international student intellectual competitions in which students from across the world go toe-to-toe answering questions in mathematics, physics, informatics, chemistry, and more. The best performers tend to be from countries like China, the United States, India, and Japan. But, somehow, the southeastern European country of Romania also frequently tops the list.</span></p>
<p><span>Since 2020, Romania’s performance in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) has been nothing short of amazing. In 2022, Romania came in fifth overall, fourth in 2023, and twelfth in 2024. In 2023, Romania placed fourth globally and first in Europe at the International Physics Olympiad, seventeenth globally and third in Europe at the International Olympiad in Informatics, sixth globally and second in Europe in the European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad, first in the Balkan Mathematical Olympiad—which also included France, Italy, and the United Kingdom—and first in the Central European Olympiad in Informatics. Romania also performed well in the International Chemistry Olympiad and many others.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s an understatement to call Romania’s skill in Olympiads merely “overperformance”. Romania’s lackluster performance in international assessments and its relatively small population size of just over 19 million people makes the things they do in Olympiads downright miraculous.</span></p>
<p><span>Average Romanian educational performance is unimpressive. Romanian youth routinely perform below the average of OECD countries and near the bottom of the pack of European nations. Romania has a poor-to-mediocre showing whether you include or exclude migrants from the calculations, and its scores on assessments like the PISA aren’t low due to being tainted by bias in the examinations. Romania genuinely underperforms. But underperformance is not the impression you would get if you only knew of Romanian education from Olympiads.</span></p>
<p><span>One possibility is that Romanian students have more variable performance on international assessments than students in other countries. No dice: </span><a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/about/programmes/pisa.html"><span>they</span></a> <a href="https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss-landing.html"><span>aren’t</span></a> <a href="https://www.iea.nl/studies/iea/pirls"><span>much</span></a><span> more variable than the student populations in other countries, and a handful of comparably-sized nations with worse Olympiad performance are more variable. Another possibility is that, for some reason, there’s a fat right tail in Romanian educational performance. If this is true, it just doesn’t show up in any existing data. Given the fact that international assessments indicate Romania’s sampling tends to be population-representative, we should have a strong prior against this possibility. Romanian test scores tend to be distributed along a symmetrical bell curve.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yet another possibility is that Romania has an undersampled ethnic group that overperforms, but whose schools aren’t tested very well. The only group this might be is Romanian Jews and using them as an explanation is problematic for two reasons. The first is that there are too few to realistically explain Romanian Olympiad performance. The second is that we know the identities of Olympiad participants from Romania, and they don’t seem to be Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span>Something else, something more mysterious, explains why Romania is such an outlier in international intellectual competitions. That thing is, in fact, the unique design of the Romanian educational system.</span></p>
<p><span>In the late 19</span><span>th</span><span> century, Romanian prince regnant Alexandru Ioan Cuza attempted to raise the status of the nation by instituting a mass literacy campaign centered around building free schools that children were compelled to attend. This effort was largely a failure, with literacy failing to break 50% by the 1930s. But World War II precipitated change. In 1948, Romania’s new governing communist party began to bring about serious educational reform at a breakneck pace.The Education Law of 1948 was passed to provoke a military-grade offensive against illiteracy, involving the mass participation of the literate from all walks of life in uplifting the poor, the abandoned, and those who simply shunned education. By the end of the 1950s, illiteracy was practically eradicated among Romania’s youth.</span></p>
<p><span>The education system that existed in Romania’s communist period was modeled on the system in place in the Soviet Union, and it included a fair helping of political propaganda in addition to physical labor. The system also overproduced schools, resulting in shoddy but widely available facilities dotting the country. Like the Soviet school system, Romania’s was marked by increasing lengths of compulsory education, poor availability of qualified teachers and educational supplies, high budgetary costs, and an extreme level of credential inflation.</span></p>
<p><span>After the fall of communism, the new democratic government went on to shutter many of these schools and to immediately lower compulsory schooling requirements to put an end to the bureaucratic nightmare that Soviet influence had saddled the country with. In the following years, how Romania wished to ration scarce governmental resources for education was a matter of intense debate, and out of that debate came a strong sentiment that, whatever the system, Romanian education would be structured competitively.</span></p>
<p><span>Nowadays, the most prestigious Romanian high schools are the National Colleges, or </span><i><span>Colegiu Național</span></i><span>. These schools are often international and frequently uphold old educational traditions sometimes dating back more than a century. Below these schools are the </span><i><span>Liceu Teoretic</span></i><span>, which are the norm, offering standard educations. Romania also has three military colleges—</span><i><span>Colegiu Militar</span></i><span>—managed directly by the Ministry of National Defense. There are also schools focused on service, technical schools, vocational schools, and apprenticeship programs. The brightest students get their pick among these schools after they take the national placement test, the </span><i><span>Evaluarea Națională, </span></i><span>when they are graduating the 8</span><span>th</span><span> grade around ages fourteen to fifteen.</span></p>
<p><span>The high school placement test is a standardized test covering Romanian language and literature as well as mathematics. Performance on the examination is reported publicly when students are issued a score on a one-to-ten scale with precision to two decimal places. A student who receives a high grade—say 9.65—would have their pick from most any school, whereas a student scoring 5.00 or below would usually be constrained to a less academically-focused form of education like a vocational program. Most students elect to go to the best school they are able to test into, and so the degree of sorting across schools is very high. To make this setup even more extreme, there is also often—but not universally—sorting </span><i><span>within</span></i><span> schools, as students select into educational tracks. This is done directly when applying to schools.</span></p>
<p><span>At the end of the Romanian high school experience, there is a graduation test, the </span><i><span>Bacalaureat</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>bac</span></i><span>. This test is marked like the entrance examination and, to pass, students must obtain a score of at least five in the subjects they have elected to take. This testing includes written and oral examinations, assessments of foreign language and computer skills, and, for ethnic minorities, assessment of their skill with their maternal language other than Romanian. The need for a given score on this examination can range from requiring just passing to requiring a high score, depending on the university one intends to attend, if that is their goal.</span></p>
<p><span>The design of Romania’s educational system makes it perhaps the most stratified educational system in the world. The fact that they have a centralized repository containing all student and teacher educational data makes their system perfect for a high-powered evaluation of exactly what happens when a country opts to hyper-stratify education.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the cruel parts of the Romanian system is that, though sorting is nationally available, students do not have equal opportunities to sort. Students located in smaller towns have fewer high school options to select from unless they’re among the few who opt into a military academy, which means joining the military. The extent of sorting is far more intense in areas with larger numbers of schools. In a </span><a href="https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/rest_a_01438/120190/School-Choice-Student-Sorting-and-Academic"><span>recent paper</span></a><span>, the Romanian economist Andrei Munteanu provided an illustration of how this works: essentially, the fewer schools in a locale, the more each individual school contains students with a wider range of ability and, the more schools in a locale, the more each individual school will be stratified into low, middle, or high ability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This combined sorting between schools and tracks means that low-ability students get stuck with other low-ability students, and high-ability students are surrounded by other high-ability students. In effect, peer groups throughout high school are extremely homogeneous. This matters because then low-performing students drag down low-performing students, and high performers cause each other to rise. Romania’s educational system has causal peer impacts on student performance on the graduation test that are very large in both directions, but primarily where there are opportunities for sorting to take place.</span></p>

<p><span>But peer effects are not everything to Romania’s exceptional Olympiad performance; they are just the fertile ground in which exceptional performance is fostered. The next part has to do with teachers. Like students, Romania’s teachers must take tests to be able to do what they want to do. Teachers naturally prefer to lecture smarter students, and the smartest teachers have their pick of the schools, and even of the tracks. In a paper with extremely robust results, researchers from the last decade </span><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.4.1289"><span>described</span></a><span> this as such:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span>[Teachers] with higher certification standards are more likely to work at better-ranked schools. This sorting persists even within schools as one moves from a weaker to a stronger track, and even within tracks as one moves from a weaker to a stronger class.</span></i></p></blockquote>
<p><span>The best teachers also opt into towns with more schools. It’s apparent, then, that teachers prefer teaching in the highest-achieving places they can be, both within and between towns. The effect of teacher-student ability pairing is accentuated even more by incentives to compete. The government of Romania is not unique in providing monetary rewards for those who win Olympiads, those who teach winners of Olympiads, or those schools Olympiad winners attend, but they are unique in having all the previously-mentioned institutional characteristics </span><a href="https://archive.md/ki6Do"><span>on top of</span></a><span> providing comprehensive monetary incentives for Olympiad achievement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Romania’s immense success in Olympiads and the widely recognized importance of Olympiad wins for signaling student human capital has also spawned a small number of private schools that advertise their prominence and tutoring capabilities. Many teachers also recommend to parents that they obtain additional tutoring for their brighter pupils, and tutoring services are commonplace. The commonality of tutoring for Olympiad winners is a global constant, whereas the things distinguishing Romania are not.</span></p>
<p><span>Two notable factors do not increase performance in the same direction. These are very slight decrements in funding allocated to the highest-ability schools, and when parents reduce the time they spend helping their students with homework, conditional on their kids matching into better schools. Another potential factor that militates against the synchrony of resource allocation in Romania is that children in more selective schools report feeling marginalized because they realize that they’re not as strong of students as they believed. The decrements in funding are likely to be unproblematic, because higher-scoring schools tend to be larger and more urban, lending them economies of scale. Due to this, they may have effectively more funding.</span></p>
<p><span>With all the pieces on the board, the key to Romania’s Olympiad success is three-fold: put the best students in the same classrooms, put the best teachers with the best students, and then incentivize schools, teachers, and students each to win Olympiads.</span></p>
<p><span>This system has proved amazingly fruitful. Given its underlying human capital, the poverty from its communist legacy, and its modest population size, Romania should not perform the way it does in academic Olympiads. And yet it does</span><i><span>. </span></i><span>The trade-off for Romania, however, is palpable.</span></p>
<p><span>Large portions of Romania’s Olympiad winners leave the country. Because Romania is a member state of the European Union, the people the country has put great effort into training and credentialing are easily able to leave the country and acquire jobs elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span>Losing the right tail to brain drain is damaging for many countries, but it’s arguably worse for Romania because its educational system is so zero-sum: the top performers do better, while the low-performers do worse. This sorting does not “lift all boats,” as it were. In Romania, the system makes for an incredibly well-trained right tail and a neglected left tail, and that left tail might hurt more than the right tail is helped, if effects on test scores are any indication. On its own, Romania’s system might be a stellar boon to the country. But with free movement of talent between countries, Romania ends up subsidizing talent discovery for other countries with less apt educational systems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most of the growth we see around us is due to the innovations of the right tail, and if they do better, we all do better. Though I doubt Romania’s schooling raises the intelligence</span> <span>of the right tail, even raising aptitude is worth something, because we must get capable people to the frontiers of their respective fields in order to innovate, and Romania has fostered a system that seems to do just that. Moreover, even if Olympiad training does not make those on the right tail more capable but instead simply prepares them better, then it can still</span> <span>have large, socially beneficial effects simply through providing Romania’s highly capable people with a means of having their talents recognized internationally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But these benefits are returned only very indirectly to Romania, if at all on net. Rather than changing Romania’s educational system or closing the borders, the right solution is for more nations to choose to be like Romania, getting a lot more juice out of their smart kids by designing a system just for them.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When designing software systems, do the simplest thing that could possibly work.</p>
<p>It’s surprising how far you can take this piece of advice. I genuinely think you can do this <em>all the time</em>. You can follow this approach for fixing bugs, for maintaining existing systems, and for architecting new ones.</p>
<p>A lot of engineers design by trying to think of the “ideal” system: something well-factored, near-infinitely scalable, elegantly distributed, and so on. I think this is entirely the wrong way to go about software design. Instead, spend that time understanding the current system deeply, then do the simplest thing that could possibly work.</p>
<h3>Simple can be underwhelming</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-system-design">System design</a> requires competence with a lot of different tools: app servers, proxies, databases, caches, queues, and so on. As they gain familiarity with these tools, junior engineers naturally want to use them. It’s fun to construct systems out of many different components! And it feels very satisfying to draw boxes and arrows on a whiteboard - like you’re doing real engineering.</p>
<p>However, as with many skills, real mastery often involves learning when to do less, not more. The fight between an ambitious novice and an old master is a well-worn cliche in martial arts movies: the novice is a blur of motion, flipping and spinning. The master is mostly still. But somehow the novice’s attacks never seem to quite connect, and the master’s eventual attack is decisive.</p>
<p>In software, this means that <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/great-software-design">great software design looks underwhelming</a>. It doesn’t look like anything much is happening at all. You can tell you’re in the presence of great software design because you start having thoughts like “oh, I didn’t realise the problem was that easy” or “oh nice, you don’t actually have to do anything difficult”.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/defunkt/unicorn">Unicorn</a> is great software design, because it delivers all the most important guarantees in a web server (request isolation, horizontal scaling, crash recovery) by leaning on Unix primitives<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. The industry-standard Rails REST API is great software design, because it gives you exactly what you need for a CRUD app in the most boring way possible. I don’t think any of these are impressive <em>software</em>. But they’re impressive feats of <em>design</em>, because <strong>they do the simplest thing that could possibly work</strong>.</p>
<p>You should do that too! Suppose you’ve got a Golang application that you want to add some kind of rate limiting to. What’s the simplest thing that could possibly work? Your first idea might be to add some kind of persistent storage (say, Redis) to track per-user request counts with a leaky-bucket algorithm. That would work! But do you need a whole new piece of infrastructure? What if instead you kept those per-user request counts in-memory? Sure, you’d lose some rate limiting data when the application is restarted, but does that matter? Actually, are you sure your edge proxy<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> doesn’t support rate limiting already? Could you just write a couple of lines in a config file instead of implementing the feature at all?</p>
<p>Maybe your edge proxy doesn’t support rate limiting. Maybe you can’t track it in-memory because you have too many server instances running in parallel, so the tightest rate limit you could enforce that way is too wide. Maybe it’s a dealbreaker if you ever lose rate limiting data, because people are hammering your service <em>that</em> hard. In that case, the simplest thing that could possibly work is adding persistent storage, so you should go and do that. But if you could do one of the easier approaches, wouldn’t you want to?</p>
<p>You really can build a whole application from scratch this way: start with the absolute simplest thing, and then only extend it when you have new requirements that force you to. It sounds silly, but it works. Think of it as taking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a> as the ultimate design principle: above single-responsibility, above choosing the best tool for the job, and above “good design”.</p>
<h3>What’s wrong with doing the simplest thing?</h3>
<p>Of course, there are three big problems with always doing the simplest thing that could possibly work. The first is that, by not anticipating future requirements, you end up with an inflexible system or a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/">big ball of mud</a>. The second is that it’s not clear what “simplest” means, so at worst I’m saying “to design well, always do good design”. The third is that you ought to be building systems that can <em>scale</em>, not systems that just work right now. Let’s take those objections in order.</p>
<h4>Big balls of mud</h4>
<p>To some engineers, “do the simplest thing that could possibly work” sounds like I’m telling them to stop doing engineering. If the simplest thing is usually a quick kludge, does that mean this advice will inevitably lead to a complete mess? We’ve all seen codebases with hacks stacked on top of hacks, and they definitely don’t look like good design.</p>
<p>But are hacks simple? I actually don’t think so. The problem with a hack or a kludge is precisely that it <em>isn’t</em> simple: that it adds complexity to the codebase by introducing another thing you have to always remember. Hacks are just <em>easier to think of</em>. Figuring out the proper fix is hard because it requires having to understand the entire codebase (or large sections of it). In fact, the proper fix is almost always much simpler than the hack.</p>
<p>It is not easy to do the simplest thing that could possibly work. When you’re looking at a problem, the first few solutions that come to mind are unlikely to be the simplest ones. Figuring out the simplest solution requires considering many different approaches. In other words, it requires doing engineering.</p>
<h4>What is simplicity?</h4>
<p>Engineers disagree a lot about what constitutes simple code. If “simplest” already means “with good design”, is it just a tautology to say “you should do the simplest thing that could possibly work?” In other words, is Unicorn really simpler than <a href="https://github.com/puma/puma">Puma</a><sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>? Is adding in-memory rate limiting really simpler than using Redis? Here’s a rough, intuitive definition of simplicity<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simple systems have fewer “moving pieces”: fewer things you have to think about when you’re working with them</li>
<li>Simple systems are less <em>internally-connected</em>. They are composed from components with clear, straightforward interfaces</li>
</ol>
<p>Unix processes are simpler than threads (and thus Unicorn is simpler than Puma) because processes are less connected: they do not share memory. This makes a lot of sense to me! But I don’t think it gives you the tools to figure out what’s simpler in every case.</p>
<p>What about in-memory rate limiting vs Redis? On the one hand, in-memory is simpler because you don’t have to think about all the things involved in standing up a separate service with persistent memory. On the other hand, Redis is simpler because the rate limiting guarantees it offers are more straightforward - you don’t have to worry about the case where one server instance thinks a user is rate limited and another one doesn’t.</p>
<p>When I’m not sure what “seems” simpler to me, I like to use this tiebreaker: <strong>simple systems are stable</strong>. If you’re comparing two states of a software system, and one will require more ongoing work <em>if no requirements change</em>, the other one is simpler. Redis must be deployed and maintained, it can have its own incidents, it requires its own monitoring, it requires a separate deployment in any new environments the service finds itself in, and so on. Thus in-memory rate limiting is simpler than Redis<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>Why wouldn’t you want to be scalable?</h4>
<p>A certain type of engineer is now screaming to themselves “but in-memory rate limiting won’t scale!” Doing the simplest thing that could possibly work will emphatically not deliver the most web-scale system. It will deliver a system that works well at the current scale. Is this irresponsible engineering?</p>
<p>No. In my view, the cardinal sin of big tech SaaS engineering is an obsession with scale. I’ve seen so much unavoidable pain caused by over-engineering systems to prepare for several orders of magnitude more than the current scale.</p>
<p>The main reason to not try this is that <strong>it doesn’t work</strong>. In my experience, for any non-trivial codebase, you can’t anticipate how it will behave at several orders of magnitude more traffic, because you don’t know ahead of time where all the bottlenecks are going to be. At most you can try to make sure you’re ready for 2x or 5x the current traffic, and then stand by to deal with problems as they come in.</p>
<p>The other reason not to try this is that <strong>it makes your codebase inflexible</strong>. It’s fun to decouple your service into two pieces so they can be scaled independently (I have seen this happen maybe ten times, and I have seen them <em>actually be usefully scaled independently</em> maybe once). But that makes certain features very hard to implement, because they now require coordination over the wire. In the worst case, they require <em>transactions</em> over the wire, which is a genuinely hard engineering problem. Most of the time you just don’t have to do any of this!</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>The longer I spend working in tech, the less optimistic I become about our collective ability to predict where a system is going. It’s hard enough to get your head around where a system currently is. And in fact, that’s the main practical difficulty in doing good design: getting an accurate big-picture understanding of the system. Most design is done without that understanding, and most design is thus pretty bad.</p>
<p>There are, broadly speaking, two ways to develop software. The first is to predict what your requirements might look like six months or a year from now, and then design the best system for that purpose. The second is to design the best system for what your requirements actually look like right now: in other words, to do the simplest thing that could possibly work.</p>

<p>
One of the most important properties of a database is durability.  Durability means that after a transaction commits, you
can be confident that, absent catastrophic hardware failure, the changes made by the commit won't be lost.  This should
remain true even if the operating system crashes or the system loses power soon after the commit.  On Linux, and most other Unix operating systems, durability is ensured by calling the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fsync.2.html" rel="external">fsync</a> system call at the right time.
</p>

<p>
Durability comes at a performance cost, and sometimes applications don't need durability.  Some applications can tolerate
losing the last several seconds of commits in the event of a power failure, as long as the database doesn't end up
corrupted.  Thus, databases typically provide knobs to configure if and when they call fsync.  This is fine, but it's essential
that the database clearly documents what its default durability properties are, and what each configuration setting guarantees.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, SQLite's documentation about its durability properties is far from clear.  I cannot tell whether SQLite is durable
by default, and if not, what are the minimal settings you need to use to ensure durability.
</p>

<p>The two relevant configuration
options are <a href="https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode" rel="external"><code>journal_mode</code></a> and <a href="https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous" rel="external"><code>synchronous</code></a>.  <code>journal_mode</code> has several possible values, but most people use either DELETE or WAL.  <code>synchronous</code> has four possible values: EXTRA, FULL, NORMAL, and OFF.
</p>

<p>
This is how I interpret SQLite's documentation after a careful reading:
</p>

<ul><li><p>The default value of <code>journal_mode</code> is DELETE:</p><blockquote>The DELETE journaling mode is the normal behavior (<a href="https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode" rel="external">source</a>; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250826165231/https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode" rel="external">archived</a>)</blockquote></li><li><p>The default value of <code>synchronous</code> is FULL:</p><blockquote>If not overridden at compile-time, the default setting is 2 (FULL) (<a href="https://sqlite.org/compile.html#default_synchronous" rel="external">source</a>; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250826070702/https://sqlite.org/compile.html#default_synchronous" rel="external">archived</a>)</blockquote></li><li><p>The default value of <code>synchronous</code> is FULL even in WAL mode:</p><blockquote>If not overridden at compile-time, this value is the same as SQLITE_DEFAULT_SYNCHRONOUS. (<a href="https://sqlite.org/compile.html#default_wal_synchronous" rel="external">source</a>; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250826070702/https://sqlite.org/compile.html#default_wal_synchronous" rel="external">archived</a>)</blockquote></li><li><p>When <code>journal_mode</code> is DELETE, you need to set <code>synchronous</code> to EXTRA to get durability:</p><blockquote>EXTRA synchronous is like FULL with the addition that the directory containing a rollback journal is synced after that journal is unlinked to commit a transaction in DELETE mode. EXTRA provides additional durability if the commit is followed closely by a power loss. (<a href="https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous" rel="external">source</a>; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250826165231/https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous" rel="external">archived</a>)</blockquote>
<p>
Edited to add: I confirmed this to be true through testing - see <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45069533" rel="external">my Hacker News comment</a> for the methodology.
</p>
</li><li><p>When <code>journal_mode</code> is WAL, FULL is sufficient for durability:</p><blockquote>With synchronous=FULL in WAL mode, an additional sync operation of the WAL file happens after each transaction commit. The extra WAL sync following each transaction helps ensure that transactions are durable across a power loss (<a href="https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous" rel="external">source</a>; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250826165231/https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous" rel="external">archived</a>)</blockquote><p>Note that this is not mentioned under the definition of FULL, but rather further down in the documentation for <code>synchronous</code>.</p></li></ul>

<p>
Based on the above, I conclude that:
</p>

<ul><li><p>By default, SQLite is <strong>not</strong> durable, because the default value of <code>journal_mode</code> is DELETE, and the default value of <code>synchronous</code> is FULL, which doesn't provide durability in DELETE mode.</p></li><li><p>If you change <code>journal_mode</code> to WAL, then SQLite <strong>is</strong> durable, because <code>synchronous=FULL</code> provides durability in WAL mode.</p></li></ul>



<p>
However, a recent <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45014296" rel="external">Hacker News comment</a> by a user who credibly claims to be Richard Hipp, the creator of SQLite, says:
</p>

<ul><li><p>"In its default configuration, SQLite is durable."</p></li><li><p>"If you switch to WAL mode, the default behavior is that transactions ... are not necessarily durable across OS crashes or power failures"</p></li></ul>

<p>
That's literally the opposite of what the documentation seems to say!
</p>

<p>
A Hacker News commenter who agrees with my reading of the documentation <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45015366" rel="external">asked Hipp</a> how his comment is consistent with the documentation, but received no reply.
</p>

<p>
Hipp also says that WAL mode used to be durable by default, but it was changed after people complained about poor performance.
This surprised me, since I had the impression that SQLite cared deeply about backwards compatibility, and weakening the
default durability setting is a nasty breaking change for any application which needs durability.
</p>

<p>
There are a couple other pitfalls around SQLite durability that you should be aware of, though I don't necessarily
blame the SQLite project for these:
</p>

<ul><li><p>Libraries that wrap SQLite can override the default value of <code>synchronous</code>.  For example, the most popular Go driver for SQLite <a href="https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3/blob/8bf7a8a844faf952aa0245b4c0ad0a47e84f4efd/sqlite3.go#L1318-L1320" rel="external">sets it to NORMAL</a> when in WAL mode, which does not provide durability.</p></li><li><p>On macOS, <a href="https://lactoseintolerant.dev/fsync-may-not-be-enough-to-guarantee-data-durability-on-mac-os/" rel="external">fsync is nerfed</a> to make macOS appear faster.  If you want a real fsync, you have to make a different, macOS-specific system call.  SQLite can do this, but it's <a href="https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_fullfsync" rel="external">off by default</a>.</p></li></ul>

<p>
My takeaway is that if you need durability, you'd better set the <code>synchronous</code> option explicitly because who knows what the default is, or what it will be in the future.  With WAL mode, FULL seems to suffice.  As for DELETE mode, who knows if FULL is enough, so you'd better go with EXTRA to be safe. And if your application might be used on macOS, enable <code>fullfsync</code>.
</p>

<p>
The SQLite project ought to clarify their documentation.  Since the meaning of <code>synchronous</code> depends on the value of <code>journal_mode</code>, I think it would be quite helpful to document the values of <code>synchronous</code> separately for each possible <code>journal_mode</code>, rather than mixing it all together.  A table with <code>synchronous</code> values on one axis and <code>journal_mode</code> on the other which tells you if the combination provides durability would do wonders.
</p>

<p>
By the way, there are definitely many applications for which losing a few seconds of data in exchange for better performance is a great tradeoff, which is why SQLite and macOS have made the choices they have made.  But programmers need to know what guarantees their tools provide, which is why unclear documentation and breaking previously-held assumptions is not cool.

Without both pieces, authentication collapses.</span></p></div><p>The system must have a few key features:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Verifiable</strong><span>: you can check the claim independently.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Composable</strong><span>: it works across chains of delegation.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Decentralized</strong><span>: no single gatekeeper decides who is “valid.”</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Public key cryptography already gives us a model. Companies prove ownership today through DNS; they could publish public keys in the same way. That would let a service authenticate a third party simply by checking DNS (without anyone filling forms, asking permission, or registering with a central directory). Sites could still blacklist or whitelist as they choose, but the </span><strong>default is open</strong><span>.</span></p><p><strong>This is what authentication for the agentic era should look like: open, verifiable, and decentralized.</strong></p><p><span>Until now, software usually had a </span><strong>narrow scope</strong><span>. </span></p><p>Think a weekly cron job that emails a “new signups” report: it gets read-only access to the analytics DB, nothing else. Or a finance app via Plaid to fund your trading account: it can initiate transfers within limits but can’t browse your transaction history. </p><div><p><span>OAuth scopes worked because the software had a clear, predictable purpose.</span></p><p><span>Agents are different. They are </span><strong>general-purpose</strong><span>. The same agent might book a flight, pay for dinner, and then summarize your bank statement. They may also be short-lived, spun up for a single task and gone after it.</span></p></div><p>One way to make this work is to give the agent an “admin key”: full access to everything  It’s convenient, but dangerous. We must resist this pattern.</p><p><strong>Agents should not hold permanent credentials, authorizations must be per-task, not per-agent.</strong></p><p><span>Think of a bank account: I might tell my agent </span><em>“pay for dinner.”</em><span> That token should allow payment. But when I ask </span><em>“show me three months of spending,”</em><span> the agent should not be able to move money. Same agent, different task, different token. </span><strong>Credentials must follow tasks, not agents.</strong></p><p><span>Fortunately, cryptography and authorization models have evolved a lot in the last last years. We now have tools that allow us to issue tokens with </span><strong>constraints</strong><span>: granular, short-lived, and delegable (like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroons_(computer_science)" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">macaroons</a><span> or </span><a href="https://github.com/eclipse-biscuit/biscuit" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">biscuits</a><span>) and Open policy engines (like </span><a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OPA</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">AWS Cedar</a><span>) can also be used for RBAC/ABAC for this use case.</span></p><p>Imagine:</p><ul><li><p>User X on Service Y holds an admin token.</p></li><li><p>They derive a narrower token for Agent Z to perform one task.</p></li><li><p>Agent Z can then derive an even narrower token for a sub-agent, all without bothering the service.</p></li><li><p>Each request can be verified against the chain.</p></li></ul><p>Coupled with the authentication model above, this approach gives us a foundation for managing agents without creating new gatekeepers.</p><p>This challenge is bigger than Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft or any single company. The future of the web cannot hinge on who controls the keys. We need protocols, not gatekeepers.</p><p><strong>Authentication, authorization, and monetization must remain open, interoperable, and standardized.</strong></p><p>Cloudflare’s launch is useful only because it exposes the danger. If we let a handful of companies decide which agents are “valid,” the agentic web will collapse into walled gardens. We’ve seen this movie before.</p><p>Here’s the line in the sand: I’m open-sourcing a first cut of these ideas chains of delegation,  request-level authorization , and task-scoped authorization so anyone can implement them, today.</p><p>If this resonates with you, if you want to collaborate, criticize, or help shape the protocols that will keep the web open for agents, please reach out jordi@fewsats.com</p><p><span>The future should not be about who holds the gates. It should be about </span><strong>protocols that let everyone build, share, and innovate</strong><span>.</span></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

We did not want to manage sync tables or schemas in Postgres –&nbsp;we wanted to write API endpoints, and manage our database ourselves.</p><p>Here's a rundown of the initial offline-first options we looked at:</p><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><!--$--><a href="https://watermelondb.dev/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WatermelonDB</a><!--/$--></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>FOSS, self-hosted</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Database agnostic</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Been around for ages, used in many production applications</p></li></ul></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><!--$--><a href="https://www.powersync.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerSync</a><!--/$--></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Not quite FOSS, but has a free Self-Hosted Edition</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Requires Postgres-level integration</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Very complex architecture, requires both changes to Postgres _and_ a separate HA MongoDB deployment cluster</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Appears to have been around quite awhile, but all their case studies are on demo/tiny/side projects</p></li></ul></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><!--$--><a href="https://electric-sql.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElectricSQL</a><!--/$--></p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Looked interesting, but was in the middle of a complete rewrite</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Requires Postgres-level integration</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>New version only handles data sync one way –&nbsp;it does <em>not</em> handle mutations</p></li></ul></li></ol><p>There are <em>many</em> other options, including RxDB, MongoDB Atlas, Couchbase, and on and on. The three listed above are the options that we deeply investigated. As will become clear, we should have looked further at this stage.</p><p>We settled on WatermelonDB and built the initial alpha version of Marco on it. The backend implementation is rather simple: there is a "pull" endpoint to GET data, and a "push" endpoint to POST mutations.</p><p>It is important here to note that although Marco is a native application in some targets, it also must run in a web browser. While we may have access to a filesystem or "true" SQLite in native targets, our common denominator is web, where persistent storage options are very limited.</p><p>On the (web) frontend, Watermelon uses IndexedDB (as do essentially all other options –&nbsp;even the WASM SQLite options are usually SQLite-on-top-of-IndexedDB). However, it turns out Watermelon faces a serious problem that all other relational frontend databases face – IndexedDB performance is <em>terrible</em>. To solve this, Watermelon uses <!--$--><a href="https://watermelondb.dev/docs/Implementation/DatabaseAdapters#lokijs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a LokiJS adapter</a><!--/$-->, which is literally just an in-memory database.</p><p>Yes, you heard that right. To get around IndexedDB performance issues, Watermelon uses LokiJS to... hold the entire database in memory. When your database size is 100MB+, this starts to become a serious problem.</p><p>Moreover, clients <em>must</em> pull data before they can push any new mutations, and mutations can easily be clobbered if the row has been updated on the backend before the frontend can push mutations.</p><p>On top of this, WatermelonDB is not as actively-maintained as it once was. Many issues and PRs are left without a response. For example, chunked initial syncing is not supported out of the box. We opened <!--$--><a href="https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/pull/1866" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a PR</a><!--/$--> for this in early December, but it's still not been merged.</p><p>We got quite far along with the Marco alpha build, and then had a bit of a panic in November. Our confidence in our WatermelonDB-based offline-first approach was decreasing steadily. We began to seriously question if this technology could actually support a rock-solid, modern user experience.</p><p>We decided we needed to find something better.</p><h3>New Wave of Offline-First</h3><p>This time around, we threw out any preconceptions we had about Postgres, separation of concerns at the API layer, etc. We had completely open minds and desperately wanted to find the "best" solution, no matter what that might look like. We were now extremely clear on the fact that we had a "tough" offline-first use case, and needed some serious help.</p><p>We discovered a host of "new wave" offline first implementations. We talked with the founders/developers of these projects and found so many extremely intelligent and talented people working on what is a very tough problem.</p><p>The leaders in this new wave are:</p><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><!--$--><a href="https://www.triplit.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Triplit</a><!--/$--></p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><!--$--><a href="https://www.instantdb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InstantDB</a><!--/$--></p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><!--$--><a href="https://www.convex.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Convex</a><!--/$--></p></li></ol><p>While Triplit and InstantDB can be described as "full stack databases", Convex is instead an entire backend solution, including API endpoints, etc. For this reason we excluded Convex, as it seems like a huge leap and essentially 100% lock-in.</p><h3>Problems with Triplit</h3><p>Our first (of several) rewrites was from WatermelonDB to Triplit. Both Triplit and InstantDB use triples to represent data – entities are stored as "triples" of (&lt;entity id&gt;, &lt;entity field&gt;, &lt;entity value&gt;). Such a representation makes syncing a straightforward affair.</p><p>Triplit's API and DX is best-in-class. However, although we desperately wanted to love the product, we found it unusable for our use case. The server-side implementation was eating gigabytes of RAM while sitting idle and would regularly OOM/crash. The client-side triples implementation would balloon 5MB of JSON into 1GB of SQLite.</p><p>We believe Triplit is a fantastic choice for any offline-first applications with relatively small storage needs. On top of this, we found the Triplit team to be incredibly talented and hard-working, and truly believe that by mid-2025, it will be a robust and capable product.</p><p>We absolutely love the developer experience with Triplit, and are rooting for the team to succeed!</p><p>But we need something which is reliable, highly performant, and battle-tested, <em>now</em>.</p><h3>Problems with InstantDB</h3><p>We next moved onto InstantDB, which can be considered a direct competitor to Triplit. Although both InstantDB and Triplit essentially solve the same problem, we found InstantDB to be a far worse implementation.</p><p>TypeScript types were non-existent. There was no sort/ordering by fields. There was no support for $like operators, and certainly no full text search. I believe some of these features have since been added –&nbsp;both teams are certainly scrambling to handle a million features and requests.</p><p>On the backend side of things, there are no webhooks, so it is impossible to respond to mutations in a scalable way. We would have had to build our own singleton subscriber microservice that then translated reactive queries into scalable webhooks. But reactive queries themselves are prone to dropped data, so we would need some sort of polling fallback... The backend story for InstantDB feels extremely incomplete.</p><p>Even looking past all of this, frontend queries that returned in 2-5ms with Watermelon+LokiJS were taking 200-500ms to return data with InstantDB. This is primarily because InstantDB is not optimistic, and was hitting network to fetch data with almost every request. There is no granular control as to what gets cached on the client side and what does not.</p><p>InstantDB is another promising product, and our understanding is that some teams are already building production applications on top of it. But it's simply too immature for our use case right now. There's essentially zero backend support, and the frontend UX felt like a massive downgrade coming from Watermelon.</p><h3>Problems with PowerSync</h3><p>Finally, to our great disappointment, we begrudgingly moved on to PowerSync. We were wary of PowerSync from the beginning, and our reluctance proved to be well-founded.</p><p>Although PowerSync is undoubtedly a mature product, and probably the most capable (on paper) of all options mentioned thus far, we hated every minute of working with it. The underlying tech might be the most production/enterprise friendly, but the DX is the worst by quite a margin.</p><p>There is a paid SaaS offering, but their pricing model would have made our use case prohibitively expensive. Therefore we needed to self-host PowerSync, which is quite a complex and expensive task in itself. Not only does it require Postgres-level integration, it also needs a HA MongoDB cluster, a lot of arcane yaml configuration, etc. It also required us to completely denormalise our Postgres tables, as relations are not properly supported across the sync buckets.</p><p>On the frontend side of things, PowerSync runs SQLite in WASM, and although the DX is fairly good, we found horrifying problems like off-by-one bugs in their Drizzle ORM integration, queries returning data <em>from local db</em> very slowly (100ms+), and long initialisation times (45s+ after login to Marco) with the UI view not updating until the sync fully completed.</p><h3>Why So Many Problems?</h3><p>There is a saying: if everyone is an asshole, maybe you're the asshole. Is the problem 5+ offline-first tools, or is it us?</p><p>Like with most things, the reality is "a bit of both". As mentioned, Marco is an incredibly data-intensive application, and from day one, we were pushing these offline-first tools to their absolute limits.</p><p>However, we also found the practical limits of these tools to be way lower than one would expect.</p><p>What is the underlying cause? In my estimation, the root cause is that all of these offline-first tools for web are essentially hacks. Because of Marco's web deployment target, which becomes our common denominator, we <em>must</em> support offline-first in a web browser, and web browsers only really support KV storage via IndexedDB.</p><p>All attempts to implement relational or graph databases within a web browser are essentially hacks. PowerSync itself is WASM SQLite... <em>On top of IndexedDB</em>. Binary SQLite chunks are literally stored in IndexedDB.</p><p>There are essentially three different variables:</p><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>The underlying (true) data store –&nbsp;this will always be IndexedDB for web implementations</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>How the data is represented for sync purposes</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>How the data is presented to developers</p></li></ol><p>The new wave of tools are attempting triples/graph implementations, but the story is the same. Browsers only give you a KV API, and anything on top of that will be built in userland and will suffer poor performance once you hit a certain scale. Although triples are easy to store and sync, when you try to jam a relational layer on top, the whole thing starts to fall apart.</p><p>To be absolutely clear: these relational and graph implementations on top of IndexedDB do not start to show their cracks unless you have 10s/100s of MB of data, or hundreds of thousands of rows/entities. But at a certain scale, performance grinds to a halt and they become unusable. For lesser use cases, Triplit and InstantDB offer exceptional DX and velocity, with almost no drawbacks.</p><p>At this point, we were starting to pull our hair out, and were wondering if we needed to build our own sync engine. Like many others, we're highly impressed with Linear, but are also aware that their sync engine was a monumental engineering effort.</p><p>We're only a team of two, and we have a <em>lot</em> to work on besides offline-first itself.</p><h3>Finally, A Solution</h3><p>Some time in early December, I came back across an option which I had glanced over before, but disregarded: <!--$--><a href="https://replicache.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Replicache</a><!--/$-->.</p><p>I think we were initially put off by their strange pricing model and the fact that it's closed-source.</p><p>I am so glad we took another look.</p><p>In terms of backend implementation, Replicache is somewhat similar to WatermelonDB, in that you need to implement push and pull endpoints in your backend, and it is otherwise entirely database-agnostic.</p><p>The frontend is where the crucial difference lies – Replicache is <em>just</em> a KV store. It is a thin layer on top of IndexedDB that adds reactivity and some querying DX. That's it. You get raw <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> performance. Some performance benchmarks are outlined <!--$--><a href="https://doc.replicache.dev/concepts/performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a><!--/$-->. The perf is truly remarkable.</p><p>The drawback to this KV approach is that searching/sorting/ordering entities would require scanning through entire collections. This is obviously a non-starter. In other words, if we wanted to use Replicache, we would need to handle indexing and search on our own.</p><p>We'll post more detailed write-ups on our tech stack in the future, but a quick summary of where we landed on the frontend is: Replicache + <!--$--><a href="https://github.com/oramasearch/orama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orama</a><!--/$-->. This gives us sophisticated and battle-tested data sync with conflict resolution and rebasing, but also extremely flexible and powerful indexing, full-text search, and more.</p><p>At the time of writing (January 2025), the Replicache team have just made it completely free and open source. This is because they've just released <!--$--><a href="https://zero.rocicorp.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero</a><!--/$-->, which looks extraordinarily compelling and will likely jump into the #1 spot for any offline-first product available.</p><p>We're eager to try Zero once it's a bit more stable, but for now will build our product on the extremely capable and robust piece of software that is Replicache.</p><h3>Future of Offline-First</h3><p>We embarked on a long and rambling journey through essentially all prior art and work in the offline-first world. It's a very hard problem to solve.</p><p>The good news is that there are many new teams and projects actively and energetically working on this problem.</p><p>Imagine a world where, as a fullstack developer, you can read and write data from an SDK in both your backend and your frontend, and they magically sync with each other. All your apps are instantly responsive. All your apps work offline out of the box.</p><p>This is already possible today with Triplit or InstantDB, if your use case is reasonable. And things are only improving.</p><p>I believe 2025 will be a year where HTTP/REST APIs will start to feel antiquated. Don't share endpoints –&nbsp;share databases.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>07-14-2025 7:37PM (ET) 08-28-2025 12:03AM (ET) (edited)</p><hr><p><img src="https://www.ethanheilman.com/x/34/figs/science.png" alt="writes in his introduction to Camillo Agrippa's " a="" treatise="" on="" the="" science="" of="" arms,="" with="" philosophical="" dialogue="" (1553)"="">
</p>

<p><a href="https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/W._Jherek_Swanger">W. Jherek Swanger</a> writes in his introduction to Camillo<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> Agrippa's "A Treatise on the Science of Arms, with a philosophical Dialogue (1553)" that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Scienzia [...] was and is often held to relate only to the study of the eternal: that which exists in nature, or was created by God. Thus theology and astronomy/astrology are held to be sciences. Indeed, Ridolfo Capoferro held that strictly speaking fencing is not a science, but rather an art, because it was not divinely created."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>16th Century Italy asks then if science is concerned only with divine (natural) knowledge<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and art is the realm of the secular and human-made, then was Leopold Kronecker right when he said<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"God made the integers; all else is the work of man"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The integers look little like the natural world and very much like the simple and powerful abstractions that humans find elegant.
Much to the frustration of the human mind, that which created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fig_wasp">fig wasps</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucochloridium_paradoxum">Leucochloridium paradoxum</a>, quantum foam, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid">plasmids</a>, does not create works of abstract simplicity.
If such a divinity left fingerprints in mathematics, that inhuman complexity and irrational strangeness<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> can be found in the reals but not the integers.
One can imagine the God of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Job">Book of Job</a> creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_of_2">the square root of two</a> and pi.</p>
<p>I have an imperfect rule of thumb for determining if something is of human construction or for the purposes of this exploration, divine.
If the something under examination causes a sense of existential nausea, disorientation, and a deep feeling that is can't possibly work like that, it is divine<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.
If on the other hand it feels universal, simple, and ideal, it is the product of human effort.</p>
<h2>The Hierarchy of Weirdness</h2>
<p>This distinction science=divine/nature, art=made by human is more complex than just two separate categories.
When humans create something, the created thing is contained, and is a function of, what already exists, so while art is the part of the universe that is created by humans, it also emerges from the part of the universe that isn't created by humans.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/kodokan-judo/page/124"><img alt="triangle choke (sankaku-jime) from Kodokan Judo ny Jigoro Kano - edited by Kodokan Editorial Committee (1986)" src="https://www.ethanheilman.com/x/34/figs/trianglejudo.png"></a></p>
<p>The human idea of the triangle choke (sankaku-jime) only works because humans have arms, legs and necks.
It wouldn't be meaningful to talk about it in a universe without chokeable necks, but necks existed before human ideas.
So the idea of a triangle exists both because of the specific context of humanity and also because humans created it.</p>
<p>More specifically, we can define a hierarchy of creation, or what a 16th Century Italian would call divine creation.
At the top of the hierarchy we have eternal nature. Eternal nature gives rise to nature, which in turn gives rise to humans, which gives rise to human ideas.
As shown below, the closer we get to eternal nature the greater the weirdness<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> (from a human perspective).</p>
<p><img alt="hierarchy of weirdness" src="https://www.ethanheilman.com/x/34/figs/creationheirarchy.png"></p>
<p>The real numbers are much closer to eternal nature<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, whereas the integers are much closer to human ideas.
This is why to human mind the integers feel more perfect, feel more divine.
A hammer feels like the perfect tool to hammer a nail not because a hammer is closer to eternal nature or more divine, but because it isn't divine.
Hammers feel like the perfect tool because they were invented by humans specifically to solve the human problem of hammering nails.</p>
<h2>Kronecker, Cantor and God</h2>
<p>Kronecker's quote about the integers being divine was not made so much because Kronecker wanted to elevate the reputation of the integers but because he wanted to damn infinity.
It was that reaction of horror at the creepy crawly bugs you see when you lift up the rock of Mathematics.
The main target of Kronecker's campaign against infinity was the mathematician Cantor<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> and his work on transfinites.
Cantor viewed infinity in a much more positive light and he wasn't alone in this reaction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_paradise">the paradise</a> that Cantor created for us no-one shall be able to expel us." - David Hilbert (1926)<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cantor's ideas also sparked a theological debate since if the mind can reason about infinity, perhaps the mind can also reason about God<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup>.
Cantor himself was deeply invested in the theological implications of his mathematical work.
He believed that God was beyond the mind<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13">12</a></sup> and thus his mathematical work was not the result of his own effort but rather God was speaking through him.</p>
<p>This is an inversion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps">God of the gaps</a><sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> where the gaps filled in by the God of the filling and the lack of gaps is evidence of God rather than the reverse.
This echos Descartes'<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15">14</a></sup> deeply unsatisfying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_argument">Trademark Argument</a> of the existence of God because finite beings like humans can perceive aspects of God like infinity, we must only be able to perceive<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17">16</a></sup> them because God exists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The idea of infinite substance, or God, must have “proceeded from some substance which really was infinite. [..] If a finite thing could produce the idea of an infinite thing, the Meditator reasons, this would violate the principle that there is more reality in a cause than in its effect, since the Idea of God is at the top of the Hierarchy of Ideas." - René Descartes, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/descartess-meditations-an-introduction/Descartes%E2%80%99s%20Meditations%20An%20Introduction_djvu.txt">Meditations on First Philosophy, in which the existence of God and the immortality of the soul are demonstrated (1641)</a><sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I much prefer the notion put forward by Chesterton that it is gaps themselves which are important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The whole secret of mysticism is this: that man can understand everything by the help of what he does not understand. The morbid logician seeks to make everything lucid, and succeeds in making everything mysterious. The mystic allows one thing to be mysterious, and everything else becomes lucid" - <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16769/16769-h/16769-h.htm">Orthodoxy by G. K. Chesterton (1908)</a><sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A Final Note</h2>
<p>Versions of this essay sat on my hard drive for the last few years and in private correspondence.
I couldn't find a conclusion to draw these threads together so I'm leaving it as a vibes-based meandering through these ideas.</p>
<p>This post originally came about because of a conversation with <a href="https://madars.org/">Madars Virza</a> about my rejection of the Kronecker quote.  I bounced it off of a number of other people including Andrew Poelstra, Russell O’Connor, Karina Poelstra, Peter Berard over the years. The observations of the real number line are taken from conversations with my dad, <a href="https://www.bridgew.edu/department/mathematics/dr-ward-heilman">Ward Heilman</a>. Hopefully I got it mostly correct, any errors are my own.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Why AI Isn’t Ready to Be a Real Coder"><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial intelligence</a> (AI) has transformed the coding sphere, with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/best-ai-coding-tools" target="_self">AI coding tools</a> completing <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/source-code">source code</a>, correcting syntax errors, creating inline documentation, and understanding and answering questions about a codebase. As the technology advances beyond automating <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/programming" target="_self">programming</a> tasks, the idea of full autonomy looms large. Is AI ready to be a <em><em>real</em></em> coder?</p><p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22625" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new paper</a> says not yet—and maps out exactly why. Researchers from <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cornell University</a>, <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/node/2873" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MIT CSAIL</a>, <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stanford University</a>, and <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a> highlight key challenges that today’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ai-models">AI models</a> face and outline promising research directions to tackle them. They presented their work at the <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2025 International Conference on Machine Learning</a>.</p><p>The study offers a clear-eyed reality check amid all the hype. “At some level, the technology is powerful and useful already, and it has gotten to the point where <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/programming">programming</a> without these tools just feels primitive,” says <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/armando-solar-lezama" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Armando Solar-Lezama</a>, a co-author of the paper and an associate director at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mit">MIT</a> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/csail">CSAIL</a>, where he leads the computer-aided programming group. He argues, however, that AI-powered <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-development" target="_self">software development</a> has yet to reach “the point where you can really collaborate with these tools the way you can with a human programmer.”</p><h2>Challenges With AI Coding Tools</h2><p>According to the study, AI still struggles with several crucial facets of coding: sweeping scopes involving huge codebases, the extended context lengths of millions of lines of code, higher levels of logical complexity, and long-horizon or long-term planning about the structure and design of code to maintain code quality.</p><p><a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/ksen.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Koushik Sen</a>, a professor of computer science at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/uc-berkeley">UC Berkeley</a> and also a co-author of the paper, cites fixing a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/memory-safe-programming-languages" target="_self">memory safety</a> bug as an example. (Such bugs can cause crashes, corrupt data, and open security vulnerabilities.) <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-engineers" target="_self">Software engineers</a> might approach debugging by first determining where the error originates, “which might be far away from where it’s crashing, especially in a large codebase,” Sen explains. They’ll also have to understand the semantics of the code and how it works, and make changes based on that understanding. “You might have to not only fix that bug but change the entire memory management,” he adds.</p><p>These kinds of complex tasks can be difficult for AI development tools to navigate, resulting in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-hallucination" target="_self">hallucinations</a> about where the bug is or its root cause, as well as irrelevant suggestions or code fixes with subtle problems. “There are many failure points, and I don’t think the current <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/llms" target="_self">LLMs</a> [<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/large-language-models">large language models</a>] are good at handling that,” says Sen.</p><p>Among the various paths suggested by the researchers toward solving these AI coding challenges—such as training code LLMs to better collaborate with humans and ensuring human oversight for machine-generated code—the human element endures.</p><p>“A big part of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-development">software development</a> is building a shared vocabulary and a shared understanding of what the problem is and how we want to describe these features. It’s about coming up with the right metaphor for the architecture of our system,” Solar-Lezama says. “It’s something that can be difficult to replicate by a machine. Our interfaces with these tools are still quite narrow compared to all the things that we can do when interacting with real colleagues.”</p><h2>Enhancing AI-Human Collaboration in Coding</h2><p>Creating better interfaces, which today are driven by <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/prompt-engineering-is-dead" target="_self">prompt engineering</a>, is integral for developer productivity in the long run. “If it takes longer to explain to the system all the things you want to do and all the details of what you want to do, then all you have is just programming by another name,” says Solar-Lezama.</p><p><a href="https://cse.nd.edu/faculty/shreya-kumar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shreya Kumar</a>, a software engineer and an associate teaching professor in computer science at the <a href="https://www.nd.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Notre Dame</a> who was not involved in the research, echoes the sentiment. “The reason we have a programming language is because we need to be unambiguous. But right now, we’re trying to adjust the prompt [in a way] that the tool will be able to understand,” she says. “We’re adapting to the tool, so instead of the tool serving us, we’re serving the tool. And it is sometimes more work than just writing the code.”</p><p>As the study notes, one way to address the dilemma of human-AI interaction is for AI systems to learn to quantify uncertainty and communicate proactively, asking for clarification or more information when faced with vague instructions or unclear scenarios. Sen adds that AI models might also be “missing context that I have in my mind as a developer—hidden concepts that are embedded in the code but hard to decipher from it. And if I give any hint to the LLM about what is happening, it might actually make better progress.”</p><p>For <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/abhik/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Abhik Roychoudhury</a>, a professor of computer science at the <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National University of Singapore</a> who was also not involved in the research, a crucial aspect missing from the paper and from most AI-backed software development tools entails capturing user intent.</p><p>“A software engineer is doing a lot of thinking in understanding the intent of the code. This intent inference—what the program is trying to do, what the program is supposed to do, and the deviation between the two—is what helps in a lot of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-engineering">software engineering</a> tasks. If this outlook can be brought in future AI offerings for software engineering, then it will get closer to what the software engineer does.”</p><h2>Where Does AI Coding Go From Here? </h2><p>Roychoudhury also assumes that many of the challenges identified in the paper are either being worked on now or “would be solved relatively quickly” due to the rapid pace of progress in AI for software engineering. Additionally, he believes that an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/agentic-ai" target="_self">agentic AI</a> approach can help, viewing significant promise in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/agentic-ai">AI agents</a> for processing requirements specifications and ensuring they can be enforced at the code level.</p><p>“I feel the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/automation">automation</a> of software engineering via agents is probably irreversible. I would dare say that it is going to happen,” Roychoudhury says.</p><p>Sen is of the same view but looks beyond agentic AI initiatives. He pinpoints ideas such as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/evolutionary-ai-coding-agents" target="_self">evolutionary algorithms to enhance AI coding skills</a> and projects like <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/deepmind-alphaevolve" target="_self">AlphaEvolve</a> that employ <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/fighting-buggy-code-with-genetic-algorithms" target="_self">genetic algorithms</a> “to shuffle the solutions, pick the best ones, and then continue improving those solutions. We need to adopt a similar technology for coding agents, where the code is continuously improving in the background.”</p><p>However, Roychoudhury cautions that the bigger question lies in “whether you can <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chatgpt-reliability" target="_self">trust</a> the agent, and this issue of trust will be further exacerbated as more and more of the coding gets automated.”</p><p>That’s why human supervision remains vital. “There should be a check and verify process. If you want a trustworthy system, you do need to have humans in the loop,” says Notre Dame’s Kumar.</p><p>Solar-Lezama agrees. “I think it’s always going to be the case that we’re ultimately going to want to build software for people, and that means we have to figure out what it is we want to write,” he says. “In some ways, achieving full automation really means that we get to now work at a different level of abstraction.”</p><p>So while AI may become a “real coder” in the near future, Roychoudhury acknowledges that it probably won’t gain software developers’ complete trust as a team member, and thus might not be allowed to do its tasks fully autonomously. “That team dynamics—when an AI agent can become a member of the team, what kind of tasks will it be doing, and how the rest of the team will be interacting with the agent—is essentially where the human-AI boundary lies,” he says.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>DeepSeek is a popular open-source large language model (LLM) praised for its strong performance. However, its large size and unique architecture, which uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture of Experts (MoE), require an advanced system for efficient serving at scale. In this blog, we explain how we match DeepSeek's inference system performance with SGLang.</p>
<p><img src="https://lmsys.org/images/blog/large_scale_ep/overall-arch.png"></p>
<p>Our implementation, shown in the figure above, runs on 12 nodes in the Atlas Cloud, each equipped with 8 H100 GPUs.
It uses prefill-decode disaggregation and large-scale expert parallelism (EP), achieving a speed of <strong>52.3k input tokens per second and 22.3k output tokens per second per node</strong> for 2000-token input sequences.
To the best of our knowledge, this represents <strong>the first open-source implementation to nearly match the throughput reported in the official DeepSeek blog</strong> at large scale.
By deploying this implementation locally, it translates to a cost of $0.20/1M output tokens, which is about one-fifth the cost of the official DeepSeek Chat API.
Compared to vanilla tensor parallelism using the same resources, this optimized strategy improves the output throuhgput by up to 5x.
This blog dives into our parallelism design, optimization methods, and results. All components of our work are fully open-source, allowing others to explore and build on our efforts. The instructions for reproducing our experiments are fully available <a href="https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/6017">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Highlight</h2>
<p>✅ SGLang now supports prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation and large-scale EP, including the full functionality of <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepEP">DeepEP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepGEMM">DeepGEMM</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/eplb">EPLB</a>.</p>
<p>✅ Leveraging these new features, our team successfully replicated DeepSeek's inference system using 12 nodes, each with 8 H100 GPUs. In total, SGLang achieves a throughput of 52.3k input tokens per second and 22.3k output tokens per second per node for input sequences of 2000 tokens.</p>
<p>✅ This blog explains technical details of our approach, focusing on optimizations for efficiency, peak memory usage reduction, and workload balancing. The profile results show that our implementation achieves nearly on-par performance with the official DeepSeek’s report.</p>

<h2>Parallelism Design</h2>
<p>Efficient parallelism is essential to manage the computational complexity and memory demands of DeepSeek's architecture. This section outlines our approach to optimizing key components: attention layers, dense feed-forward networks (FFNs), sparse FFNs, and the language model (LM) head. Each component leverages tailored parallelism strategies to enhance scalability, memory efficiency, and performance.</p>
<h3>Attention Layers</h3>
<p>DeepSeek employs <strong>Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)</strong> to effectively model complex dependencies within input sequences. To optimize this mechanism, we implement <strong>DP Attention</strong>, a data parallelism strategy that eliminates KV cache duplication across devices, significantly reducing memory overhead. Introduced in <a href="https://lmsys.org/blog/2024-12-04-sglang-v0-4/#data-parallelism-attention-for-deepseek-models">SGLang v0.4</a>, this approach has been extended to support <strong>hybrid data and tensor parallelism</strong>, offering flexibility for processing small batch sizes efficiently.</p>
<h3>Dense FFNs</h3>
<p>Despite using only three dense FFN layers, DeepSeek-V3's computation can significantly increase peak memory usage, potentially leading to system crashes if not carefully managed. To address this, we adopt <strong>Data Parallelism (DP)</strong> over tensor parallelism (TP), leveraging the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Scalability</strong>: With an intermediate dimension of 18,432, high TP degrees (e.g., TP32) result in inefficient fragmentation into small-unit segments (e.g., 576 units), which are not divisible by 128—a common alignment boundary for modern GPUs such as H100. This misalignment hampers computational efficiency and memory utilization. DP provides a more scalable solution by avoiding fragmentation, ensuring balanced workload distribution across devices.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized Memory Efficiency</strong>: Traditionally, TP reduces memory usage as worker size increases, but this advantage diminishes under DP attention. In a pure TP setup, memory demand for a single-layer Transformer model scales with DP size as: $$\text{Memory}=\frac{N_{\text{param}}}{\text{TP}}+(1+k)N_{\text{hidden_state}}\cdot \text{DP}\notag$$ Here, $N_{\text{hidden_state}}=n_\text{token}\times n_\text{hidden_size}$ is the size of the hidden state on each device (DP rank), $N_{\text{param}}=n_\text{intermediate_size}\times n_\text{hidden_size}$ is the number of model parameters, and $k$ is a coefficient representing extra memory overhead from CUDA Graph duplication. By assuming $\text{DP}=\text{TP}$, this memory usage function is minimized when $\text{TP}=\sqrt{\frac{N_{\text{param}}}{(1+k)N_{\text{hidden_state}}}}$. DeepSeek-V3 uses an intermediate size of 18,432. During the prefill phase, CUDA Graph is typically disabled, so $k = 0$. However, the token size per device can easily exceed 2,048, resulting in an optimal TP size of 3 or less. In the decode phase, a practical configuration might use 128 tokens per device and set $k = 3$. In this case, the memory-optimal TP size is 6. In both phases, a lower TP degree minimizes memory usage per device. As a result, DP may offer a more memory-efficient approach for scaling compared to relying solely on TP.</li>
<li><strong>Minimized Communication Overhead</strong>: In pure TP, each FFN necessitates two all-reduce operations, resulting in substantial communication overhead. By leveraging DP, we optimize this process to a single reduce-scatter following the prior attention layer and an all-gather before the next, reducing communication costs by 50%. Furthermore, when attention is also computed under pure DP, inter-device communication is entirely eliminated, significantly enhancing overall efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>The integration of DP dense FFN with DP attention is illustrated in the left figure below. Users can enable this feature by setting <code>--moe-dense-tp-size=1</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://lmsys.org/images/blog/large_scale_ep/parallel-design.png"></p>
<h3>Sparse FFNs</h3>
<p>In DeepSeek-V3's Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, sparse FFNs require substantial expert weights, creating a significant memory bottleneck. To address this, we implement <strong>Expert Parallelism (EP)</strong>, which distributes expert weights across multiple devices. This approach effectively scales memory capacity while maintaining high performance, though it does introduce challenges like irregular all-to-all communication and workload imbalance.</p>
<p>The figure in the right figure above illustrates our EP implementation using the DeepEP framework, with further details on our EP design and optimizations provided in <a href="#large-scale-expert-parallelism">the following sections</a>.</p>
<h3>LM Head</h3>
<p>The LM head computes output probabilities over a large vocabulary, a resource-intensive operation traditionally handled with vocabulary parallelism to aggregate token logits from TP groups. To enhance scalability and efficiency, we adopt <strong>Data Parallelism (DP)</strong>, mirroring our dense FFN strategy. This reduces memory overhead and simplifies communication across devices, delivering a more streamlined solution.</p>
<h2>Prefill and Decode Disaggregation</h2>
<p>LLM inference comprises two distinct phases: <strong>Prefill</strong> and <strong>Decode</strong>. The Prefill phase is computation-intensive, processing the entire input sequence, while the Decode phase is memory-intensive, managing the Key-Value (KV) cache for token generation. Traditionally, these phases are handled within a unified engine, where combined scheduling of prefill and decode batches introduces inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we introduce <strong>Prefill and Decode (PD) Disaggregation</strong> in SGLang.</p>
<h3>Issues with Unified Scheduling</h3>
<p>The conventional unified engine, which processes prefill and decode batches together, results in three significant problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Prefill Interruption</strong>: Incoming prefill batches frequently interrupt ongoing decode batches, causing substantial delays in token generation.</li>
<li><strong>DP Attention Imbalance</strong>: In DP attention, one DP worker may process a prefill batch while another handles a decode batch simultaneously, leading to increased decode latency.</li>
<li><strong>Incompatible with DeepEP</strong>: As we will discuss in <a href="#expert-parallelism-with-deepep">a later section</a>, DeepEP executes different dispatch modes for prefill and decode, making unified scheduling imcompatible with DeepEP.</li>
</ol>
<p>PD Disaggregation resolves these by separating the two stages, enabling tailored optimizations for each.</p>
<h3>Implementation Details</h3>
<p>The PD Disaggregation design in SGLang, depicted in the diagram below, interleaves execution between a Prefill Server and a Decode Server:</p>
<p><img src="https://lmsys.org/images/blog/large_scale_ep/pd-disaggregation.png"></p>
<p>Upon receiving an input request, the workflow proceeds as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Prefill Server and a Decode Server pair via a handshake, establishing a local sender and receiver, respectively.</li>
<li>The Decode Server pre-allocates the KV cache, signaling the Prefill Server to begin the model forward pass and compute the KV caches.</li>
<li>Once computed, the data transfers to the Decode Server, which handles iterative token generation.</li>
</ol>
<p>This separation ensures each phase operates under optimal conditions, maximizing GPU resource utilization. To further enhance performance, our implementation incorporates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-blocking Transfer</strong>: Data send and receive operations run in a background thread, keeping the scheduler’s event loop uninterrupted.</li>
<li><strong>RDMA-Based Transfer</strong>: Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) leverages queue pairs for connections and scatter-gather elements (SGE) for efficient transfer of non-contiguous memory chunks.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible API Integration</strong>: SGLang offers adaptable APIs that integrate high-performance RDMA libraries like Mooncake and NIXL, streamlining data transfers.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details can be found in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rQXJwKd5b9b1aOzLh98mnyMhBMhlxXA5ATZTHoQrwvc/edit?tab=t.0">design document</a>.</p>
<h2>Large-scale Expert Parallelism</h2>
<h3>Expert Parallelism with DeepEP</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepEP">DeepEP</a>, implemented by the DeepSeek team, is a communication library designed to streamline EP in MoE models. It tackles the challenge of efficiently routing tokens to specific experts across multiple GPUs. By providing optimized communication kernels, DeepEP reduces latency and boosts throughput, making it ideal for large-scale inference tasks.</p>
<p>DeepEP provides two specialized dispatch modes to address varying workload demands:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normal Dispatch</strong>: Optimized for handling long input sequences, such as during the prefill phase, this mode prioritizes maximum computational throughput. However, it generates symbolic shapes that are incompatible with CUDA Graph, rendering it less effective for the decode phase, where kernel launch overhead becomes a significant bottleneck.</li>
<li><strong>Low-Latency Dispatch</strong>: Tailored for generating output tokens during the decode phase, this mode prioritizes minimal delay to ensure real-time performance. It supports CUDA Graph but requires preallocating a fixed memory size. If the memory demand exceeds this preallocation, a runtime error occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In SGLang, the integration of DeepEP provides <strong>auto mode</strong> that dynamically selects between these two dispatch modes based on the workload. However, without PD disaggregation, the auto mode faces a limitation: it cannot simultaneously support both normal dispatch (for prefill) and low-latency dispatch (for decode) within the same communication group. This restriction hinders its compatibility with DP attention, which is crucial for memory-efficient inference. The compatibility of each mode is outlined in the table below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Mode</strong></th>
<th><strong>Long Input</strong></th>
<th><strong>Long Output</strong></th>
<th><strong>DP Attention</strong></th>
<th><strong>CUDA Graph</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Normal</td>
<td>✅</td>
<td>❌</td>
<td>✅</td>
<td>❌</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Low-Latency</td>
<td>❌</td>
<td>✅</td>
<td>✅</td>
<td>✅</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Auto</td>
<td>✅</td>
<td>✅</td>
<td>❌</td>
<td>✅</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>PD disaggregation addresses this by separating prefill and decode phases, allowing normal dispatch for the prefill phase and low-latency dispatch for the decode phase, both under DP attention. This integration optimizes resource utilization and enhances overall performance by aligning the dispatch mode with the specific needs of each phase.</p>
<h3>DeepGEMM Integration</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepGEMM">DeepGEMM</a> is another high-efficient library developed by the DeepSeek team, specifically designed to optimize computations in MoE models. It provides two specialized functions for handling MoE-related matrix multiplications (Grouped GEMMs), each tailored to different phases of the inference process.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grouped GEMMs (contiguous layout):</strong> This kernel is designed for dynamic input shapes, making it ideal for the prefill phase of MoE inference. It processes inputs where the data for different experts is concatenated contiguously, allowing for flexible handling of varying input sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Grouped GEMMs (masked layout):</strong> This kernel assumes a fixed input shape and uses a mask tensor to compute only the valid portions of the input. It is compatible with CUDA Graph, which optimizes kernel launches, making it well-suited for the decode phase where reducing overhead is critical.</li>
</ul>
<p>DeepGEMM integrates smoothly with the dispatch modes of DeepEP:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the <strong>contiguous layout kernel</strong>, which is used with <strong>normal dispatch</strong> in the prefill phase, an additional step is required. Since normal dispatch outputs a symbolic shape, a permutation is needed to transform the output into the contiguous format expected by the kernel. We referred to the LightLLM project and implemented a custom Triton kernel for efficient permutation. This kernel ensures that the output from normal dispatch is correctly rearranged, enabling smooth integration with the contiguous GEMM kernel.</li>
<li>The <strong>masked layout kernel</strong> pairs seamlessly with DeepEP’s <strong>low-latency dispatch</strong>, as both are optimized for the decode phase and support CUDA Graph.</li>
</ul>
<p>SGLang also integrates DeepGEMM for MoE computation under tensor parallelism. Additionally, DeepGEMM provides a highly efficient general GeMM kernel, which can be activated in SGLang by setting the environment variable <code>SGL_ENABLE_JIT_DEEPGEMM</code> to 1, offering even greater computational efficiency for non-MoE operations.</p>
<h3>Two-batch Overlap</h3>
<p>In multi-node environments, limited communication bandwidth can significantly increase overall latency. To tackle this challenge, we implemented <strong>Two-batch Overlap (TBO)</strong> following <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/profile-data">DeepSeek's system design</a>. TBO splits a single batch into two micro-batches, allowing computation and communication to overlap, which also lowers peak memory usage by halving the effective batch size. However, putting TBO into practice introduces specific implementation difficulties.</p>
<h5>Implementation Challenges</h5>
<p>Although DeepSeek released the design framework of TBO, there are two slight implementation challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code Complexity</strong>: Directly coding TBO can lead to duplicated logic for managing multiple micro-batches. This increases the complexity of the codebase, making it harder to maintain and prone to errors, especially as the number of micro-batches or overlapping scenarios grows.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization Issues in the Prefill Phase</strong>: Achieving effective overlap between computation and communication needs consideration when the normal dispatch in DeepEP block the CPU. This blocking behavior can stall the pipeline, leaving the GPU idle and undermining the performance benefits of TBO.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Abstraction for Clean Implementation</h5>
<p>To create a more maintainable and reusable codebase, we use an abstraction layer consisting of operations and yield points. This method simplifies development by allowing us to write code as if handling a single micro-batch, while strategically pausing execution by inserting yield points to let other micro-batches proceed. It eliminates code duplication, reduces the potential need for variable postfixes, and efficiently manages cases where some executions complete at a layer's end while others have not. Additionally, it supports easy adaptation to different overlapping region choices or future enhancements, like a three-batch overlap, with minimal code changes. Below is a concise demonstration of this approach:</p>
<pre><code>operations = [
    <span>self</span>._forward_attn,
    YieldOperation(),  <span># Pause execution for other micro-batches</span>
    <span>self</span>._forward_dispatch,
    <span>self</span>._forward_mlp,
    YieldOperation(),  <span># Another pause point</span>
    <span>self</span>._forward_combine,
]

<span># Process a single micro-batch without duplicating code</span>
<span>def</span> <span>_forward_attn</span>(<span>self, state</span>):
    state.hidden_states = <span>self</span>.self_attn(state.hidden_states, ...)
</code></pre>
<h5>Prefill Overlapping Implementation</h5>
<p>We refine the launch order during the prefill phase to avoid CPU-blocking via the dispatch operation in DeepEP, even though we are using its asynchronous mode. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dispatch operation blocks the CPU until the GPU receives metadata from other ranks to allocate correctly sized tensors.</li>
<li>An improper implementation would leave the computation stream idle during this period, as no computation tasks are submitted to the GPU.</li>
</ul>
<p>To optimize, we prioritize submitting computation tasks to the GPU before launching CPU-blocking communication. This ensures the GPU remains active during communication. As illustrated in the figure below, TBO with a proper launch order, indicated by bolded borders, avoids bubble caused by a CPU-blocking operation (i.e., normal dispatch).</p>
<p><img src="https://lmsys.org/images/blog/large_scale_ep/tbo-prefill.png"></p>
<h3>Expert Parallelism Load Balancer</h3>
<p>In MoE models, EP often leads to uneven workload distribution across GPUs. This imbalance forces the system to wait for the slowest GPU computation or communication, wasting compute cycles and increasing memory usage due to expert activations. As the number of GPUs (EP size) increases, the imbalance issue gets more severe.</p>
<p>To address this, DeepSeek developed the <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/EPLB">Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB)</a>. EPLB takes expert distribution statistics as input and computes an optimal arrangement of experts to minimize imbalance. Users can allocate redundant experts (e.g., 32 additional experts), which, when combined with the original 256, create a pool of 288 experts. This pool allows EPLB to strategically place or replicate experts—for instance, duplicating the most frequently used expert multiple times or grouping a moderately used expert with rarely used ones on a single GPU.</p>
<p>Beyond balancing workloads, EPLB offers greater flexibility in parallelism design. With the original 256 experts, parallelism sizes are restricted to powers of two. EPLB’s use of 288 experts enables more diverse configurations, such as parallelism sizes of 12 or 72.</p>
<p>In the figure below, we demonstrate the effects of scale and EPLB algorithm to the imbalance issue via simulation. We compute GPU balancedness as the ratio between mean computation time and maximum computation time for a MoE layer among GPUs, and we use the number of tokens for a GPU to estimate the computation time for it. As can be seen, utilization rate decreases when the system scales with the number of nodes, and enabling EPLB significantly improves the utilization.</p>
<p><img src="https://lmsys.org/images/blog/large_scale_ep/eplb-balancedness.png"></p>
<h5>EPLB for Real-World Serving</h5>
<p>For EPLB to be effective, the input distribution must closely match the actual serving workload. Two strategies enhance this alignment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increasing Batch Size</strong>: Larger batches reduce random fluctuations in expert usage, which improves balance, which can be achieved by scaling the cluster or using techniques like Multi-Token Prediction (MTP).</li>
<li><strong>Periodic Rebalancing</strong>: Regularly updating the expert arrangement leverages temporal locality but requires efficient reloading of experts. This necessitates minimizing the cost of expert reloading operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with EPLB, some imbalance is inevitable, making further optimization a valuable future direction.</p>
<h5>Implementation of Rebalancing</h5>
<p>SGLang implements expert rebalancing in three stages to ensure efficiency and minimal disruption:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>System Loading Stage</strong>: Weights are optionally preloaded from disk to main memory for faster rebalancing or kept on disk with memory mapping (mmap) for reduced memory usage.</li>
<li><strong>Rebalance Preparation Stage</strong>: Required weights are asynchronously transferred to device memory in the background, utilizing free DMA hardware engines without interrupting ongoing GPU operations.</li>
<li><strong>Rebalance Execution Stage</strong>: A device-to-device copy updates the weights. This step can be further optimized through physical memory rebinding techniques.</li>
</ol>
<p>This staged approach ensures that rebalancing is both efficient and non-disruptive, maintaining system performance during updates.</p>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<h3>End-to-end Performance</h3>
<h5>Experimental Setup</h5>
<p>We evaluated the end-to-end performance of different configurations of SGLang using DeepSeek-V3 on a cluster of 12 nodes, connected via InfiniBand and each equipped with 8 H100 GPUs. This evaluation highlights the throughput improvements enabled by our advanced optimization techniques. We compared the following four settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SGLang with TP16 x 6</strong>: Every two nodes are paired with an independent group, running DeepSeek-V3 inference with a TP size of 16 and DP attention.</li>
<li><strong>SGLang with PD Disaggregation</strong>: This version incorporates PD disaggregation and full EP optimization. For the EPLB, we adopt a distribution matching the input/output data, as real-time serving statistics are unavailable.</li>
<li><strong>SGLang with PD Disaggregation and simulated MTP</strong>: To simulate MTP’s effects, we firstly double the batch size and halve the Key-Value KV cache length to maintain the same workload for GroupedGeMM computation and memory access. Moreover, we insert dummy kernels after the real attention computation to ensure the attention phase takes the same time as in DeepSeek’s profile, accurately reflecting the slowdown caused by MTP’s attention mechanism. We conservatively assume a 70% acceptance rate under MTP.</li>
<li><strong>DeepSeek Profile Results</strong>: Throughput estimates are derived from <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/profile-data">DeepSeek’s official profiling data</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Performance Analysis of Prefill and Decode Phases</h5>
<p>To accommodate varying workload demands, we independently evaluated the prefill (P) and decode (D) phases, assuming unlimited resources for the non-tested phase to isolate and maximize the load on the tested nodes—mirroring the setup used by DeepSeek. The results are summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prefill Phase</strong>: On 4 nodes (4×8×H100, EP32), the system achieved per-node throughputs of 57,674, 54,543, and 50,302 tokens per second for prompt lengths of 1K, 2K, and 4K, respectively. As shown in the bar chart below, this represents up to a 3.3× improvement over the TP16 baseline, largely attributable to the optimized GroupedGeMM kernel (DeepGEMM) and two-batch overlap. Assuming a perfectly balanced workload, our system’s throughput is within 5.6% of DeepSeek's official profile.</li>
<li><strong>Decode Phase</strong>: Evaluated on 9 nodes (9×8×H100, EP72; half the scale of DeepSeek), the system achieved 22,282 tokens/sec per node for 2K inputs—representing a 5.2× speedup over the TP16 baseline. Under simulated MTP conditions—with attention kernels intentionally slowed to reflect real-world latency—the system sustained a high throughput of 17,373 tokens/sec per node for 4K inputs, just 6.6% below DeepSeek’s official profile. As shown in the figure on the right, these performance gains are largely attributed to 4× larger batch sizes enabled by EP, which enhances scalability by significantly reducing per-GPU memory consumption of model weights.</li>

<h3>Profile Results</h3>
<p>This section compares SGLang’s performance with DeepSeek’s inference system, aligning our experimental setup as closely as possible to DeepSeek’s production environment. We analyze overall throughput and detailed kernel breakdowns, benchmarking against DeepSeek’s blog and public profile data.</p>
<h5>Overall Throughput</h5>
<p>For prefill, we tested a scenario with 16,384 tokens per device and an input length of 4,096. Due to uncertainty in DeepSeek’s expert distribution, we evaluated two cases: one with default expert distribution and another with simulated perfect EPLB (random expert selection following group-limited routing semantics) as a performance upper bound.</p>
<p>The results are presented below:</p>

<p>Using half the nodes of DeepSeek, SGLang with simulated MTP is only slightly slower than DeepSeek’s profile. In a higher batch size setting (256 sequences, 2,000 input length), SGLang achieves 22,282 tokens per second per node, demonstrating strong scalability.</p>
<h5>Detail Breakdown</h5>
<p>The figure below breaks down kernel execution times for prefill, including unit test results as a theoretical upper bound:</p>
<p><img src="https://lmsys.org/images/blog/large_scale_ep/profile-prefill.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default EPLB</strong>: Communication kernels exhibit longer execution times and higher variance compared to DeepSeek’s profile, likely due to greater expert imbalance. This leads to extended computation stream bubbles, slowing down overall performance.</li>
<li><strong>Simulated Perfect EPLB</strong>: This setup aligns more closely with DeepSeek’s profile, though discrepancies remain, indicating potential areas for optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison with Unit Tests</strong>: Both DeepSeek and SGLang have a communication time slower than unit test results, while the latter is achievable when disabling TBO, revealing a potential optimization direction if communication is the bottleneck.</li>
</ul>
<p>SGLang’s decode kernel breakdown aligns closely with DeepSeek’s, as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="https://lmsys.org/images/blog/large_scale_ep/profile-decode.png"></p>
<p>Key observations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combine Time Discrepancy</strong>: SGLang’s combine operation appears 2x slower than DeepSeek’s due to shorter attention computation, causing communication kernels to busy-wait. In the simulated slow attention experiment, combine time matches DeepSeek’s, confirming this hypothesis.</li>
<li><strong>MoE Performance</strong>: SGLang’s MoE kernels are 25% slower, possibly because DeepSeek’s 18 nodes (versus our 9) distribute experts more efficiently, reducing memory access overhead for GEMM operations.</li>
<li><strong>Dispatch Optimization Potential</strong>: Both DeepSeek and SGLang show dispatch times of ~0.17ms per layer, but unit tests with DeepEP reveal a potential of 0.06ms occupying SMs. Currently, dispatch spends significant time busy-waiting for data. Inserting slow dummy kernels between send/receive operations reduces dispatch time to 0.09ms, and in-flight duration analysis using unit test data suggests further improvements are possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>While minor enhancements remain—primarily in kernel fusion under "Other Kernels"—SGLang’s decode performance is largely aligned with DeepSeek’s, with prefill optimization as the next focus.</p>
<h3>Ablation Study: Two-batch Overlap</h3>
<h5>Impact of Batch Size and Attention Time</h5>
<p>This section investigates TBO performance across varying batch sizes and simulated MTP scenarios.</p>
<p><img src="https://lmsys.org/images/blog/large_scale_ep/tbo-overall.png"></p>
<p>TBO delivers two significant benefits in the prefill phase, as evidenced by throughput comparisons and memory usage optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Larger Batch Sizes</strong>: In the vanilla configuration, each device processes up to 8,192 tokens before encountering out-of-memory (OOM) errors at 16,384 tokens. TBO mitigates this by optimizing memory usage for input tokens, enabling inference with batches as large as 16,384 tokens per device. This further boosts performance to 40.5% increase when comparing the TBO flag with all other configurations made optimal.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Throughput</strong>: By overlapping computation (e.g., attention and MLP phases) with communication (e.g., DeepEP Combine and Dispatch), TBO achieves a 27% to 35% throughput increase compared to the vanilla setup, even when processing the same token count per device.</li>
</ul>
<p>TBO’s impact in the decode phase varies by scenario, with performance tied to batch size and attention processing time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real Test Cases</strong>: Speedup in practical scenarios is contingent on batch size exceeding a threshold between 64 and 128 tokens. Below this, TBO yields minimal or negative gains (e.g., -27% at 32 tokens/device), as small decode batch sizes hinder kernel efficiency. The speedup reaches 25.5% at 256 tokens with a performance of 22,310 tokens per second.</li>
<li><strong>Simulated MTP Scenario</strong>: TBO provides the most substantial speedup in simulated MTP cases when processing 128 requests to generate 256 tokens per decode step. This is due to prolonged attention processing time, which aligns computation (e.g., DP Attention layers) with DeepEP communication overhead (e.g., combine and dispatch steps). The evaluation shows a 35% speedup at 128 sequences/device, with throughput 17,552 tokens per second compared to 12,929 without TBO.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Detail Breakdown</h5>
<p>We evaluated three prefill scenarios: TBO with 16k tokens per batch, TBO with 8k tokens, and no-TBO with 8k tokens. The figure below reveals key insights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TBO Efficiency</strong>: Comparing the 8k cases, TBO improves overall efficiency by overlapping computation and communication, as expected.</li>
<li><strong>Batch Size Impact</strong>: Reducing the batch size from 16k to 8k with TBO results in a slight slowdown, reflecting diminished kernel efficiency with smaller batches.</li>
<li><strong>Kernel Performance</strong>: Interestingly, the no-TBO 8k case outperforms the TBO 16k case in per-kernel speed, despite both having an effective batch size of 8k for kernels. This may stem from reduced streaming multiprocessors (SMs) with TBO, potential noisy neighbor effects during overlap, or kernel incompatibility between computation and communication. These findings suggest future optimization directions for SGLang.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://lmsys.org/images/blog/large_scale_ep/tbo-breakdown-prefill.png"></p>
<p>For the decode phase, we analyzed three configurations: TBO with a batch size of 256, no-TBO with 256, and no-TBO with 128. The time breakdown is shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TBO vs. No-TBO (Batch Size 256)</strong>: Without TBO, communication time increases significantly due to the lack of overlap. However, computation kernels, particularly GEMM, benefit from a larger effective batch size, resulting in faster execution.</li>
<li><strong>TBO (256) vs. No-TBO (128)</strong>: Comparing cases with the same kernel batch size, only non-overlapped communication slows down in the no-TBO setup, while computation remains consistent. Unlike prefill, decode communication kernels either fully utilize SMs (during send/receive) or none (during inflight waiting), avoiding resource contention with computation kernels.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://lmsys.org/images/blog/large_scale_ep/tbo-breakdown-decode.png"></p>
<h3>Ablation Study: EPLB</h3>
<p>This section evaluates the impact of the EPLB on system performance through overall throughput analysis and detailed case studies. Given EPLB's sensitivity to workload distribution and distribution shifts in production environments, we focus on qualitative and generalizable insights rather than real-world performance, which requires production data.</p>
<h5>Overall Results</h5>
<p>The figure below illustrates EPLB's effect on throughput in large-scale settings. EPLB delivers a significant speedup of 1.49x (prefill) and 2.54x (decode), as expected, due to its ability to mitigate workload imbalances across GPUs. As the number of ranks scales, imbalances grow, and EPLB effectively addresses this in our large-scale experiments, leading to notable throughput improvements.</p>
<p><img src="https://lmsys.org/images/blog/large_scale_ep/eplb-throughput.png"></p>
<h5>Case Study: Workload Imbalance Versus Overall Throughput</h5>
<p>To explore the relationship between workload imbalance and throughput, we conducted a case study using a decode experiment with 1800 input tokens, 100 output tokens, and a batch size of 256. Throughput and balancedness (average token count divided by maximum token count across experts) were plotted against decoding steps:</p>
<p><img src="https://lmsys.org/images/blog/large_scale_ep/eplb-throughput-vs-imbalance.png"></p>
<p>The results reveal a strong correlation between balancedness and throughput, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high balancedness for optimal performance.</p>
<h5>Case Study: Expert Distribution Statistics</h5>
<p>The following figure presents expert distribution statistics for prefill and decode sample data:</p>
<p><img src="https://lmsys.org/images/blog/large_scale_ep/eplb-stat.png"></p>
<p>Key observations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imbalance in Expert Usage</strong>: Most experts are infrequently used, while a small subset is heavily utilized, underscoring the inherent imbalance in MoE models.</li>
<li><strong>Prefill vs. Decode Differences</strong>: Although prefill and decode distributions share similarities, notable differences exist. This supports the use of PD disaggregation, which enables distinct expert placements for each phase, optimizing performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>These findings highlight EPLB's role in addressing workload imbalances and the value of tailoring expert placement to phase-specific demands.</p>
<h2>Toolkits</h2>
<h3>Disposable Tensor</h3>
<p>Memory management in PyTorch can be challenging due to persistent object references, especially in GPU-intensive workflows where CUDA memory is a scarce resource. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span> <span>ffn</span>(<span>hidden_state: torch.Tensor, linear1: nn.Linear, linear2: nn.Linear</span>):
    intermediate_state = linear1(hidden_state)
    <span>del</span> hidden_state  <span># Attempt to free memory, but no effect due to external reference</span>
    <span>return</span> linear2(nn.ReLU(intermediate_state))

hidden_state = ffn(hidden_state, linear1, linear2)
</code></pre>
<p>In this code, <code>del hidden_state</code> is intended to release the memory occupied by <code>hidden_state</code> after <code>intermediate_state</code> is computed. However, as <code>hidden_state</code> is still referenced outside the function, the <code>del</code> operation has no effect. This increases peak memory usage, risking performance slowdowns or out-of-memory errors.</p>
<p>SGLang addresses this with the DisposableTensor class, a subclass of <code>torch.Tensor</code> which introduces a dispose() method to explicitly and immediately release a tensor’s memory, circumventing Python’s reference counting limitations. Here’s how it works:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span> <span>ffn</span>(<span>hidden_state: torch.Tensor, linear1: nn.Linear, linear2: nn.Linear</span>):
    intermediate_state = linear1(hidden_state)
    hidden_state.dispose()  <span># Immediately releases CUDA memory</span>
    <span>return</span> linear2(nn.ReLU(intermediate_state))

<span># Wrap the tensor in DisposableTensor</span>
hidden_state = DisposableTensor(hidden_state)
hidden_state = ffn(hidden_state, linear1, linear2)
</code></pre>
<p>By wrapping <code>hidden_state</code> in a <code>DisposableTensor</code> and calling <code>dispose()</code> when it’s no longer needed, the CUDA memory is freed right away. This ensures that memory is released as soon as the tensor’s role in the computation is complete, reducing peak memory usage and improving overall efficiency.</p>
<h3>Expert Workload Extraction and Simulation</h3>
<p>SGLang also includes a toolset for analyzing and simulating expert workload distribution in MoE models. This feature enables users to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dump Expert Workload Statistics</strong>: Extract either accumulated statistics or per-batch workload data. Accumulated stats support the EPLB manager for real-time optimization, while per-batch data provides granular insights for analysis and simulation.</li>
<li><strong>Simulate Expert Utilization</strong>: Model expert balance across various configurations without requiring costly hardware or repeated trials. For instance, users can gather workload data from a modest setup (e.g., 2x8xH100 or 8xH200) and simulate the performance for a large-scale 22-node deployment.</li>
</ul>
<p>This simulation capability allows users to evaluate how factors like rebalancing frequency, node count, or batch size impact system performance. It’s a cost-effective way to fine-tune configurations before scaling up.</p>
<h2>Limitations and Future Work</h2>
<p>While our implementation of SGLang for DeepSeek-V3 inference demonstrates significant throughput improvements, several limitations and areas for future enhancement remain:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Latency Optimization</strong>: The current focus on throughput leaves Time to First Token (TTFT) at 2–5 seconds and Inter-Token Latency (ITL) at approximately 100ms, requiring further optimizations for real-time use cases.</li>
<li><strong>Sequence Length Constraints</strong>: Limited to shorter sequences due to the use of 96 GPUs. Expanding GPU resources would support longer sequences, essential for specific applications.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) Integration</strong>: SGLang supports MTP but lacks full integration with DP attention, reducing efficiency in mixed parallelism configurations.</li>
<li><strong>EPLB Distribution</strong>: The experiments in this blog utilizes in-distribution data for Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB), which may not reflect real-world variability. Future work should experiment performances when having distribution shifts.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Tensor Parallelism (TP) Sizes</strong>: For DeepSeek-V3, memory-optimal TP sizes for dense FFNs are small but larger than 1. Currently, SGLang only supports pure TP or DP, leading to suboptimal memory use. Flexible TP options are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Blackwell Support</strong>: Currently, our implementation supports only the NVIDIA Hopper architecture. We are actively working to extend compatibility to the next-generation Blackwell architecture. If you are interested in supporting or sponsoring this development, welcome to contact <a href="mailto:lmsys.org@gmail.com">lmsys.org@gmail.com</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By leveraging PD disaggregation, EP, and a carefully crafted parallelism design, we’ve reproduced DeepSeek’s inference framework in SGLang with exceptional performance. Our open-source efforts—achieving 52.3k input tokens per second and 22.3k output tokens per second—demonstrate SGLang’s power for large-scale LLM inference. We invite the community to explore, replicate, and extend this work to push the boundaries of efficient AI deployment.</p>

            <pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 14:02:59 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://taylor.town/flunking-anthropic">https://taylor.town/flunking-anthropic</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45064284">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Here's a vague overview of what just happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>I recently applied for
<a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/4816735008">Anthropic's Developer Relations role</a>.</li>
<li>My friend who works there gave me a glowing recommendation (thanks again,
dude!).</li>
<li>I completed their secret take-home assignment.</li>
<li>On top of their secret take-home assignment, I independently published
<a href="https://diggit.dev/">diggit.dev</a> and <a href="https://taylor.town/diggit-000">a companion blogpost</a>
about my [sincerely] positive experiences with Claude. I was hoping that
some unsolicited "extra credit" would make me look like an
exceptional/ambitious candidate.</li>
<li>I
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45012776">posted diggit.dev to HackerNews</a>
and it hit the frontpage!</li>
<li>I submitted my take-home assignment and my unsolicited extra credit.</li>
<li>They sent me
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1j98vu0/the_word_unfortunately_is_literally_traumatizing/">the "unfortunately" email</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anthropic obviously didn't do anything wrong. I'm just bummed.</p>
<p>Claude Code truly is one of my favorite dev tools ever, and if you've suffered
through <a href="https://taylor.town/about#appearances">my talks/interviews</a>, you're probably sick of my
enthusiasm for software. I was particularly excited to interview with Anthropic
because I respect their approach to responsible AI adoption. <a href="https://taylor.town/">This very blog</a>
is too often a crazed celebration of humans, of software, of AI, of progress, of
sincerity -- I, I felt like I was a perfect fit.</p>
<p>The first time I flunked an Anthropic interview (ca. 2022), I accidentally
clicked a wrong button during their automated coding challenge. It was easy to
swallow that failure. I made an honest mistake; I expect companies to reject
candidates who make honest mistakes during interviews.</p>
<p>This is different. I didn't misclick any buttons. My best wasn't good enough.
I'm not good enough.</p>
<p>This essay started as a fantasy: some hero at Anthropic reads this on HackerNews
and vouches for me and I get the job and I help them guide humanity toward
post-scarity AI abundance, forever and ever, amen. I'm ashamed of these
thoughts. It's the same folly of explaining to an ex-girlfriend why she's wrong
about <em>her own experience</em>.</p>
<p>Dating was difficult for me. I don't mind feeling ugly or low-status or whatever
-- I know my place. But it hurts to feel seen, feel considered, but ultimately
rejected due to mysterious forces: "He's cute, but he's too weird."</p>
<p>Yes, I'm weird. My eccentric habits have been an overall boon for my career, for
my relationships, for my well-being. But it's moments like these when I just
want to turn all my weird off. I want to be a square peg for this square hole
and do honest work and feed my family and help humanity thrive.</p>
<p>I can't turn my weird off, so I think I defensively dial it up sometimes. I
exaggerate my eccentricities. It's easy to swallow criticism when it isn't the
<em>real</em> me, when it isn't <em>my best</em>, when it's <em>honest mistakes</em> -- what a load
of crap. This is me. This is my best. Hello, world.</p>
<p>Now it's all coming back in waves, in gasps -- I spent so much of my life being
an unlikable jerk. Becoming somebody else has been slow/painful and I'm so
deeply afraid of regressing. Over the past decade, I've been striving to spread
joy, to do good, to be better. I'm trying so hard.</p>
<p>And all this keyboard vomit is a promise to myself that I'm not giving up. I
hate this feeling, and I'm staring these nightmares straight in their stupid
eyeballs, and they're not blinking. I am still alive, and I have so much more to
do.</p>
<p>I'm okay. I mean it. I don't need (or deserve) your sympathy. I'm so lucky to be
alive, at this time, at this place, in this body, with these people. My life is
great, and it will get even better if I keep putting in this effort.</p>
<p>Spewing my insides like this onto The Internet is terrifying, but I suspect many
strangers are facing similar feelings. It's rough out there. Whatever it is,
wherever you are, I hope this helps. You've got this. You're not alone, and
we're only human.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                                    Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.</p><p>People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent <a href="https://pestakeholder.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PESP_Report_IDD_2025.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">report</a> from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.</p><p>“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”</p><p><span data-bsp-pv="4f8e492c-6f2f-390e-bc61-f176d3a37ab9"></span><span data-bsp-pv="00000196-d9df-d2f6-ab96-dddfa7e50000"></span><br>For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”</p><p>In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.</p><p>But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/grassley-wyden-probe-reports-of-abuse-at-group-homes-in-iowa-and-oregon" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">conducted a probe</a> into the company’s operations in <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2020-12-03%20Investigative%20Report%20(REM%20Iowa).pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Iowa</a> and <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/120220%20Life%20at%20Cypress%20House%20-%20An%20Examination%20of%20Care%20Provided%20by%20MENTOR%20Oregon.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Oregon</a> following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.</p><p>“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-grassley-issue-reports-on-developmental-disability-care-facilities-in-oregon-and-iowa" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">statement</a> in 2020 following his investigation.</p><p>In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.</p><p>“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.</p><p>The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.</p><p>In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.</p><p>From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, <a href="https://pestakeholder.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PESP_Report_IDD_2025.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">according to the report</a> by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.</p><h3 id="cash-cow">Cash Cow</h3><p>Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.</p><p>Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.</p><p>Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.</p><p><a href="https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3320219#:~:text=Sevita%20generating%20approximately%2085%25%2D90%25%20of%20its%20revenues%20from%20Medicaid" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid</a>, according to a February 2025 report from S&amp;P Global.</p><p>Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.</p><p>“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.</p><p>In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/03/29/care-facility-is-fined-after-woman-left-unattended-in-liquor-store-consumes-vodka/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">left unattended in a liquor store</a> and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/neurorestorative-2022/download" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">report</a>.</p><p>The federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/details/nursing-home/465179?state=UT&amp;measure=nursing-home-penalties" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">four times since 2022</a>. A <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/inspections/pdf/nursing-home/465179/health/complaint-inspection?date=2024-02-20" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">February 2024 inspection report</a> by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.</p><p>Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.</p><p>Similar financial maneuvering <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/investigation-reveals-how-investors-made-millions-as-steward-health-care-system-collapsed" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care</a>, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.</p><p>“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.</p><p>“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”</p><h3 id="david-vs-goliath">David vs. Goliath</h3><p>After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.</p><p>AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.</p><p>But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.</p><p>“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.</p><p>“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”</p><p>A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.</p><p>“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.</p><p>Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.</p><p>When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.</p><p>“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.</p><p>Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.</p><p>There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.</p><h3 id="state-solutions">State Solutions</h3><p>Some states have moved to <a href="https://stateline.org/2024/01/18/shell-game-when-private-equity-comes-to-town-hospitals-can-see-cutbacks-closures/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">address problems</a> with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.</p><p>In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers <a href="https://stateline.org/2024/01/18/shell-game-when-private-equity-comes-to-town-hospitals-can-see-cutbacks-closures/#:~:text=Rhode%20Island%20roadblock" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">threatened the future of local hospitals</a>, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.</p><p>More states are following suit.

        <p><em>The secrecy battle over the Army’s Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) for Sig Sauer’s P320 has followed <strong>Glasscock v. Sig Sauer</strong> to the Eighth Circuit. A media intervenor is now asking the appellate court to keep key records open—and their brief places Practical Shooting Insights (this site) squarely in the middle of the story.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-new">What’s new</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Trace intervenes in the appeal.</strong> The newsroom moved to intervene <strong>for the limited purpose of opposing</strong> sealed filings tied to class certification and the FMECA, arguing the public’s right of access and noting the district court cited the FMECA <strong>nine times</strong> when it certified the class.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-01.png" alt="Screenshot 1"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sig Sauer says “national security” and asks for deference to the Army.</strong> In opposing intervention, Sig Sauer urges the court to leave FMECA-related material sealed and to give the Army time to weigh in, framing the dispute in terms of protecting “military secrets.”</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-03.png" alt="Screenshot 3"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A second FMECA document emerges.</strong> Sig Sauer’s opposition confirms there are <strong>two</strong> FMECA records in the class-certification exhibits: a <strong>FMECA Spreadsheet</strong> and a <strong>FMECA Memorandum</strong>—the latter not previously described in public filings—raising fresh questions about what the memo contains and who authored it.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-04.png" alt="Screenshot 4"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>PSI’s reporting is part of the record.</strong> The Trace’s filing tells the court the unredacted FMECA was found on CourtListener, de‑obscured, and published on Practical Shooting Insights, where it “remains available”—and it recounts Sig Sauer’s own executive discussing it on a podcast while pointing viewers to this website.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-06.png" alt="Screenshot 6"></p>

<p>The FMECA document was previously published <a href="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/the-document-sig-sauer-doesnt-want-you-to-see-about-the-p320/">here</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-traces-pitch-this-isnt-secret-anymore">The Trace’s pitch: This isn’t secret anymore</h2>

<p>The Trace walks the appellate court through how the FMECA left the bottle: it was posted on this website and then widely republished; a YouTube explainer discussing it surpassed <strong>100,000 views</strong>. The filing quotes Sig Sauer’s VP of Consumer Affairs <strong>Phil Strader</strong> being asked on the <em>Behind the Lens</em> podcast why the FMECA shouldn’t be public and responding, <strong>“No, there’s not”</strong> (nothing to hide), while <strong>directing viewers to this website to see the document</strong> and describing its contents.</p>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-07.png" alt="Screenshot 7"></p>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-08.png" alt="Screenshot 8"></p>

<p>The reporting regarding Phil Strader’s interview was previously published <a href="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/sig-sauer-vp-consumer-affairs-discusses-the-document-they-didnt-want-you-to-see/">here</a></p>

<p><strong>How many times has the unredacted FMECA been “shared”?</strong> The filings don’t give a precise share count. What they <em>do</em> document is widespread republication and discussion, including the 100k‑plus video and multiple re‑posts mirroring the PSI copy. In other words, the genie is out of the bottle.</p>

<p>The Trace also points to <strong>DoD Instruction 5230.24</strong>, the policy Sig Sauer invokes, noting it <strong>does not authorize withholding unclassified information</strong> about <strong>evaluations of performance and reliability</strong> of military equipment—and that the PSI‑hosted FMECA <strong>bears no DoD distribution markings</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-09.png" alt="Screenshot 9"></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="sig-sauers-response-let-the-army-decideand-keep-the-lid-on">Sig Sauer’s response: Let the Army decide—and keep the lid on</h2>

<p>Sig Sauer tells the Eighth Circuit The Trace <strong>lacks standing</strong> and that parallel briefing is already underway in the district court. Substantively, Sig Sauer leans on <strong>military‑secrets</strong> concerns, requests time for the <strong>Army to opine</strong> on release, and characterizes the FMECA as controlled technical information created under the MHS contract. (The company also recounts how the spreadsheet briefly became public in another case before being pulled down.)</p>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-10.png" alt="Screenshot 10"></p>

<p>Two details in Sig Sauer’s papers matter going forward:</p>

<p>1) <strong>The “FMECA Memorandum.”</strong> Sig Sauer identifies the memo alongside the previously published spreadsheet. If the memo is Sig Sauer‑authored, it could reveal how the company framed the Army analysis internally—an issue directly relevant to notice, risk mitigation, and marketing claims.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Ongoing Army communications.</strong> Sig Sauer’s litigation counsel filed a declaration stating he asked the Army about the FMECA’s distribution status and that key Army decision‑makers were <strong>unavailable</strong> the week of the deadline; Sig Sauer says the Army may submit information and seeks additional time.</p>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-11.png" alt="Screenshot 11"></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-transparency-question-distilled">The transparency question, distilled</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Is the FMECA “national‑security” material?</strong> The Trace says <strong>no</strong>—and points to DoDI 5230.24’s carve‑out: it <strong>does not provide authority to withhold</strong> unclassified evaluations of <strong>performance and reliability</strong>—exactly what a FMECA is. It also underscores the lack of any DoD marking on the PSI copy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Is secrecy even possible at this point?</strong> The record shows the unredacted spreadsheet is <strong>online on this website</strong>, has been <strong>reposted broadly</strong>, and has been discussed by Sig Sauer’s own executive on air—who <strong>told listeners where to find it</strong>. One video discussing it has <strong>100,000+ views</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="why-this-matters-to-the-class-actionand-to-owners">Why this matters to the class action—and to owners</h2>

<p>The district court relied on the FMECA repeatedly when certifying the Missouri class, including on <strong>notice</strong> and <strong>risk‑mitigation</strong> questions—the very issues consumers care about. Keeping the heart of that analysis under seal on appeal would blunt the public’s ability to scrutinize a product‑safety fight with real‑world consequences.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="my-role-plainly">My role, plainly</h2>

<p>Practical Shooting Insights is an independent site covering the shooting‑sports and firearms industry. The Trace’s filing names PSI as the first publisher of the unredacted spreadsheet and quotes Strader pointing viewers here. I will continue to publish filings and analysis so readers can compare the arguments to the documents themselves.</p>

<p>1) <strong>Whether the Eighth Circuit permits intervention</strong> and applies the strong presumption of public access to <strong>class‑certification</strong> records.<br>
2) <strong>If the Army weighs in</strong>—and on what basis—regarding the FMECA’s distribution status.<br>
3) <strong>Disclosure of the FMECA Memorandum.</strong> If it’s Sig Sauer-authored, it could illuminate internal framing of hazards and fixes—material at the core of consumer‑protection claims.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="infoCardDek"><h3>   Why is Facebook cloud-processing my device's camera roll?   </h3><p>Meta is uploading and analyzing your camera roll photos and videos, even ones you haven't posted, in its cloud in order to generate AI-powered suggestions like collages, monthly recaps, themed albums, or AI-restyled versions of your images.   </p><h3>   Where is this feature being tested?   </h3><p>Meta has confirmed the feature is a test, saying, "We're exploring ways to make content sharing easier for people on Facebook by testing suggestions of ready-to-share and curated content from a person's camera roll."   </p><p>The test is currently available in the US and Canada, but it's not available in <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/ai-terms" rel="noopener nofollow sponsored" target="_blank"><span>Illinois or Texas</span><!----></a></span> due to those states' privacy laws.   </p><h3>   Did Facebook ask for my consent before turning this on?   </h3><p>Meta is showing a pop-up asking users if they want to enable cloud processing, but some users claim they haven't seen it. Instead, they found the toggles in their settings already switched on by default, raising questions about whether clear consent was given.   </p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="Is Meta scanning your camera roll? How to check and turn it off - right now" width="1280" height="737.28" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption> <span>Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><h3> Can I remove my photos once they've been uploaded? </h3><p>ZDNET's sister site, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/prepare-to-share-all-your-pics-with-meta-if-you-turn-on-facebooks-new-ai-photo-tool/">CNET</a>, reports that Meta pulls from your newer pictures (roughly the last 30 days) and if you disable the feature, your uploaded photos will be deleted after 30 days. The only way to confirm is by <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-protect-your-privacy-from-facebook-and-what-doesnt-work/">downloading your Facebook account data.</a></p><h3>   Why is this a potential privacy issue?   </h3><p>It expands Meta's reach beyond the content you've chosen to upload and share online -- into your private, unposted photos and videos. For many, that's a major red flag and a line they're not comfortable crossing, understandably so.   </p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/metas-personal-superintelligence-dream-leaves-much-to-the-imagination/"><strong>What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out</strong></a></p><p>Even if Meta is asking for consent to access your camera roll in order to analyze your phone's photos and provide AI-powered suggestions, the company could have done a better job of being clear and explicit about what it's trying to do.   </p><p>How many users, like me, simply dismissed the consent pop-up without fully realizing what they'd just agreed to?   </p><p><em>Editor's note: This article was updated on Aug. 24, 2025 to clarify that Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions are not turned on by default and are entirely opt-in. Still, some users say they never knowingly agreed and are finding the features enabled in their settings</em>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Anthropic sent out an email, saying they will train on personal data.  They made it sound like you have to opt in, but when I click the privacy link it defaults to on.  If you don’t want your data trained on, you better manually turn it off.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>These changes only affect Consumer accounts (Claude Free, Pro, and Max plans). If you use Claude for Work, via the API, or other services under our Commercial Terms or other Agreements, then these changes don't apply to you. </p>
