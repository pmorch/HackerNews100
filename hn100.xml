<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Microsoft has terminated the Israeli military’s access to technology it used to operate a powerful surveillance system that collected millions of Palestinian civilian phone calls made each day in Gaza and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/west-bank" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">West Bank</a>, the Guardian can reveal.</p><p>Microsoft told Israeli officials late last week that Unit 8200, the military’s elite spy agency, had violated the company’s terms of service by storing the vast trove of surveillance data in its Azure cloud platform, sources familiar with the situation said.</p><p>The decision to cut off Unit 8200’s ability to use some of its technology results directly from an investigation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud" data-link-name="in body link">published by the Guardian last month</a>. It revealed how Azure was being used to store and process the trove of Palestinian communications in a mass surveillance programme.</p><p>In a joint investigation with the Israeli-Palestinian publication<a href="https://www.972mag.com/microsoft-8200-intelligence-surveillance-cloud-azure/" data-link-name="in body link"> +972 Magazine</a> and the Hebrew-language outlet <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/%d7%9e%d7%99%d7%9c%d7%99%d7%95%d7%9f-%d7%a9%d7%99%d7%97%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%91%d7%a9%d7%a2%d7%94-%d7%94%d7%9e%d7%90%d7%92%d7%a8-%d7%a9%d7%9c-8200-%d7%a2%d7%9c-%d7%a9%d7%a8%d7%aa%d7%99-%d7%9e%d7%99/" data-link-name="in body link">Local Call</a>, the Guardian revealed how Microsoft and Unit 8200 had worked together on a plan to move large volumes of sensitive intelligence material into Azure.</p><p>The project began after a meeting in 2021 between Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, and the unit’s then commander, Yossi Sariel.</p><p>In response to the investigation, Microsoft ordered an urgent external inquiry to review its relationship with Unit 8200. Its initial findings have now led the company to cancel the unit’s access to some of its cloud storage and AI services.</p><p>Equipped with Azure’s near-limitless storage capacity and computing power, Unit 8200 had built an indiscriminate new system allowing its intelligence officers to collect, play back and analyse the content of cellular calls of an entire population.</p><p>The project was so expansive that, according to sources from Unit 8200 – which is equivalent in its remit to the US National Security Agency – a mantra emerged internally that captured its scale and ambition: “A million calls an hour.”</p><p>According to several sources, the enormous repository of intercepted calls – which amounted to as much as 8,000 terabytes of data – was held in a Microsoft datacentre in the Netherlands. Within days of the Guardian publishing the investigation, Unit 8200 appears to have swiftly moved the surveillance data out of the country.</p><p>According to sources familiar with the huge data transfer outside of the EU country, it occurred in early August. Intelligence sources said Unit 8200 planned to transfer the data to the Amazon Web Services cloud platform. Neither the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) nor Amazon responded to a request for comment.</p><p>The extraordinary decision by Microsoft to end the spy agency’s access to key technology was made amid pressure from employees and investors over its work for Israel’s military and the role its technology has played in the almost two-year offensive in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Gaza</a>.</p><p>A United Nations commission of inquiry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/israel-committed-genocide-in-gaza-says-un-inquiry" data-link-name="in body link">recently concluded</a> that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza, a charge denied by Israel but supported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/01/israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-worlds-top-scholars-on-the-say" data-link-name="in body link">many experts</a> in international law.</p><p>The Guardian’s joint investigation prompted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/26/microsoft-employee-sit-in-israeli-military-ties" data-link-name="in body link">protests at Microsoft’s US headquarters</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/10/activists-in-netherlands-protest-on-roof-of-microsoft-site-storing-israeli-military-data" data-link-name="in body link">one of its European datacentres</a>, as well as demands by a worker-led campaign group, No Azure for Apartheid, to end all ties to the Israeli military.</p><figure id="b8c99a97-a3c0-47f0-aec1-b4c2e288b1e3" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1416cde65d2a0b1d0d21744f5047812a997de5/403_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1416cde65d2a0b1d0d21744f5047812a997de5/403_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1416cde65d2a0b1d0d21744f5047812a997de5/403_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1416cde65d2a0b1d0d21744f5047812a997de5/403_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1416cde65d2a0b1d0d21744f5047812a997de5/403_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1416cde65d2a0b1d0d21744f5047812a997de5/403_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="No Azure for Apartheid demonstrators " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1416cde65d2a0b1d0d21744f5047812a997de5/403_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Demonstrators outside a Microsoft event in Seattle in May.</span> Photograph: Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>On Thursday, Microsoft’s vice-chair and president, Brad Smith, informed staff of the decision. In an email seen by the Guardian, he said the company had “ceased and disabled a set of services to a unit within the Israel ministry of defense”, including cloud storage and AI services.</p><p>Smith wrote: “We do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians. We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades.”</p><p>The decision brings to an abrupt end a three-year period in which the spy agency operated its surveillance programme using Microsoft’s technology.</p><p>Unit 8200 used its own expansive surveillance capabilities to intercept and collect the calls. The spy agency then used a customised and segregated area within the Azure platform, allowing for the data to be retained for extended periods of time and analysed using AI-driven techniques.</p><p>Although the initial focus of the surveillance system was the West Bank, where an estimated 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military occupation, intelligence sources said the cloud-based storage platform had been used in the Gaza offensive to facilitate the preparation of deadly airstrikes.</p><p>The revelations highlighted how Israel has relied on the services and infrastructure of major US technology companies to support its bombardment of Gaza, which has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and created a profound humanitarian and starvation crisis.</p><figure id="41adb301-3590-4416-b2e1-1b7e6d173af5" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.QABlockElement"><gu-island name="QandaAtom" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ea5c99b8-694b-4577-9ff6-726c78be1c34&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How many Palestinians have been killed in Israel's campaign against Gaza?&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<p>According to health officials in Gaza, at least 60,000 people have been killed during Israel’s current military campaign, launched after the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 which killed nearly 1,200 people. </p><p></p><p>The actual death toll is likely to be significantly higher, as the figure&amp;nbsp;only includes Palestinians killed by bombs or bullets whose bodies have been recovered, leaving out thousands trapped under the rubble or killed by starvation and other indirect victims of the campaign.</p><p></p><p>According to the data – which includes the deaths of militants – women, children, and elderly people account for approximately 55% of the recorded deaths.</p>&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><div data-atom-id="ea5c99b8-694b-4577-9ff6-726c78be1c34" data-atom-type="qanda"><details data-atom-id="ea5c99b8-694b-4577-9ff6-726c78be1c34" data-snippet-type="qanda"><summary><span>Q&amp;A</span><h4>How many Palestinians have been killed in Israel's campaign against Gaza?</h4><span><span><span></span>Show</span></span></summary><div><p>According to health officials in Gaza, at least 60,000 people have been killed during Israel’s current military campaign, launched after the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 which killed nearly 1,200 people. </p><p>The actual death toll is likely to be significantly higher, as the figure&nbsp;only includes Palestinians killed by bombs or bullets whose bodies have been recovered, leaving out thousands trapped under the rubble or killed by starvation and other indirect victims of the campaign.</p><p>According to the data – which includes the deaths of militants – women, children, and elderly people account for approximately 55% of the recorded deaths.</p></div></details></div></gu-island></figure><p>According to a document seen by the Guardian, a senior Microsoft executive told Israel’s ministry of defence late last week: “While our review is ongoing, we have at this juncture identified evidence that supports elements of the Guardian’s reporting.”</p><p>The executive told Israel officials that Microsoft “is not in the business of facilitating the mass surveillance of civilians” and notified them that it would “disable” access to services that supported the Unit 8200 surveillance project and suspend its use of some AI products.</p><p>The termination is the first known case of a US technology company withdrawing services provided to the Israeli military since the beginning of its war on Gaza.</p><p>The decision has not affected Microsoft’s wider commercial relationship with the IDF, which is a longstanding client and will retain access to other services.

You validate their signup, notify them about events, and send them invoices through email. The service continues to find new purpose with agentic workflows and other AI-powered tools that rely on a simple email as an input or output.</p><p>And it is a pain for developers to manage. It’s frequently the most annoying burden for most teams. Developers deserve a solution that is simple, reliable, and deeply integrated into their workflow.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we're excited to announce just that: the private beta of Email Sending, a new capability that allows you to send transactional emails directly from Cloudflare Workers. Email Sending joins and expands our popular <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/"><u>Email Routing</u></a> product, and together they form the new Cloudflare Email Service — a single, unified developer experience for all your email needs.</p><p>With Cloudflare Email Service, we’re distilling our years of experience <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/"><u>securing</u></a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/"><u>routing</u></a> emails, and combining it with the power of the developer platform. Now, sending an email is as easy as adding a binding to a Worker and calling <code>send</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {

    await env.SEND_EMAIL.send({
      to: [{ email: "<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="49212c252526092c31282439252c672a2624">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>" }],

      subject: "Hello World",
      text: "Hello World!"
    });

    return new Response(`Successfully sent email!`);
  },
};</code></pre>
            <p><b>Email experience is user experience</b></p><p>Email is a core tenet of your user experience. It’s how you stay in touch with your users when they are outside your applications. Users rely on email to inform them when they need to take actions such as password resets, purchase receipts, magic login links, and onboarding flows. When they fail, your application fails.</p><p>That means it’s crucial that emails need to land in your users’ inboxes, both reliably and quickly. A magic link that arrives ten minutes late is a lost user. An email delivered to a spam folder breaks user flows and can erode trust in your product. That’s why we’re focusing on deliverability and time-to-inbox with Cloudflare Email Service.&nbsp;</p><p>To do this, we’re tightly integrating with DNS to automatically configure the necessary DNS records — like SPF, DKIM and DMARC — such that email providers can verify your sending domain and trust your emails. Plus, in true Cloudflare fashion, Email Service is a global service. That means that we can deliver your emails with low latency anywhere in the world, without the complexity of managing servers across regions.</p><p><b>Simple and flexible for developers</b></p><p>Treating email as a core piece of your application also means building for every touchpoint in your development workflow. We’re building Email Service as part of the Cloudflare stack to make developing with email feels as natural as writing a Worker.&nbsp;</p><p>In practice, that means solving for every part of the transactional email workflow:</p><ul><li><p>Starting with Email Service is easy. Instead of managing API keys and secrets, you can use the <code>Email</code> binding to your <code>wrangler.jsonc</code> and send emails securely and with no risk of leaked credentials.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You can use Workers to process incoming mail, store attachments in R2, and add tasks to Queues to get email sending off the hot path of your application. And you can use <code>wrangler</code> to emulate Email Sending locally, allowing you to test your user journeys without jumping between tools and environments.</p></li><li><p>In production, you have clear observability over your emails with bounce rates and delivery events. And, when a user reports a missing email, you can quickly dive into the delivery status to debug issues quickly and help get your user back on track.</p></li></ul><p>We’re also making sure Email Service seamlessly fits into your existing applications. If you’ve been leaning on existing email frameworks (like <a href="https://react.email/"><u>React Email</u></a>) to send rich, HTML-rendered emails to users, you can continue to use them with Email Service. Import the library, render your template, and pass it to the <code>send</code> method just as you would elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
            <pre><code>import { render, pretty, toPlainText } from '@react-email/render';
import { SignupConfirmation } from './templates';

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {

    // Convert React Email template to html
    const html = await pretty(await render(&lt;SignupConfirmation url="https://your-domain.com/confirmation-id"/&gt;));

    // Use the Email Sending binding to send emails
    await env.SEND_EMAIL.send({
      to: [{ email: "<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="58303d343437183d20393528343d763b3735">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>" }],
      from: { email: "<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f392839ade80969d979681b38a9c8681de979c9e929a9ddd909c9e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>", name: "Welcome" },
      subject: "Signup Confirmation",
      html,
      text: toPlainText(html)
    });

    return new Response(`Successfully sent email!`);
  }
};</code></pre>
            <p><b>Email Routing and Email Sending: Better together</b></p><p>Sending email is only half the story. Applications often need to receive and parse emails to create powerful workflows. By combining Email Sending with our existing <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing"><u>Email Routing</u></a> capabilities, we're providing a complete, end-to-end solution for all your application's email needs.</p><p>Email Routing allows you to create custom email addresses on your domain and handle incoming messages programmatically with a Worker, which can enable powerful application flows such as:</p><ul><li><p>Using <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/"><u>Workers AI</u></a> to parse, summarize and even label incoming emails: flagging security events from customers, early signs of a bug or incident, and/or generating automatic responses based on those incoming emails.</p></li><li><p>Creating support tickets in systems like JIRA or Linear from emails sent to <code><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7c0f090c0c130e083c0513090e511813111d1512521f1311">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>.</p></li><li><p>Processing invoices sent to <code><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="442d2a322b2d272137043d2b313669202b29252d2a6a272b29">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> and storing attachments in R2.</p></li></ul><p>To use Email Routing, add the <code>email</code> handler to your Worker application and process it as needed:</p>
            <pre><code>export default {
  // Create an email handler to process emails delivered to your Worker
  async email(message, env, ctx) {

    // Classify incoming emails using Workers AI
    const { score, label } = env.AI.run("@cf/huggingface/distilbert-sst-2-int8", { text: message.raw" })

    env.PROCESSED_EMAILS.send({score, label, message});
  },
};  </code></pre>
            <p>When you combine inbound routing with outbound sending, you can close the loop entirely within Cloudflare. Imagine a user emails your support address. A Worker can receive the email, parse its content, call a third-party API to create a ticket, and then use the Email Sending binding to send an immediate confirmation back to the user with their ticket number. That’s the power of a unified Email Service.</p><p>Email Sending will require a paid Workers subscription, and we'll be charging based on messages sent. We're still finalizing the packaging, and we'll update our documentation, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/"><u>changelog</u></a>, and notify users as soon as we have final pricing and long before we start charging. Email Routing limits will remain unchanged.</p><p><b>What’s next</b></p><p>Email is core to your application today, and it's becoming essential for the next generation of AI agents, background tasks, and automated workflows. We built the Cloudflare Email Service to be the engine for this new era of applications, we’ll be making it available in private beta this November.</p><ul><li><p>Interested in Email Sending? <a href="https://forms.gle/BX6ECfkar3oVLQxs7"><u>Sign up to the waitlist here.</u></a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Want to start processing inbound emails?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="anchor-15e178">After hospitals were acquired by private equity firms, patient death rates in the emergency departments rose by 13% compared with similar hospitals, according to research published this week in <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-03471" target="_blank">Annals of Internal Medicine</a>.</p><p id="anchor-7ffa60">The research, which compared outcomes at hospitals over a 10-year period, adds fresh evidence to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/patients-private-equity-hospitals-more-infections-falls-jama-study-rcna130956">previous studies </a>showing harmful patient outcomes and <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/private-equity-investments-health-care-may-increase-costs-degrade-quality">higher costs</a> among health care entities owned by profit-oriented financiers. </p><p id="anchor-989875">The increased deaths in emergency departments at private equity-owned hospitals are most likely the result of reduced staffing levels after the acquisitions, which the study also measured, said Dr. Zirui Song, a co-author and associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School.</p><p id="anchor-544dcb">After hospitals were acquired by private equity, the number of full-time employees fell by an average 11.6% compared with non-private equity facilities, the research found, and salary expenditures in the emergency departments and intensive care units declined by 18% and 16%, respectively. </p><p id="anchor-22482c">“Most hospital care in the country remains a face-to-face, human, labor-intensive endeavor, especially in emergency departments and ICUs,” Song said in an interview. “When human labor is cut to this extent in staffing sensitive areas of the hospital, patient harm can plausibly ensue, including mortality.”</p><p id="anchor-e94edc"><a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/deaths-rose-emergency-rooms-after-hospitals-were-acquired-private-equity-firms">The new study</a> analyzed 1 million emergency department visits by Medicare patients at 49 private equity-owned hospitals from 2009 through 2019. The researchers compared the outcomes of those visits with more than 6 million visits at 293 matched hospitals — those of similar size and location  — not acquired by private equity. </p><p id="anchor-16f972">The study’s co-authors, in addition to Song, are José R. Zubizarreta of Harvard University, Dr. Sneha Kannan of the University of Pittsburgh, Joseph Dov Bruch of the University of Chicago and Dr. Jennifer Stevens, director of the Center for Healthcare Delivery Science at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.</p><p id="anchor-b18fb7">Song said the new research differed from previous studies on private equity’s impact, which focused on patients who were admitted to the hospital.</p><p id="anchor-9c772e">“There are far more patients who come into the emergency department than patients who are actually admitted into the wards of the hospital,” Song said, “so this study looks at a patient population that had not been examined in great depth before.”</p><p id="anchor-2378ab">Private equity firms are sophisticated financial operators that buy companies, typically loading them with large amounts of debt to pay for the acquisitions. The firms hope to sell the companies for profit a few years later.</p><p id="anchor-1e4961">The private equity industry has <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2023/nov/private-equity-role-health-care" target="_blank">poured over $1 trillion </a>into health care companies in recent years. Health care has been a focus of the financiers because it accounts for 18% of <a href="https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/nhe-fact-sheet">gross domestic product </a>in the United States.</p><p id="anchor-7320fe">Because their acquisitions add debt costs to the companies they buy, those operations must cut other expenses to offset the burden. Employees are <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-lawmakers-renew-legislative-push-to-stop-private-equity-looting" target="_blank">often the first to be fired</a>, and costs are often increased to generate higher profits. Some hospitals owned by private-equity firms sell the land under their buildings, enriching the owners but saddling the facilities with higher rent costs. </p><p id="anchor-d32c1f">Dr. Robert McNamara, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Temple University’s Lewis Katz School of Medicine, said the new research confirms what doctors in the field have long complained about: being stretched too thin by private equity owners.</p><p id="anchor-88add3">“When private equity comes in, they try to jack up the revenues and then, when that reaches an end point, they start slashing expenses,” McNamara said in an interview. “Instead of people just losing their jobs, you have bad patient outcomes here. Less staff equals worse outcomes.”</p><p id="anchor-a48c4b">The new research on increased deaths in emergency departments at private equity-owned hospitals aligns with a <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w28474">2021 study</a> that found 11% higher mortality rates at nursing homes owned by private equity. That study, by academics at New York University, the University of Chicago and the University of Pennsylvania, concluded that lower nursing staffs and declines in compliance with care standards contributed to the increased deaths at financier-owned homes.</p><p id="anchor-24fa62">Some states are enacting laws to rein in private equity’s impact on health care. In June, Oregon <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2025/06/09/bill-enacting-nations-strictest-limits-on-corporate-health-care-influence-signed-by-gov-kotek/" target="_blank">enacted a law</a> limiting the control corporations and private equity can have over health care operations.

    <p>
      I recently attended the
      <a href="https://goatmire.com/">Goatmire Elixir Conf</a>
      and one of the standout talks for me was
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sasajuric/">Saša Jurić's</a>
      <a href="https://goatmire.com/talk/tell-me-a-story">"Tell Me a Story"</a>.
      It was an incredible presentation that combined theatrical storytelling with practical technical advice. Saša performed parts of his talk in character, turning technical topics into a compelling narrative that was part comedy, part tragedy, and fully packed with useful insights I've started implementing myself. The recording will eventually be released online for viewing. I highly recommend that people watch it, and I'll endeavor to add a link to it here when it becomes available.
    </p>

    </a></p><h2>The Code Review Challenge</h2>

    <p>
      The talk focused on Code Review and Pull Requests (PRs). Saša laid out common problems most software engineers face. Too often, engineers dread code reviews even though they're a significant part of team collaboration. We avoid them because PRs tend to be too large, too complex, too difficult to comprehend, and too painful to test. So we end up commenting "Looks Good To Me" and suggesting a few minor styling improvements to give the appearance of a thorough review.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is how security leaks happen and codebases become progressively unmaintainable. Since git blame only points to the original author, it's easy to think "if something goes wrong, it's not on me". But we're all responsible for the whole system, regardless of who wrote the individual lines of code.
    </p>

    <h2>What Makes a PR Reviewable?</h2>

    <p>
      So how do we review something that feels unreviewable? Saša advocates for normalizing the practice of returning difficult-to-understand PRs to the author. This makes logical sense, but it's challenging to implement because it can feel like admitting we're not smart enough to understand the code. However, saying "I don't understand this enough to approve it" is far more valuable than pretending with an empty "LGTM".
    </p>

    <p>
      If we commit to only reviewing truly reviewable PRs, what does that look like? According to Saša, it should take the average reviewer 5-10 minutes. By 'average reviewer,' he means mid-to-senior developers who understand the domain, business, and tech stack well—not newcomers still learning the system or mythical 10x engineers.
    </p>

    <p>
      How do you create a PR that can be reviewed in 5-10 minutes? By reducing the scope. A full feature should often be multiple PRs. A good rule of thumb is 300 lines of code changes - once you get above 500 lines, you're entering unreviewable territory.
    </p>

    <h2>Telling a Story with Commits</h2>

    <p>
      A key part of having a reviewable PR is writing commits that tell a story. Present your changes incrementally and logically so reviewers can follow your thought process. Generic commit messages such as "add dependency," "implement file upload feature," and "address PR feedback" don’t tell much of a story and leave reviewers guessing. Why was the dependency added? What were the specific steps in creating the file uploader feature? What feedback is being addressed?
    </p>

    <h3>Story-Telling Commit Messages</h3>

    <p>
      After a toast to the demo gods, Saša demonstrated writing story-telling commits with a live coding example, creating a PR that was part of a larger feature. His
      <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/hamlet/pull/3">example PR</a>
      adds just 152 lines of code, removes 2 lines, but uses 13 thoughtful commits.
    </p>

    <p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/93ugurtvcfo9dp4njj8c.png" alt="image of commit messages"></p><p>
      While some developers might understand those 152 lines from the final diff alone, I couldn't confidently approve it without the commit story.
    </p>

    <h3>Breaking Down the Example</h3>

    <p>
      For instance, looking at the overall diff, I didn't understand why he added
      <code>:runtime_tools</code>
      to <code>applications</code>
      in <code>mix.exs</code>. Following the <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/hamlet/pull/3/commits/b94b851a4e8af5cd0905a70d6edc18a72d492df0">commit narrative</a>, it's clear this was needed for access to
      <code>:scheduler.get_sample()</code>
      to collect the samples. Now I can research that context or ask more pointed questions.
    </p>

    <h3>The Iterative Process</h3>

    <p>
      A huge benefit of seeing this live was witnessing the iterative process. In the <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/hamlet/pull/3/commits/299d745cb8bbaf6731098b74f3643b9472ede4b8">compute average utilization commit</a>, we initially saw an incorrect implementation that computed averages of all schedulers, including offline ones. When testing revealed unexpected results, Saša went back and updated both the code and the commit that originally implemented that function so the story remained coherent.
    </p>

    <p>
      A flow that I find to work well for keeping commit history clean is with fixup commits. A fixup is a small commit that’s explicitly marked to be folded into an earlier commit during an interactive rebase. When you run rebase with autosquash, Git automatically pairs each fixup with its target and tucks the changes into the right place, keeping the story coherent without manual reordering.
    </p>

    <p>
      I sometimes experience creating merge conflicts for myself during this process. Both Saša and I agree that if it becomes too much effort to resolve the conflict, then creating a new commit is ok. Taking the time to put in extra effort to keep the commit history clean and the story coherent makes the PR easier for reviewers to understand.
    </p>

    <h3>The Value of Clean History</h3>

    <p>
      Keeping the commit history clean connects to advice I've heard about ensuring every commit compiles and keeps the application runnable. I used to follow this loosely, but recent experiences with git bisect emphasized to me its importance. (If you are unfamiliar with
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect">git bisect</a>
      , it's worth checking out; it uses a binary search algorithm to find which commit in your project's history introduced a bug.)
    </p>

    <p>
      There are a few factors that make narrowing down when and how a regression was introduced more challenging. If a commit doesn't compile, I can't isolate whether the bug first appeared there. If the bug appeared in a commit that had hundreds of lines of code changed, determining which part of the commit is the issue requires significantly more reasoning. A clean commit history with messages that tell a story makes these kinds of investigations easier.
    </p>

    <h2>Making Review a Collaborative Success</h2>

    <p>
      When we present focused PRs with commits that tell clear stories, we get feedback sooner and our development cycles speed up. When reviewers understand our changes, we're more likely to receive valuable feedback instead of blanket approvals, and we're more likely to ship quality code. When our commits make sense, we can travel back in time as needed to understand how our codebase evolved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks to Saša's theatrical lesson, I will be more intentional about crafting commit stories. The next time you're preparing a PR, consider:
      <strong>Are you telling a story your reviewers can follow?</strong>
      Start small - maybe focus on just one aspect, like keeping PRs under that 300-line guideline or writing more descriptive commit messages. Your future reviewers (and your future debugging self) will thank you.
    </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>25 Sep 2025</p><p>I’ve spent 15 years of my life working on Bundler. When I introduce myself, people say “oh, the Bundler guy?”, and I am forced to agree.</p><p>I didn’t come up with the original idea for Bundler (that was Yehuda). I also didn’t work on the first six months worth of prototypes. That was all Carl and Yehuda together, back when “Carlhuda” was a super-prolific author of Ruby libraries, including most of the work to modularize Rails for version 3.</p><p>I joined the team at a pivotal moment, in February 2010, as the 0.9 prototype was starting to be re-written yet another time into the shape that would finally be released as 1.0. By the time Carl, Yehuda, and I released version 1.0 together in August 2010, we had fully established the structure and commands that Bundler 2.7.2 still uses today.</p><p>I gave my first conference talk about Bundler at Red Dirt Ruby in May 2010. Because they would be too busy with Rails 3 talks, Yehuda and Carl asked me to give the first RailsConf talk about Bundler, in June 2010.</p><p>As Carl and Yehuda drifted off to other projects, in 2011 and 2012 respectively, I took on a larger role, co-maintaining the project with Terence Lee, then on the Ruby platform team at Heroku. We shipped (and, embarrassingly, broke) many versions of Bundler on our way to the 1.1 release and its major speed improvements. We also gave several conference talks together, sharing what we had learned about Bundler, about gems, and about maintaining open source.</p><p>In 2013, I managed to convince the owner of <code>bundler.io</code> to sell me his domain, and rebuilt the website to host a separate copy of the documentation for every version of Bundler, ensuring even users on old versions could still access accurate documentation.</p><p>By the end of 2013, Terence had drifted away from the project as well, and I realized that everyone using Ruby was now one bus (or one lottery ticket) away from Bundler having no significant maintainers. During 2014, I made sure to settle any remaining ownership issues, including purchasing the rights to the Bundler logo, and began investigating various funding ideas. I tried specialized consulting, corporate sponsorships, and asking Ruby Central about sponsoring Bundler and RubyGems development work. Ruby Central declined, citing their desire to stay focused on conferences, but suggested that if I wanted to pursue something myself they would be happy to collaborate.</p><p>In 2015, I founded Ruby Together specifically to raise funds to pay the existing maintainers team of Bundler, RubyGems, and RubyGems.org. Over time, we were able to raise enough money to quietly but scrappily keep the entire RubyGems ecosystem maintained and functional. Ruby Together did not ever, at any point, demand any form of governance or control over the existing open source projects. Maintainers did their thing in the RubyGems and Bundler GitHub orgs, while Ruby Together staff and board members did their thing in the rubytogether GitHub org.</p><p>By 2021, when Ruby Central and Ruby Together were both interested in merging together, funds were harder to find. Ruby Together had a membership program. Ruby Central wanted a to have a membership program. The confusing split between “Ruby Central owns the AWS account, but Ruby Together pays all the devs” continued to be a problem.</p><p>We prepared <a href="https://andre.arko.net/2025/09/25/bundler-belongs-to-the-ruby-community/merger-agreement.pdf">a merger agreement</a> (which you can read in full at the link), stating that Ruby Central’s new goal after the merger would be “paying maintainers to do the programming”. The agreement also states that Ruby Central will follow Ruby Together’s <a href="https://github.com/rubycentral/board/blob/38904a634d5993e244911087efdaa54811d2d516/VISION_MISSON_VALUES.md">Vision, Mission, and Values</a>, a document that is hosted in the rubycentral GitHub organization today. That document includes a very specific list of goals, including:</p><ul><li>Project users and maintainers are empowered to decide what’s best for their projects</li><li>Ruby open source developers are paid for their work</li><li>Give control to the community</li><li>Be accountable and transparent to the community</li><li>Establish a collaborative, positive space for projects</li><li>Have a clear and transparent funding process</li></ul><p>You can read much more in both the merger agreement and in the Mission, Vision, and Values document, but the fundamental goal for both the non-profit and the open source projects is clear: this is all for the Ruby community. Without the community, there is no point to this work, and there is no way it could ever have been done in the first place. Without the 354 individuals who contributed to Bundler and to RubyGems, I could never have become “the Bundler guy” in the first place.</p><p>In the last few weeks, Ruby Central has <a href="https://joel.drapper.me/p/rubygems-takeover/">suddenly asserted</a> that they alone own Bundler. That simply isn’t true. In order to defend the reputation of the team of maintainers who have given so much time and energy to the project, I have registered my existing trademark on the Bundler project.</p><p>Trademarks do not affect copyright, which stays with the original contributors unchanged. Trademarks do not affect license terms, which stay MIT and unchanged. Trademarks only impact one thing: who is allowed say that what they make is named “Bundler”. Ruby Central is welcome to the code, just like everyone else. They are not welcome to the project name that the Bundler maintainers have painstakingly created over the last 15 years.</p><p>While the trademark has been registered under my name as an individual, I will not keep it for myself, because the idea of Bundler belongs to the Ruby community. Once there is a Ruby organization that is accountable to the maintainers, and accountable to the community, with openly and democratically elected board members, I commit to transfer my trademark to that organization.</p><p>I will not license the trademark, and will instead transfer ownership entirely. Bundler should belong to the community, and I want to make sure that is true for as long as Bundler exists.</p><p>My time to write is sponsored by <a href="https://spinel.coop/">Spinel</a>.

<h3>Sep 25 2025</h3>


<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/rEpvdWFczQ" alt=""></p>

<p>These days the internet as a whole is mostly constructed out of point to point ethernet circuits, meaning an ethernet interface (mostly optical) attached directly from one routing device to another routing device.</p>

<p>However that is not always the case, as the humble “internet exchange” (IX) still exists, and while the relevancy of IXs are progressively being diminished by the internet increasingly being concentrated into a small handful of content networks and IXs not keeping up with the lowering price of transit or private fiber connections to the largest networks, there are still a large number of networks that’s attached to at least one IX fabric.</p>

<p>IXs are a little bit strange, as they are at their core practically identical to a simple ethernet switch you may find in your home or office (except your home switch is unlikely to be doing terabits per second of traffic). As IXs depend on the ethernet switches interest in only being the MAC addresses of traffic and not the Layer 3 IP addresses.</p>

<p>However home and small and medium business (SMB) routers often come with defaults that make life a lot easier for networks way of desktop computers and common office equipment on them, these same defaults are at the very least annoying and at the very worst actively exploitable if put on a IX LAN with many untrusted participants.</p>

<h2>bgp.tools “naughty packets” feature</h2>

<p>The company that I run and operate has a large number of ports at internet exchanges (at a rough estimate I am the top 13 of all networks on the internet in this metric!), and alongside the route collecting that bgp.tools does on these IX ports, it also listens in on the broadcast and multicast traffic that happens on these exchanges.</p>

<p>This isn’t that magical, at its core it works by running tcpdump on each IX port, and picking up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast,_unknown-unicast_and_multicast_traffic">BUM traffic</a>, parsing what it is looking at (and throwing away the unknown unicast, since that is a separate common problem that I don’t want to get involved with), and reporting that data back up the chain to bgp.tools’s website.</p>

<p>This creates little warning icons (or alerts if they use the monitoring product) on their IX membership rows to let them and others know that something is not configured correctly</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/CNsNutZ5sl" alt=""></p>

<p>When I first started off developing this feature I was basically going off the top of my head on what the obvious mistakes that were likely to happen on misconfigured IX ports. However at the same time I developed a “miscellaneous packets” feed that collected packets that I didn’t have code to deal with.</p>

<h2>Here are all of the things that have found</h2>

<p>Checking that miscellaneous packet feed every week has been a lot of fun and deeply terrifying on what networks have been sending into exchanges. Here are some of the things that bgp.tools finds on a regular basis</p>

<h2>Router/Switch Identification</h2>

<p>With large deployments of routers and switches it is often very difficult to actually locate where each device is plugged into at either end. For this exact reason, many vendors ship protocols that emit various identifier packets that are designed to help operations teams identify the “far side” of each port</p>

<h3>LLDP</h3>

<p>Commonness: Low</p>

<p>Operational Danger: Low</p>

<p>Security Danger: Information Disclosure</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Layer_Discovery_Protocol">Link Layer Discovery Protocol</a> is a pretty common cross vendor protocol for doing exactly this, it is also sometimes used to automatically configure capabilities like higher wattage power over ethernet.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a LLDP packet (and what information it discloses) from my own network:</p>

<pre><code>root@blah:~# lldpctl 
------------------------------------------------------------------
LLDP neighbors:

      MAU oper type: 10GigBaseCX4 - X copper over 8 pair 100-Ohm balanced cable
</code></pre>

<h3>CDP</h3>

<p>Commonness: High</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: Information Disclosure</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Discovery_Protocol">Cisco Discovery Protocol</a> is a older and proprietary to Cisco (although that does not stop many vendors from having copied it) version of LLDP</p>

<h3>MNDP</h3>

<p>Commonness: High</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: Information Disclosure</p>

<p>The popular budget network equipment vendor Mikrotik ships by default with a feature called “<a href="https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/ROS/pages/24805517/Neighbor+discovery">Mikrotik Neighbor Discovery Protocol</a>” enabled by default.</p>

<p>Here is an example decoded MNDP packet from a network on FranceIX</p>

<pre><code>    Seq: 134398
    MAC Address: 08:55:31:1b:9c:aa
    Identity: DC2.A23.CCR02
    Version: 6.49.6 (stable)
    Platform: MikroTik
    Uptime: 2239h52m39s
    SoftwareID: HBWH-7QHV
    Board: CCR1009-7G-1C-1S+
    IPv6Address: 2001:7f8:54::1:85
    InterfaceName: FRANCE_IX
    IPv4Address: 37.49.237.85
</code></pre>

<p>We can see what they named the device , what type of device it is, the interface name (FRANCE_IX), and the device uptime.</p>

<h2>Automatic Addressing</h2>

<p>Most consumer devices when they come on the network do not know what IP address/gateway they are supposed to be using, This is because in most environments you do not want to have machines that have statically configured addresses.</p>

<p>However IX’s are not these kinds of environments, as they are environments where all participants have been assigned a very specific IP address to use on the LAN. This does not stop these automatic IP address assignment protocols from attempting to grab IP addresses with some configurations.</p>

<h3>DHCP / DHCPv6</h3>

<p>Commonness: Medium</p>

<p>Operational Danger: High</p>

<p>Security Danger: Targeted traffic redirection</p>

<p>This is the exact same protocol that your mobile phone or laptop is using, just being blasted out to terabit/s per second switching fabrics. When a IX participant is asking for addresses with DHCP on the exchange, any one of the entities connected (some of which may be considered adversaries of your state) could reply to their request and assign them an IP address and default gateway, the latter possibly redirecting large amounts of traffic through them!</p>

<h3>IPv6 RA</h3>

<p>Commonness: High</p>

<p>Operational Danger: People using your network for free</p>

<p>Security Danger: Low</p>

<p>IPv6 Router Advertisement is a protocol where routers periodically announced onto the LAN but they are capable of acting as a gateway (and optionally include instructions for clients to generate IPv6 addresses automatically), this is useful for IPv6 deployment, but this behavior is absolutely not desirable on internet exchanges as you do not want to have people use you as a gateway for the entire internet over peering LANs, as effectively giving them free internet transit, which is typically bad for business.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this feature is enabled by default on Cisco and Arista, meaning it is so common that bgp.tools has a dedicated icon for it on the site.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/K0278APdn0" alt=""></p>

<h2>Non BGP Routing Protocols</h2>

<p>On exchanges there is generally only one accepted routing protocol that is allowed to be used between members and that is BGP. However that does not seem to stop other networks from accidentally enabling other protocols, some of which automatically “flood” messages to broadcast so they can look for peers to automatically establish relationships with.</p>

<h3>OSPF and IS-IS / ES-IS</h3>

<p>Commonness: Low</p>

<p>Operational Danger: You will import other peoples internal routes</p>

<p>Security Danger: People can insert routes into your network</p>

<p>OSPF and IS-IS are the classic internal routing protocols that a lot of networks use to manage their internal routing table. This internal routing table is where the more specific routes for individual customers or subscriber pools exist.</p>

<p>While OSPF and IS-IS offer an ability to restrict sessions that are automatically started without a given password in configuration, a decent number of networks do not use this feature.</p>

<p>The result of this is if these networks without a password configured meet each other on the internet exchange with OSPF/IS-IS configured they will automatically exchange internal routing tables of each other, the effects of this could range between a security risk because an attacker could inject routes into their internet routing table, all the way to a full blown outage as there would be overlap in internal network routes.</p>

<h3>RIP / RIPv2</h3>

<p>Commonness: Rare</p>

<p>Operational Danger: You will import other peoples internal routes</p>

<p>Security Danger: People can insert routes into your network</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_Information_Protocol">Routing Information Protocol</a> is a very old way of doing what OSPF and IS-IS does on most modern networks today.</p>

<p>RIP and RIPv2 have similar automatic peer configuration features, meaning that if two or more members on an internet exchange have this configured they will almost certainly automatically merge their internal routing tables.</p>

<h3>MPLS LDP</h3>

<p>Commonness: Rare</p>

<p>Operational Danger: People can manipulate MPLS labels</p>

<p>Security Danger: People can manipulate MPLS labels</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching">MultiProtocol Label Switching</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Label_Distribution_Protocol">Label Distribution Protocol</a> is a different type of internal routing protocol that rather than dealing with IP prefixes, handles the exchange of MPLS Labels. Given that a lot of networks deploy MPLS as the core way of moving data around in their network, exposing this to another untrusted party is pretty bad.</p>

<h3>Various vendors loop testing protocols</h3>

<p>Commonness: Low</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: None</p>

<p>Quite a lot of vendors have their own form of proprietary ethernet loop detection, which often involve sending out probing packets into the LAN and seeing if they arrive back on any other interface (which would indicate a loop)</p>

<p>For example, here is a loop testing packet from a Huawei device</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/JxgJqqOCjv" alt=""></p>

<h3>Spanning Tree (of various flavors)</h3>

<p>Commonness: Medium</p>

<p>Operational Danger: Local disruption</p>

<p>Security Danger: None</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol">Spanning Tree Protocol</a> is a very common default that is enabled across most ethernet switches to combat ethernet loops. However accepting STP packets and sending them to other members of the exchange could result in disruption to the peer, as both sides try to agree a hierarchy with each other.</p>

<h2>The problem with SONiC</h2>

<p>SONiC is an open source network operating system (NOS) developed mostly by Microsoft, this is notable because almost all network operating systems are proprietary with no source code available. There are many reasons for this but one of the primary ones is that while there are many networking equipment vendors out there, the actual fundamental ASIC/Chips suppliers that are used to build high end equipment are limited down to around 3, with the majority of the market share being Broadcom. SONiC has in recent years become the most well known by name open source NOS.</p>

<p>Unfortunately SONiC is also just not a very good pick for almost all users, and mortally let down by its software quality. An example of this is a script called <a href="https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage/blob/0fa211d531766b953ce280d21c56075f7b2a85b4/files/scripts/arp_update#L71">arp_update</a> that transmits a “Ping all IPv6 devices” packet to all connected LANs so that it can work around a potential limitation in the hardware that it supports. This is a nuisance on internet exchanges because once there are more than a handful of these devices on the exchange, every one is spending a non zero amount of resources responding to pointless pings.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/xOEbXGIlJQ" alt=""></p>

<p>It’s hard for me to understate how crap of a workaround this is, and how much more crap this is for devices with internet exchange ports.</p>

<h2>Weird misc stuff that should not be on internet exchanges</h2>

<p>There is a final category for things that are kind of just bizarre to see. They are just things that should not actually appear at all on any internet exchange port, and suggest something strange has happened. Either with unexpected devices being connected into the exchange fabric entirely, or very inadvisable configurations being used for public “network edge” ports.</p>

<h3>Broadcast NTP</h3>

<p>Commonness: Low</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: None</p>

<p>While Network Time Protocol is very common, most of the time it is configured in a unicast way (meaning that a device deliberately queries a NTP peer), however there is a lesser used broadcast mode where a server broadcasts the time into the LAN on regular intervals.</p>

<p>Unfortunately some networks have decided to enable this on their internet exchange ports, meaning that all members are receiving (but are unlikely using) these packets.</p>

<p>It doesn’t help that almost every single time I have seen one of these situations, the time being broadcast itself is wrong by at least a few days implying that a device itself does not actually have a good source of time, and it’s just drifting from it’s original set up</p>

<h3>MikroTik Winbox / MAC-Telnet</h3>

<p>Commonness: Medium</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: Exposure of a remote configuration interface to untrusted networks</p>

<p>Once again our friend MikroTik comes back with some interesting defaults, In this case the RoMON protocol that allows their GUI management interface (WinBox), and the ability to “telnet” into a neighboring device with just its MAC address.</p>

<p>The logic behind the telnet feature is that it is useful for when you need to go to recover a device that you may have accidentally set a bad firewall or IP address/routing configuration on. However that does also mean that bgp.tools has traces of people using this telnet feature (which often broadcasts keystrokes and outputs) to all members. Implying that some networks are using the IX LAN (presumably by borrowing another member’s router) as a recovery mechanism for their misconfigurations.</p>

<h3>DEC-MOP</h3>

<p>Commonness: Medium</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: Exposure of a legacy protocol to untrusted networks</p>

<p>The Digital Equipment Corporation (Yes, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">PDP-11 company</a>) developed a series of network protocols called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECnet">DECnet</a>. While it is unlikely that you will ever encounter a device that needs DECNet support, Cisco by default enables this protocol on all interfaces (unless explicitly configured otherwise) on all enterprise software versions for IOS/IOS-XE.</p>

<h3>SSDP (UPNP)</h3>

<p>Commonness: Rare</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: Allowing untrusted networks to configure your device</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol">Simple Service Discovery Protocol</a> and its’s most common implementation use case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play">Universal Plug and Play</a> is a protocol normally only ever found in the home/residential networking space. It allows for simple configuration for things like port forwarding. Since no one should be connecting such hardware to IX LANs, this is generally a sign of a serious misconfiguration.</p>

<h3>LLMNR / MDNS</h3>

<p>Commonness: Rare</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: Information Disclosure</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS">Multicast DNS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-Local_Multicast_Name_Resolution">Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution</a> are protocols used mostly by desktop computers to locate other things on the network (typically home or small biz networks) by name.</p>

<p>MDNS is also very common in the automatic discovery of network printers, it also happens to be what I discovered the most on various exchanges</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/tRNR9Q6zSi" alt=""></p>

<p>While this is obviously ridiculous that a printer would be attached to an IX, what is likely actually happening here is that linux distributions like Debian will/would offer a “print server” role enabled by default. Since Linux “software routers” based on Debian are common in some regions, it doesn’t necessarily surprise me that these routers were installed with the print server role left enabled by mistake when they the operating system was installed.</p>

<h3>NETBIOS</h3>

<p>Commonness: Rare</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: The exposure of Windows or SMB to untrusted networks</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS">NETBIOS</a> is often used to power SMB/Samba, the Windows file and printer sharing protocol.</p>

<p>When I first encountered this packet I assumed that this was going to be a windows server configuration that had been let onto the exchanged by mistake, as encountering windows servers acting as edge routers is unheard of (although <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/flexing-windows-rras-bgp-stack-ipv6">windows does actually have a bgp implementation</a>, it is not designed for edge peering and so would make an extremely poor edge router)</p>

<p>Upon further inspection of the packets it appears that what has actually happened here (at least 6 different times) is desktops/laptops have been let into the exchange instead. I can tell this because windows will automatically generate host names like <code>SERVER-ABCD1234</code> for windows server installations, and <code>DESKTOP-ABCD1234</code> for desktop/laptop ones, and NETBIOS packets often include the hostname of the system that is querying.</p>

<p>I can only assume this has happened due to incorrect physical cable patching or VLAN translation.</p>

<h3>VRRP/HSRP</h3>

<p>Commonness: Low</p>

<p>Operational Danger: Untrusted networks could trigger failover of your routers</p>

<p>Security Danger: None</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Router_Redundancy_Protocol">Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Standby_Router_Protocol">Hot Standby Router Protocol</a> are protocols that are designed to allow two routers to automatically take over from another if they fail. To do this the protocol sends packets on a regular interval into the LAN that has the gateway ip address that is being protected from downtime.</p>

<p>While redundancy is obviously desired on exchanges, this is typically done by actually attaching two discrete routers to the exchange with different LAN IP addresses, so VRRP and similar protocols are not appreciated configurations.</p>

<h2>DNS-Broadcast</h2>

<p>Commonness: Medium</p>

<p>Operational Danger: Embarrassment</p>

<p>Security Danger: Information disclosure</p>

<p>When Cisco devices are unable to find a working DNS resolver, they resort to broadcasting the DNS query on all interfaces, Most of the time this just means that the Cisco licensing server (the “cslu-local”) is queried for, with an added bonus of the owners <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_domain">DNS search domain</a> (if they have configured one)</p>

<p>So filtering for these packets is quite easy, and results in pretty much exactly what you would think.</p>

<pre><code>$ tcpdump -nr dns.pcap |&amp; pcregrep -o1 '\] A{1,4}\? ([^\)]+)' | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 15
    875 cslu-local.{CORP-F}
    998 cslu-local.{CORP-F}
   1162 tools.cisco.com.{Military-A}.
   1648 cslu-local.{CORP-G}
   1659 cslu-local.{CORP-F}
   1880 cslu-local.{CORP-E}
   2088 tools.cisco.com.{CORP-A}.
   2910 cslu-local.{CORP-D}
   4213 cslu-local.{Military-A}.
   5125 cslu-local.{CORP-C}.com.
   5515 cslu-local.{CORP-B}.fr.
   7367 cslu-local.{CORP-A}.com.
   7675 tools.cisco.com.
   9934 cslu-local.{Military-A}
  10838 cslu-local.

<p>Except Cisco also has another interesting default back from the days when Cisco sold dedicated terminal servers where you would dial into the device (over the phone), and then type the device name you were looking to connect to.</p>

<p>In practice everybody should be disabling this function in 2025, however by default it is enabled, so if you log into the Cisco CLI and make a typo (let’s say for this example you forgot the you’re on a cisco rather than a huawei), this happens:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/Ezr9GDVR1J" alt=""></p>

<p>The CLI just hangs, as it broadcasts your typo onto all interfaces…</p>

<p>Anyway with a little bit of careful processing we can see all of these typos and sometimes the search domain from where they came from:</p>

<pre><code>$ tcpdump -nr dns.pcap |&amp; pcregrep -o1 '\] A{1,4}\? ([^\)]+)' | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | egrep -v  'cslu|tools.cisco.com'

      1 conft.powernet.net.br.

<p>There is of course an added danger while having this enabled that you could actually answer these queries and then trick an operator into typing into a terminal that you control. But I suspect that almost all operators would notice something like that happening, making such a trick difficult to pull off.</p>

<h2>How can IXs prevent this?</h2>

<p>While pretty much all exchanges have rules that define the kind of traffic that you are allowed to be sent into the internet exchange fabric that would forbid almost all of these types of packets from being sent ( For example, here is <a href="https://www.ams-ix.net/ams/documentation/allowed-traffic">AMS-IX’s list of rules</a> ), enforcement of these rules is nonexistent in most exchanges.</p>

<p>Which is a shame really because a lot of this can be automatically done with simple access control lists (ACLs) that target just mac addresses alone.</p>

<p>DEC-MOP, RoMON, STP, CDP, IS-IS, ES-IS, LLDP, VRRP, OSPF, IPv6 RA are remarkably common, and yet they use specific MAC address destinations that could just be filtered out on all ports, preventing them from being seen by other IX participants.</p>

<p>While [LLMNR, NetBIOS, PIM, LDP, MDNS, DHCPv4 /DHCPv6, SSDP, DNS-Broadcast, Broadcast NTP, MikroTik Discovery] do require the IX device to be able to inspect Layer 3 headers like UDP port numbers in ACLs, this feature is very common among deployed hardware in the industry.</p>

<p>Even if exchanges are not able to automatically enforce policy using ACLs, there are open source projects like <a href="https://github.com/euro-ix/IXP-Watch">IXP-Watch</a> and systems like bgp.tools that will monitor this for you.</p>

<p>There shouldn’t really be an excuse for things to be this way!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>A tech-savvy San Francisco resident has sparked conversation online after he shared a perplexing discovery about his LG washing machine's seemingly voracious appetite for data on X (formerly <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/twitter">Twitter</a>).</p><p>In a post with more than 7 million views, Johnie Lee shared a screenshot of his machine's data usage, which showed around 3.6GB of daily data usage. For context, 3GB of data is the rough equivalent of streaming high-definition video for an hour on a device.</p><p>A spokesperson for LG told <em>Newsweek</em>: "LG has connected with the customer regarding the high-traffic data concern and is actively investigating to understand the root of this unusual occurrence.</p><p>"Following the spike, the washer has shown reduced traffic data. Despite this being an isolated incident, LG remains committed to investigating the underlying cause."</p><div><p><img id="8338685" clicktodisplay="false" showcredit="true" credit="RossHelen/Getty Images" alt="Washing machine" caption="A picture of a washing machine with a smartphone in the foreground.

The connection to a Wi-Fi network allows the user to operate functions from a smartphone, download additional wash programs, and receive alerts when a load is complete.</p><p>But Lee, a home automation and tech enthusiast, stumbled upon the anomaly while troubleshooting issues with his home network.</p><p>"I had noticed at the beginning of January that my Internet was running a little slow and my network was behaving a little weird," he told <em>Newsweek</em>. "On January 8, I was looking through the router logs to see what devices were using the most bandwidth. Besides the usual suspects, I noticed that my LG Washing Machine had the fourth-highest usage of data for the week. This was highly suspicious."</p><p>In September 2023, the U.K.-based consumer awareness publication Which? reported the results of a study into the data our smart devices use and collect. Results found that smart washing machines are collecting a significant amount of user data, including personal information such as date of birth, location, and even access to photos.</p><p>There is no evidence that the data is being sold to third parties, but the prolonged lifespan of washing machines has begun to raise questions about long-term data tracking.</p><div><p><img id="8338688" clicktodisplay="false" showcredit="true" credit="@Johnie/X" alt="Washing machine" caption="A screenshot of the washing machine data that shows around 3.6GB of data use a day." sourcealt="@Johnie/X" sources="[]" fetchpriority="auto" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2338688-washing-machine.png?w=1600&amp;quality=75&amp;webp=1 1x" src="https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2338688-washing-machine.png?w=1600&amp;quality=75&amp;webp=1"></p></div><p>The Which? article said that LG washing machines require users to provide their date of birth to use the associated app, while Samsung and Miele request access to photos and location data. They advised users to review the privacy policies and settings of smart devices, to ensure they fully understand and can potentially limit the data being collected in their home.</p><p>Lee is keen to embrace technological advances in everyday life but was baffled by the behavior of the washing machine and shared what he had found on X, hoping to prompt a laugh or two with his followers.</p><p>"When I discovered the data usage, it was such a surreal moment that I felt like sharing with my small network on X to share in the bafflement and have a collective laugh at my dirty laundry misfortunes," he said. "I never expected it to blow up the way it did."</p><p>The unexpected attention prompted a wave of reactions and jokes, touching on issues including AI, bitcoin, privacy, downloadable content (DLC), and the ever-growing impact of technology on our lives.</p><p>Alongside the jokes, the discovery prompted conversation around the trade-offs between privacy and convenience as our lives become increasingly connected with data and data collection.</p></article></div>]]></description>

A writer Dan Okrent taught his friends a new game: players picked a fantasy baseball team from the pool of real-life baseball players.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-174160086" href="https://shreyashariharan.substack.com/p/how-did-sports-betting-become-legal#footnote-1-174160086" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> You win by being the best at predicting what your handpicked baseball players will do in the actual game. This game was called fantasy baseball.</span></p><p>Fantasy play spread to other sports like basketball and football. People bet small amounts of money to participate in fantasy sports contests with their friends. Those who chose the best performing fantasy teams got to keep the pot.</p><p>It was primarily a fun social activity you’d do with your friends.</p><p><span>In 1992, New Jersey Senator and former basketball player </span><strong>Bill Bradley</strong><span> sponsored a Federal law called PASPA, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act. This law banned most states from legalizing sports books: businesses that set odds, accepted wagers, and paid out winnings on sports games.</span></p><p>Bradley, a former NBA player and principled senator, believed that gambling corrupted the integrity of sports. It could lead to match fixing, point shaving, and unfair influence.</p><p>PASPA passed with broad, bipartisan support: 88-5 in the Senate and by a voice vote in the House. A voice vote is when lawmakers shout “aye” or “no”, reserved for uncontroversial proposals. The experts thought sports gambling was a problem, and the public didn’t care about it much.</p><p>The law was unusual in its wording: it didn't explicitly make sports betting a federal crime for individuals, but it stopped states from legalizing it. PASPA was crafted to avoid opposition from states where sports betting already existed, like Nevada, Delaware, Oregon, and Montana. It blocked other states from passing new laws that would legalize and regulate sports gambling. Twenty five years later, this wording is what led to the undoing of PASPA when New Jersey wanted to legalize sports betting.</p><p>In the meantime, fantasy sports continued to gain popularity through the 90s and 2000s. Fantasy sports expanded from small circles of die-hard sports fans to a national pastime, played in high schools and colleges, debated in office break rooms, and argued over at Thanksgiving dinners.</p><p><span>In 2009, a company in Scotland was created called FanDuel that introduced </span><strong>daily</strong><span> fantasy sports. Before FanDuel, players would draft a fantasy team just once before the season started and have points accumulate through the season. Daily fantasy sports introduced daily contests: players could draft a new team every day for the game that is being played that day. Instead of just competing with your friends, the prize pool was now a large global jackpot aggregated among millions of FanDuel users who you did not know. In 2012, DraftKings was founded to compete with FanDuel.</span></p><p>Fantasy sports extended from primarily a social activity to a money-making activity.</p><p><span>FanDuel and DraftKings began spending heavily on TV ads. In the 2015 NFL season, they </span><a href="https://archive.is/G8lPo" rel="">spent $27 million</a><span> on 8,000 television spots, outspending the entire beer industry. These were crude ads, most of them being testimonials about people who won big; the kind that bragged “I turned five bucks into fifty thousand”.</span></p><p>The ads caught the eyes of regulators. Isn’t this sports gambling? How was this on TV screens when sports gambling was illegal?</p><p>In 2015, the attorneys general of New York and Illinois ordered that FanDuel and DraftKings had to cease and desist fantasy sports contests since they were considered to be sports gambling.</p><p><span>In response to the crackdown, FanDuel and DraftKings hired </span><strong>Jeremy Kudon</strong><span>, a partner at </span><a href="https://www.orrick.com/" rel="">Orrick</a><span>, a New York law firm that lobbies legislatures on behalf of clients. Kudon had a challenging job. PASPA, which was passed in 1992, effectively banned sports betting.</span></p><p>Kodon viewed that the best path to influence national policy was working through state legislatures. By winning over several states, you can eventually shift national policy.</p><p><span>His strategy was to initially focus on smaller and male-dominated legislatures like Kansas because it would be easier to explain the issue:</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-174160086" href="https://shreyashariharan.substack.com/p/how-did-sports-betting-become-legal#footnote-2-174160086" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><blockquote><p>“A lot of women would say, ‘I have no idea what you’re talking about. That just sounds like gambling.’ The men would say, ‘I do fantasy sports. You’re telling me this is gambling? There’s no way this is gambling. I do this with my friends.’”</p></blockquote><p>His argument to state legislatures was that fantasy sports is a game of skill like a golf tournament, not a game of luck like a slot machine. To prove this, he worked with an economist to show that the best fantasy football players are better at building teams than any real NFL general manager.</p><p>Kansas was the first state to explicitly legalize daily fantasy sports. After Kansas, Kudon persuaded 22 more states to allow fantasy sports.</p><p><span>Sports betting was still illegal under PASPA, but it was prevalent in New Jersey. About </span><a href="https://www.nj.gov/oag/ge/2023news/PrevalenceReport2023Final.pdf" rel="">half</a><span> of today’s sports bettors in New Jersey used to bet on sports when it was illegal. Minor bookies would pass out cards with spreads for sports fans to bet on. Illegal bookies operated quietly, taking bets in diners, corner stores, and high schools.</span></p><p><span>In 2007, Rudy Garcia, a New Jersey politician, went to do something that was common in Jersey: place a sports bet with a local bookie. However, this bookie was part of an FBI sting operation, so Garcia was </span><a href="https://observer.com/2007/03/ex-assemblyman-faces-arrest-on-money-laundering-charges/" rel="">indicted</a><span> for criminal activity and forced out of politics.</span></p><p>Ray Lesniak, a New Jersey senator, who was a close friend and ally of Garcia, was shocked at how unfair the case was. After all, sports betting was a harmless pastime in Jersey. He decided to take on the cause of legalizing sports betting in New Jersey.</p><p><span>To change New Jersey state law, Lesniak needed the help of the then governor </span><strong>Chris Christie.</strong><span> But the two didn’t get along, and Christie backed the sports betting ban at the time.</span></p><p>Blocked at the statehouse, Lesniak turned to the public. He proposed a referendum asking voters if sports betting should be legalized. When nearly a million residents cast their ballots, two-thirds voted for. The vote had no legislative effect and was largely a publicity stunt, but it worked. Christie, a big sports fan who occasionally bet on games in high school, was pragmatic and decided to change course.</p><p>When asked why he changed his position on sports betting, Christie said:²</p><blockquote><p>“When you look at the black market of sports betting, there are billions of dollars bet every year. Legitimizing that already ongoing activity would create economic activity for the state.” </p></blockquote><p>Christie thought that Senator Bill Bradley, who sponsored PASPA, was “extraordinarily naive” with his rationale for maintaining the ban on sports betting.</p><p>Two weeks after the referendum, Lesniak introduced the Sports Wagering Act (2012) which allowed sports betting in New Jersey, and Christie signed it into law.</p><p><span>Immediately after the 2012 Sports Wagering Act was signed, the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, and NCAA sued New Jersey, arguing that this act violated federal law PASPA. To defend New Jersey’s case, Christie approached </span><strong>Ted Olson</strong><span>, a legendary constitutional lawyer.</span></p><p>By the time Olson was challenging PASPA, it was in force for 20 years without being challenged. At the time, he thought:²</p><blockquote><p>“The desire to pass this statute was perceived as doing good: to stop people from betting on sports, to stop the potential corruption of athletes and the temptation put before them. Why will the Supreme Court get involved now?”</p></blockquote><p><span>But the Supreme Court had been drifting in a new direction for a while and Ted Olson helped it drift. In the 1980s, Olson was a prominent member of the </span><a href="https://fedsoc.org/bio/theodore-olson" rel="">Federalist Society</a><span>, which believed that the constitution should be understood as it was originally written, rather than as a “living document” that evolves with modern values. Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett were all part of the Federalist Society at different periods, and groomed to be Supreme Court justices. Olson was an influential leader in the same club as the Supreme Court judges who would decide if PASPA should be repealed. Christie hired Olson because his presence showed that New Jersey’s case should be taken seriously.</span></p><p>Olson’s argument was that Congress had overstepped. PASPA told states that they cannot authorize sports gambling, but they would have to enforce the ban themselves. Under the anti-commandeering doctrine of the constitution, Congress cannot compel states to do something. Congress can legislate on people, not states. </p><p>Under PASPA, Congress didn’t ban individuals from betting on sports, which it could have done under the Interstate Commerce Clause. It also didn’t provide the federal regulatory muscle to enforce the sports betting ban. In contrast, for example, when Congress passed the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, it created a federal regulatory regime (the FAA) to enforce airline rules directly, rather than compel states to do it.</p><p><span>Olson, however, lost his first two cases in the lower courts and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The courts said that New Jersey’s 2012 Sports Wagering Act was exactly what PASPA prohibited: a state “authorizing” sports betting, and federal law supersedes state law under the </span><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artVI-C2-1/ALDE_00013395/" rel="">Supremacy Clause</a><span> of the constitution. The NCAA lawyers effectively argued this:²</span></p><blockquote><p>“We aren’t saying you have to enforce the prohibition. We aren’t saying you need to do anything to prevent sports gambling. You just can’t legalize it.”</p></blockquote><p>While PASPA blocked states from legalizing sports betting, it didn’t force them to regulate it. A minor difference, but not commandeering.</p><p>Christie took this as an opportunity to do something clever. In 2014, New Jersey passed a new law that repealed the state’s own previous regulation on sports betting. They didn’t create licenses or regulate it; they just removed the prior ban. The state took the hands-off position: they weren’t going to formally legalize or regulate sports betting, but they weren’t going to prevent it. Now, if the leagues sued New Jersey, the state could argue that it hadn’t authorized sports betting at all; it had merely stepped aside.</p><p>As expected, the leagues sued. They argued that even this partial repeal authorized sports gambling. The commissioner of the NFL Roger Goodell told Chris Christie:²</p><blockquote><p>“You’ve got to drop the case because we’re going to embarrass you.” </p></blockquote><p>The early rounds went badly. Olson lost four more cases in the lower courts and Christie spent $6 million in public funds. But Olson knew that if they petition for the Supreme Court to hear their case, they had a good shot at getting accepted.</p><p>Olson was right. In June 2017, the Supreme Court agreed to hear New Jersey’s case. </p><p><span>On December 4th, 2017, Olson argued New Jersey’s case in the Supreme Court. Supreme Court cases aren’t like courtroom dramas you see on TV, but more like a press conference with nine hostile reporters who are constantly interrupting and questioning you. The full audio argument of </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/audio/2017/16-476" rel="">Murphy vs. NCAA</a><span> (formerly Christie vs. NCAA) is worth listening to; it is gripping from start to finish:</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-174160086" href="https://shreyashariharan.substack.com/p/how-did-sports-betting-become-legal#footnote-3-174160086" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p><audio src="https://shreyashariharan.substack.com/api/v1/audio/upload/464bf9e1-a0ad-4689-9ba8-2624a119c15a/src" preload="auto">Audio playback is not supported on your browser. Please upgrade.</audio></p><p>Olson starts with arguing against PASPA based on the anti-commandeering principle: Congress can regulate people, not states.</p><p>Almost immediately, Justice Ginsberg interrupts Olson:³ wasn’t PASPA just another example of federal preemption, where federal law supersedes state law?</p><p>Olson says that when federal law supersedes state law, the federal government should regulate individuals via the Interstate Commerce Clause. PASPA doesn’t regulate individuals, nor does it provide regulatory muscle for enforcing the ban on sports betting. It simply commandeers states to ban sports betting and do the work of enforcing the ban.</p><p>Justice Sotomayor challenges this. She says that states don’t have to enforce the ban:³</p><blockquote><p>“Mr. Olson, if every governor enforced every law on the book, the state would be more than bankrupt. It would have no way of surviving. There are countless laws, and even laws that are in force, that are not enforced totally. States make choices all the time. There is nothing [in PASPA] telling this state that it has to enforce this law.”</p></blockquote><p>But Olson had a stronger counterargument this time thanks to Christie’s clever 2014 maneuver. New Jersey’s sports wagering act of 2014 did not legalize sports betting, it simply removed their prior ban. If PASPA blocked that, it meant that Congress was dictating what state legislatures can and cannot do.</p><p>Olson’s logic resonated with Justice Alito, a New Jersey native who had been part of the Federalist Society. Alito said there is no difference between Congress ordering a state to pass a law and forbidding it from repealing one: both are unconstitutional intrusions.</p><p>With that framing, the issue became clear. This was no longer about sports betting in New Jersey; it was about the balance of power between Washington and the states. The court, now more open to states’ rights than in prior years, delivered a landmark judgment. In May 2018, the Supreme Court ruled with a 6-3 vote that PASPA was unconstitutional, therefore removing the 26-year federal ban on sports betting and unleashing the modern sports betting industry.</p><p>Lobbyists like Jeremy Kudon saw this ruling as an opening to persuade state legislatures across the country to legalize sports betting. Kudon started with states that already legalized fantasy sports, a landscape he knew better than anyone else. Today, 38 states have legalized sports betting.</p><p>The widespread embrace of sports betting among everyday Americans wasn’t inevitable. Bill Bradley’s views on the harms of sports betting were the norm in America through the 90s and 2000s. It took a motivated state Governor in Chris Christie, an exceptional constitutional lawyer in Ted Olson, and a tactical lobbyist in Jeremy Kudon, to bring sports betting to nearly every American state and household.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apply now, do YC after you graduate. For students who want to finish school before doing YC. Get funded the moment you're accepted.</p><p><img src="https://www.ycombinator.com/vite/assets/spur_founders_early_decision-CSkUvarM.jpg" alt="Early Decision for Students"></p><p>Sneha and Anushka, founders of<!-- --> <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/spur">Spur (S24)</a>, applied in Fall 2023 for the S24 batch using Early Decision. This allowed them to graduate in May 2024 and then do YC. They've since raised $4.5M from top investors for their AI-powered QA testing tools.</p></div><div><h2>How Early Decision Works</h2><p>Early Decision lets you apply to YC while you're still in school and reserve your spot in a future batch. For example, you apply in Fall of this year, for a spot in the summer batch of the following year. You submit the same YC application as if you were applying for the upcoming batch. If you're accepted, we'll fund you immediately and hold your place for after you graduate.</p><h3>Is It for You?</h3><p>This program is designed for students who want to finish their degree before starting a company. If you're considering working on your own startup after graduation, Early Decision makes it easy to lock in your spot.</p><p>Even if you're not completely sure yet if you want to do a startup, you should still apply. There is no downside.</p><p>Also, if you're not in your final year, you can still apply for Early Decision. You'll be able to finish the school year you're currently in, and then either join a later batch or decide to drop out and start sooner.</p><h3>The Timeline</h3><p>The most common path is students applying in the fall of their final year and joining the summer batch after graduating in Spring. But you can apply for any batch in the future within reason. The application and interview process is the same as if you were applying for the upcoming batch. Once you're accepted, YC funds you right away and confirms your future batch.</p><h3>How to Apply</h3><p>When you fill out your YC application, you'll see a question asking which batch you want to apply for. Simply select "A batch after Winter 2026" to indicate you're applying for Early Decision, and tell us which batch you'd like to be considered for.</p><div><p><img src="https://www.ycombinator.com/vite/assets/early_decision_instructions-lZfrHNPm.png" alt="Early Decision batch selection in YC application"></p><p>The batch preference question in the YC application</p></div><h3>Why We Created Early Decision</h3><p>Many students want to finish their degree or complete more of their education before starting a company. Also we know that many students spend a lot of time in Fall or during their final year applying for jobs or internships. Early Decision gives students another option: apply to YC and bet on yourself.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <!-- no template found for topper block -->


<p><em>The Dating Apps Reporting Project is an 18-month investigation. It was produced in partnership with the </em><a href="https://pulitzercenter.org/journalism/initiatives/ai-accountability-network" target="_blank"><em>Pulitzer Center’s AI Accountability Network</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://themarkup.org/"><em>The Markup</em></a><em>, now a part of </em><a href="https://calmatters.org/" target="_blank"><em>CalMatters</em></a><em>, and copublished with </em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us" target="_blank"><em>The Guardian</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://19thnews.org/" target="_blank"><em>The 19th</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>When a young woman in Denver met up with a smiling cardiologist she matched with on the dating app Hinge, she had no way of knowing that the company behind the app had already received reports from two other women who accused him of rape.</p>



<p>She met the 34-year-old doctor with green eyes and thinning hair at Highland Tap &amp; Burger, a sports bar in a trendy neighborhood. It went well enough that she accepted an invitation to go back to his apartment. As she emerged from his bathroom, he handed her a tequila soda.</p>



<p>What transpired over the next 24 hours, according to court testimony, reads like every person’s dating app nightmare.</p>



<p>After sipping the drink, the woman started to lose control. Her memory blurred. She fell to the ground, and the man started to film her. He put her in a headlock, kissing her forehead; she struggled to free herself but managed to grab her things and leave. He followed her out the door, holding her shoes and trying to force her back inside, but she was able to call an Uber, vomiting in the car on the way home.</p>



  



<p>She woke up at home, soaking wet on her bathroom floor, the key to her house still in her door. She continued vomiting for hours. When she came to, she reported the assault to Hinge.</p>



<p>Hinge is one of more than a dozen dating apps owned by Match Group. The $8.5 billion global conglomerate also owns brands like Tinder (the world’s most popular dating app), OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish. Match Group controls half of the world’s online dating market, operates in 190 countries, and facilitates meetups for millions of people.</p>



<p>Match Group’s <a href="https://mtch.com/safety" target="_blank">official safety policy</a> states that when a user is reported for assault, “all accounts found that are associated with that user will be banned from our platforms.”</p>



<p>So why, on the night of Jan. 25, 2023, was Stephen Matthews still on the app? Just four days before, Match Group had been alerted when another woman reported him for rape. A little more than a week later, he was reported for rape again. This time, the survivor went to the police.</p>



<p>None of these women knew that the company had known about his violent behavior for years. He was first reported on Sept. 28, 2020. By then, Match Group’s safety policy was already in place.</p>



<p>Even after a police report, it took nearly two months for Matthews to be arrested — the only thing that got him off the apps. By then, at least 15 women would eventually report that Matthews had raped or drugged them. Nearly every one of them had met him on dating apps run by Match Group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Oct. 25, 2024, <a href="https://www.denverda.org/news-release/convicted-rapist-stephen-matthews-sentenced-to-158-years-to-life-in-prison/" target="_blank">a Denver judge sentenced Matthews to 158 years to life in prison</a> after a jury convicted him of 35 counts related to drugging and sexually assaulting eight women, drugging two women, and assaulting one more for a total of 11 women. Attorneys for the women said much of that violence could have been prevented.</p>



<p>“It is shocking that for years after receiving reports of sexual assault, Hinge continued to allow Stephen Matthews access to its platforms and actively facilitated his abuse,” said Laura Wolf, the attorney representing the woman whose police report led to the arrest. Following best practices for&nbsp;reporting on sexual assault, the Dating Apps Reporting Project is honoring survivors’ requests for anonymity.&nbsp;Matthews’ attorney, Douglas Cohen, declined to comment. A letter that The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent directly to Matthews in jail went unanswered.</p>



<p>Match Group’s reach is so massive — its mission is “to spark meaningful connections for every single person worldwide” — that people <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2019/08/online-dating-popular-way-u-s-couples-meet" target="_blank">are more likely to meet through its apps</a> than out at the bars, at church, or through friends.</p>

<p>But Matthews’ case shows that even as these apps have made it easier for us to connect with a seemingly endless pool of potential lovers, they have also made it easier for people who commit sexual abuse to reach a seemingly endless number of potential targets.</p>



<p>In 2022, a team of researchers at Brigham Young University published an <a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7669&amp;context=facpub" target="_blank">analysis</a> of hundreds of sexual assaults in Utah. They found attacks facilitated by dating apps happened faster and were more violent than when the perpetrator met the victim through other means. They also found that perpetrators who use dating apps are more likely to target vulnerable people. Almost 60 percent of sexual assault survivors self-reported a mental illness.</p>



<p>Match Group has known for years which users have been reported for drugging, assaulting, or raping their dates since at least 2016, according to internal company documents. Since 2019, Match Group’s central database has recorded every user reported for rape and assault across its entire suite of apps; by 2022, the system, known as Sentinel, was collecting hundreds of troubling incidents every week, company insiders say.</p>



<p>Match Group promised <a href="https://d1sud0deeo84nn.cloudfront.net/WCrxplt63uNCw4hJxqckDJRDN6jH5h41k1BqB3nf.pdf" target="_blank">in 2020</a> that it would release what’s known as a transparency report — a public document that would reveal data on harm occurring on and off its platforms. If the public were aware of the scale of rape and assault on Match Group apps, they would be able to accurately assess their risk. As of February 2025, the report has not been released.</p>



<p>Instead, as people continued to get hurt, the company dithered over what damning information should be hidden. “Do we only publish where we are required by law?” reads a slide in a 2021 presentation shown multiple times to Match Group employees as well as external safety partners. “Do we push back on how much we are required to reveal, or do we try to go beyond what is required?”</p>

<p>No online space is risk-free. But while Match Group has long possessed the tools, financial resources, and investigative procedures necessary to make it harder for bad actors to resurface, internal documents show the company has resisted efforts to spread them across its apps, in part because safety protocols could stall corporate growth.</p>



<p>“The obsession with metrics and having to stick with them is frustrating and potentially dangerous,” one employee wrote in 2021 after the company learned that the investigative news nonprofit ProPublica was planning a story. “This is not the way we were meant to work and people’s lives are at risk.”</p>

<p>The same person asked their superiors: “‘How much would you personally pay to stop just one person being sexually assaulted by a date, one child being trafficked or one vulnerable person being driven to suicide by a predator?’ I feel that if I asked members of our staff that question individually, they would put a high value of their own money on it – But as a group nobody is ready to hear that yet.”</p>



<p>Since 2021, Match Group has publicly promised to improve the safety of their products and share data, but company insiders say safety has not improved. A brief hiring spree sparked by congressional and media scrutiny has been largely scaled back, according to former employees. In 2024, the remaining employees from the central trust-and-safety team Match Group set up in response to increased scrutiny were let go and their jobs outsourced to overseas contractors. Facing pressure from Wall Street, Match Group removed CEO Bernard Kim in early February 2025 as he struggled to cut costs and end the steady decline in subscribers to Match Group’s most powerful app, Tinder.</p>



<p>Members of Congress have repeatedly requested data from Match Group on sexual harm. In February 2020, 11 members of <a href="https://schakowsky.house.gov/media/press-releases/schakowsky-kuster-lead-letter-match-group-president-calling-improvements" target="_blank">Congress wrote</a> to then-CEO Shar Dubey asking for details on how the company responds to reports of sexual violence. In July 2023, two Democrats, then-Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire and Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois followed up after we inquired on the status of their efforts. The company has still not provided the data.</p>



<p>In September 2024, the House of Representatives <a href="https://valadao.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1538" target="_blank">passed a bill</a> that requires consumers to be notified if they have interacted with a user on a dating app who has been banned for defrauding consumers of money or personal financial information. But the bill stopped short of addressing the issue of sexual assault on the apps, and it died in the Senate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our review of hundreds of pages of internal company documents, along with thousands of pages of court records, securities filings, and analyst reports, coupled with dozens of interviews with current and former employees and survivors of sexual violence found women who report being raped get no traction, while accused rapists like Stephen Matthews keep swiping — and assaulting.</p>



<p>Our own testing on Match Group apps shows that as of February 2025, not much has changed. Banned Tinder users, including those reported for sexual assault, can easily rejoin or move to another Match Group dating app, all while keeping most of their key personal information exactly the same.</p>



<p>The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent Match Group a four-page letter detailing our findings. The company responded with a short statement. The statement did not dispute that Match Group has carefully documented the extent of harm on company apps for years without sharing that information with the public. It also defended the company’s efforts to make platforms safe.</p>



<p>“We recognize our role in fostering safer communities and promoting authentic and respectful connections worldwide,” the statement provided by Kayla Whaling, senior director of communications, read. “We will always work to invest in and improve our systems, and search for ways to help our users stay safe, both online and when they connect in real life.”</p>



<p>The company said it vigorously combats violence.&nbsp;“We take every report of misconduct seriously, and vigilantly remove and block accounts that have violated our rules regarding this behavior,” its statement read. Our own testing found otherwise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in April 2024, The Dating Apps Reporting Project created a series of Tinder accounts that we subsequently reported for sexual assault. Soon after, Tinder banned the accounts, and we started investigating how easy it would be for a banned user to create new accounts.</p>



<p>Repeatedly, we found that users, soon after being banned, could create new Tinder accounts with the exact same name, birthday, and profile photos used on their banned accounts. Users banned from Tinder were also able to sign up for Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish without changing those personal details.</p>



<p>To get around the Tinder ban, we used techniques commonly suggested by online guides and forums that don’t require lots of technical knowledge to understand. We were able to verify three techniques that allowed banned Match Group users to repeatedly bypass being flagged when creating new accounts.</p>



<p>In its statement, Match Group cast itself as an industry leader in deploying technology to promote safety, including “harassment-preventing AI tools, ID verification for profiles, and a portal that helps us better support and communicate with law enforcement investigating crimes. … Every person deserves safe and respectful experiences. We are committed to doing the work to make dating safer on our platforms and beyond,” the statement said.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Sept. 28, 2020 — the date Denver cardiologist Stephen Matthews raped a woman who reported him to Hinge</strong> — is also the date Tracey Breeden was brought on as Match Group’s head of safety and social advocacy.</p>



<p>Breeden was a flashy hire. “With Tracey coming on board, we are reaffirming our commitment not just to be safety leaders in the dating space, but across the entire tech sector,” then-CEO Shar Dubey said.</p>



<p>Sporting a trademark black leather jacket and short, slick-backed hair, Breeden went by the nickname “Tornado” during her 15-year career in law enforcement. What made her attractive to Match Group was her most recent job at Uber. She helped the global ride-hailing company revive its reputation after a series of scandals — from persistent reports of harassment of women employees to allegations that it was ignoring sexual assault that occurred during Uber rides.</p>





<p>Breeden spearheaded a safety report in 2019 that told the public what Uber knew about nearly every problem, including nationwide reports of intoxicated drivers, traffic fatalities, and incidents of sexual violence. The report became a key metric of success for the company.</p>



<p>In hiring Breeden, Match Group hoped to replicate this success across its portfolio of apps. “Corporations,” she said in a press release announcing her arrival, “have a responsibility to help ensure safe experiences for their users.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Breeden’s team garnered public attention for its new safety measures, including partnerships with NGOs, optional AI-assisted photo verification, and a law enforcement portal where police and prosecutors can request data.</p>



<p>She also fostered a partnership with Garbo, a startup that offered low-cost background checks. <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2022-03-09-Garbo-Launches-Background-Check-Platform-To-Public-and-On-Tinder" target="_blank">It launched on Tinder in 2022</a>. Experts point out that background checks are not always reliable as they pull from outdated databases, and <a href="https://rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system" target="_blank">research</a> suggests that most people who commit sexual abuse do not encounter the criminal justice system. For example, Matthews had no criminal record.</p>



<p>During this time, Match Group invested $100 million into safety as a recurring cost, the company said, and boasted about Breeden’s “central safety team.”</p>



<p>Her team of veteran safety professionals referred to themselves as “The Avengers,” even donning superhero costumes at company events.</p>

<p>But Michael Lawrie called this “safety theater.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lawrie worked for Match Group for nearly a decade, shaping and leading a safety team for one of the company’s smaller brands, OkCupid. Sometimes working 80-hour weeks, he spent hours, even days, sniffing out savvy users who tried to thwart bans by creating multiple accounts.</p>



<p>Over a 30-year career in content moderation, Lawrie said, he saw many users like Stephen Matthews. “You’re dealing with one repeat offender. I’ve dealt with god knows how many repeat offenders,” he said.</p>

<p>A yellow Post-it note on the side of Lawrie’s computer listed out some of his responsibilities: “Rape flags. … Investigate miscreants.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>These days, Lawrie is trying to start an advocacy organization for content moderators and other front-line safety workers. But, he said, he’s done with dating apps.</p>



<p>“I don’t think they’re safe enough at the moment,” he said. “They’re gonna get worse. …I’m hoping dating sites vanish.”</p>



<p>Lawrie said he was initially excited about Breeden’s hire. He said she spent her first few months on the job talking to each brand’s safety team, and told him that she was “very impressed” by the work OkCupid was doing.</p>



<p>Each of Match Group’s biggest apps provided their self-described strengths and weaknesses to Breeden’s team, according to an internal spreadsheet. At Hinge, these weaknesses included a “very rudimentary warning system with no targeted comms and no follow through” and “no way to find” the original profile “of a bad actor who has created multiple profiles.”</p>



<p>Breeden was confronted with an existential problem. “Our current ban categories won’t allow us to answer the public’s biggest question: Am I likely to be harmed on my date?” reads a slide in a presentation drafted by her team in April 2021. While each of Match Group’s apps had a system of reporting and banning violent users, the information was disorganized, and none of the apps talked to each other.</p>

<p>Lawrie hoped Breeden would improve safety at the company. But he quickly grew frustrated that neither she nor Match Group leadership listened to his pleas for what they really needed to make platforms safer: To hire trained — and expensive — investigators and integrate powerful moderation tools across all the apps.</p>



<p>OkCupid already had those tools. Lawrie was using them every day.<br>One of those was the Sentinel system, which had been up and running across Match Group’s apps for at least five years before Breeden arrived. It works like this: When a user is banned for something serious — like sexual assault — a case is created in Sentinel with the phone number and email address associated with their account. In interviews, multiple current and former employees described how those reports circulate through each of Match Group’s apps. The system is designed to ban anyone who uses that information. It also grabs the original profile’s IP addresses, photos, and birthdate.</p>


<figure aria-label="image" role="group">

    </div><figcaption>
        <span>Caption:</span>
        An example of a case in Sentinel for a banned user. Sensitive information has been redacted by The Markup

</figcaption></figure>


<p>Such a system seems robust at first glance — but none of the Match Group’s apps require users to provide photo identification (the kind needed to buy alcohol or board an airplane), so once a person is kicked out, they can easily start a new account with different contact information. A quick search yields scores of online forums with clear steps and suggestions for how to rejoin the apps. In addition, internal company documents show information on IP addresses, photos, and birthdate were not used to ban a user if they appear on another Match dating app.</p>



<p>Lawrie’s team at OkCupid knew Sentinel could only do so much.</p>



<p>So his team deployed other tools to fix its shortcomings, including one that could automatically ban a profile that was linked to a phone number, photo, or URL that had been previously banned — even if the user made an account with a different email or IP address. This tool was designed to be proactive rather than reactive, so that the profiles of alleged perpetrators like Matthews would not resurface after they had been reported.</p>



<p>Internal company documents from 2019 and 2020 show thousands of reports of “serious physical assault,” abuse, or violence on OkCupid that were deemed serious enough to get users banned from all of Match Group’s apps. This is among the information the company kept from the public.</p>



<p>Breeden and Match Group leadership praised Lawrie and his team at OkCupid, he said, for their thorough investigative work and for handling some of the company’s most difficult cases. Yet, he said, Match Group never built out a skilled, experienced investigative unit at other brands like the one he headed up at OkCupid. Under Breeden’s leadership, he said, they faced pressure to speed up investigations and train outsourced labor to use complicated moderation tools.</p>



<p>A week after a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/addressing-rape-in-four-minutes-or-less-dating-app-reps-left-unprepared-to-respond-to-assault-victims" target="_blank">damning article in 2021</a> revealed that content moderators with little training were asked to rapidly deal with violent sexual content across Match Group’s brands, then-CEO Dubey sent out an all-staff email addressing the controversy. She CC’d Breeden, acknowledging that the brand’s safety teams were not all on equal footing.</p>



<p>As Match Group prepared internally for the story to break, Lawrie was asked to write a report for Breeden outlining his team’s accomplishments “to make sure when Tracey describes and acknowledges what you are doing individually to celebrate the good work that you are doing.”</p>



<p>Lawrie used that report to protest.</p>



<p>“Most professionals aren’t judged on how many cases they can hurry through in an hour,” he wrote. The way Match Group expects its trust-and-safety and support teams to work “basically diminishes their skills and makes them production-line workers.” Breeden declined to comment for this story, citing a nondisclosure agreement.</p>



<p>Lawrie left the company in 2022 and said most of his small team that was ferreting out malicious users also left due to a negative workplace environment. He said much of their work was outsourced to contractors with little training and severe quotas.</p>



<p>He now cautions anyone using a dating app to understand that they’re not in the business of protecting users.</p>



<p>“You’re on your own pretty much,” he said.</p>



<hr>



<p>As Lawrie was getting pushed out of Match Group, Matthews kept appearing on the company’s apps.</p>



<p>One crisp fall evening in 2022, one of the Denver cardiologist’s old medical school classmates was on Hinge when her phone screen filled up with a familiar face.</p>

        Despite having been reported for rape to Hinge, Stephen Matthew’s profile was still promoted on the app as a Standout, as indicated by the rose icon in the bottom right corner

</figcaption></figure>


<p>Matthews was being promoted on the app as a Standout, a popular profile that Hinge’s algorithm thinks you’ll like. To match with a Standout, users must send the person a rose. They get one free rose a week, but they cost $3.99 a pop after that. His classmate did not send Matthews a rose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By this point, Matthews had already been reported for rape at least once to Hinge. Court documents show that he had already allegedly sexually assaulted nine women and drugged 10. Not only did the apps allow him back on, they featured Matthews’ profile.</p>



<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic dragged on, people got tired of forking money over for dating apps. Match Group still made a hefty profit, but its growth flatlined. Its stock cratered, losing nearly half its value between October 2021 and April 2022. That month, an analyst from J.P. Morgan <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25516004-20220429-jp-morgan-jpy-match-group-latest-thoughts-on-key-debates-1q-preview/#document/p1" target="_blank">wrote that</a> the firm had received more messages about “the underperformance of MTCH shares in recent weeks than any other topic.”</p>



<p>In May 2022, Match ousted Dubey and installed Bernard Kim as CEO, a former executive at the gaming company Zynga that popularized viral games like “FarmVille.”</p>



<p>While Dubey spoke frequently about trust and safety and worked closely with Breeden, Kim hardly mentioned safety when he began his time at Match Group, instead emphasizing the need for continued rapid expansion to drive long-term shareholder value.</p>



<p>Lawrie said that Kim, with his background in gaming rather than dating apps, had no interest in love. “He just wants to make money. He’s just there to increase profits,” Lawrie said. “If he’s looking at a bottom line, then it’s easier to have a lawsuit than it is to provide safety. I know which one he’s gonna pick.” Match Group declined to make Bernard Kim available for an interview. Messages sent to Kim directly went unreturned.</p>



<p>While the tension between growth and safety exists across the tech sector, it is especially high at dating apps companies where executives have to worry about constant churn — users leaving the apps when they are no longer looking for dates. Every time Match Group delivers on its promise, it also loses customers.</p>



<p>In February 2024, six dating app users <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/17/are-dating-apps-fuelling-addiction-lawsuit-against-tinder-hinge-and-match-claims-so" target="_blank">filed what they hope will be certified as a class action lawsuit</a>. They argue Match Group uses “addictive” features to encourage compulsive use while not leading to any real increase in off-app relationships. “The app is designed specifically to hook them, and to keep them paying subscription fees — not to help them find love,” attorney Ryan Clarkson said. Match Group filed to dismiss the lawsuit in September, noting in its quarterly report that it “will defend vigorously” against the allegations.</p>



<hr>



<p>Despite Kim’s efforts, Match Group’s stock price continued to drop, and during that time, so did any mention of trust and safety. In over a year of quarterly investor calls, Kim only referenced safety efforts once.</p>



<p>Employees who pushed for these initiatives were forced out or laid off, including Breeden — a leader who was so convinced of her own invincibility that she showed up to an event wielding a Captain America shield.</p>

<p>Match Group fired its power hire in October 2022. Layoffs hit her team over the next several months. In February 2024, the remaining&nbsp;critical investigators and law enforcement liaisons on Breeden’s central safety team were shown the door.</p>



<p>Lawrie said group chats of former Match Group employees have been gossipping about the cutbacks.</p>



<p>“You’re not gonna see them taking safety seriously ever again,” he said, adding that the only thing that he thinks might change that is legislation.</p>



<hr>



<p>Four months before Matthews was arrested, a post on a Facebook group in Denver blew up, right around Christmas.</p>



<p>Over and over again, women furiously detailed negative experiences they or their friends had with Matthews.</p>



<p>Some women described him as “sketchy.” Others called him “terrible” and “not safe.” Multiple women told a similar, dark story: that they were offered drinks, blacked out, and sexually assaulted.</p>



<p>The thread reached 150 comments. Two women wrote the same thing: that they had been waiting for someone to post about the cardiologist.</p>



<p>The flood of Facebook comments mirrored details in the police reports released the following year. Nearly all of the 16 women included in the district attorney’s initial complaints were offered tequila. Eight recalled playing Jenga. Six mentioned a hot tub.</p>



<p>As these stories circulated in this small corner of the internet in December 2022, the Denver cardiologist stayed on Match Group apps.</p>



<p>Those fortunate enough to know about the Facebook group — and who had the foresight to check for Matthews on it — would be saved from a bad date or worse. But the fact that he could still log into Tinder and Hinge left him with a pool of thousands of unsuspecting women whom he could — and would — continue to match with.</p>



<p>The Dating Apps Reporting Project is aware of four additional women who have accused Matthews of drugging and/or raping them who were not part of the criminal complaint. Each of these women met Matthews on a Match Group app during a single year between the summers of 2020 and 2021.</p>



<p>During the years Matthews was on their apps, Match Group hired and fired Breeden. It made loud promises on sexual violence, announced initiatives and product lines, and promised a transparency report. But it was not straight with the public, which meant the women matching with Matthews on Match Group apps were not aware of the risk they faced.</p>



<p>Match Group’s partnership with Garbo, the background check company, also fell apart in the summer of 2023. “It’s become clear that most online platforms aren’t legitimately committed to trust and safety for their users,” Garbo wrote in a <a href="https://www.garbo.io/blog/next-phase-at-garbo" target="_blank">searing blog post</a>.</p>



<p>After spending so much energy talking about monetization, gamification, and growth, Kim began to publicly acknowledge this problem. Speaking at the Citibank conference in the fall of 2023, he said the company was investing in new features to make sure “women have a good experience while they’re in the product. They feel safe. They feel secure. Etc.”</p>





<p>The “etc.” does not seem to include increased transparency about safety. Instead, in May 2023, Tinder released a “female-focused package,” a curated list of “high-quality profiles.” It is unclear how Tinder determines these high-quality matches. Hinge’s Standout feature, which is similar, had previously promoted Matthews.</p>



<p>In fact, under Kim’s leadership, all mentions of a transparency report disappeared from the company’s annual impact report. Ironically, this was around the same time that new legislation in Europe required tech companies <a href="https://transparency.dsa.ec.europa.eu/statement?s=&amp;platform_id%5B%5D=125&amp;platform_id%5B%5D=129&amp;platform_id-125=on&amp;platform_id-129=on&amp;created_at_start=&amp;created_at_end=" target="_blank">to disclose reports</a> of “non-consensual behavior” and other issues. Match Group will be required to submit a transparency report to the European Union on the scope of harm on their platforms later this month. Lawmakers in India and Australia are also demanding transparency.</p>



<p>This is exactly the situation Breeden and her team pondered three years ago. “What if publishing in one jurisdiction sparks a requirement in another?” read a slide in the same internal presentation where Match Group’s trust-and-safety leaders wondered whether they should “push back on how much [they] are required to reveal.”</p>



<p>After Match Group published a disappointing earnings report in February 2025 that fell below analysts’ expectations, it also announced that Kim would be replaced by former Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff. Tinder’s revenue, sales, and subscribers had all gone down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Match Group struggles to reverse its decline, it’s also aware that its reputation is in the spotlight. Earnings calls and shareholder letters over the first three quarters of 2024 indicate that the company knows it is a business imperative to make women feel safer on its platforms. Match Group brought in a new vice president to head trust and safety whose job partly focuses on complying with increased global transparency requirements. The company is experimenting with requiring faces in photos and rolled out a <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2024-04-22-SHORTCUT-YOUR-DATING-ADMIN-THANKS-TO-TINDERS-SHARE-MY-DATE" target="_blank">“Share My Date</a>” feature so you can be tracked while meeting up with an online stranger. On Tinder, it orchestrated a “major ecosystem cleanup” geared toward identifying fake profiles and getting scammers off the app.</p>



<p>But neither the cleanup nor tracking a date from your phone would have stopped Matthews — a man who never sought to hide his identity, who assaulted his dates in his own home — from finding and harming women.</p>



<hr>



<p>Four years after Matthews’ first documented assault, he walked into a wood-paneled courtroom in Denver and was sentenced to 158 years to life in prison. “I will sentence. I cannot heal,” Judge Eric Johnson told the room filled with survivors and family members.</p>



<p>“Countless women have suffered and will continue to suffer,” said Laura Wolf, an attorney who represented the woman whose police report triggered Matthews’ arrest. “Hinge and other dating platforms have taken no steps to ensure the safety of the product they are selling, matching unsuspecting women to known predators without pause or concern.”</p>



<p>Match Group didn’t make it easy for the Denver prosecutors to convict Matthews. A search warrant was issued to Hinge in July 2023. Two months later, prosecutors were still empty-handed — with the judge in the case asking at a hearing if he needed to start “dragging people in to get stuff done.” It wasn’t until February 2024 that the Denver District Attorney’s Office said they finally received documents returned by Match Group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Matthews will likely never leave prison. Match Group executives currently face no charges. But the company knew about Matthews, and it knows about thousands of other abusive users. It has the data that could help users avoid dangerous situations, but it hasn’t shared it, leaving millions of people in the dark.</p>



<p>Lawmakers around the world are starting to ask for answers from the most powerful force in modern dating. In June, Colorado passed a law, triggered by the Matthews case, that forces dating app companies to tell the state attorney general <a href="https://coag.gov/dating-safety/" target="_blank">what safety measures they are taking to protect users</a>. Although the law leaves room for the possibility of additional transparency in the future, it does not currently require the company to tell the state, or the public, how many people are raped or assaulted after using its platform. In the U.S., we’ve just scratched the surface. In most states, there’s little that requires Match Group to share information with you — or with Congress.</p>



<p>The reality is that if Stephen Matthews were released today, he could get right back on a dating app. Match Group knows this — and now so do you.</p>
