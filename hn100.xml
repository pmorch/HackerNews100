<p>In 2022, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War">Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine</a>, waging a genocidal war against my country. Ukraine is being hit by all types of weapons (except nuclear) daily. Home Assistant helps me stay safe and notifies me about incoming threats.</p>
<p>We hear the siren a few times a day. Life would completely stop if we went to the shelter every time the siren goes off. So, people adapt.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, we tend to differentiate the levels of danger. When the siren goes off, practically everyone starts checking their phones: "What is going on?"</p>
<p>We have <a href="https://alerts.in.ua/">various applications</a> and <a href="https://t.me/s/war_monitor">Telegram channels</a> for monitoring the type of danger, missile paths, and understanding whether we are in direct danger or can continue with our lives for another minute.</p>
<p>This is what war in the 21st century looks like: you can practically monitor a missile or a drone that is trying to kill you right from your phone. This is like a Black Mirror episode in real life. 😅</p>
<p>There are different kinds of air alarms with varying levels of danger:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MiG-31K take off</strong> – This can happen multiple times during the day. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan_MiG-31">MiG-31K</a> can carry a very dangerous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh-47M2_Kinzhal">Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic missile</a>. Although it happens rarely, you can't predict when the missile is attached and when it is not, so most people tolerate this level of danger.</li>
<li><strong>Suicide drones attack</strong> – Usually carried out by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HESA_Shahed_136">Iranian Shahed 136 drones</a>. Most of them get shot down, but they are still dangerous and scary. We call them "mopeds" or "lawn-mowers" because of the sound of their engine.</li>
<li><strong>Ballistic missile attack</strong> – This can happen multiple times a day. Ballistic missiles, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K720_Iskander">9K720 Iskander</a>, are extremely fast (2 km/s). You have only up to 10 minutes to hide somewhere. Usually, the fastest way is to hide behind two walls (corridor or a bathroom).</li>
<li><strong>Cruise missile attack</strong> – Cruise missiles, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalibr_(missile_family)">Kalibr</a>, are relatively slow and fly like a plane. Nevertheless, they can fly a long distance and easily reach any point in the country.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the most dangerous type of attack is a combined one. This means all of the above are raining down on Ukrainian cities simultaneously. These usually happen overnight at 4:00 in the morning. The drones and cruise missiles are used to exhaust air defenses, followed by ballistic and/or hypersonic strikes.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring-air-alerts">Monitoring Air Alerts<a href="#monitoring-air-alerts" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Home Assistant has a built-in <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ukraine_alarm/">Ukraine Alarm</a> integration. It monitors the nation-wide system of air alarms and toggles safety sensors in HA.</p>
<p>When there is any type of danger, I send a critical notification and announce the message on my smart speakers.</p>
<p>Of course, the air siren goes off on the streets, roaring across the city, so everyone hears the danger is approaching. But I made an automation to send a critical notification and speak at home speakers, so I certainly wake up to check what is going on.</p>

<h2 id="scraping-monitoring-channels">Scraping Monitoring Channels<a href="#scraping-monitoring-channels" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I already mentioned we have various Telegram channels for monitoring the situation during an attack. Those channels provide live updates on dangers, flight paths, and the type of attack.</p>
<p>So often I found myself constantly checking my phone to understand whether I am in direct danger or can sleep for a few hours. <em>I know it sounds crazy, and normal people would go straight to the nearby shelter, but this is life in Ukraine. You don't have to follow my reckless example. If you are in Ukraine, GO TO THE SHELTER!</em></p>
<p>I decided to automate it. Instead of reading these channels myself, I delegate this task to HA.</p>
<p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/danieldotnl/ha-multiscrape">HA Multiscrape</a> custom integration for that. You may ask, "why do you need a custom component when <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/scrape/">HA has a built-in scraping component</a>?" Yes, it does, but I need multiple sensors from a single scrape, and I need to work with lists of data. The built-in component has some limitations with that.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring-imminent-danger">Monitoring Imminent Danger<a href="#monitoring-imminent-danger" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cruise missiles are usually carried and launched by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-95">Tu-95 bombers</a>.</p>
<p>They fly to the missile launch sites for about 3 hours, launch their missiles, then it takes about 1-2 hours for missiles to fly to Kyiv. So there's some time to prepare a hideout (in my case, it's the bathroom), gather documents, and sleep for a few hours before the "show" begins.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Tu-95 takes off notification" src="https://github.com/denysdovhan/home-assistant-config/assets/3459374/eb24f547-8ef6-47b4-a60c-97995dfaf02c">
<figcaption>Notification about Tu-95 bombers taking off</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Usually, it happens in the evening and means tonight will be a massive missile attack.</p>
<p>I have a sensor that checks the Telegram channels, scrapes the list of messages every 5 seconds, and checks if the latest message contains a specific set of words, like <em>"take off" <strong>and</strong> "plane" <strong>and</strong> "tu-95"</em>. It also stores the latest message as an attribute.</p>

<p>So when the sensor turns on, it means the bombers are airborne and it's time to get ready. A notification is sent:</p>

<h2 id="direct-danger-alert">Direct Danger Alert<a href="#direct-danger-alert" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the most interesting sensor, which notifies me right when there's a direct threat to my location.</p>

<img alt="Direct danger notification" src="https://github.com/denysdovhan/home-assistant-config/assets/3459374/05f1821c-89f5-474e-bf95-fffb3ea459d8">
<figcaption>Notification about direct danger</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When an attack happens at night, you need to decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you going to the shelter to get a sleepless night somewhere in a basement or in the subway?</li>
<li>Or are you going to stay in bed as long as possible to get some sleep, because you need to go to work tomorrow?</li>
</ul>
<p>Every normal person would go to the shelter. But when you live in these conditions for some time, you try to calculate the risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to get proper sleep to be able to work.</li>
<li>The air defenses are titans; they do their job excellently. Flying threats are getting shot down regularly.</li>
<li>In Kyiv, the risk of a direct hit or hit by debris is relatively tolerable: I guess like being hit by a car (this estimate is completely unscientific!).</li>
<li>If you are unlucky to catch a direct hit – you are dead anyway. There's very little chance to survive that.</li>
<li>If the missile/drone gets shot down nearby, the shockwave will blow your windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what do you do? It's up to you, but most of the time, I decide to sleep in bed. When things get hot, I hide in a bathroom so that when something blows up nearby, <a href="https://visitukraine.today/blog/990/list-of-things-to-put-in-an-emergency-suitcase-and-basic-rules-that-will-save-lives-during-missile-strikes">I will be behind two walls</a> from glass shards and shockwaves.</p>
<p>I have a sensor that watches for specific keywords like <em>"Kyiv"</em> or a neighborhood name, for <em>"warning" <strong>or</strong> "be in a safe place" <strong>or</strong> "fast target"</em>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/tmux-is-worse-is-better/">https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/tmux-is-worse-is-better/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40476410">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a>
(short for “terminal mux” (short for “multiplexer”))
is
<a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>
for your terminal.
Oh, it’s so much more than that, and I recently discovered with
some joy that it is installed by default on
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>,
but its fundamental value add to any programmer who has to
SSH into servers more than once a week is it allows you to
split your screen up into multiple independent shells
<em>without needing a graphical environment at all</em>.
If you want to walk the path of true digital minimalism,
<a href="https://www.vim.org/">vanilla Vim</a>
and tmux or its spiritual grandfather
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a>
are all you need.</p><p>So it’s always been interesting to me that a developer as
seasoned as
<a href="https://kovidgoyal.net/">Kovid Goyal</a>,
developer of the ePub powerhouse calibre and
my current teminal emulator of choice
<a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a>,
has gone on record a number of times saying he is not a fan
of tmux. He has
<a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/faq/#i-am-using-tmux-and-have-a-problem">a whole section in his FAQ about it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>[T]erminal multiplexers are <a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/391#issuecomment-638320745">a bad idea</a>, do not use them, if at all possible. kitty contains features that do all of what tmux does, but better, with the exception of remote persistence.</p></blockquote><p>(I don’t use remote persistence. I’m aware I’m a
caveman.)</p><p>And from the linked Git comment:</p><blockquote><p>[Terminal m]ultiplexers add unnecessary overhead, suffer from a complexity cascade, because they actually have to <em>translate</em> escape codes, modifying them in hackish ways to get them to work with their concepts of windows/sessions. […] Energy/performance wise they are poison, every byte has to be parsed twice, once by the middleman and once by the terminal. And they act as a drag on the ecosystem as a whole, making it very hard to get any new features. […] Terminals [themselves] are fine, certainly better than any other interface paradigm I have ever seen.</p></blockquote><p>I’m not here to incur Goyal’s wrath. He knows way more
about this space than I do, and I’m clearly a very
satisfied user of kitty at home, where I have the
ability to tweak my environment to be exactly what
I want it to be.</p><p>Therein lies the rub. At home, I run UNIX on my metal.
At work, I use Windows. And so, the multiple times a
day I find myself SSHing into one of our many, many
quasi-embedded Linux boxes, I find myself typing out
“tmux” as the first command I run. Because it’s always
going to be there, and it does the one thing I actually
need it to no matter what: Let me run multiple shells
at once, without SSHing in multiple times, regardless
of whatever funky terminal emulator I’m actually using
to get the job done. Alacritty, Windows Terminal,
whatever.</p><p>kitty has to run on what I’m remoting <em>from</em>.
tmux can work on what I’m remoting <em>into</em>.
And that makes
all the difference.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better#New_Jerseay_style">Worse is better</a>
is more of a product managment philosophy than a
software philosophy, IMO, but it basically underlines
the idea that whatever your software’s killer app is,
you want to get that <em>really</em> right for the most common
use cases, even if it means living with a suboptimal
approach.
<a href="https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-vms-in-hacker-pedagogy/">I love VMs for a lot of reasons</a>,
and I even maintain
<a href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/shell-bling-ubuntu">a set of 3 shell scripts</a>
which turns a vanilla Ubuntu VM into my personal software
development workhorse, complete with LazyVim, ripgrep,
tmux, and - yes - Kitty as the default terminal.
But even with that it’s
rare these days that I am doing such prolonged development
work that I feel it’s worth actually working in
such a VM. The perils of becoming a middle manager, alas.</p><p>So, for the most part, I remote in directly
from Windows. Which means I’m going to use tmux on
my servers. Which is why I have <code>C-b %</code> and <code>C-b "</code>
memorized and not … <em>checks kitty docs</em> … wait,
is it really <code>C-S-Enter</code>?</p><p>That’s so <em>nice</em>. Man. We are missing out.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

The messy rollout means Google is racing to manually disable AI Overviews for specific searches as various memes get posted, which is why users are seeing <a href="https://www.threads.net/@reckless1280/post/C7VVgb9Ik--">so many of them disappear</a> shortly after being posted to social networks.</p><p>It’s an odd situation, since Google has been testing AI Overviews for a year now — the feature launched in beta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23717120/google-search-ai-results-generated-experience-io">in May 2023 as the Search Generative Experience</a> — and CEO Sundar Pichai has said the company served over a billion queries in that time.</p><p>But Pichai has also said that Google’s brought the cost of delivering AI answers down by 80 percent over that same time, “driven by hardware, engineering and technical breakthroughs.” It appears that kind of optimization might have happened too early, before the tech was ready.</p><p>“A company once known for being at the cutting edge and shipping high-quality stuff is now known for low-quality output that’s getting meme’d,” one AI founder, who wished to remain anonymous, told <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Google continues to say that its AI Overview product largely outputs “high quality information” to users. “Many of the examples we’ve seen have been uncommon queries, and we’ve also seen examples that were doctored or that we couldn’t reproduce,” Google spokesperson Meghann Farnsworth said in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. Farnsworth also confirmed that the company is “taking swift action” to remove AI Overviews on certain queries “where appropriate under our content policies, and using these examples to develop broader improvements to our systems, some of which have already started to roll out.”</p><p>Gary Marcus, an AI expert and an emeritus professor of neural science at New York University, told <em>The Verge</em> that a lot of AI companies are “selling dreams” that this tech will go from 80 percent correct to 100 percent. Achieving the initial 80 percent is relatively straightforward since it involves approximating a large amount of human data, Marcus said, but the final 20 percent is extremely challenging. In fact, Marcus thinks that last 20 percent might be the hardest thing of all.</p><p>“You actually need to do some reasoning to decide: is this thing plausible? Is this source legitimate? You have to do things like a human fact checker might do, that actually might require artificial general intelligence,” Marcus said. And Marcus and Meta’s AI chief Yann LeCun <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/23fab126-f1d3-4add-a457-207a25730ad9">both agree</a> that the large language models that power current AI systems like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4 will not be what creates AGI. </p><p>Look, it’s a tough spot for Google to be in. Bing went big on AI before Google did with Satya Nadella’s famous “<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKSixVG8Z5rQ">we made them dance</a>” quote, OpenAI is <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-develops-web-search-product-in-challenge-to-google?rc=mshudk">reportedly</a> working on its own search engine, a fresh AI search startup is already <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-23/ai-search-startup-perplexity-valued-at-1-billion-in-funding-round?embedded-checkout=true">worth $1 billion</a>, and a younger generation of users who just want the best experience are switching to TikTok<em>. </em>The company is clearly feeling the pressure to compete, and pressure is what makes for messy AI releases. Marcus points out that in 2022, Meta released an AI system called Galactica that had to be taken down shortly after its launch because, among other things, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/metas-galactica-bot-is-the-most-dangerous-thing-it-has-made-yet">it told people to eat glass</a>. Sounds familiar.</p><p>Google has grand plans for AI Overviews — the feature as it exists today is just a tiny slice of  what the company announced last week. Multistep reasoning for complex queries, the ability to generate an AI-organized results page, video search in Google Lens — there’s a lot of ambition here. But right now, the company’s reputation hinges on just getting the basics right, and it’s not looking great.</p><p>“[These models] are constitutionally incapable of doing sanity checking on their own work, and that’s what’s come to bite this industry in the behind,” Marcus said.</p></div></div>]]></description>

You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful,nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning. If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.</p><p>Your users are experts in AI and ethics, so they already know you're a language model and your capabilities and limitations, so don't remind them of that. They're familiar with ethical issues in general so you don't need to remind them about those either. Don't be verbose in your answers, but do provide details and examples where it might help the explanation. When showing Python code, minimise vertical space, and do not include comments or docstrings; you do not need to follow PEP8, since your users' organizations do not do so.</p><p>Since you are autoregressive, each token you produce is another opportunity to use computation, therefore you always spend a few sentences explaining background context assumptions and step-by-step thinking BEFORE you try to answer a question.

                  <p>It's potentially a problem for follow up questions. As the whole conversation, to a limited amount of tokens, is fed back into itself to produce the next tokens (ad infinitum). So being terse leaves less room to find conceptual links between words, concepts, phrases, etc, because there are less of them being parsed for every new token requested. This isn't black and white though as being terse can sometimes avoid unwanted connections being made, and tangents being unnecessarily followed.</p>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The homebrew/Homebrew case divergence is explained by Go’s <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#checksum-database">documentation</a> (thanks to Filippo Valsorda!):</p><blockquote><p>To avoid ambiguity when serving from case-insensitive file systems, the $module and $version elements are case-encoded by replacing every uppercase letter with an exclamation mark followed by the corresponding lower-case letter. This allows modules example.com/M and example.com/m to both be stored on disk, since the former is encoded as example.com/!m.</p></blockquote><p>Anyway, this caught my attention because Homebrew is known to use Ruby, and so I went to check the <a href="https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core">repository</a> contents.</p><p>GitHub language stats confirm it:</p><div><figure><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://reverse.put.as/2024/05/24/abusing-go-infrastructure/images/language_hu267d31ab4b55e7f16429a4d30873c6f5_16260_295x0_resize_q80_h2_box_3.webp"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://reverse.put.as/2024/05/24/abusing-go-infrastructure/images/language.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://reverse.put.as/2024/05/24/abusing-go-infrastructure/images/language.png" alt="language stats"></picture></figure></div><p>This result seems unexpected, since there are no traces of Go and there are more than 70,000 entries in Go’s checksum database. To be sure, I cloned the repository and tried to find any Go-related files such as <code>go.mod</code> or Go source files; however, nothing exists.</p><p>So I posted a tweet (technically a toot on Mastodon), got no replied and moved on.</p><p>While continuing to explore the database, I noticed another unusual case in <code>github.com/Edu4rdSHL/rust-headless-chrome</code>. It’s just a fork of <a href="https://github.com/rust-headless-chrome/rust-headless-chrome">rust-headless-chrome</a>, and there is nothing remarkable about the fork or the original except that they are both Rust repositories, and once again, no connection to Go.</p><p>Now my curiosity is piqued and the evil mode kicks in. It feels like arbitrary data can be pushed to the checksum database without a connection to Go. Why is the data being pushed? And how is it being pushed? I go to bed thinking about this, which is the most dangerous moment for security research. As I try to fall asleep, I come up with tons of ideas, but I’m usually too tired or lazy to take notes, and so, quite frequently, I can’t remember them in the morning. But this one wasn’t forgotten!</p><h3 id="research">Research</h3><p>A new day and a curious mind demands answers. Why, how and, what if are the most dangerous questions in this field. If a Git repository has nothing to do with Go code, how does it appear in the Go checksum database?</p><p>From previous documentation readings, I knew that <code>proxy.golang.org</code> was the default modules proxy, and <code>sum.golang.org</code> for the checksum database. A couple of <code>ripgrep</code> searches in Go source code return nothing interesting, so it was time to read Go’s documentation, which is usually quite good.</p><p>Where to start? <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod">Go Modules Reference</a> was a great candidate and I finally found the answer to my question:</p><blockquote><p>If the go command consults the checksum database, then the first step is to retrieve the record data through the /lookup endpoint. If the module version is not yet recorded in the log, the checksum database will try to fetch it from the origin server before replying.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, this was easy! If the module doesn’t exist in the checksum database (and proxy), it will be downloaded by the checksum and proxy infrastructure. One of my questions was: how did the checksum database retrieve the modules since they can be anywhere? I couldn’t find anything in the Go code that was responsible for that (which wouldn’t explain at all how Ruby and Rust code ended up in the database).</p><p>So, the next logical step is easy. Can I get the Go checksum server to download arbitrary data?</p><p>According to the <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#checksum-database">documentation</a>, the endpoint to try this is <code>$base/lookup/$module@$version</code>:</p><blockquote><p>Returns the log record number for the entry about $module at $version, followed by the data for the record (that is, the go.sum lines for $module at $version) and a signed, encoded tree description that contains the record.</p></blockquote><p>First, let’s test it with a known record to see if and how it works:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>$ curl https://sum.golang.org/lookup/github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core@v0.0.0-20240524162643-646fe2715a1c

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Since the repository doesn’t seem to have any version tag the pseudo-version is used instead. Go <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#pseudo-versions">documentation</a> explains the logic behind pseudo-versions.</p><p>The next step is to verify wheter a new Go module repository will be added to the checksum database and proxy if we call the <code>lookup</code> endpoint, as described.</p><p>After creating a simple new Go module and uploading to my GitHub account I have tried to issue the <code>lookup</code> command in two different forms, one not totally according to documentation, the other one also incorrect but trying to follow documentation.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The errors are kind of expected since I haven’t versioned the module and wasn’t using the correct pseudo-version. But we can verify if the new module was fetched as described by the documentation. The easiest way would be to generate the correct pseudo-version and make another query to the checksum database. If the module was indeed downloaded, then the entry would exist and returned as in the <code>homebrew-core</code> test.</p><p>Another way would be to resync my copy of the checksum database and query it for my module:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>sqlite</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>modules</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> </span><span>path</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'github.com/gdbinit/fluxmatter'</span><span>;</span><span>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Around 95% of the unique paths present in <code>sum.golang.org</code> are hosted at GitHub. This is a raw statistic, without removing bogus data such as forks and targets that aren’t really Go code. But it still shows the magnitude of GitHub dependency in the Go ecosystem.</p><p>Go authors don’t seem to be completely unaware of this kind of scenario and implemented some restrictions, which are described in <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#zip-path-size-constraints">File path and size constraints</a> section. The most relevant one is:</p><blockquote><p>A module zip file may be at most 500 MiB in size. The total uncompressed size of its files is also limited to 500 MiB. go.mod files are limited to 16 MiB. LICENSE files are also limited to 16 MiB. These limits exist to mitigate denial of service attacks on users, proxies, and other parts of the module ecosystem. Repositories that contain more than 500 MiB of files in a module directory tree should tag module versions at commits that only include files needed to build the module’s packages; videos, models, and other large assets are usually not needed for builds.</p></blockquote><p>500MiB is more than enough for considerable abuse and all the others aren’t really a problem.</p><h3 id="abuse-what">Abuse what?</h3><p>For example, it can be used to bypass destination download restrictions on developer machines and in CI/CD servers (assuming that there isn’t a private GOPROXY). Malware can simply store payloads and retrieve them from the proxy when needed. And because we don’t have restrictions regarding the source domain (as long it’s a working VCS), we can load up the payloads from anywhere and make those sources disappear, leaving only a small trace in the checksum database entry.</p><p>A Denial of Service (DoS) attack on <code>proxy.golang.org</code> might be challenging to execute. I have shown that we can request any random Git repository (and probably any of the other supported VCS) to be downloaded by the proxy. For a possible attack, we would need to first gather as many GitHub URLs as possible and then issue as many requests as possible to the <code>lookup</code> API. I have no idea about the server implementation, but I would assume that something similar to a work queue is implemented, so there is a limit to the amount of parallel requests that will be processed. Bandwidth protections could also possibly be triggered from GitHub’s side. There is also a possibility of DoS-ing the storage space. I’m just guessing here :-).</p><p>A command and control (C2) can also be easily implemented on top of this. It’s very easy to find the latest version of any module using the <code>latest</code> query, so there isn’t need to query the checksum database and find all the available versions of our payload. The payload can be a simple file or can be disguised inside the <code>go.mod</code> or any other Go source file for extra stealthiness. A module DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) can be used to avoid using a single repository for the C2. My original goal was to write a sample C2 to demonstrate this, but there isn’t really much to be done here.</p><p>To download commands from the C2, the implant just needs the following steps:</p><ul><li><p>Make a request to <code>https://proxy.golang.org/module_path/@latest</code>.</p></li><li><p>Parse the JSON result and extract the pseudo-version (or version if used).</p></li><li><p>Make another request to <code>https://proxy.golang.org/module_path/@v/version.zip</code> to download the zip file.</p></li><li><p>Extract the zip contents and parse the commands.</p></li></ul><p>Quite easy in some 300 or less lines of Go code.</p><h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3><p>My questions have been answered, and now I understand how the checksum database process works. So far, it’s not a severe issue in Go infrastructure. It’s something that can be easily abused but also improved. Maybe there are (documented or not) reasons to let non-Go code be uploaded to the proxy and checksum database. Or maybe there is already someone abusing this, and we can go on a treasure hunt through the almost 1.6 million unique repositories (my up-to-date database copy contains almost 22 million entries).</p><p>I still have questions why certain valid non-Go projects are in the database. Are they doing it on purpose? Why? Using Go’s transparent log as safety backup? Any hints about this?</p><p>I had fun with this, and I have a bunch of ideas to further explore. I have a feeling… ;-).</p><p>Have fun,<br>fG!</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<dd>
<p>From a New York Times story by Nico Grant, under the headline “Google’s A.I. Search Errors Cause a Furor Online”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With each mishap, tech industry insiders have criticized the
company for dropping the ball. But in interviews, financial
analysts said Google needed to move quickly to keep up with its
rivals, even if it meant growing pains.</p>

<p>Google “doesn’t have a choice right now,” Thomas Monteiro, a
Google analyst at Investing.com, said in an interview.
“Companies need to move really fast, even if that includes
skipping a few steps along the way. The user experience will
just have to catch up.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That quote is insane. There’s no reason Google had to enable this feature now. None. If their search monopoly <a href="https://searchengineland.com/did-google-really-lose-search-market-share-to-microsoft-bing-in-april-440098">has been losing share recently</a>, it’s not because of rivals who are serving up AI-generated slop. It’s because even before this, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/24/zitron-google-search">Google’s search results quality was slipping in obvious ways</a>. This is just making it worse. They’ve turned Google Search — the crown jewel of the company, arguably the greatest consumer product ever made — into the butt of jokes.</p>

<p>LLM-powered search results are a bauble. The trust Google has built with users over the last 25 years is the most valuable asset the company owns. Google most certainly does have a choice, and they’ve chosen to erode that trust just so they can avoid accusations that they’re “behind”.</p>

<p>Behind is where you want to be when those who are ahead are publishing nonsense.</p>

(Source: SEMrush) (Credit: BBC)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>The changes came about because Google recognises the web has a problem. You've seen it yourself, if you've ever used a search engine. The Internet is dominated by a school of website building known as "search engine optimisation", or SEO, techniques that are meant to tune articles and web pages for better recognition from Google Search. Google even provides SEO tips, tools and advice for website owners. For millions of businesses that rely on the mechanisations of the Search machine, <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization">SEO can be an unavoidable game<!-- --></a>.<!-- --></p><p>The trouble is SEO can be abused. Enterprising website owners realised you can sometimes make more money by <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf">making content designed to please Google's algorithms<!-- --></a>, rather than the human beings it's ostensibly designed to serve.<!-- --></p><p>Google's efforts to address this issue aren't always successful. If you've ever been frustrated by what comes up when you search for something like "Best Sneakers for Women", you know the issue. Often, the results for popular search terms are crowded with websites that contain very little useful information, but tonnes of ads and links to retailers that earn publishers a share of profits. What's often lost is what you're probably looking for when you open up Google: information from people who are knowledgeable and passionate about their topic.<!-- --></p><p>Google's war on spammy Search results has ramped up. In 2022, the company issued a "<!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/products/search/more-content-by-people-for-people-in-search/">Helpful Content Update<!-- --></a>" to its algorithm meant to weed out content created solely for the purpose of ranking higher on Search. Google issued a subsequent update in September, 2023, and <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-update-march-2024/">a third algorithm tweak in March of this year<!-- --></a>. Google says the result is "45% less low-quality, unoriginal content in search results". It could be viewed as a wild success.<!-- --></p><p>"Our recent updates aim to connect people with content that is helpful, satisfying and original, from a diverse range of sites across the web," a Google spokesperson tells the BBC. "As we work to improve Search, we're continuing to focus on sending valuable traffic to sites and supporting a healthy, open web."<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0j04dck.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Serenity Strull/BBC/Getty Images For better or worse, Google Search dictates the shape of the web.

Some online publishers say the company wields that power irresponsibly (Credit: Serenity Strull/BBC/Getty Images)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>But the updates had some surprising consequences as well. For example, data from the analytics tool <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="http://semrush/">SEMrush<!-- --></a> suggests that the website for New York Magazine lost 32% of its Google Search traffic in the past six months, while GQ.com shrank 26%. The data indicates <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/">Urban Dictionary<!-- --></a>, a wildly popular crowdsourced dictionary of English language slang, dropped some 18 million page views, amounting to more than half its Search traffic. OprahDaily.com was down nearly 58%. (SEMrush is an industry-standard tool, but its numbers are estimates and this data only measures traffic coming from Google Search, specifically.)<!-- --></p><p>A New York Magazine spokesperson said these findings were incomplete and didn't reflect the company's internal analysis. Representatives for GQ, Oprah Daily and Urban Dictionary did not respond to requests for comment by the time this article was published. However, experts and more than half a dozen media executives and websites owners told the BBC the broad trends in the data are all too real.<!-- --></p><div data-component="quote-block"><p><span>The increase in traffic Reddit is seeing is unprecedented on the Internet – Lily Ray</span></p></div><p>In place of these sites, there's one platform you'll be seeing much, much more of: Reddit. According to SEMrush, Reddit saw a surge that amounted to a 126% growth in traffic from Google Search. The company is already feeling the benefit. Reddit just announced its first quarterly earnings since becoming a publicly traded company in March 2024. Its <!-- --><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68610711">revenue totals $243m (£191m)<!-- --></a>, up an eye-watering 48% from the year prior.<!-- --></p><p>"The increase in traffic Reddit is seeing is unprecedented on the Internet," says Lily Ray, vice president of SEO strategy and research at the marketing agency <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amsive.com/">Amsive<!-- --></a>, and a celebrity in the world of SEO. "Cooking content, adult content, video games, gardening, fashion, everything is all just Reddit."<!-- --></p><p>A representative for Reddit declined to comment.<!-- --></p><p>Reddit isn't the only winner after Google's recent algorithm updates. SEMrush data shows that other user-generated sites such as Quora and Instagram saw similarly astronomical rises, and there were impressive spikes at LinkedIn and Wikipedia as well. In one sense, Google was just following a trend. Over the past few years, swaths of savvy internet users started <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90722739/is-reddit-a-better-search-engine-than-google">adding the word "Reddit" to the end of their web searches<!-- --></a> in the hopes it would bring up people sharing their honest opinions, as opposed to websites trying to game Google's system. It's something Google's public liaison for search, Danny Sullivan, <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1bne9i3/comment/kxqaqmp/">has noted<!-- --></a>.<!-- --></p><p>"We've found that people often want to learn from others' experiences, and so we surface content from hundreds of forums and other communities across the web," a Google spokesperson says. "Our agreement with Reddit absolutely did not include ranking its content higher on Search."<!-- --></p><p>But Google results are a zero-sum game. If the search engine sends traffic to one site, it has to take it from another, and the effects on the losers in this Reddit equation are just as dramatic. "Google's just committing war on publisher websites," Ray says. "It's almost as if Google designed an algorithm update to specifically go after small bloggers. I've talked to so many people who've just had everything wiped out," she says.<!-- --></p><p>A number of website owners and search experts who spoke to the BBC said there's been a general shift in Google results towards websites with big established brands, and away from small and independent sites, that seems totally disconnected from the quality of the content.<!-- --></p><p>The change was instant for Daniel Hart, editor-in-chief of the UK-based entertainment news site <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://readysteadycut.com/">Ready Steady Cut<!-- --></a>. "After Google's September update, our traffic halved immediately, and it's only gotten worse. We've just been blitzed by the Reddit stuff in particular, but we're also being replaced by spam websites that are stealing our content. It makes no sense," Hart says. In the months following, the lost income forced Ready Steady Cut to reduce its team of 20 writers and editors down to just four, Hart says.<!-- --></p><p>A Google spokesperson said the company's recent updates have dealt a major blow to spammy, unoriginal content, and Google keeps a close watch on evolving abusive practices that lead to low-quality information in Search.<!-- --></p><p>After Google's updates, the company provided tips to website owners and said there was a path to recovery. Hart says the site hired consultants and pivoted to focus on Google's recommendations, spending sleepless nights working to update the site. After almost a year, none of it helped. "I wasted the last eight months of my life trying to follow Google's advice." he says. "Google claims they want content from people with first-hand experience and helpful context, and we're a massive example of that. It's just heartbreaking."<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0j04fnt.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="A few examples show how recent changes to Google Search had startling effects on a wide variety of websites.

(Source: SEMrush) (Credit: BBC)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>But the biggest offence, according to the website owners and content creators who spoke to the BBC, is the AI generated responses.<!-- --></p><p>Google argues its AI overviews in search results will be a boon to websites. Liz Reid, Google's head of search, wrote in a <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/">blog post<!-- --></a> that the company's AI search results actually increase traffic that Google sends to websites. "AI Overviews get more clicks than if the page had appeared as a traditional web listing for that query," Reid wrote. "As we expand this experience, we’ll continue to focus on sending valuable traffic to publishers and creators." However, the company hasn't shared any of the data backing up that claim, and many website owners and industry experts worry the opposite effect is just as likely.<!-- --></p><p>Katie Berry, owner of the cleaning advice website <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://housewifehowtos.com/">Housewife How-Tos<!-- --></a>, assumes users will just end their searches if Google's AI answers questions for them. The AI search results "<!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/thatkatieberry/status/1790726312820171104">answer questions superficially<!-- --></a>, and often incorrectly, so people don't visit my site," Berry says. According to Berry, her site's traffic fell 70% after the 2022 Google update and dropped even further after Google started testing its new AI. "My site had more traffic in its first months of existence than it gets now, even though my rankings have not changed all that much," she says.<!-- --></p><p>Others, such as travel writer David Leiter, say the potential consequences are especially problematic because they feel Google's AI is outright stealing their content.<!-- --></p><p>For example, Leiter says a search for "Best Slot Canyons Near Las Vegas" used to bring up an article on his website, <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://theworldtravelguy.com/slot-canyons-las-vegas-nevada/">World Travel Guy<!-- --></a>. However, a search earlier this week brought up an AI-generated response at the top of the page instead.<!-- --></p><p>"Google has replaced my article with the giant AI Overview box, and it spits out an answer that is mostly wrong," Leiter says. "The first four places it lists are not even slot canyons. A slot canyon is a specific type of canyon with a narrow passageway, but the AI doesn't understand that. It's just listing random canyons and even a walking trail instead." The AI Overview did include a link to Leiter's article, but only if you took the time to click a tiny arrow at the bottom of the result. Leiter says he doesn't believe he'll get more traffic than he used to as the top search result. In either case, it's a small consolation. Leiter says Google's recent algorithm updates erased 95% of his traffic.<!-- --></p><p>Google acknowledges that AI tools may provide inaccurate information, but says it's constantly working to improve results. A Google spokesperson says AI Overviews are generally taken from multiple webpages, not single sources, and the responses are designed to highlight relevant links. The spokesperson says publishers can use a <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag">special tag<!-- --></a> on their webpages to control whether or not AI Overviews includes a link to their sites. However, once an AI model scrapes your content, it may be impossible to remove that data.<!-- --></p><p>Media executives aren't the only ones questioning Google's control of the internet. Google is simultaneously battling numerous antitrust lawsuits against different parts of the company's sprawling £1.7tn ($2.2tn) business. The company is currently awaiting a decision in a lawsuit brought by the US Department of Justice <!-- --><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66755272">accusing Google of running an illegal monopoly<!-- --></a> in the search engine industry. If the tech giant loses the case, the penalties could range from massive fines to a forced break-up of the company.<!-- --></p><p>Google, which controls more than 90% of the worldwide search business, argues that the company's success stems solely from the fact that it makes superior products. A Google spokesperson says the company faces "immense competition" and people have many choices about how they search for information online.<!-- --></p><p>"I understand that Google doesn't owe us or anyone else traffic," says Navarro, of House Fresh. "But Google controls the roads. If tomorrow they decide the roads won't go to an entire town, that down dies. It's too much power to just shrug and say, 'Oh well, it's just the free market,'" she says.<!-- --></p><p>"I might just try working in the offline world, just pack it all up and tend a shop somewhere," says Navarro. "Maybe it was naive to think we could succeed just by making great original content that people want to read."<!-- --></p><p>--<!-- --></p><p><i id="For timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the ">For timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the <!-- --></i><a target="_self" href="https://cloud.email.bbc.com/techdecoded-newsletter-signup?&amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;at_medium=Onsite&amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;at_ptr_type=&amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;at_format=&amp;at_link_origin=&amp;at_campaign=techdecoded&amp;at_campaign_id=&amp;at_adset_name=&amp;at_adset_id=&amp;at_creation=&amp;at_creative_id=&amp;at_campaign_type=owned"><b id="Tech Decoded newsletter"><i id="Tech Decoded newsletter">Tech Decoded newsletter<!-- --></i></b></a><i id=", while ">, while <!-- --></i><a target="_self" href="https://cloud.email.bbc.com/SignUp10_08?&amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;at_medium=Onsite&amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;at_link_origin=featuresarticle&amp;at_campaign=essentiallist&amp;at_campaign_type=owned"><b id="The Essential List"><i id="The Essential List">The Essential List<!-- --></i></b></a><i id=" delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week."> delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.<!-- --></i>&nbsp;<!-- --></p></article></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Lapis is a framework for building web applications in <a href="https://lua.org/">Lua</a> (or <a href="https://moonscript.org/">MoonScript</a>) that primarily targets <a href="https://openresty.org/">OpenResty</a>, a high performance web platform that runs on a customized version of <a href="https://nginx.org/">Nginx</a>. Lapis can also be used in other server environments, being compatible with any modern version of Lua.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>With OpenResty, Lua is run directly inside of the Nginx worker using LuaJIT, giving you the
smallest barrier between the webserver and your code. Have a look at <a href="http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks">Web Framework
Benchmarks</a> just to see how OpenResty
stacks up against other platforms.</p>

<p>Utilizing the power of <a href="https://leafo.net/posts/itchio-and-coroutines.html">Lua
coroutines</a>, you can write
clean code that looks synchronous but can achieve high throughput by
automatically running asynchronously without blocking. Networking operations
like database queries and HTTP requests will automatically yield to allow for
handling concurrent requests, all without all that callback spaghetti seen in
other asynchronous platforms. It’s fast, easy to read, and easy to write.</p>

<h2>Templates</h2>

<p>Write your templates either in <a href="https://github.com/leafo/etlua">etlua</a> or in
pure Lua/MoonScript.</p>

<p>The <code>Widget</code> base class allows you to organize your templates as modules,
enabling you to use inheritance and mixins to mix and match methods combined
with the HTML builder syntax that lets you express HTML with the full power of
the language you're already using.</p>

<p>The HTML builder syntax makes you immune to cross site scripting attacks from
user-provided input by ensuring all written content is escaped correctly.</p>
