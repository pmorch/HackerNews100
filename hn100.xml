                                        <p>RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil’s national data protection authority determined on Tuesday that Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, cannot use data originating in the country to train its artificial intelligence. </p><p>Meta’s updated privacy policy enables the company to feed people’s public posts into its AI systems. That practice will not be permitted in Brazil, however.</p><p>The decision stems from “the imminent risk of serious and irreparable or difficult-to-repair damage to the fundamental rights of the affected data subjects,” the agency said in the nation’s official gazette. </p><p>Brazil is one of Meta’s biggest markets. Facebook alone has around 102 million active users in the country, the agency said in a statement. The nation has a population of 203 million, according to the country’s 2022 census.</p><p>A spokesperson for Meta said in a statement the company is “disappointed” and insists its method “complies with privacy laws and regulations in Brazil.”</p>
    

<p>“This is a step backwards for innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Brazil,” the spokesperson added.</p>



<p>The social media company has also encountered resistance to its privacy policy update in Europe, where it recently put on hold its plans to start feeding people’s public posts into training AI systems — which was supposed to start last week.</p><p>In the U.S., where there’s no national law protecting online privacy, such training is already happening.</p>
    
<p>Meta said on its Brazilian blog in May that it could “use information that people have shared publicly about Meta’s products and services for some of our generative AI features,” which could include “public posts or photos and their captions.”</p><p>Refusing to partake is possible, Meta said in that statement. Despite that option, there are “excessive and unjustified obstacles to accessing the information and exercising” the right to opt out, the agency said in a statement. </p>
    

<p>Meta did not provide sufficient information to allow people to be aware of the possible consequences of using their personal data for the development of generative AI, it added.</p><p>Meta isn’t the only company that has sought to train its AI systems on data from Brazilians.</p><p>Human Rights Watch released a report last month that found that personal photos of identifiable Brazilian children sourced from a large database of online images — pulled from parent blogs, the websites of professional event photographers and video-sharing sites such as YouTube — were being used to create AI image-generator tools without families’ knowledge. In some cases, those tools have been used create AI-generated nude imagery.</p><p>Hye Jung Han, a Brazil-based researcher for the rights group, said in an email Tuesday that the regulator’s action “helps to protect children from worrying that their personal data, shared with friends and family on Meta’s platforms, might be used to inflict harm back on them in ways that are impossible to anticipate or guard against.”</p><p>But the decision regarding Meta will “very likely” encourage other companies to refrain from being transparent in the use of data in the future, said Ronaldo Lemos, of the Institute of Technology and Society of Rio de Janeiro, a think-tank. </p>
    

<p>“Meta was severely punished for being the only one among the Big Tech companies to clearly and in advance notify in its privacy policy that it would use data from its platforms to train artificial intelligence,” he said. </p><p>Compliance must be demonstrated by the company within five working days from the notification of the decision, and the agency established a daily fine of 50,000 reais ($8,820) for failure to do so.</p>

          <div itemprop="text" id="post_1">
              <p>First of all, I understand that Sonar is a well intentioned product.</p>
<p>It’s right <em>most</em> of the time.  Unfortunately coding is, of course, complex and it’s challenging for a product like Sonar to keep pace with the fast changing syntax of newer languages.</p>
<p>I’m an experienced Developer and Team Lead, currently coding in Kotlin with Coroutines. I’ve also worked with Java, C++, C, Objective-C and Swift.  We can all learn more, but I’ve been around the block and know a few things about what code quality looks like and how to make pragmatic decisions around it.</p>
<p>Our ‘default’ Sonar setup is currently making me ‘butcher’ my Kotlin code to comply with it’s rules and, as you may tell, it’s really upsetting.</p>
<p>You may say <em>“The rules can be customised”</em>, or <em>“Allow an exception”</em>.  You need to understand <strong>that is not a simple option for many of your users</strong>.  In my case, I have a superior who administers Sonar and is, let’s say, completely committed to it.  For any ‘exception granted’ we would have to book time with them days in advance then white-board the reason why Sonar is wrong, or produce a sample program - who has got time for that with tight deadlines?</p>
<p>Please rethink your UX with the realisation that there are probably many professional and experienced software engineers out there who - far from appreciating your product, actually feel genuinely oppressed by it: like victims of a cold unfeeling system with no ‘right to reply’.  Unable to merge deadline code until every point is addressed, for better or worse.  It’s a terrible helpless feeling.</p>
<p>A couple of Kotlin examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inability to define a single suspending function interface. Sonar tells me to make it a fun interface, then tells me fun interfaces can’t have suspending functions.  I should make this a functional type instead?  Completely <em>inconsistent</em> with the rest of the code and removes the opportunity to provide information though labelling the function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sonar doesn’t respect import aliasing.  Let’s say I have Domain and Service models for some entities.  I have ‘Person’ defined in domain and service packages. In one of those packages, I want to write a mapper extension.  I use import aliasing to disambiguate each ‘Person’ as DomainPerson and ServicePerson.  This is an informative convention, but Sonar doesn’t allow it: <code>import service.Person as ServicePerson</code> is considered redundant.  I could then use a private typealias ServicePerson = Person` but this isn’t the same.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just two examples, I could find more.</p>
<p><strong>Can you do something with your product</strong> to give users more of a ‘right to reply’ and re-empower them?<br>
There will be creative ways to achieve this without undermining Sonar’s purpose.  Just some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow a user role where rules can be overridden but the admin gets informed and can remove the override at a later time.</li>
<li>A mode where an override can be granted by 3-4 other users all agreeing, who aren’t admins.</li>
<li>Button to fast-access (lazily create) a community thread regarding a certain rule, to report a problem with it, so you know your difficulty is being heard at least by Sonar, if not within your organisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for listening to my part rant, part suggestions.  This is sincere.</p>

              <p>Hey there.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback. It’s essential in our quest to ensure developers not only find value in our products but also enjoy and feel empowered by the experience.</p>
<p>If you disagree with a rule implementation, I encourage you to post the details in the category titled <a href="https://community.sonarsource.com/c/clean-code/fp/7">Report a False-Positive/False-Negative</a>, for which we <a href="https://community.sonarsource.com/t/how-to-report-a-false-positive-false-negative/37022">have a post detailing what is required to report</a> (code sample, product versions, rule IDs…). Our teams are very reactive and enjoy engaging in these discussions.</p>

<p>There is an <a href="https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/instance-administration/security/#:~:text=permission%C2%A0below.-,Project%20permissions,-Project%20permissions%20are"><strong>Administer Issue</strong></a> permission that in most organizations would be granted to Team leaders or experienced developers (like yourself) to be able to mark issues as False-Positive/Won’t Fix.</p>
<p>Somebody else (like your superior) has at least two options (maybe more) to discover these exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the <strong>Issues</strong> tab of a project (or the SonarQube instance overall) to filter for issues that are marked as False-Positive / Won’t Fix if they want to do some kind of global review.</li>
<li>Configure a project-level <a href="https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/instance-administration/notifications/">e-mail notification</a> for <strong>Issues resolved as false positive or won’t fix</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And, to be honest, Chris, if you have a superior that trusts in Sonar 100% and trusts you and your fellow developers very little (unwilling to delegate permissions, decision making)… I think that’s the root of your problem and not one that can be fixed with product changes. We create a new user role? Enable some kind of consensus-driven issue status? Your superior could just decide not to grant it.</p>
<p>Happy to continue discussing this.</p>

<p>if you have a superior that trusts in Sonar 100% and trusts you and your fellow developers very little (unwilling to delegate permissions, decision making)… I think that’s the root of your problem</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You make a fair point that anyone who uses a tool and does not understand is part of the problem.  However, if the tool could be easier to understand, that could go a long way to addressing that issue.</p>
<p>Respectfully, the root of the problem is that SonarQube is not clear to everyone who uses it.  Specifically, it offers little towards gauging what is important and and what is not.  Programmers have been engaged with a tug of war with management since the dawn of the digital era.  Managers, who don’t understand coding well enough to police it, are now offered Sonarqube as a policing tool.  They are given a bat to hit programmers over the head.  This has an easy metric for determining perfections – 0 issues found.  It’s a managers dream – a computer that sums up everything you need to know in one number.  If you give someone a bat, they’re going to use it to hit things.  It’s pretty simple.</p>
<p>The number of issues found in your project is similar to likes on social media – it’s a badge of honor to show off to all your manager friends. I have a coding library that’s tens of thousands of lines.  Military Standard data types are defined by two numbers, so my (Java) class names end with something like “_1234_567”  Like a good programmer, my fields and getters follow the same naming pattern.<br>
This violates S101, S116, S100, S101 for a total of 4.7k hits. This has caused everyone to freak out.</p>
<p>The OP point is well taken, that if I had an opportunity to add some structured comments to that report before a manager read it, the sky would not be falling.  Now I am having trouble explaining in meeting after meeting, “we violated 4 <em>MINOR</em> rules on purpose.  So if we ignore those rules like we’re supposed to, the 4,700 hits go away.”  To which they respond, “You want us to cover up 4,700 hits?”</p>
<p>Clearly, it’s a major problem that they don’t understand a minor sonarqube finding “<a href="https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/issues/#:~:text=MINOR%3A%20A%20quality%20flaw%20that,quality%20flaw%2C%20just%20a%20finding." rel="noopener nofollow ugc">may slightly impact developer productivity</a>” and it <strong>may also not</strong> affect quality.</p>
<p>So thanks to Sonarqube, I am going to have to make my code unreadable to a human in order to please management, which means INTENTIONALLY creating a mountain of technical debt.  But that’s okay, because Sonarqube doesn’t count it.</p>
<p>Sonarqube exacerbates the problem of communication with management; it does not help it. The problem is how the information is presented.  As OP pointed out, Programmers don’t have an opportunity to respond proactively to the issues.  It’s fair to blame managers, it also fair to blame the bad information they are given to make decisions. For example, your issue count could be broken down into “must address” and “not urgent” or the like.  It could further have something like, “4,712 issues have open discussions, here is a link.”  The idea that a single number could sum up technical debt is simply dangerous.  It encourages people to NOT investigate and learn more.  It encourages people to not listen.</p>
<p>“Dude, look, it’s really simple, your project has 4,700 sonarqube findings, everyone else has less than 100.  This is a job performance problem.”  – Overheard in a meeting</p>
<p>Finally, I have a question.  Are there articles posted by Sonarsource telling managers how to interpret sonarqube results properly?  I’ve been scouring the web for “how to handle minor sonarqube issues best practice” and found nothing useful to my case.  I’d welcome knowledge if anyone has any.</p>

              <p>Hey there <a href="https://community.sonarsource.com/u/jeremy_cox">@Jeremy_Cox</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for the super valuable feedback (that we’ve been discussing a lot internally). I want to provide a few preliminary notes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We’re conscious of the fact that Sonar can be misused, and we’ve made some efforts to minimize how easy that is. We once had a feature (meant to “gamify” fixing issues and not introducing new ones) which… you guessed it, resulted in some managers using it to measure individual performance. Some organizations loved this feature! We removed it because it absolutely didn’t align with our values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A big shift is going to come to our products soon (this year) that will shift focus on raising <em>findings</em> about <em>facts</em> about the code (<em>this is not a coding practice that aligns with our organization’s practices</em>), rather than <em>issues</em> with a hypothesized impact (“this may slightly impact developer productivity”). This repositioning might also make it easier to explain why you want to ignore a rule. T</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of this shift we are also looking at how to make sure Clean Code (and Clean as You Code) is easy to understand by governance stakeholders and de-emphasize issue count. Yes, there will be product changes that have to happen as well as education/positioning that has to change (no silver bullets, only lots of reuglar ones)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t think we have anything regarding this. It’s a valid point I’ll pass on.</p>
<p>Please don’t hesitate to keep giving us honest feedback as things progress, or if you’ve thought of any other points you want to share. Feedback is a gift. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/gift.png?v=12" title=":gift:" alt=":gift:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

							<div class="hide_article"> -->
								<p>Bruce Bastian, an alumnus of Brigham Young University who pioneered a successful word-processing application and later would become an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, died Sunday.</p>
<p>Bastian, 76, passed away surrounded by his four sons, husband Clint Ford, friends and other family members, the <a href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/human-rights-campaign-mourns-the-loss-of-bruce-bastian-champion-for-lgbtq-equality-hrc-board-member-for-22-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Human Rights Campaign</a> reported.</p>
<p>His death was marked family and members of the LGBTQ+ community he championed, as well as other organizations he was involved with.</p>
<p>“I think people will remember him for a number of reasons, from his work with technology, his philanthropy, and within the LGBTQ community. As for others, we’ll remember him as a loving husband and father,” Bastian’s oldest son, Rick, told the Daily Herald.</p>
<p>Bastian was a member of the Human Rights Campaign, Encircle, Equality Utah and the Utah Pride Center. He traveled to the nation’s capital and fought for equal marriage rights while advocating for inclusion of people with differing sexual orientations.</p>
<p>“Bruce was in this fight, working at every level of politics and advocacy, for over three decades,” Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a press release. “He traveled all across this country on HRC’s behalf and worked tirelessly to help build an inclusive organization where more people could be a part of this work.”</p>
<p>Bastian also was a major supporter of organizations like Equality Utah, Utah Pride Center, and Encircle.</p>
<p><a href="https://encircletogether.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Encircle</a> has a series of homes throughout Utah that provide mental health services, resources and tools for LGBTQ+ youth and families. Encircle opened its first location seven years ago <a href="https://encircletogether.org/visit-a-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Provo</a>, and it was named after Bastian and Ford.</p>
<p>“Bruce was an invaluable member of our community and worked tirelessly to make our country a safer place for LGBTQ+ individuals,” Encircle’s CEO, Jordan Sgro, said in an emailed statement sent to the Daily Herald. “He was instrumental in building Encircle and we would not be where we are today without support from Bruce and his husband, Clint. Most importantly, Bruce was a friend and an incredible mentor, and served for years on our Board of Directors. He will be greatly missed.”</p>
<p>Prior to his social impact and philanthropic work, or even entrepreneurship, Bastian moved to Utah from southern Idaho to attend Brigham Young University. During the mid 1970s, he served as director of the <a href="https://byucougars.com/the-power-of-the-wasatch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cougar Marching Band</a>.</p>
<p>In 1979, while still attending the university as a graduate student in computer science, he co-founded what would eventually become WordPerfect Corp. along with faculty member Alan Ashton. It initially was developed as a word-processing software for a minicomputer owned by the City of Orem. Bastian and Ashton were able to maintain ownership of the software.</p>
<p>The company served as a dominant force in the technology space throughout the 1980s and 1990s. At one point, Bastian was worth $840 million, the <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2003/6/22/19730449/bastian-s-profile-low-151-in-utah-at-least/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deseret News</a> reported in 2003.</p>
<p>Bastian stepped down from his role as chairman of WordPerfect in 1994 and the company was sold to Novell a short time later.</p>
<p>Bastian would go on to focus his time on charitable causes and philanthropy. In 1997, he started the <a href="https://bastianfoundation.org/about_us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B.W. Bastian Foundation</a>, whose commitment is to only support organizations that fully embrace equality.</p>
<p>“The impact he had on so many lives was immeasurable,” Michael Marriott, the foundation’s executive director, said in a press release. “His spirit and memory will live on through Clint, his husband of six years, through Bruce’s four sons and their families, and through the many lives he touched through his generosity, time, energy and commitment to making the world a better place. And Bruce’s legacy will continue in the work of the B.W. Bastian Foundation and its mission.”</p>
<p>Bastian also maintained his love for music and the arts. In 2010, then-President Barack Obama <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/realitycheck/the-press-office/president-obama-announces-more-key-administration-posts-22610" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointed him to the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Arts</a>.</p>
<p>Bastian continued to use his resources and fortune to support organizations providing services to Utah’s LGBTQ+ community and other pro-equality causes, including the Utah Democratic Party.</p>
<p>“Bruce Bastian was a light to the people of our state,” Utah Democratic Party Chair Diane Lewis said in a statement. “His example calls on us to do more, especially when it comes to supporting our LGBTQ+ community.”</p>
<p>Bastian was born March 23, 1948, in Twin Falls, Idaho. He grew up on his family’s farm before moving south to Provo to attend BYU, where he earned a bachelor’s in music education and his master’s in computer science.</p>
<p>His adult life was spent in Orem and Palm Springs, California, where he lived with Ford.</p>
<p>In addition to his partner and four sons, Bastian also leaves behind 14 grandchildren, two sisters and a brother.</p>
<p>Rick Bastian says he wants his father to be remembered as being courageous, someone who stood up for social justice and advocated for others. “We’ll miss him dearly,” he said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Zusammenfassung</h2><p>We introduce Meta 3D Gen (3DGen), a new state-of-the-art, fast pipeline for text-to-3D asset generation. 3DGen offers 3D asset creation with high prompt fidelity and high-quality 3D shapes
and textures in under a minute. It supports physically-based rendering (PBR), necessary for 3D asset relighting in real-world applications. Additionally, 3DGen supports generative retexturing of previously generated (or artist-created) 3D shapes using additional textual inputs provided by the user. 3DGen integrates key technical components, Meta 3D AssetGen and Meta 3D TextureGen, that we developed for text-to-3D and text-to-texture generation, respectively. By combining their strengths, 3DGen represents 3D objects simultaneously in three ways: in view space, in volumetric space, and in UV (or texture) space. The integration of these two techniques achieves a win rate of
68% with respect to the single-stage model. We compare 3DGen to numerous industry baselines, and show that it outperforms them in terms of prompt fidelity and visual quality for complex textual prompts, while being significantly faster.</p><a role="button" href="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/449707112_509645168082163_2193712134508658234_n.pdf?_nc_cat=111&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=3c67a6&amp;_nc_ohc=5bSbn3KaluAQ7kNvgHdZ399&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;gid=AXBASXz1KO8tg3z1y-Ars0j&amp;oh=00_AYCt-8K376OTlrWw8mqkXdaNoo4nF8ugEL3fZyLp9Kc7oQ&amp;oe=668A1851" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;button&quot;,&quot;creative_detail&quot;:&quot;button&quot;,&quot;create_type&quot;:&quot;button&quot;,&quot;create_type_detail&quot;:&quot;button&quot;}" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><p>Download the Paper</p></a></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Earlier this year, we introduced <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data/">GraphRAG<span> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, a graph-based approach to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that enables question-answering over private or previously unseen datasets. Today, we’re pleased to announce that GraphRAG is now available on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub<span> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, offering more structured information retrieval and comprehensive response generation than naive RAG approaches.&nbsp;The GraphRAG code repository is complemented by a <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/graphrag-accelerator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solution accelerator<span> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, providing an easy-to-use API experience hosted on Azure that can be deployed code-free in a few clicks. </p>



<p>GraphRAG uses a large language model (LLM) to automate the extraction of a rich knowledge graph from any collection of text documents. One of the most exciting features of this graph-based data index is its ability to report on the semantic structure of the data prior to any user queries. It does this by detecting “communities” of densely connected nodes in a hierarchical fashion, partitioning the graph at multiple levels from high-level themes to low-level topics, as illustrated in Figure 1. Using an LLM to summarize each of these communities creates a hierarchical summary of the data, providing an overview of a dataset without needing to know which questions to ask in advance. Each community serves as the basis of a <em>community summary</em> that describes its entities and their relationships.</p>

Knowledge graph of entity nodes and relationship edges derived from a <a href="https://github.com/yixuantt/MultiHop-RAG/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news dataset<span> (opens in new tab)</span></a>, with different colors representing various communities. Level 0 communities (left) represent the highest-level themes of the dataset, while level 1 communities (right) show the emergence of more granular topics within these themes.</figcaption></figure>







<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/from-local-to-global-a-graph-rag-approach-to-query-focused-summarization/">preprint</a>, we explore how these community summaries can also help answer <em>global questions</em>—which address the entire dataset rather than focusing on specific chunks of text—where naive RAG approaches based on vector search fall short. For example, consider the question “What are the main themes in the dataset?” This is a reasonable starting point but one where naive RAG will always give misleading answers. This is because it generates answers from chunks of text semantically similar to the question, not necessarily from the subset of input texts needed to answer it.</p>



<p>However, if a question addresses the entire dataset, <em>all</em> input texts should be considered. Since naive RAG only considers the top-<em>k </em>most similar chunks of input text, it fails. Even worse, it will match the question against chunks of text that are superficially similar to that question, resulting in misleading answers. Community summaries help answer such global questions because the graph index of entity and relationship descriptions has already considered all input texts in its construction. Therefore, we can use a map-reduce approach for question answering that retains all relevant content from the global data context:</p>



<ol start="1">
<li>Group community reports up to the LLM context window size.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Map the question across each group to create community answers.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Reduce all relevant community answers into a final global answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="evaluation-and-results">Evaluation and results&nbsp;</h2>



<p>To evaluate this approach against naive RAG and hierarchical source-text summarization, we used the LLM GPT-4 to generate a diverse set of activity-centered sense-making questions from short descriptions of two datasets: podcast transcripts and news articles. We then selected three metrics for head-to-head comparison of generated answers, as evaluated by an LLM judge: comprehensiveness (covers all aspects in detail), diversity (provides different perspectives), and empowerment (supports informed decision making).</p>



<p>The results show that GraphRAG, when using community summaries at any level of the community hierarchy, outperforms naive RAG on comprehensiveness and diversity (~70–80% win rate). GraphRAG using intermediate- and low-level community summaries also performed better than source text summarization on these metrics at lower token costs (~20–70% token use per query). Performance was competitive with hierarchical source text summarization for the highest-level communities at substantially lower token costs (~2–3% token use per query). This is shown in Figure 2.</p>

<h2 id="research-insights-and-future-directions">Research insights and future directions&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Through the initial research cycle, we demonstrated that LLMs can successfully derive rich knowledge graphs from unstructured text inputs, and these graphs can support a new class of global queries for which (a) naive RAG cannot generate appropriate responses, and (b) hierarchical source text summarization is prohibitively expensive per query. The overall suitability of GraphRAG for any given use case, however, depends on whether the benefits of structured knowledge representations, readymade community summaries, and support for global queries outweigh the upfront costs of graph index construction.</p>



<p>We’re currently exploring various approaches to reduce these costs while maintaining response quality. Our latest work on automatically tuning LLM extraction prompts to the problem domain is an example of how we are reducing the upfront effort required to customize these prompts, enumerate entity types, create few-shot examples, and so on. To enable evaluation of GraphRAG with minimal upfront indexing costs, we’re also investigating NLP-based approaches to approximating the knowledge graph and community summaries that would be generated by a full indexing process. Our goal is to ensure that, whatever the constraints of the deployment context, there is a GraphRAG configuration that can accommodate these constraints while still delivering exceptional response quality.</p>







<p>By making GraphRAG and a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/graphrag-accelerator/">solution accelerator<span> (opens in new tab)</span></a> publicly available, we aim to make graph-based RAG approaches more accessible for users and use cases where it’s critical to understand data at a global level. We encourage community feedback and suggestions on both the code repository and solution accelerator as we work together to enable the next generation of RAG experiences.</p>

<p dir="auto">This is a Vim script port of <a href="https://github.com/rui314/8cc">8cc</a> built on <a href="https://github.com/shinh/elvm">ELVM</a>.
In other words, this is a complete C compiler written in Vim script.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/rui314/8cc">8cc</a> is a nicely-written small C compiler for x86_64 Linux. It's C11-aware and self-hosted.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/shinh/elvm">ELVM</a> is a <strong>E</strong>so <strong>L</strong>ang <strong>V</strong>irtual <strong>M</strong>achine.
ELVM retargets 8cc to emit its own intermediate representation, EIR.
ELVM compiles C code into EIR with the retargeted 8cc as frontend. And then translates EIR into various targets (Python, Ruby, C,
BrainFxxk, Piet, Befunge, Emacs Lisp, ...) in backend. The architecture resembles LLVM.
<a href="http://shinh.skr.jp/slide/elvm/000.html" rel="nofollow">This presentation</a> is a good stuff to know ELVM architecture further (though in Japanese).</p>
<p dir="auto">ELVM can compile itself into various targets.
So I added a new 'Vim script' backend and use it to translate C code of 8cc into Vim script.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now 8cc.vim is written in pure Vim script. 8cc.vim consists of frontend (customized 8cc) and backend (ELC).
It can compile C code into Vim script. And of course Vim can evaluate the generated Vim script code.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that this is a toy project. 8cc.vim is much much slower.
It takes 824 (frontend: 430 + backend: 396) seconds to compile the simplest <code>putchar()</code> program
on MacBook Pro Early 2015 (2.7 GHz Intel Core i5). But actually it works!</p>
<p dir="auto">As VM runs on Vim script, 8cc.vim works on Linux, OS X and (hopefully) Windows.</p>

                         <p>
            July 2nd, 2024</p><!-- .entry-meta -->
        <p>Once upon a time, the IBM PC was released.</p>
<p>In the IBM PC BIOS, you could enter characters that weren’t present on the keyboard by holding the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key and typing the decimal value on the numeric keypad. For example, you could enter ñ by holding <kbd>Alt</kbd> and typing <kbd>Numpad1</kbd> <kbd>Numpad6</kbd> <kbd>Numpad4</kbd>, then releasing the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key.</p>
<p>For expository simplicity, I will henceforth use the notation <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>164</kbd> to indicate that you press the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key, then type the specified digits in sequence on the numeric keypad, then release the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key.</p>
<p>Okay, so in the IBM PC BIOS, when you typed <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>…</kbd>, the code numbers were treated as decimal byte values, and the result on the screen came from your video card’s character generator. In the United States, the character generator’s ROM showed what we today call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437"> Code Page 437</a>.</p>
<p>When it was introduced, Windows in the United States used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252"> Code Page 1252</a> as its 8-bit character set, which it called the “ANSI character set”; the old BIOS character set was retroactively named the OEM character set. To preserve compatibility with MS-DOS, if you used the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key in conjunction with the numeric keypad, the number you typed was still looked up in OEM character set, so that your muscle-memory code numbers still worked. You could still type <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>164</kbd> to get your ñ, even though the code number for ñ in Code Page 1252 is 241, not 164.</p>
<p>If you wanted to type a character that had no OEM equivalent, you could prefix a numeric keypad <kbd>0</kbd> to indicate that you wanted the value looked up in the ANSI code page. Therefore, you could type <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>0169</kbd> to get a ©, which did not exist in the OEM code page. You could also type <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>0241</kbd> to get your precious ñ, using the ANSI code point number rather than the OEM code point number.</p>
<p>If you entered a number larger than 255, both Windows and the IBM PC BIOS took your value mod 256, so typing <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>259</kbd> was the same as typing <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd>. Both gave you OEM code point 3, which for Code Page 437 is a heart ♥.</p>
<p>If you ask the Internet how to type some of these non-ASCII characters on Windows, you may see people (and large language models) that tell you to type, say, <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>9731</kbd> to get a Unicode snowman ☃. Unfortunately, from what we’ve learned above, this doesn’t work. You instead get the OEM character whose value is 9731 mod 256 = 3, or the aforementioned heart ♥.</p>
<p>A customer reported that a recent Windows update broke their ability to type a snowman by using <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>9731</kbd>. We explained that the update was not at fault; rather, <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>9731</kbd> was never supposed to produce a snowman at all! But the customer insisted that it used to work.</p>
<p>A closer investigation of the issue revealed the reason.</p>
<p>You see, while it’s true that the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>…</kbd> decimal value is taken mod 256, that is just the default behavior of the Windows input system. But some controls (most notably the RichEdit control) override the default handling of the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>…</kbd> sequence and parse out the decimal value <i>mod 65536</i> rather than <i>mod 256</i>.</p>
<p>This means that whether the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>…</kbd> value is taken mod 256 depends on what kind of control you are typing into.</p>
<p>By default, the value is taken mod 256, and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>9731</kbd> gives you a heart.</p>
<p>But if you happen to be using a RichEdit control, then the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>…</kbd> value is taken mod 65536, and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>9731</kbd> gives you a snowman.</p>
<p>(I don’t know of anybody who takes the value mod 2097151, to support direct entry of code points outside the Basic Multilingual Plane.)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One memorable encounter occurred while Ligocki was visiting Germany the summer after his sophomore year, when he took a side trip to Berlin to meet up with Marxen. “We got through the language barrier through the medium of busy beavers,” he said. The medium of beer also helped. Ligocki ended up having too many and missed his train back to Hamburg.</p>
<p>The busy beaver bug stuck with Ligocki throughout college, but when he graduated and found a job, life got in the way. He returned to the hunt from time to time, but never for long. In early 2022, he set up an <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/busy-beaver-discuss">online discussion group</a> to help researchers stay in touch. Then in May, Stérin discovered the mailing list and sent an invitation to join the Busy Beaver Challenge. Ligocki needed no convincing.</p>

<p>One of his first contributions to the project was reviving a technique invented by Marxen, which they’d discussed in that Berlin pub 16 years earlier. Called the “closed tape language method,” it was a new way to identify patterns on a Turing machine’s tape that indicate it will never halt. This is the basic strategy behind programs that identify loopers and many other species of non-halting machines, but the closed tape language method had the potential to identify a much broader class of patterns using a unified mathematical framework.</p>
<p>Ligocki wrote a <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2022/06/10/ctl.html">blog post</a> introducing his new collaborators to the technique, but even though the theoretical idea was very general, he didn’t know how to write a program that would cover all the cases. Blanchard figured out how to do that shortly after joining the project in the fall, but his program was relatively slow. Then two other contributors found ways to make it run much faster. Within the span of a few months, the closed tape language technique had gone from a promising idea to one of their <a href="https://discuss.bbchallenge.org/t/decider-finite-automata-reduction/123">most powerful tools</a>. It could even handle 10 of Georgiev’s 43 holdouts, nicknamed <a href="https://bbchallenge.org/skelet">Skelet machines</a> in his honor.</p>
<p>“This thing would never have existed with any one person contributing,” Ligocki said.</p>
<h2><strong>A Monster Approaches</strong></h2>
<p>As the months passed, new contributors discovered the Busy Beaver Challenge and began chipping away at different parts of the problem. But many machines remained unsolved, and two developed especially fearsome reputations.</p>
<p>The first was <a href="https://bbchallenge.org/1LC1LE_---1LD_1RD0LD_1LA1RE_0LB0RC">Skelet #1</a>, which kept alternating between phases of predictable and chaotic behavior. Then in March 2023, Ligocki and Pavel Kropitz — a Slovakian contributor who doesn’t speak English and communicates with the rest of the team using Google Translate — developed a series of ideas that finally <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2023/03/13/skelet-1-infinite.html">cracked it open</a>. Using a souped-up version of Marxen and Buntrock’s 30-year-old accelerated simulation technique, they discovered that the tug-of-war between order and chaos did end, but only after more than a trillion trillion steps. Then it finally settled into a repeating cycle that was itself unusually long. Practically all infinite loops begin repeating within 1,000 steps; Skelet #1’s was more than 8 billion steps long.</p>
<p>“Who ordered that?” Blanchard said. “Where did that come from? Why is it here?”</p>

<p>The machine’s behavior was so strange, and the proof combined so many different ideas, that for nearly five months Ligocki wasn’t sure of the result. That period of uncertainty was dispelled by a new contributor — a 21-year-old self-taught programmer named <a href="https://github.com/meithecatte">Maja Kądziołka</a>, who mostly goes by the single name mei.</p>
<p>Kądziołka grew up in Poland and attended the University of Warsaw for one semester in fall 2021 before dropping out — the rigidity of the curriculum and the move to remote instruction after a surge of Covid-19 cases didn’t fit well with their learning style. They worked at a software company for a little over a year but increasingly found the work draining, and began looking for something more intellectually stimulating. They found it in Coq, the software designed to encode and certify the validity of mathematical proofs.</p>

<p>The Busy Beaver Challenge contributors were already using computer programs in their proofs, but like paper-and-pencil proofs, computer programs are vulnerable to errors. In Coq proofs, the code won’t run unless every line logically follows from the preceding ones, making errors effectively impossible. To Kądziołka, figuring out how to craft these proofs began to feel like a game. “It’s almost addictive,” they said. “I started at a normal hour, and then it was night. Then it was morning.”</p>
<p>After learning Coq, Kądziołka began looking for an open problem to test it out. That’s when they found the Busy Beaver Challenge. A few weeks later, they’d <a href="https://github.com/meithecatte/busycoq">translated</a> several of the team’s proofs into Coq, including Ligocki and Kropitz’s proof that Skelet #1 never halts — Ligocki could finally be sure about it. Suddenly, an even higher standard of rigor than Stérin’s emphasis on reproducibility seemed possible. And it had all started with someone who had no formal training at all — an amateur mathematician.</p>
<p>“Let’s remember that means a lover of mathematics,” Moore said. “It is not a pejorative term.”</p>
<h2><strong>The Dam Breaks</strong></h2>
<p>Around the same time, a graduate student named <a href="http://chrisxudoesmath.com/">Chris Xu</a> made a breakthrough on the second monstrous machine — <a href="https://bbchallenge.org/1LB---_0RC1LE_0RD1RC_1LA1RB_0LB0LA">Skelet #17</a>. It was usually easy to summarize the behavior of even the most fiendish five-rule Turing machines once you figured out how they worked. “Then you encounter some bullshit like Skelet 17, and you go, ‘Nah, the universe is trolling us,’” Kądziołka said. Understanding Skelet #17 by studying the patterns on its tape was like deciphering a secret message wrapped in four layers of encryption: Cracking one code just revealed another totally unrelated code, and two more below that. Xu had to decipher all of them before he could finally prove that the machine never halted.</p>
<p><a href="http://chrisxudoesmath.com/papers/skelet17.pdf">Xu’s proof</a> was brilliant, but it involved some mathematical intuition that nobody knew how to formalize in the precise terms demanded by Coq. What’s more, the Busy Beaver Challenge’s work wasn’t done: While Skelet #1 and #17 were the two machines that had seemed most formidable, some others remained to be solved, and still more had only been solved using inefficient programs. That was no way to convince the world.</p>

<p>“We wanted to make sure that it was something reasonably reproducible,” Blanchard said, “and also not write a proof where we would say, ‘Step 63: Let this program run for six months.’”</p>
<p>Over the following months, the community slowly cobbled together proofs for the remaining machines, but most had yet to be translated into Coq. Then in April a <a href="https://discuss.bbchallenge.org/t/proving-bb-5-in-coq/225">mysterious new contributor</a> known only by the pseudonym mxdys came in to finish the job. Nobody on the team knows where mxdys is located or any other personal details about them. In a Discord direct message exchange, they mentioned a long-standing interest in mathematical games, but they declined to provide more information about their background.</p>
<p>On May 10, mxdys posted a characteristically succinct message to the Discord server: “The Coq proof of BB(5) is finished.” Stérin replied a minute later with a series of seven exclamation points. In a matter of weeks, mxdys had refined the community’s techniques and synthesized their results into a single <a href="https://github.com/ccz181078/Coq-BB5">40,000-line Coq proof</a>.</p>
<p>“This is not a thing that’s easy to formalize,” said <a href="https://yforster.de/">Yannick Forster</a>, a Coq expert at the French national research institute Inria who reviewed the proof. “I’m still positively shocked.”</p>
<p>The machine that Marxen and Buntrock had discovered over 30 years earlier, which halted after 47 million steps, really was the fifth busy beaver.</p>
<p>“These news are very exciting for me,” Georgiev wrote in an email. “I never expected that this problem would be solved in my time.”</p>
<p>But for another Busy Beaver pioneer, the news came too late. Allen Brady <a href="https://www.rgj.com/obituaries/pnvs0805561">died on April 21</a>, less than a month before the proof was finished. He was 90 years old.</p>
<h2><strong>Where Beavers Roam</strong></h2>
<p>The Busy Beaver Challenge contributors have begun to draft a formal academic paper describing their results, supplementing mxdys’ Coq proof with a human-readable one. That’ll take a while: Most machines were proved non-halting in multiple ways, and the team will need to decide how best to combine the results into a single proof.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, part of the team has moved on to the next beaver. But just four days ago, mxdys and another contributor known as Racheline discovered a barrier for BB(6) that seems insurmountable: a six-rule machine whose halting problem resembles a famously intractable math problem called the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-attempt-to-corner-the-collatz-conjecture-20200826/">Collatz conjecture</a>. Connections between Turing machines and the Collatz conjecture date back to a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01409968">1993 paper</a> by the mathematician <a href="https://bbchallenge.org/~pascal.michel/index.html">Pascal Michel</a>, but the newly discovered machine, dubbed “<a href="https://bbchallenge.org/1RB1RA_0LC1LE_1LD1LC_1LA0LB_1LF1RE_---0RA&amp;status=undecided">Antihydra</a>,” is the smallest one that appears unsolvable without a conceptual breakthrough in mathematics. That adds an extra layer of significance to the BB(5) result.</p>
<p>“It’s conceivable that this is the last busy beaver number that we will ever know,” Aaronson said.</p>
<p>There are many variants of the original busy beaver problem, and some Busy Beaver Challenge contributors plan to keep working on these. But not everyone intends to continue this work. They each came to the project on their own, for their own reasons, and their journeys are beginning to diverge.</p>
<p>Stérin wants to develop software tools to facilitate collaborative online projects in other areas of mathematics. “The thing that BB challenge brought me is the deep, deep, deep conviction that it’s an extremely effective way of performing research,” he said. “It deserves to have a bigger stage.”</p>

<p>Kądziołka too is pulling back, after developing a fascination with the European international rail network. “I will probably come back to busy beaver things again at some point, but currently it’s not the thing on my mind,” they said. “I’m currently pursuing becoming a train driver.”</p>
<p>Ligocki thinks he’ll keep up his busy beaver hunting, but after 20 years of switching between bursts of intense activity and not thinking about beavers at all, he’s learned not to put too much stock in his predictions.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of like the halting problem,” he said. “You just never can quite tell what’s going to happen.”</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>What happened to the old version of Pretzel AI - the visual, in-browser data manipulation tool?</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> It's available in the <a href="https://github.com/pretzelai/pretzelai/tree/main/pretzelai_visual"><code>pretzelai_visual</code> folder here</a>. Please see <a href="https://github.com/pretzelai/pretzelai/pull/76" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/pretzelai/pretzelai/pull/76/hovercard">this PR</a> for more info.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>What AI model does Pretzel use?</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> Pretzel uses different AI models for various tasks:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Default model: GPT-4o</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Offers a good balance between speed and quality</li>
<li>Can be changed in Pretzel Settings if you're using your own API key</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Inline completions: <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/codestral/" rel="nofollow">Mistral's Codestral model</a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Excellent for code completion</li>
<li>Very fast performance (22B parameter model)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Fallback option:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If you're using your own API key without providing a Mistral API Key, Pretzel will use GPT-4o for inline completions as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">We're continuing to experiment with models and supporting local models and Anthropic's Claude is at the top of our list.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>What about feature X?</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> There's a ton we want to build. Please <a href="https://github.com/pretzelai/pretzelai/issues">open an issue</a> and tell us what you want us to build!</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>Where's the roadmap?</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> We have a rough roadmap at the top of this README. There are many features we'd like to build, but there's just two of us. So, we're collecting feedback about what would be most helpful. Please open an issue or just email us with your feedback! Based on what we find, we'll prioritize our roadmap.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>Why are you using the AGPL license? Or, why not use MIT/BSD3 licenses?</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> Our goal with building Pretzel is to make an amazing data tool that is free for both individuals and companies to use. That said, we are a two-person startup - and we don't want some third party to just take our code and sell a hosted version of it without giving back to the community. Jupyter code is licensed as BSD-3 and if we keep our new code BSD-3 licensed, there would be no way to stop a third party from doing this. As a result, we went with the AGPLv3 license for all the new code. This ensures that if someone else does want to take our code and sell it (SaaS or otherwise), they have to open-source all of their modifications under AGPLv3 as well.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>Why a fork of Jupyter? Why not contribute into Jupyter directly?</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> This deserves a longer answer but here's the short answer: We've set out to make the <strong>new</strong> de-facto, modern, open-source data tool. Initially, we wanted to start from scratch. However, after talking to several data professionals, we realized it will be very hard to get people to switch to a new tool, no matter how good. The best way to get people to switch is to not have them switch at all. That's why we decided to fork Jupyter - for the near zero switching costs. Also, Jupyter is a mature product, and we're shipping feature really fast - frankly, at the pace we're shipping features, the code we write won't be accepted into the Jupyter codebase 😅. There are also many downsides to this decision - we've had to spend considerable time understanding the whole Jupyter ecosystem and multiple codebases, the complex release processes, the various APIs etc. However, we think this is the right decision for us.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>My company is worried about using an AGPLv3 licensed tool. What can I do?</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> The AGPL is a barrier ONLY IF you're modifying Pretzel AND redistributing it to the public. If you're simply using it as a tool in your company (even with modifications), the AGPL DOES NOT ask you to share your code. Still, if AGPL is an issue for you, please contact us, and we can figure out something that works.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q.</strong> <em>How are you planning on making money? OR, how are you free? I'm worried that you'll make this tool paid in the future.</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A.</strong> We're planning on selling a hosted version of the tool to companies to make money. This hosted version will probably have some company specific features that individuals don't want or need such as data access controls, connectors for data sources, integration with GitHub, hosted and shareable dashboard, scalable and on-demand compute for large data jobs etc. We will not retroactively make Pretzel's individual version paid.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5812560/ladybird-web-browser-becomes-a-non-profit-with-1-million-from-github-founder">https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5812560/ladybird-web-browser-becomes-a-non-profit-with-1-million-from-github-founder</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40856791">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The original founder of GitHub (Chris Wanstrath) has partnered up with the founder of SerenityOS and the Ladybird web browser (Andreas Kling) to create "<a href="https://ladybird.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ladybird Browser Initiative</a>" -- a USA-based non-profit dedicated exclusively to building a brand new web browser.&nbsp; From scratch.</p><p>While many have claimed that developing a new web browser "from scratch" is an impossible goal, the founders of The Ladybird Browser Initiative believe they can do it.&nbsp; What's more, they are confident it can be done without taking <em>any</em> funding from corporate deals or advertising revenue.</p><p>Their goal?&nbsp; To have a fully functional "Alpha" version of the Ladybird browser ready sometime in 2026.</p><h3>Ladybird Funding</h3><p>Roughly one year ago, the Ladybird Browser received their first major sponsorship (<a href="https://awesomekling.substack.com/p/welcoming-shopify-as-a-ladybird-sponsor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$100,000 from Shopify</a>).&nbsp; Now, with the creation of a 501(c)(3) non-profit (accompanied by a $1 Million dollar pledge from the GitHub founder), Ladybird is preparing to become the only major web browser which does not treat the user like the product being sold.</p><blockquote><p>"Today, every major browser engine is open source, which is wonderful, but there's still one issue: <strong>they're all funded by Google's advertising empire</strong>. Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, and Opera all use Google's Chromium. Apple receives billions to make Google the default search engine in Safari, and Firefox has a similar deal where they receive hundreds of millions each year.</p><p>The world needs a browser that puts people first, contributes to open standards using a brand new engine, and is <strong>free from advertising's influence</strong>."</p></blockquote><p>The fact that every major web browser engine is funded by advertising (specifically, via Google) is, indeed, a concern -- which makes the idea of a web browser free from that influence incredibly interesting.</p><p>But how, exactly, is Ladybird going to pull this off?</p><blockquote><p>"Unlike traditional business models that rely on monetizing the user, <strong>Ladybird is funded entirely by sponsorships and donations</strong> from companies and individuals who care about the open web. <strong>Our non-profit will not pursue corporate deals or revenue outside of unrestricted donations</strong>. The software and its source code will be available for free, forever."</p></blockquote><p>While it's easy to dismiss the notion of "funding a web browser via donations" as an unachievable, whimsical goal... Ladybird has already had some significant success in that area (not least of which, the $1 Million dollars from the GitHub founder), resulting in Ladybird already having 4 paid, full time developers (with 3 more programmers "starting soon").</p><p>So, maybe this approach is not as "unachievable" and "whimsical" as it first seems.</p><h3>No Corporate Control</h3><p>Also fascinating is this statement:</p><blockquote><p>"Our non-profit will not pursue corporate deals or revenue outside of unrestricted donations."</p></blockquote><p>What does that mean, in practice?</p><p>It means Ladybird won't be doing corporate deals for default search engines.&nbsp; Or marketing campaigns for other companies.&nbsp; This means that, if they can stick to their guns, Ladybird stands a real chance of a truly independent web browser... one which no company can control.</p><p>In fact the Ladybird Browser Initiative even has a policy specifically not allowing corporate donors to buy board seats:</p><blockquote><p>"All sponsorships are in the form of unrestricted donations. <strong>Board seats and other forms of influence are not for sale</strong>."</p></blockquote><p>This is a huge deal.&nbsp; Massive.</p><p>A problem many non-profit foundations face is corruption of their core mission via corporate control of their boards.&nbsp; There are many examples throughout the Open Source world of exactly this sort of problem (<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5116049/70-of-companies-on-the-linux-foundation-board-are-gpl-violators" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looking at you, Linux Foundation</a>), and to see Ladybird recognize this problem -- and take action to prevent it -- right from the start?</p><p>Color me impressed.</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2024-06-30/102127/102127_n7xyyap4c92jiob_custom.jpeg" alt=""></p><h3>The Current Status</h3><p>The first public "Alpha" release of Ladybird may be a ways out (slated for 2026), but the current development versions are already quite far along.</p><blockquote><p>"<strong>We can already do some of our daily browsing with Ladybird</strong>, like managing GitHub issues and pull requests, and commenting on Hacker News. The browser is improving every day, as our community of contributors are actively fixing bugs and adding features."</p></blockquote><p>Testing of a recent build of Ladybird confirmed that statement.&nbsp; Many websites function perfectly -- including some quite complex sites.&nbsp; While many other websites were... less than functional.&nbsp; Lots of work has clearly been done, with lots more left to do.</p><p>Can the development team improve Ladybird to a point where it will be usable, as a primary web browser, some time in next few years?&nbsp; Considering the progress to date... it seems entirely possible.</p><h3>"We won't be chasing buzzwords"</h3><p>The Lunduke Journal reached out to <a href="https://ladybird.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ladybird Browser Initiative's</a> co-Founder, Andreas Kling, with a burning question...</p><p>Now that the Ladybird web browser has an official nonprofit, with multiple full time developers working on it, you are clearly moving towards direct competition with the likes of Google and Mozilla. &nbsp;The eye of Sauron is upon you. &nbsp;How does that feel?</p><p>Kling's response:</p><blockquote><p>"Feels great! The web is one of humanity's greatest inventions, and it deserves diverse, competing implementations to truly thrive. The industry has been heading in a troubling direction for years, with companies like Microsoft and Opera abandoning their own browser engines in favor of Chromium.</p><p>We obviously don't have the resources of companies like Google, Apple, and Mozilla, so <strong>things will take some time</strong>. However, I'm extremely optimistic about the road ahead. We have a fantastic community of developers working on Ladybird, and we're making solid, consistent progress.</p><p>One thing we have going for us is focus. <strong>Unlike the major players, we're *completely* focused on one thing only: the web browser</strong>.</p><p><strong>We won't be chasing buzzwords or looking for alternative revenue streams</strong>. Our goal is to build a good browser and give it away for free, while soliciting nothing but unrestricted donations from anyone who likes what we're doing."</p></blockquote><p>There's a lot here to be excited about.</p><ul><li>No chasing buzzwords.</li><li>No alternative revenue streams.</li><li>Total focus on the web browser.</li><li>A brand new, from scratch browser engine.</li><li>No advertising or Big Tech influence.</li><li>A rag-tag team of rebels going, toe to toe, with the Big Tech web browser makers.</li></ul><p>While, according to the Ladybird team, they are a ways off from a major public release... it's hard not to feel a bit optimistic about what this could mean for the future of web browsing.&nbsp; This may be early days still, but the possibilities are tantalizing.</p><p>The Lunduke Journal is rooting for you, Ladybird.</p><div>

The best hypotheses I could find were:</p><ul><li><p>It’s the farthest region from Spain, so the least communicated to the rest of the empire, and hence the one that drifted the most from the homeland.</p></li><li><p>It’s extremely isolated by the Andes, the ocean in the west, the ice in the south, and the desert in the north, making its connection even to Argentina, Bolivia or Peru really hard.</p></li><li><p>It didn’t have silver mines, or a climate for sugar or tobacco farming, so it wasn’t a particularly valuable place to exploit, and remained secondary in the empire, getting fewer visitors from other parts of the empire, and drifting further apart.</p></li><li><p>It has strong influences from other regions, such as German, Italian, or even Basque.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>But why is no other country as long?</p><p>You need:</p><ul><li><p>A sandwich between sea and continent</p></li><li><p>Oriented north-south, so that it changes climates quickly&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Far enough from the equator so that the north-south climate does change fast, and so that it’s not too densely populated.</p></li></ul><p>The sandwich requires an oceanic plate subducting under a continental

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://cprimozic.net/blog/trying-out-kans/">https://cprimozic.net/blog/trying-out-kans/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40855028">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's been a fair bit of buzz about Kolmogorov-Arnold networks online lately.  Some research papers were posted around claiming that they offer better accuracy or faster training compared to traditional neural networks/MLPs for the same parameter count.</p>
<p>I was compelled by these claims and decided to test them out myself.  Here are my main findings if you're not interested in reading through the details:</p>
<p>
KANs definitely don't feel like a silver bullet, and they require significant tuning to get good results compared to regular neural networks.
</p>
<p>That being said, KANs can usually come close to or match the performance of regular neural networks at the same parameter count.  However, they are much more complicated to implement than neural networks and require a lot of tricks and hacky-feeling techniques to make them work.</p>
<p>I do believe that there are specialized use cases where they could be objectively better than NNs and be worth pursuing, but in my opinion the brutal simplicity of NNs make them a much stronger default choice.</p>
<h2 id="kan-background"><a href="#kan-background" aria-label="kan background permalink"></a>KAN Background</h2>
<p>
At the highest level, KANs learn activation functions while neural networks learn the weights connecting neurons with static activation functions together.
</p>
<p>Here's a diagram representing a minimal KAN:</p>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://i.ameo.link/ca7.svg" alt="A diagram representing the architecture of a minimal KAN with two layers.  It shows two inputs labeled IN0 and IN1 which are each connected to two nodes in the first layer.  Each node in the first layer is labeled &quot;B-Spline&quot; and contains a different curve representing its learned activation function.  In turn, of the two pairs of two nodes in the first layer are attached to nodes labeled &quot;+&quot;.  This same pattern repeats for the second layer with the &quot;+&quot; nodes taking the place of the &quot;IN&quot; nodes.  Then, all of the b-spline nodes in the second layer are connected to a single &quot;+&quot; node which is in turn connected to an output node labeled &quot;OUT0&quot;.">
  </p>
</div>
<p>And here's a neural network/multi-layer perceptron with the same number of layers and nodes:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ameo.link/ca9.svg" alt="A diagram representing a neural network/multi-layer perceptron.  It shows two inputs, two densely connected hidden layers with 4 neurons each, and a single output node.">
</p>
<p>One big difference to note is that there are far fewer connections between nodes in KANs compared to neural networks/MLPs.  KANs move the majority of the learnable parameters into the nodes/activation functions themselves.</p>
<h3 id="b-splines"><a href="#b-splines" aria-label="b splines permalink"></a>B-Splines</h3>
<p>The usual choice of learnable activation function used by KANs is the <strong>B-Spline</strong>.</p>
<p>B-splines are fancy little mathematical gizmos which are composed of multiple piecewise n-degree polynomials strung together in such a way that they're continuous at every point.  Here's an example:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ameo.link/caa.png" alt="A plot of a B-spline with 2 knots and order-2 polynomials.  It shows a blue curve that performs 4 zero-crossings and has 3 distinct peaks."></p>
<p>There's a lot of things you can customize with B-splines.  You can pick the degree of polynomial used to represent the different grid segments, you can pick the number of knots which determines how many polynomials are strung together, and you can specify the domain/range of the spline however you want.</p>
<p>Another nice thing about B-splines is that they are entirely differentiable.  That means that the autograd implementations in machine learning frameworks like Torch, Jax, and Tinygrad can optimize the coefficients used to define the splines directly.  This is how the "learning" in machine learning happens, so definitely something that's needed for an activation function to be usable in a KAN.</p>
<h2 id="kans-in-practice"><a href="#kans-in-practice" aria-label="kans in practice permalink"></a>KANs in Practice</h2>
<p>After reading up enough on KANs to feel like I understood what was going on, I decided to try implementing them myself from scratch and try them out on some toy problems.  I decided to build it in <a href="https://tinygrad.org/">Tinygrad</a>, a minimal ML framework I've had success working with in the past.  What I ended up with is <a href="https://github.com/Ameobea/kan/blob/main/tiny_kan.py">here</a>.</p>
<p>The basic KAN architecture wasn't too complicated, and the only really tricky part was the B-spline implementation.  For that, I just ported the implementation that the authors of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756">original KAN research paper</a> created for their <a href="https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan">PyKAN library</a>.</p>
<h3 id="simple-1d-test-function"><a href="#simple-1d-test-function" aria-label="simple 1d test function permalink"></a>Simple 1D Test Function</h3>
<p>After a bit of effort and some debugging, I had a working KAN implementation.  To test it out, I set up a small KAN with 2 layers of trained it to fit some relatively simple 1D functions and it did a pretty good job:</p>

<p>To understand what kind of splines it was learning to accomplish this, I plotted the output of each spline in the network across the full input range of the model:</p>

<p>Pretty solid results!  The first layer's outputs are pretty simple and represent a single spline each.  Then the second layer creates more complicated representations that are stitched together from the outputs of the previous layer, and the final layer has a single spline which combines it all together and returns the model's output.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-up"><a href="#scaling-up" aria-label="scaling up permalink"></a>Scaling Up</h3>
<p>Inspired by this early success, I decided to try turning up the complexity.  I set up a training pipeline to parameterize images - learning a function like <code>(normalizedXCoord, normalizedYCoord) -&gt; pixelLuminance</code>.</p>
<p>I used a version of positional encoding to expand the coordinates from single scalars into small vectors to make it easier for the networks to learn high-frequency features.</p>
<p>
When I tried to train KANs to parameterize some small images, I ran into significant difficulty.
</p>
<p>The models would fail to converge or perform badly.  I tried changing a bunch of things like layer count, knot count and spline order on the splines, learning rate, you name it.  Some things helped, but it was largely a pretty poor showing.</p>
<p>At some point, I figured I'd take a look at PyKAN's source code to see if I was missing something in my implementation compared to what they were doing.  I'd had good luck with PyKAN when testing it out in a Python notebook when I was first investigating KANs.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there was a whole lot more going on there than I expected.</p>
<h2 id="pykans-tricks-and-extras"><a href="#pykans-tricks-and-extras" aria-label="pykans tricks and extras permalink"></a>PyKAN's Tricks and Extras</h2>
<p>PyKAN's source code is actually pretty small and easy enough to parse through.</p>
<p>
As I read some of the code around the core KAN implementation, I quickly noticed that PyKAN was using a lot of tricks to beef up their KAN implementation.
</p>
<p>Here are the ones I noticed:</p>
<h3 id="bias"><a href="#bias" aria-label="bias permalink"></a>Bias</h3>
<p>PyKAn includes a learnable bias vector which is added to the output of each layer before passing it to the next.  This is the same thing that traditional neural networks have.</p>
<p>They include this note in the docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>biases are added on nodes (in principle, biases can be absorbed into activation functions. However, we still have them for better optimization)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I added them to my own KAN implementation and sure enough, I did see an improvement in learning ability.</p>
<h3 id="spline-weights"><a href="#spline-weights" aria-label="spline weights permalink"></a>Spline Weights</h3>
<p>I also noticed that PyKAN was using a learnable weight vector of size <code>(in_count * out_count,)</code> and multiplying the output of the splines by this before summing.</p>
<p>This is a pretty big vector, and it scales multiplicatively with the layer width.  It's actually as big as the entire weight vector for a dense layer of a traditional neural network.</p>
<p>That being said, it seems to be worth it.  When I added it to my KAN implementation and trimmed down the layer sizes to keep the param count the same, the training performance was about the same or slightly better.</p>
<h3 id="base-functions"><a href="#base-functions" aria-label="base functions permalink"></a>Base Functions</h3>
<p>In addition to the B-Splines, the PyKAN implementation also included something they call "base functions", also referred to as "residual functions".</p>
<p>Not to be confused with the basis functions which are used internally in the B-Spline implementation, these add a different path for data to get through the layer that bypasses the splines entirely.  The function used defaults to <code>torch.nn.SiLU()</code> which is a close relative of the ReLU activation function.</p>
<p>So the input vector of the layer gets passed through this base function element-wise, multiplied by yet another set of learnable weights of shape <code>(in_count * out_count)</code>, and then added to the outputs of the splines.</p>
<p>So there's really a lot going on now, and we're quite far away from the simple architecture from the diagram I included earlier.  The KAN layer is something like this now:</p>
<div data-language="py"><pre><code>y <span>=</span> <span>(</span>splines<span>(</span>x<span>)</span> <span>*</span> spline_weights <span>+</span> base_fn<span>(</span>x<span>)</span> <span>*</span> base_weights<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span>axis<span>=</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> bias</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="grid-updates--extensions"><a href="#grid-updates--extensions" aria-label="grid updates  extensions permalink"></a>Grid Updates + Extensions</h3>
<p>There's also a lot of code included for things they call grid extensions and grid updates.  I believe that these are for dynamically adjusting the domain of individual splines and/or the number of knots in a spline live during training.</p>
<p>There was an example on the PyKAN Github showing how they'd refine the splines to add more and more knots and provide higher and higher resolution.  They'd pick new coefficients to approximate the old spline as closely as possible so it could be done during training.</p>
<p>I didn't mess with any of these and definitely didn't attempt porting them over to my Tinygrad implementation.</p>
<h3 id="lbfgs-optimizer"><a href="#lbfgs-optimizer" aria-label="lbfgs optimizer permalink"></a>LBFGS Optimizer</h3>
<p>Finally, I noticed that they were using an optimizer called LBFGS to tune their parameters instead of the SGD or Adam that are usually seen when training neural networks.</p>
<p>I looked into it a little bit and found a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited-memory_BFGS">Wikipedia page</a>.  Here's the first sentence from that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS or LM-BFGS) is an optimization algorithm in the family of quasi-Newton methods that approximates the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm (BFGS)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't attempt to dig into that further, but I figure that they got better results with that compared to more commonly used optimizers.</p>
<h2 id="results"><a href="#results" aria-label="results permalink"></a>Results</h2>
<p>I integrated a few of these techniques - specifically the base function + base weights, spline weights, and bias vector - into my Tinygrad KAN implementation.  Since these add a huge amount of parameters to the model, I had to significantly reduce the layer sizes and counts that I was testing with in order to keep the same param count.</p>
<p>Despite that, they did seem to help - some more than others - but they also slowed training down a ton.</p>
<h2 id="b-spline-alternatives"><a href="#b-spline-alternatives" aria-label="b spline alternatives permalink"></a>B-Spline Alternatives</h2>
<p>I come from a software development background, and seeing all of these "extras" and special techniques mixed into the KAN implementation felt like a sort of code smell to me.</p>
<p>I wanted to see if I could implement a much more minimal version of a KAN which retained its cool property of having a learnable activation function in a simpler way.</p>
<p>I experimented with some different options for a while and eventually landed on an activation function like this:</p>
<div data-language="py"><pre><code>y <span>=</span> tanh<span>(</span>a <span>*</span> x<span>.</span><span>pow</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> b <span>*</span> x<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Where both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are learnable.</p>
<p>I got pretty decent results, coming relatively close to the Spline-based KANs on the image parameterization use case and training like 10x faster as well.  I mixed in the learnable bias and played around with some other variations, but the improvements were small or negative.</p>
<p>Eventually, it got to the point where I was just dancing around the same final loss value +-20% or so and I stopped my search.</p>
<p>
The main theme seems to be that the Adam optimizer is quite good at doing its job regardless of the computational graph it has to work with, and the most significant factor controlling performance is just parameter count.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I spent a few more days trying different variations on this theme: mixing KAN layers and NN layers, tweaking model width vs. depth, tuning various other hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size.  Despite my efforts, the results were the same:</p>
<p>
No matter what I did, the most simple neural network was still outperforming the fanciest KAN-based model I tried.
</p>
<p>I was able to train a model to a loss of 0.0006 after 20k epochs with a neural network using boring <code>tanh</code> activations, and the best I could do with the most successful training run with a KAN was about 0.00011.</p>
<p>I'll admit that there's a decent chance I missed something in my KAN implementation, failed to find the architecture of hyperparameters that would work best for me, or picked an unlucky thing to test with that just doesn't work well for KANs.</p>
<p>But the fact that neural networks worked so well with so little effort was pretty compelling and made me uninterested in spending more time trying to get KANs to outperform them for now.  In any case, it wasn't anything close to the "50% less params for the same performance" that I'd heard claims of.</p>
<p>One final note is that I really don't want this to come off as me trashing on KANs and saying that they're useless.  Some of the demos on the PyKAN Github and docs revolve around more niche or use cases like learning functions to "machine precision" with 64-bit floats - which they do successfully. Neural networks can't do easily if at all.</p>
<p>I think work investigating alternatives or improvements to neural networks is very worthwhile, and might be the kind of thing that gives us the next transformer-level leap in AI capability.</p></div></div>]]></description>
