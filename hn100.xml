<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>I owe Mozilla a thank-you. Really, I do. Maybe an Edible Arrangement? People like those. Some lil pineapples cut into stars on sticks and chocolate strawberries might brighten their day. For the note, I'm thinking something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for proving me exactly right.</p>
<p>XOXO
MT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eight months ago, in the fallout of Mozilla's fumbling of a Privacy Policy update, I <a href="https://taggart-tech.com/mozilla-cycle-pt2/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mozilla is pursuing its primary objective, which is the survival of Mozilla. Its mission statement is more than broad enough to accommodate that, and Firefox is not a real priority. The community should accept that and stop waiting for Mozilla to be the hero they deserve.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regrettably, I was unable to take my own advice on the last part. So here we are yet again, marveling at Mozilla's dedication toward eroding decades of good will in the community they purportedly serve. To quote one of my <a href="https://achewood.com/2006/06/21/title.html">sacred texts</a>, it's a focus and intensity normally seen only in successes.</p>
<p>Back in the present, we have Mozilla <del>doubling</del> <del>tripling</del> <em>n</em>thing down on this direction. First, with their <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/ai-window/">announcement</a> of "AI Window," a new feature (used very loosely) coming to Firefox which seems to emulate the user experience offered by AI browsers like Perplexity's Comet or OpenAI's Atlas. In other words, instead of performing search from the address bar and interacting with websites like browsers have done since they were invented, your first interaction will be with a language model prompt, which then mediates your experience of the web.</p>
<p>Not to gloat, but <a href="https://taggart-tech.com/interfaces/">I told you so</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/building-ai-the-firefox-way-shaping-what-s-next-together/td-p/109922/">response</a> from the Firefox community has not just been overwhelmingly negative, it is <em>universally</em> negative as far as I can tell. At least among users willing to post on Mozilla's forums about the issue, which is absolutely a biased sample set. I have received some comments separately in support of Firefox, but they are countable and the vast, vast minority. Mozilla's core audience hates this move. At the very least, they would want all the AI components of Firefox to be opt-in, a choice that Firefox has been unwilling to make so far, instead enabling these new features by default.</p>
<p>What does Mozilla do? Temper the plan? Ease up on the forced features?</p>
<p>Nah, they do what any good corporate PR person would tell you to do when facing public backlash: <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/rewiring-mozilla-ai-and-web/">post through it</a>.</p>
<p>This post is a summary of Mozilla's new Strategic Plan, which is viewable in full <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2025/11/Mozilla-Summary-Portfolio-Strategy.pdf">here</a>. I read it through a few times, and my brain nearly ripped in half from the cognitive dissonance involved. But I think it's worth examining Mozilla's claims carefully. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>AI (by which they mean generative AI) is a transformative technology that will fundamentally alter how we interact with machines and the web.</li>
<li>The current landscape is dangerous and controlled by big tech and "closed source" models.</li>
<li>Mozilla should therefore pivot to develop and support "open source" AI implementations the same way they advocated for open web standards.</li>
</ol>
<p>The strategy details the "what" and "how" of Mozilla's transformation in this direction. We're going to touch on some of those points, but let's begin with these big claims, affording Mozilla maximum benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>Is generative AI a transformative technology? The Corpos sure seem to want it to be, although its actual usage seems mostly to be chatbot-related. All other attempts to use this trick in other realms have failed rather miserably. Microsoft, for example, <a href="https://taggart-tech.com/mozilla-cycle-pt3/theverge.com/report/822443/microsoft-windows-copilot-vision-ai-assistant-pc-voice-controls-impressions">wants you to talk to your computer</a> instead of using a mouse and keyboard <em>like a dinosaur</em>. The results, unfortunately, are much worse than the Jurassic version of computer interaction. The pattern holds true across the board. Google's AI Overview continues to be an inferior provider of information than solid web search results. Also, as it turns out, people <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf316">learn less</a> from LLM output.</p>
<p>Even the AI browsers Mozilla wants to emulate have significant issues, vulnerable to <a href="https://layerxsecurity.com/blog/layerx-identifies-vulnerability-in-new-chatgpt-atlas-browser/">old web vulnerabilities</a> and <a href="https://guard.io/labs/scamlexity-we-put-agentic-ai-browsers-to-the-test-they-clicked-they-paid-they-failed">new attacks</a> against the models themselves.</p>
<p>Generative AI is transforming something, but I don't think it's the web, and I don't think it's for the better.</p>
<p>Which means their second claim is definitely true! The current landscape <em>is</em> dangerous, as I've been decrying for years.</p>
<p>But because Mozilla is convinced that generative AI is a force for good (with no evidence to back that claim up), they conclude that their mission must be to create "open source" alternatives to commercial ("big tech") offerings.</p>
<p>If you truly believe generative AI is a net good but with potential for significant harm, there are arguments to be made for ethical implementations. This same instinct is what propelled researchers from OpenAI to split and found <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/company">Anthropic</a>.</p>
<p>This, however, is an article of <a href="https://taggart-tech.com/faith">faith</a>. It cannot be argued rationally because no empirical evidence exists to support it. The entirety of the belief is predicated on future potential—and it always will be, right up until the harms are so inescapably clear that even the most ardent of believers suffer because of them. Even then, not all of the Flock will lose faith. And as we now see, Mozilla leadership are not just the Flock, but Disciples.</p>
<p>Mozilla has had a conversion experience, while its core audience has not. This results in a schism of purpose.</p>

<h2 id="the-actual-strategy">The Actual Strategy</h2>
<p>Digging into the plan itself, Mozilla's ambitions are remarkable. Mozilla has, as the plan notes, always measured itself against a "double bottom line" of mission and market success. However, it seems these two criteria are now separately defined by: "a. AI that advances the Manifesto; and b. diversifying revenue away from search."</p>
<p>Their specific goals include:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Mozilla orgs have a flagship AI product by 2028</li>
<li>10% year-over-year community growth</li>
<li>20% year-over-year growth in non-search revenue</li>
<li>3 Mozilla orgs have more than $25M in revenue (currently: 1)</li>
<li>10% year-over-year investment portfolio returns</li>
</ul>
<p>I am dumbfounded by these goals. I can't even be snarky about them. They seem so disconnected from reality that I can't imagine how a Board arrived at them.</p>
<p>Let's go through them one at a time.</p>
<h3 id="flagship-ai-products">"Flagship" AI Products</h3>
<p>What "orgs" are we talking about here? Historically there have been <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/organizations/">two Mozilla organizations</a>: the Mozilla Foundation, which is the not-for-profit to which you donate to preserve the open web); and the Mozilla Corporation, which develops Firefox, makes deals with search engines, and creates other revenue-generating projects like, uh, <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/future-of-pocket">Pocket</a>.</p>
<p>There now exist three other for-profit subsidiaries of the Foundation, although these are not mentioned in the official listings. The first is MZLA Technologies Corporation, which is responsible for <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2020/01/thunderbirds-new-home/">Thunderbird</a>. I can't tell what else they do, if anything.</p>
<p>Another is <a href="https://mozilla.ai/">Mozilla.ai</a>, which has a much clearer purpose. This company produces AI products and services. So of these organizations, 3 of them need to have flagship AI products by 2028. What could that <em>possibly</em> look like?</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://mozilla.vc/">Mozilla Ventures</a>, which is literally just a venture capital firm throwing money at AI projects that align with Mozilla's Manifesto.</p>
<p><img src="https://taggart-tech.com/mzla_revenue-streams.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Mozilla.ai has the easiest and clearest road, as their <a href="https://www.mozilla.ai/product/agent-platform">Agent Platform</a>is already in early access and is absolutely a commercial product. MZLA has...Thunderbird? So AI-powered Thunderbird? That's what I can figure, although Thunderbird is not exactly known as an AI platform. Their new paid Thunderbird Pro service <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2025/11/thunderbird-pro-november-2025-update/">currently makes no mention</a> of AI integration. That's a headscratcher. Mozilla VenturesAnd finally, we have the Corporation and Firefox.</p>
<p>Let's be as clear as we can possibly be. <strong>Mozilla is an AI company</strong>, and <strong>Firefox will be a flagship AI product</strong> according to this strategic plan. This is the focus for Mozilla, which means users of Firefox will only get more and more AI shoved down their throat, and likely fewer ways to avoid it.</p>

<p>I don't have access to Mozilla's "community" numbers, however they choose to define them. But if the reaction to recent changes is any indication, expecting growth of any kind isn't just optimistic, it's delusional. They are betraying the principles of their core use base in favor of their new god. That behavior is usually not rewarded by users or customers.</p>
<h3 id="financials">Financials</h3>
<p>While I don't have access to community numbers, the Mozilla Foundation must disclose its financials, so <a href="https://assets.mozilla.net/annualreport/2024/mozilla-fdn-2023-fs-final-short-1209.pdf">that I can review</a>—and you can too, if you're broken like me. I don't want to think about how much time I've spent reading Mozilla's 990s.</p>
<p>Looking at their revenue change from 2022 to 2023, we see a <em>drop</em> of 3% in royalties (search deals) and almost 15% in subscriptions and advertising. Let's also note that by these counts, royalties account for about 76% of Mozilla's annual revenue. That's by my own calculation on these disclosure, but Mozilla themselves cite 85% as share of revenue from search alone.</p>
<p><a href="https://assets.mozilla.net/annualreport/2022/mozilla-fdn-2022-fs-final-0908.pdf">2022's numbers</a> show a similar drop (down 3% from 2021) in royalties, but a 25% (!!) jump in subscriptions and ad revenue. My guess is ads, since I don't think the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/products/vpn/">VPN service</a> is raking it in, nor do I think a bunch of people suddenly signed up for Pocket before it died. This would certainly explain why last year, Mozilla <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/advertising/principles/improving-online-advertising/">went hard</a> on their "privacy-honoring" advertising acquisition.</p>
<p>Zooming back out: the current business model is not delivering growth. So the pivot to AI is a bet that investment is out there for alternative sources of AI technology. It's also, tacitly, a bet that the AI bubble will last long enough to get competing products off the ground and attract investment before it's too late.</p>
<p>I...wouldn't be so sure.</p>
<p>As far as their investment portfolio's performance, Mozilla <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2024/article/financing-an-open-internet-mozillas-path-forward/">has changed their strategy</a> significantly in the last 3 years, resulting in significant increases in dividend and realized gains in investments. What's the change in strategy?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the end of 2022, Mozilla changed our strategy for managing our financial reserves. In prior years we took a purely defensive approach, investing solely in highly liquid fixed-income securities. Our revised approach is focused on delivering a total return to Mozilla after inflation, while maintaining sufficient liquid reserves to weather economic pressures and seize growth opportunities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translation: we invested more in stocks and less in bonds, T-notes, and CDs. What specifically they've invested in is unclear, but you can probably guess it rhymes with Blavidia. I'm sure they have a diversified portfolio, but <em>if</em> you believe (as I do) that the market is heading for a massive correction, this goal is unattainable and a dangerous target for a strategic plan.</p>
<p>Lastly, on revenue. Mozilla plainly <em>has</em> to diversify away from search, because search is dying. Google itself is trying to kill it, in favor of AI. If this succeeds, Firefox's primary revenue stream is drying up, and they know it. More than anything else, this is the reason for the pivot. As I've said before, the will to survive takes precedence over principle when choosing a path forward for any organization, even a not-for-profit with a stated mission.</p>
<p>These goals are not so much reasonable expectations as existential mandates. Either Mozilla approaches these targets in 3 years, or they may be staring death in the face.</p>
<h2 id="flawed-hypotheses">Flawed Hypotheses</h2>
<p>This strategy hinges on three stated hypotheses from Mozilla:</p>
<ol>
<li>A generational shift in human computer interaction is widening the gap between Mozilla’s products and trustworthy, user-centered experiences.</li>
<li>A vibrant, successful and decentralized open source AI ecosystem is essential if we want independent tech players to thrive — and for innovation to come from everywhere.</li>
<li>The growing need for sovereign, public interest AI which will only be met by governments and public interest tech players pooling resources and banding together.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's...okay. We'll take it from the top.</p>
<p>Would you say generative AI is a "generational shift in human computer interaction?" The Corpos want it to be, but so far this hasn't taken place. Declaring it thus is the wish becoming the father of the thought. Maybe someday a functional language model will govern our interaction with computing machines, but that is nowhere near the case now, and the fundamental flaws in the technology preclude it from being so in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Would you say generative AI is "trustworthy" or "user-centered?" The people who implicitly trust generative AI are suffering from psychosis. It's a pathology. The model creators themselves tell you not to trust them! What are we doing here?</p>
<p>Y'know what is trustworthy? A goddamned URL bar that takes me to the website I want to go to. A search engine that shows me sources, ideally curated for quality.</p>
<p>Okay so hypothesis 1 doesn't pass the sniff test. On to number 2.</p>
<p>Can someone please explain to me what the hell "open source AI" is? Mozilla's helpful <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Strategy#Open_source_AI">Strategy Wiki</a> lists Mozilla's own products and investments under this category. Remember that for LLMs, you have two major "source" components: the dataset on which a model was trained, and the resulting vectors/weights file that comprises the model. Among them is <a href="https://huggingface.co/">HuggingFace</a>, which is probably best understood as GitHub for AI. HuggingFace hosts both models and datasets used in ML/AI applications. It's about as close to open source AI as I can imagine.</p>
<p>Some of those HuggingFace datasets are really useful. Like, for example, the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/tensonaut/EPSTEIN_FILES_20K">OCRed version of the Epstein Files</a>. That's rad as hell, and I'm glad there's a place to share those things. It's even a goldmine for researchers like me, since datasets containing <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/JailbreakBench/JBB-Behaviors">model jailbreaking prompts</a> are available.</p>
<p>But let's be clear about Mozilla's value proposition of the "transformative" generative AI. These are not small models we're talking about; these are large language models that were trained on massive corpora of text. Those corpora are the "source." We know that the training data for frontier models comes from copyrighted material and material scraped without consent. We also know that code generated from scraped sources may well violate the licenses of that source code in reproduction.</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>there can never be an open source large language model</strong> when the sources are themselves violate of content usage agreements. For all the talk about "ethical" AI, Mozilla fails to address this original sin of the technology.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I should say "nearly fails." In the "Threats" section of their <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swot.asp">SWOT analysis</a> of their own strategy, they identify "Open models disappear" as a threat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big tech / China stop releasing open models. No public open source frontier models emerge. Mozilla’s strategy is obsolete / outflanked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay so by "open source AI" you actually mean Qwen/Deepseek/Llama. Cool. Cool cool cool. These are open weight <em>only</em>, so the premise of open data goes out the window. And this threat gives away the fact that Mozilla can only succeed on the backs of frontier models. There is no real plan to "democratize" LLMs, nor can there be for the scale required.</p>
<p>This entire exercise is a farce. Yet again, Mozilla pursues a parasitical relationship with the corpos. It worked last time, right??</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3: the growing need for "sovereign" AI. We've already established that there is no large language model possible without corpo scale and investment, except perhaps with government support. So is that what Mozilla wants? State-sponsored LLMs? This hypothesis points in that direction, with Mozilla as the "public interest tech player" catching a percentage somewhere in the middle. Being a government intermediary is also probably not a safe position for anyone at this juncture, much less a tech company.</p>
<p>But also, what "need" are we talking about here? Why is there a need for any of this at all?</p>
<p>Again we encounter the fundamental schism of purpose between Mozilla trying to survive, and the mission its core audience believes in. You could imagine a Mozilla that decided, "Actually, the web was better without this dreck in it, and the experience of the web is not improved by moving users closer to it." You could imagine an organization that doubled down on true privacy, and a human-centered web. We'll never know what kind of funding streams such an organization could build, because Mozilla has chosen the machines over people. They have chosen quick revenue over long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>It's finally time you and I take the advice I offered before: let Mozilla die. It no longer serves its stated purpose.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Being a pop star has its pros and cons like most jobs in this world but before I state some of them I want to clarify that firstly I don’t view what I do as a ‘job’ and I secondly don’t really view myself as purely a pop star, I’m just using that terminology specifically for this piece of writing. I’ve always been delving into different creative zones adjacent to music. Building out an entire album roll out obviously constitutes immersing yourself in many different mediums but now more than ever I feel a pull away from music and into other realms. Unfortunately this probably means I’d describe myself more as a ‘creative’ (gross) or plain and simply put: an artist. However, for the purposes of this piece I’m focusing purely on the the realities of being a pop star because it was my original dream, because it’s the role in my life I have the most experience navigating and because it’s also the most ridiculous one.</p><p>One of the main realities of being a pop star is that at a certain level, it’s really fucking fun. You get to go to great parties in a black SUV and you can smoke cigarettes in the car and scream out of the sunroof and all that cliche shit. At these parties you sometimes get to meet interesting people and those interesting people often actually want to meet you. You get to wear fabulous clothes and shoes and jewelry that sometimes comes with its own security guard who trails you around the party making sure you don’t loose the extortionate earrings sitting on your lobes or let some random person you’ve just met in the bathroom try on the necklace around your neck that is equivalent to the heart of the ocean. You get good free shit like phones and laptops and vinyl and trips and shroom gummies and headphones and clothes and sometimes even an electric bike that will sit in your garage untouched for the best part of 5 years. You get to enter restaurants through the back entrance and give a half smile to the head chef (who probably hates you) and the waiters (who probably hate you too) as they sweat away doing an actual real service industry job while you strut through the kitchen with your 4 best friends who are tagging along for the ride. You get to feel special, but you also have to at points feel embarrassed by how stupid the whole thing is. You also get to hear a lot of incredible music that undoubtably is going to shift culture and public perception months before its released (the time Addison played me Diet Pepsi for the first time while driving around New York after dinner at Casino springs to mind). Sometimes you get to help out your other pop star friends by providing an opinion or lending an ear or a helping make a decision relating to their work which allows you to feel a part of a interconnected community of people you love and respect. You also get to have fans and their dedication to your work makes you feel like they will be there for you until the end of time, even though in reality they won’t. You get to stand on stage and feel like a God. You get to make people cry with happiness, you soundtrack their break ups, their recovery, their crazy nights out, their revenge, their love, their lives. You get to travel the world and see all kinds of different places and you never even have to worry about booking a single element of the travel yourself because you have an amazing tour manager to do that for you. You get to call in sick whenever you want and you never have to worry about bailing on work last minute because you know for certain that there’s another pop star out there who’s actually way more unreliable and flakey than you. Thank God.</p><p>You will also end up spending a lot of time inhabiting strange and soulless liminal spaces. Whether its the holding area of the event you’re about to enter, the airport lounge, the visa office, the claustrophobic tour bus, the greenroom with no windows, the underneath of a stage or the set build of a photoshoot or music video you’re on, you are often caught in the in-between. You’re in transit, you’re going somewhere but the journey itself takes up the majority of the experience. When Rachel Sennott came to shoot her scene in our upcoming film The Moment she was overnighted in a van straight from the front row of the Balenciaga show in Paris to the back doors of a warehouse in London’s Docklands. She was bundled up with blankets and pillows and shipped directly to us like a package. The journey took all night but she was only on set for around an hour.</p><p>Another thing about being a pop star is that you cannot avoid the fact that some people are simply determined to prove that you are stupid. I’ve always been completely fascinated by this and think it has something to do with self projection. Being a pop star has always been partially about being a fantasy and obviously the fantasy is decided mostly by the consumer. Marketing and strategy and packaging and presentation can do it’s best to guide a viewer to the desired outcome but at the end of the day the consumer gets to decide whether a pop star is a symbol of sex, or anarchy or intelligence or whatever else they wish to see. Sometimes people don’t like to be lumped in with general consensus, they like to go against the grain of public opinion and that’s when a totally opposite defiant stance is born. Instead of “she’s a sex symbol” it becomes “she’s a whore”. Instead of “she’s anarchic” it's “she’s a fucking drug addict”. Instead of “she’s intelligent” it’s “she’s pretentious and said a whole load of nothing” and so on and so on. I find that this is often where the stupidity narrative can be born. I’ve always wondered why someone else’s success triggers such rage and anger in certain people and I think it probably all boils down to the fact that the patriarchal society we unfortunately live in has successfully brainwashed us all. We are still trained to hate women, to hate ourselves and to be angry at women if they step out of the neat little box that public perception has put them in. I think subconsciously people still believe there is only room for women to be a certain type of way and once they claim to be one way they better not DARE grow or change or morph into something else. Also people obviously want the clicks and an opposite stance is more likely to get that. When I joined substack there were a flurry of think pieces and questions as to why. Some people theorized on the desire for long form content and a deeper connection with a fanbase, some people were just purely excited, some people suggested I might be heeding the advice of my record label in attempt to be omnipresent across all platforms, some people were surprised I even had enough brain cells left to write because of all that partying I do (!). The truth is I’ve always loved writing so why the fuck not? I felt generally welcomed to the community but also did see the small wave of people being annoyed I’d broken down the walls of my box they were determined to keep me in, the box, or should I say the brand, of the party girl who smokes cigs, does coke, loves the color green and has the capacity for nothing else. To them I’m a silly little idiot because that’s what they desire me to be. I guess sometimes that’s just part of the deal.</p><p>Sometimes being a pop star can be really embarrassing, especially when you’re around old friends of family members who have known you since before you could talk. The discrepancy in lifestyles becomes more and more drastic the more successful and paranoid you become. As a British person the longer you stay in LA the more you lose touch with the realities of certain things, but that’s why being a pop star can also be seriously humbling too, especially when your old friends mock and ridicule you for caring about something absolutely pointless. In ways being a pop star makes me think about the person I used to be compared to the person I am now. How is that person different? Or is she still the same? A couple of weeks ago Yung Lean came for dinner at my house and we were discussing some industry adjacent friends of ours and whether we felt they had changed after their successes in their certain fields. The next day my brain was stewing and so I text him to ask him whether he thought I had changed. I knew he would be honest because he always is and I know he sees through everything, all the persona and all the facade. He is probably one of the wisest people I know. I’m sat there waiting for his response and the three speech bubble dots kept appearing and disappearing on my phone screen which was sending me into a total spiral. When he finally pressed send his message said that he thought I had not changed from the person he knew when we were younger and that he didn’t think I would in the future but also that I definitely do have ‘yes people’ around me that blow smoke up my ass. I said I could see the truth in that but luckily he went on to say that generally speaking I’m too British and self deprecating to actually believe any of the wild compliments the ‘yes people’ might pay me so I was probably safe.</p><p>My final thought on being a pop star is that there is a level of expectation for you to be entirely truthful all the time. Over recent years some people seem to have developed a connection between fame and moral responsibility that I’ve never really understood. All my favorite artists are absolutely not role models nor would I want them to be, but maybe that’s just me. I want hedonism, danger and a sense of anti establishment to come along with my artists because when I was younger I wanted to escape through them. I don’t care if they tell the truth or lie or play a character or adopt a persona or fabricate entire scenarios and worlds. To me that’s the point, that’s the drama, that’s the fun, that’s the FANTASY.</p><p><span>I’m ending the essay with a link to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeMIWCxHgQk" rel="">one of my favorite Lou Reed interviews</a><span>. Is it performance? Is it truth? Is it lies? Who fucking cares? In my opinion it’s just funny and cool.</span></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">





<p><img src="https://kevinboone.me/img/degoogle.png"></p>
<p>I imagine that most people who take an interest in de-Googling are
concerned about privacy. Privacy on the Internet is a somewhat nebulous
concept, but one aspect of privacy is surely the prevention of your web
browsing behaviour being propagated from one organization to another. I
don’t want my medical insurers to know, for example, that I’ve been
researching coronary artery disease. And even though my personal safety
and liberty probably aren’t at stake, I don’t want to give any support
to the global advertising behemoth, by allowing advertisers access to
better information about me.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while distancing yourself from Google and its services
might be a necessary first step in protecting your privacy, it’s far
from the last. There’s more to do, and it’s getting harder to do it,
because of browser fingerprinting.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-got-here">How we got here</h2>
<p>Until about five years ago, our main concern surrounding browser
privacy was probably the use of third-party tracking cookies. The
original intent behind cookies was that they would allow a web browser
and a web server to engage in a conversation over a period of time. The
HTTP protocol that web servers use is <em>stateless</em>; that is, each
interaction between browser and server is expected to be complete in
itself. Having the browser and the server exchange a cookie (which could
just be a random number) in each interaction allowed the server to
associate each browser with an ongoing conversation. This was, and is, a
legitimate use of cookies, one that is necessary for almost all
interactive web-based services. If the cookie is short-lived, and only
applies to a single conversation with a single web server, it’s not a
privacy concern.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, web browsers for a long time lacked the ability to
distinguish between privacy-sparing and privacy-breaking uses of
cookies. If many different websites issue pages that contain links to
the same server – usually some kind of advertising service – then the
browser would send cookies to that server, thinking it was being
helpful. This behaviour effectively linked web-based services together,
allowing them to share information about their users. The process is a
bit more complicated than I’m making it out to be, but these third-party
cookies were of such concern that, in Europe at least, legislation was
enacted to force websites to disclose that they were using them.</p>
<p>Browsers eventually got better at figuring out which cookies were
helpful and which harmful and, for the most part, we don’t need to be
too concerned about ‘tracking cookies’ these days. Not only can browsers
mitigate their risks, there’s a far more sinister one: browser
fingerprinting.</p>
<h2 id="browser-fingerprinting">Browser fingerprinting</h2>
<p>Browser fingerprinting does not depend on cookies. It’s resistant, to
some extent, to privacy measures like VPNs. Worst of all, steps that we
might take to mitigate the risk of fingerprinting can actually worsen
the risk. It’s a privacy nightmare, and it’s getting worse.</p>
<p>Fingerprinting works by having the web server extract certain
discrete elements of information from the browser, and combining those
elements into a numerical identifier. Some of the information supplied
by the browser is fundamental and necessary and, although a browser
could fake it, such a measure is likely to break the website.</p>
<p>For example, a fingerprinting system knows, just from information
that my browser always supplies (and probably has to), that I’m using
version 144 of the Firefox browser, on Linux; my preferred language is
English, and my time-zone is GMT. That, by itself, isn’t enough
information to identify me uniquely, but it’s a step towards doing
so.</p>
<p>To get more information, the fingerprinter needs to use more
sophisticated methods which the browser could, in theory, block. For
example, if the browser supports JavaScript – and they nearly all do –
then the fingerprinter can figure out what fonts I have installed, what
browser extensions I use, perhaps even what my hardware is. Worst of
all, perhaps, it can extract a <em>canvas fingerprint</em>. Canvas
fingerprinting works by having the browser run code that draws text
(perhaps invisibly), and then retrieving the individual pixel data that
it drew. This pixel data will differ subtly from one system to another,
even drawing the same text, because of subtle differences in the
graphics hardware and the operating system.</p>
<p>It appears that only about one browser in every thousand share the
same canvas fingerprint. Again, this alone isn’t enough to identify me,
but it’s another significant data point.</p>
<p>Fingerprinting can make use of even what appears to be trivial
information. If, for example, I resize my browser window, the browser
will probably make the next window the same size. It will probably
remember my preference from one day to the next. If the fingerprinter
knows my preferred browser window size is, say, 1287x892 pixels, that
probably narrows down the search for my identify by a factor of a
thousand or more.</p>
<h2 id="why-crude-methods-to-defeat-fingerprinting-dont-work">Why crude
methods to defeat fingerprinting don’t work</h2>
<p>You might think that a simple way to prevent, or at least hamper,
fingerprinting would be simply to disable JavaScript support in the
browser. While this does defeat measures like canvas fingerprinting, it
generates a significant data point of its own: the fact that JavaScript
is disabled. Since almost every web browser in the world now supports
JavaScript, turning it off as a measure to protect privacy is like going
to the shopping mall wearing a ski mask. Sure, it hides your identify;
but nobody’s going to want to serve you in stores. And disabling
JavaScript will break many websites, including some pages on this one,
because I use it to render math equations.</p>
<p>Less dramatic approaches to fingerprinting resistance have their own
problems. For example, a debate has long raged about whether a browser
should actually identify itself at all. The fact that I’m running
Firefox on Linux probably puts me in a small, easily identified group.
Perhaps my browser should instead tell the server I’m running Chrome on
Windows? That’s a much larger group, after all.</p>
<p>The problem is that the fingerprinters can guess the browser and
platform with pretty good accuracy using other methods, whether the
browser reports this information or not. If the browser says something
different to what the fingerprinter infers, we’re back in ski-mask
territory.</p>
<p>What about more subtle methods to spoof the client’s behaviour?
Browsers (or plug-ins) can modify the canvas drawing procedures, for
example, to spoof the results of canvas fingerprinting. Unfortunately,
these methods leave traces of their own, if they aren’t applied subtly.
What’s more, if they’re applied rigorously enough to be effective, they
can break websites that rely on them for normal operation.</p>
<p>All in all, browser fingerprinting is very hard to defeat, and
organizations that want to track us have gotten disturbingly good at
it.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-any-good-news">Is there any good news?</h2>
<p>Not much, frankly.</p>
<p>Before sinking into despondency, it’s worth bearing in mind that
websites that attempt to demonstrate the efficacy of fingerprinting,
like <a href="https://amiunique.org/">amiunique</a> and <a href="https://fingerprint.com/">fingerprint.com</a> do not reflect how
fingerprinting works in the real world. They’re operating on
comparatively small sets of data and, for the most part, they’re not
tracking users over days. Real-world tracking is much harder than these
sites make it out to be. That’s not to say it’s <em>too</em> hard but it
is, at best, a statistical approach, rather than an exact one.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kevinboone.me/img/fingerprinting1.png" alt="Oh, bugger. That’s something I don’t want to see from amiunique.org">

</figure>
<p>In addition ‘uniqueness’, in itself, is not a strong measure of
traceability. That my browser fingerprint is unique at some point in
time is irrelevant if my fingerprint will be different tomorrow, whether
it remains unique within the fingerprinter’s database or not.</p>
<p>Of course, these facts also mean that it’s difficult to assess the
effectiveness of our countermeasures: our assessment can only be
approximate, because we don’t actually know what real fingerprinters are
doing.</p>
<p>Another small piece of good news is that browser developers are
starting to realize how much of a hazard fingerprinting is, and to
integrate more robust countermeasures. We don’t necessarily need to
resort to plug-ins and extensions, which are themselves detectable and
become part of the fingerprint. At present, Brave and Mullvad seems to
be doing the most to resist fingerprinting, albeit in different ways.
Librewolf has the same fingerprint resistance as Firefox, but it is
turned on by default. Probably anti-fingerprinting methods will improve
over time but, of course, the fingerprinters will get better at what
they do, too.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-can-we-do">So what can we do?</h2>
<p>First, and most obviously, if you care about avoiding tracking, you
<em>must</em> prevent long-lived cookies hanging around in the browser,
and you <em>must</em> use a VPN. Ideally the VPN should rotate its
endpoint regularly.</p>
<p>The fact that you’re using a VPN, of course, is something that the
fingerprinters will know, and it is does make you stand out.
Sophisticated fingerprinters won’t be defeated by a VPN alone. But if
you don’t use a VPN, the trackers don’t even <em>need</em> to
fingerprint you: your IP number, combined with a few other bits of
routine information, will identify you immediately, and with
near-certainty.</p>
<p>Many browsers can be configured to remove cookies when they seem not
to be in use; Librewolf does this by default, and Firefox and Chrome do
it in ‘incognito’ mode. The downside, of course, is that long-lived
cookies are often used to store authentication status so, if you delete
them, you’ll find yourself having to log in every time you look at a
site that requires authentication. To mitigate this annoyance, browsers
generally allow particular sites to be excluded from their
cookie-burning policies.</p>
<p>Next, you need to be as unremarkable as possible. Fingerprinting is
about uniqueness, so you should use the most popular browser on the most
popular operating system on the kind of hardware you can buy from PC
World. If you’re running the latest Chrome on the latest Windows 11 on a
two-year-old, bog-standard laptop, you’re going to be one of a very
large group. Of course Chrome, being a Google product, has its own
privacy concerns, so you might be better off using a Chromium-based
browser with reduced Google influence, like Brave.</p>
<p>You should endeavour to keep your computer in as near its stock
configuration as possible. Don’t install anything (like fonts) that are
reportable by the browser. Don’t install any extensions, and don’t
change any settings. Use the same ‘light’ theme as everybody else, and
use the browser with a maximized window, and always the same size. And
so on.</p>
<p>If possible, use a browser that has built-in fingerprint resistance,
like Mullvad or Librewolf (or Firefox with these features turned
on).</p>
<p>If you take all these precautions, you can probably reduce the
probability that you can be tracked by you browser fingerprint, over
days or weeks, from about 99% to about 50%.</p>
<p>50% is still too high, of course.</p>
<h2 id="the-downsides-of-resisting-fingerprinting">The downsides of
resisting fingerprinting</h2>
<p>If you enable fingerprinting resistance in Firefox, or use Librewolf,
you’ll immediately encounter oddities. Most obviously, every time you
open a new browser window, it will be the same size. Resizing the window
may have odd results, as the browser will try to constrain certain
screen elements to common size multiples. In addition, you won’t be able
to change the theme.</p>
<p>You’ll probably find yourself facing more ‘CAPTCHA’ and similar
identity challenges, because your browser will be unknown to the server.
Websites don’t do this out of spite: hacking and fraud are rife on the
Internet, and the operators of web-based services are rightly paranoid
about client behaviour.</p>
<p>You’ll likely find that some websites just don’t work properly, in
many small ways: wrong colours, misplaced text, that kind of thing. I’ve
found these issues to be irritations rather than show-stoppers, but you
might discover otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="is-browser-fingerprinting-legal">Is browser fingerprinting
legal?</h2>
<p>The short answer, I think, is that nobody knows, even within a
specific jurisdiction. In the UK, <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2024/12/our-response-to-google-s-policy-change-on-fingerprinting/">the
Information Commissioner’s Office takes a dim view of it</a>, and it
probably violates the spirit of the GDPR, if not the letter.</p>
<p>The GDPR is, for the most part, technologically neutral, although it
has specific provisions for cookies, which were a significant concern at
the time it was drafted. So far as I know, nobody has yet challenged
browser fingerprinting under the GDPR, even though it seems to violate
the provisions regarding consent. Since there are legitimate reasons for
fingerprinting, such as hacking detection, organizations that do it
could perhaps defend against a legal challenge on the basis that
fingerprinting is necessary to operate their services safely. In the
end, we really need specific, new legislation to address this privacy
threat.</p>

<p>I suspect that many people who take an interest in Internet privacy
don’t appreciate how hard it is to resist browser fingerprinting. Taking
steps to reduce it leads to inconvenience and, with the present state of
technology, even the most intrusive approaches are only partially
effective. The data collected by fingerprinting is invisible to the
user, and stored somewhere beyond the user’s reach.</p>
<p>On the other hand, browser fingerprinting produces only statistical
results, and usually can’t be used to track or identify a user with
certainty. The data it collects has a relatively short lifespan – days
to weeks, not months or years. While it probably can be used for
sinister purposes, my main concern is that it supports the intrusive,
out-of-control online advertising industry, which has made a wasteland
of the Internet.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s probably only going to be controlled by legislation
and, even when that happens, the advertisers will seek new ways to make
the Internet even more of a hellscape – they always do.</p>

The French company itself has tumbled several times in the past two decades and always bounced back, but never quite as spectacularly as when, earlier this month, it asked the public for money.</p><p>An appeal for €5m (£4.4m) of emergency funding to secure the immediate future of the glassworks took just five hours and 40 minutes to reach its target. Within 48 hours, the total amount pledged had topped €19m.</p><p>François Marciano, 59, the director general of Duralex, said the response had astonished everyone at the company. “We thought it would take five or six weeks to raise the €5m. When it reached nearly €20m we had to say stop.

During a production run, more than a dozen samples of whatever is being made – glasses, plates, bowls – will be randomly removed and subjected to stress tests. In the quality control room, they will be heated to 150C then plunged into cold water to see if they resist a thermic shock, and dropped from the height of a kitchen counter on to a metal sheet to see if they shatter. They will be tested for stackability and then weighed and the glass thickness measured. If they pass, they are thrown in a bin and the production line is given a thumbs up. If they fail, everything stops and the machines are recalibrated.</p><h2 id="the-ultimate-drinking-vessel">‘The ultimate drinking vessel’</h2><p>It is not known who invented the company’s trademark Picardie glass, the tumbler used in school canteens with a thick curved rim and semi-fluted shape that first appeared in 1954. The British design guru <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110905055801/http://www.patricktaylor.com/duralex-picardie" data-link-name="in body link">Patrick Taylor has ranked</a> the Picardie alongside Levi’s jeans and the Swiss Army knife as an icon of modern design.

  <p data-date="2025-11-21T00:00:00">written on November 21, 2025</p>
  

  <p>I felt like it might be a good time to write about some new things I’ve
learned.  Most of this is going to be about building agents, with a little bit
about using agentic coding tools.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Building agents is still messy.  SDK abstractions break once you hit
real tool use.  Caching works better when you manage it yourself, but differs
between models.  Reinforcement ends up doing more heavy lifting than expected,
and failures need strict isolation to avoid derailing the loop.  Shared state
via a file-system-like layer is an important building block.  Output tooling is
surprisingly tricky, and model choice still depends on the task.</p>
<h2>Which Agent SDK To Target?</h2>
<p>When you build your own agent, you have the choice of targeting an underlying
SDK like the OpenAI SDK or the Anthropic SDK, or you can go with a higher level
abstraction such as the Vercel AI SDK or Pydantic.  The choice we made a while
back was to adopt the Vercel AI SDK but only the provider abstractions, and to
basically <a href="https://ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/node/manual-agent-loop">drive the agent loop
ourselves</a>.  At this point
<a href="https://earendil.com/">we</a> would not make that choice again.  There is
absolutely nothing wrong with the Vercel AI SDK, but when you are trying to
build an agent, two things happen that we originally didn’t anticipate:</p>
<p>The first is that the differences between models are significant enough that
you will need to build your own agent abstraction.  We have not found any of
the solutions from these SDKs that build the right abstraction for an agent.  I
think this is partly because, despite the basic agent design being just a loop,
there are subtle differences based on the tools you provide.  These differences
affect how easy or hard it is to find the right abstraction (cache control,
different requirements for reinforcement, tool prompts, provider-side tools,
etc.).  Because the right abstraction is not yet clear, using the original SDKs
from the dedicated platforms keeps you fully in control.  With some of these
higher-level SDKs you have to build on top of their existing abstractions,
which might not be the ones you actually want in the end.</p>
<p>We also found it incredibly challenging to work with the Vercel SDK when it
comes to dealing with provider-side tools.  The attempted unification of
messaging formats doesn’t quite work.  For instance, the web search tool from
Anthropic routinely destroys the message history with the Vercel SDK, and we
haven’t yet fully figured out the cause.  Also, in Anthropic’s case, cache
management is much easier when targeting their SDK directly instead of the
Vercel one.  The error messages when you get things wrong are much clearer.</p>
<p>This might change, but right now we would probably not use an abstraction when
building an agent, at least until things have settled down a bit.  The benefits
do not yet outweigh the costs for us.</p>
<p>Someone else might have figured it out.  If you’re reading this and think I’m
wrong, please drop me a mail.  I want to learn.</p>
<h2>Caching Lessons</h2>
<p>The different platforms have very different approaches to caching.  A lot has
been said about this already, but Anthropic makes you pay for caching.  It
makes you manage cache points explicitly, and this really changes the way you
interact with it from an agent engineering level.  I initially found the manual
management pretty dumb.  Why doesn’t the platform do this for me?  But I’ve
fully come around and now vastly prefer explicit cache management.  It makes
costs and cache utilization much more predictable.</p>
<p>Explicit caching allows you to do certain things that are much harder
otherwise.  For instance, you can split off a conversation and have it run in
two different directions simultaneously.  You also have the opportunity to do
context editing.  The optimal strategy here is unclear, but you clearly have a
lot more control, and I really like having that control.  It also makes it much
easier to understand the cost of the underlying agent.  You can assume much
more about how well your cache will be utilized, whereas with other platforms
we found it to be hit and miss.</p>
<p>The way we do caching in the agent with Anthropic is pretty straightforward.
One cache point is after the system prompt.  Two cache points are placed at the
beginning of the conversation, where the last one moves up with the tail of the
conversation.  And then there is some optimization along the way that you can
do.</p>
<p>Because the system prompt and the tool selection now have to be mostly static,
we feed a dynamic message later to provide information such as the current
time.  Otherwise, this would trash the cache.  We also leverage reinforcement
during the loop much more.</p>
<h2>Reinforcement In The Agent Loop</h2>
<p>Every time the agent runs a tool you have the opportunity to not just return
data that the tool produces, but also to feed more information back into the
loop.  For instance, you can remind the agent about the overall objective and
the status of individual tasks.  You can also provide hints about how the tool
call might succeed when a tool fails.  Another use of reinforcement is to
inform the system about state changes that happened in the background.  If you
have an agent that uses parallel processing, you can inject information after
every tool call when that state changed and when it is relevant for completing
the task.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s enough for the agent to self-reinforce.  In Claude Code, for
instance, the todo write tool is a self-reinforcement tool.  All it does is
take from the agent a list of tasks that it thinks it should do and echo out
what came in.  It’s basically just an echo tool; it really doesn’t do anything
else.  But that is enough to drive the agent forward better than if the only
task and subtask were given at the beginning of the context and too much has
happened in the meantime.</p>
<p>We also use reinforcements to inform the system if the environment changed
during execution in a way that’s problematic for the agent.  For instance, if
our agent fails and retries from a certain step forward but the recovery
operates off broken data, we inject a message informing it that it might want
to back off a couple of steps and redo an earlier step.</p>
<h2>Isolate Failures</h2>
<p>If you expect a lot of failures during code execution, there is an opportunity
to hide those failures from the context.  This can happen in two ways.  One is
to run tasks that might require iteration individually.  You would run them in
a subagent until they succeed and only report back the success, plus maybe a
brief summary of approaches that did not work.  It is helpful for an agent to
learn about what did not work in a subtask because it can then feed that
information into the next task to hopefully steer away from those failures.</p>
<p>The second option doesn’t exist in all agents or foundation models, but with
Anthropic you can do context editing.  So far we haven’t had a lot of success
with context editing, but we believe it’s an interesting thing we would love to
explore more.  We would also love to learn if people have success with it.
What is interesting about context editing is that you should be able to
preserve tokens for further down the iteration loop.  You can take out of the
context certain failures that didn’t drive towards successful completion of the
loop, but only negatively affected certain attempts during execution.  But as
with the point I made earlier: it is also useful for the agent to understand
what didn’t work, but maybe it doesn’t require the full state and full output
of all the failures.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, context editing will automatically invalidate caches.  There is
really no way around it.  So it can be unclear when the trade-off of doing that
compensates for the extra cost of trashing the cache.</p>
<h2>Sub Agents / Sub Inference</h2>
<p>As I mentioned a couple of times on this blog already, most of our agents are
based on code execution and code generation.  That really requires a common
place for the agent to store data.  Our choice is a file system—in our case a
virtual file system—but that requires different tools to access it.  This is
particularly important if you have something like a subagent or subinference.</p>
<p>You should try to build an agent that doesn’t have dead ends.  A dead end is
where a task can only continue executing within the sub-tool that you built.
For instance, you might build a tool that generates an image, but is only able
to feed that image back into one more tool.  That’s a problem because you might
then want to put those images into a zip archive using the code execution tool.
So there needs to be a system that allows the image generation tool to write
the image to the same place where the code execution tool can read it.  In
essence, that’s a file system.</p>
<p>Obviously it has to go the other way around too.  You might want to use the
code execution tool to unpack a zip archive and then go back to inference to
describe all the images so that the next step can go back to code execution and
so forth.  The file system is the mechanism that we use for that.  But it does
require tools to be built in a way that they can take file paths to the virtual
file system to work with.</p>
<p>So basically an <code>ExecuteCode</code> tool would have access to the same file system as
the <code>RunInference</code> tool which could take a <code>path</code> to a file on that same
virtual file system.</p>
<h2>The Use Of An Output Tool</h2>
<p>One interesting thing about how we structured our agent is that it does not
represent a chat session.  It will eventually communicate something to the user
or the outside world, but all the messages that it sends in between are usually
not revealed.  The question is: how does it create that message?  We have one
tool which is the output tool.  The agent uses it explicitly to communicate to
the human.  We then use a prompt to instruct it when to use that tool.  In our
case the output tool sends an email.</p>
<p>But that turns out to pose a few other challenges.  One is that it’s
surprisingly hard to steer the wording and tone of that output tool compared to
just using the main agent loop’s text output as the mechanism to talk to the
user.  I cannot say why this is, but I think it’s probably related to how these
models are trained.</p>
<p>One attempt that didn’t work well was to have the output tool run another quick
LLM like Gemini 2.5 Flash to adjust the tone to our preference.  But this
increases latency and actually reduces the quality of the output.  In part, I
think the model just doesn’t word things correctly and the subtool doesn’t have
sufficient context.  Providing more slices of the main agentic context into the
subtool makes it expensive and also didn’t fully solve the problem.  It also
sometimes reveals information in the final output that we didn’t want to be
there, like the steps that led to the end result.</p>
<p>Another problem with an output tool is that sometimes it just doesn’t call the
tool.  One of the ways in which we’re forcing this is we remember if the output
tool was called.  If the loop ends without the output tool, we inject a
reinforcement message to encourage it to use the output tool.</p>
<h2>Model Choice</h2>
<p>Overall our choices for models haven’t dramatically changed so far.  I think
Haiku and Sonnet are still the best tool callers available, so they make for
excellent choices in the agent loop.  They are also somewhat transparent with
regards to what the RL looks like.  The other obvious choices are the Gemini
models.  We so far haven’t found a ton of success with the GPT family of models
for the main loop.</p>
<p>For the individual sub-tools, which in part might also require inference, our
current choice is Gemini 2.5 if you need to summarize large documents or work
with PDFs and things like that.  That is also a pretty good model for
extracting information from images, in particular because the Sonnet family of
models likes to run into a safety filter which can be annoying.</p>
<p>There’s also probably the very obvious realization that token cost alone
doesn’t really define how expensive an agent.  A better tool caller will do the
job in fewer tokens.  There are some cheaper models available than sonnet
today, but they are not <em>necessarily</em> cheaper in a loop.</p>
<p>But all things considered, not that much has changed in the last couple of
weeks.</p>
<h2>Testing and Evals</h2>
<p>We find testing and evals to be the hardest problem here.  This is not entirely
surprising, but the agentic nature makes it even harder.  Unlike prompts, you
cannot just do the evals in some external system because there’s too much you
need to feed into it.  This means you want to do evals based on observability
data or instrumenting your actual test runs.  So far none of the solutions we
have tried have convinced us that they found the right approach here.
Unfortunately, I have to report that at the moment we haven’t found something
that really makes us happy.  I hope we’re going to find a solution for this
because it is becoming an increasingly frustrating aspect of building an agent.</p>
<h2>Coding Agent Updates</h2>
<p>As for my experience with coding agents, not really all that much has changed.
The main new development is that I’m trialing <a href="https://ampcode.com/">Amp</a> more.
In case you’re curious why: it’s not that it’s objectively a better agent than
what I’m using, but I really quite like the way they’re thinking about agents
from what they’re posting.  The interactions of the different sub agents like
the Oracle with the main loop is beautifully done, and not many other harnesses
do this today.  It’s also a good way for me to validate how different agent
designs work.  Amp, similar to Claude Code, really feels like a product built
by people who also use their own tool.  I do not feel every other agent in the
industry does this.</p>
<h2>Quick Stuff I Read And Found</h2>
<p>That’s just a random assortment of things that I feel might also be worth
sharing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/">What if you don’t need MCP at
all?</a>:
Mario argues that many MCP servers are overengineered and include large
toolsets that consume lots of context.  He proposes a minimalist approach for
browser-agent use-cases by relying on simple CLI tools (e.g., start, navigate,
evaluate JS, screenshot) executed via Bash, which keeps token usage small and
workflows flexible.  I <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-commands/tree/main/skills/web-browser">built a Claude/Amp Skill out of
it</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2025/11/16/the-fate-of-small-open-source/">The fate of “small” open
source</a>:
The author argues that the age of tiny, single-purpose open-source libraries is
coming to an end, largely because built-in platform APIs and AI tools can now
generate simple utilities on demand.  <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/1/24/build-it-yourself/">Thank fucking
god</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://x.com/mitsuhiko/status/1991997262810218983">Tmux is love</a>.  There is
no article that goes with it, but the TLDR is that Tmux is great.  If you
have anything that remotely looks like an interactive system that an agent
should work with, you should <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-commands/tree/main/skills/tmux">give it some Tmux
skills</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/11/22/llm-apis/">LLM APIs are a Synchronization Problem</a>.  This was a
separate realization that was too long for this post, so I wrote a separate one.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Mosses are already known for coping with harsh radiation, dehydration, and long <a href="https://scienceclock.com/mars-ice-could-preserve-traces-of-ancient-life-study-suggests/">freezes</a>. Now scientists have pushed them even further by exposing their spore capsules to open space for nine months, and most of them survived.</p>



<p>The team worked with spreading earthmoss (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physcomitrella_patens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Physcomitrium patens</em></a>), a small moss species used widely as a plant model by researchers. Its spore-containing capsules were mounted on the outside of the International Space Station (ISS), where they experienced direct solar radiation, vacuum conditions, and sharp temperature swings during each orbit.</p>



<p>Under those conditions, cells usually break down quickly. So the researchers were surprised by what came back. “We expected almost zero survival, but the result was the opposite,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1105940?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> Hokkaido University biologist Tomomichi Fujita. More than 80 percent of the spores still germinated once they returned to Earth.</p>

<p>The team detected a small drop in chlorophyll a, but the other pigments remained stable. The spores grew normally in follow-up tests, showing no signs of major stress from their time in orbit.</p>



<p>This kind of toughness fits with the evolutionary history of mosses. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryophyte" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bryophytes</a> — the group that includes mosses, liverworts, and hornworts — were among the first plants to move from water onto land about 500 million years ago. Their spores had to withstand drying and direct sunlight long before soils existed, which may explain why their protective structures still hold up so well today.</p>

<p>The results place moss spores alongside the few organisms known to tolerate direct <a href="https://scienceclock.com/category/space/">space</a> exposure, including tardigrades and certain microbes. Their survival also adds to ongoing discussions about what types of <a href="https://scienceclock.com/category/life/">life</a> might endure extreme environments beyond Earth.</p>



<p>According to the researchers, this durability could matter for future experiments on the Moon or Mars. Mosses need very little soil and can pull nutrients directly from rock, making them candidates for early ecosystem tests in <a href="https://scienceclock.com/aliens-got-bored-and-stopped-searching-humans-says-scientist/">extraterrestrial</a> settings.</p>




<p>“Ultimately, we hope this work opens a new frontier toward constructing ecosystems in extraterrestrial environments such as&nbsp;the <a href="https://scienceclock.com/saturns-moon-enceladus-signals-organic-molecules-key-to-lifes-chemistry/">Moon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mars,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1105940?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a>&nbsp;Fujita.</p>
