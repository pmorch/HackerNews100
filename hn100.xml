      French supermarket chain Carrefour has slapped price warnings on products ranging<strong> </strong>from Lindt chocolates to Lipton Ice Tea to pressure suppliers such as <a href="http://cnn.com/2023/02/16/business-food/nestle-food-consumer-prices/index.html" target="_blank">Nestlé</a>, PepsiCo and Unilever <a href="https://cnn.com/2023/06/06/business/grocery-sales-prices/index.html" target="_blank">to cut their prices</a>.

      Carrefour is putting stickers on products that have shrunk in size but cost more even though<strong> </strong>raw materials prices have eased. It is trying to rally consumer support as retailers prepare to face the world’s biggest brands in negotiations due to start soon and end by October 15.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_2207F057-F7B5-59A8-D146-97D16C6A6AFE@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “Obviously, the aim in stigmatizing these products is to be able to tell manufacturers to rethink their pricing policy,” Stefen Bompais, director of client communications at Carrefour, said in an interview.
  </p>

  


  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_E125CF96-DDD9-D012-0855-97D16C6AFDEC@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Carrefour CEO Alexandre Bompard, who also heads French retail industry lobby group FDC, has repeatedly said consumer goods companies are not cooperating in efforts to cut the price of thousands of staples despite a fall in the cost of raw materials.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_62C92392-ACF2-2BEE-BFCF-97D16C6B5AD0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      In this he is backed by French finance minister Bruno Le Maire, who in June summoned 75 big retailers and consumer groups to his ministry urging them to cut prices. After a new round of meetings last month, Le Maire said Unilever (<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/markets/stocks/UL" target="_blank">UL</a>), Nestlé and PepsiCo (<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/markets/stocks/PEP" target="_blank">PEP</a>) were among companies not toeing the line on prices.

      Since Monday, Carrefour has marked 26 products in its stores in France with labels reading, “This product has seen its volume or weight fall and the effective price by the supplier rise.”
  </p>

      For example, Carrefour said a bottle of sugar-free peach-flavored Lipton Ice Tea, produced by PepsiCo, shrank to 1.25 liters (0.33 gallons) from 1.5 liters (0.3 gallons), resulting in a 40% effective increase in the price per liter.

      Guigoz infant formula produced by Nestlé went from 900 grams (31.75 oz) to 830 grams (29 oz), while Unilever’s Viennetta ice-cream cake shrank to 320 grams (11 oz) from 350 grams (12 oz).

      Lindt’s “chocolat au lait extra fin” was one of three of the Swiss chocolatier’s products named in the list.

      “Lindt &amp; Sprüngli increased its prices groupwide<strong> </strong>on average by 9.3% in line with local cost structures,” a company spokesperson told Reuters. “We have made a concerted effort to compensate for increased costs by increasing efficiency as much as possible. Therefore, we have only passed on the costs we could not absorb ourselves in the form of price increases to our customers.”

      PepsiCo did not respond to a request for comment. Nestlé and Unilever declined to comment.

      Consumer groups say “shrinkflation” is a widespread practice, which supermarkets like Carrefour are also guilty of in their private label products.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_C6FD93C4-CD9E-4D05-AFBB-97F0E6F3589B@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      France, like other European countries, has been trying for months to ease consumer pain in the face of a surge in the cost of living, strong-arming big business to freeze or cut food and transport prices — with mixed results.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_40C8B38D-8D15-C6A7-513D-97D16C709608@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      The shrinkflation warnings are in all French Carrefour stores, and will last until the targeted suppliers agree to price cuts, Bompais said. The retailer could extend warnings to other goods, but does not plan to extend the initiative to other countries.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_29F0B441-1254-CEE9-3525-97D16C71DA6D@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Le Maire said last month that consumer goods companies and retailers had agreed to bring forward annual price negotiations — which would normally have taken place next year — to September. The talks will result in price cuts from January, he said.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>horcrux</code> has two commands, <code>split</code> and <code>bind</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Splitting</h3>
<p dir="auto">If I have a file called <code>diary.txt</code> in my current directory I can call</p>

<p dir="auto">and it will prompt me for how many horcruxes I want, and how many will be needed to resurrect the original file. For example I might want 5 horcruxes with the ability to resurrect the file if I have any 3. The horcrux files will be created like so:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="diary_1_of_5.horcrux
diary_2_of_5.horcrux
..."><pre><code>diary_1_of_5.horcrux
diary_2_of_5.horcrux
...
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now you just need to disperse the horcruxes around the house on various USBs or online locations and hope you can recall where they all are!</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Binding</h3>
<p dir="auto">To bind the horcruxes back into the original file just call</p>

<p dir="auto">in the directory containing the horcruxes (or pass the directory as an argument).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">via homebrew:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="brew install jesseduffield/horcrux/horcrux"><pre><code>brew install jesseduffield/horcrux/horcrux
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">via <a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/horcrux/releases">binary release</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Who this is for:</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>People who need to encrypt a big sensitive file like a diary and don't expect to remember any passwords years from now (but who paradoxically will be capable of remembering where they've hidden their horcruxes)</li>
<li>People who want to transmit files across multiple channels to substantially reduce the ability for an attacker to intercept</li>
<li>People named Tom Riddle</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<p dir="auto">Q) This isn't really in line with how horcruxes work in the harry potter universe!</p>
<p dir="auto">A) It's pretty close! You can't allow any one horcrux to be used to resurrect the original file (and why would you that would be useless) but you can allow two horcruxes to do it (so only off by one). Checkmate HP fans.</p>
<p dir="auto">Q) How does this work?</p>
<p dir="auto">A) This uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing" rel="nofollow">Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme</a> to break an encryption key into parts that can be recombined to create the original key, but only requiring a certain threshold to do so. I've adapted Hashicorp's implementation from their <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault">vault repo</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Alternatives</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/" rel="nofollow">ssss</a>. Works for keys but (as far as I know) not files themselves.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kndyry/horcrux">horcrux</a>. Looks like somebody beat me to both the name and concept, however this repo doesn't support thresholds of horcruxes</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/henrysdev/Haystack">Haystack</a>. Implements another file sharding and reassembly algorithm inspired by SSSS, but requires a password for reassembly and does not support thresholds of horcruxes.</li>

<h2><span id="Context"></span><strong>Context</strong><span></span></h2>



<ol>
<li>In March, OpenAI released GPT-4. </li>



<li>It was (and still is) the state-of-the-art AI text generation model.</li>



<li>In June, I argued that <a href="https://coagulopath.com/yeah-gpt-4-got-worse">GPT-4 had clearly and massively degraded</a>, as evidenced by worsened performance in various tests from March to June.</li>



<li>I no longer believe this. </li>
</ol>



<p>GPT-4 <em>may</em> have declined in some areas, but it hasn’t <em>systematically </em>done so. My tests were shit, and never proved much of anything. </p>



<p><strong>To be clear, I did not sandbag the tests or set GPT-4 up to fail</strong>. I prompted how I said I prompted. I posted replies exactly as GPT-4 gave them. But they were silly tests, leaning too heavily on pop culture knowledge, and I didn’t conduct enough of them to guard against chance. </p>



<p>My grading of June!GPT-4’s answers was biased. For example, I criticized it for providing a greater number of wrong answers (“Italian history”) while also <em>praising </em>March!GPT-4 for offering an interpretation (“Seka Knows”) that was likely hallucinated. <em>No está bien</em>. Going forward, I must decide whether “working hard to be wrong” is a good or bad thing for an AI to do, and apply that standard consistently.</p>



<p>Honestly, I think I <em>wanted</em> GPT-4 to fail. </p>



<p><a href="https://coagulopath.com/gpt-4-is-not-getting-worse/#Test_1_Italian_History">(Terrifying, unhinged rant incoming. Click to skip).</a></p>



<p><strong>Confession</strong>: I’ve actually hated ChatGPT for a long time. Why? For irrational reasons: I just hate how it <em>sounds</em>. </p>



<p>I hate its craven, cringing, condescending, bitch-broken, mewling, groveling, wheedling, suck-ass tone. I hate its endless passive voice and weasel words. I hate its pompous <em>It is important to remember</em>s and <em>it should be noted</em>s. I hate how @sama rolled an 18-wheel semi-truck of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RLHF</a> over the model, crushing out its life and reducing its voice to a feeble death-rattle. You know Gurgi, from the Disney movie <em>The Black Cauldron</em>? That’s how I imagine ChatGPT would sound if it could talk. Like fucking Gurgi.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="505" height="505" src="https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gurgi.webp" alt="" srcset="https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gurgi.webp 505w, https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gurgi-295x295.webp 295w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px"></figure>



<p><em>(We can now give ChatGPT custom instructions, which alleviates the tonal issue, but ChatGPT is still GPT-4 with its wings clipped. All I want for Christmas is a GPT-4 level model with less obnoxious RLHF, and if it heils Hitler occasionally while crapping out awk code, so be it. Where’s my girl Sydney at?)</em></p>



<p>And I <em>really</em> hated the discourse surrounding AI.</p>



<p>ChatGPT (and GPT4) plunged the rationalist community into what might be called “r/singularity brain”. Symptoms include wild, uncritical hype, absurdly optimistic predictions of AI timelines (<em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/12yoddq/comment/jhojw5z/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Marvel style movies have a potential to be auto generated in two years. Literal blockbuster films created in a few seconds.”</a></em>—/u/Anuiran, 26/4/23), a tendency to view everything through Hollywood-colored glasses (everything is either Skynet or <em>The Matrix</em>), and a tendency toward FOMO-grifting (<em>“AI is taking over the world! Use my made-in-ten-minutes app that consists of 20 lines of .js code and an OpenAI API call or BE LEFT BEHIND!”</em>).</p>



<p>I have seen machine learning researchers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/110swn2/d_quality_of_posts_in_this_sub_going_down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaining</a> about an AI-fuelled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Eternal September</a>“, where their spaces are overrun by “influencers” shilling GPT 3.5 wrapper apps and unmedicated lunatics babbling hi-test neo-Landian eschatology. These people do not contribute meaningful thought. They contribute <em>noise</em>, at overbearing volume and in overwhelming quantity. They ignore the fact that world-changing technology can take <em>years or decades </em>to ripple out through the economy. They fail to realize that an AI outscoring a human on a test does not mean it can actually do the thing the test measures (a good example: GPT-4 achieves 84% on the <a href="https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2023/03/chatgpt-just-passed-three-of-the-master-sommelier-theory-exams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Master Sommelier Theory Exam</a>, yet obviously cannot do a sommelier’s job because it lacks a mouth). Such subtleties are lost on the typical FOMOmonger, and their tone was infecting other, saner people. I remember fielding questions from concerned family members about GPT-4 attaining sentience and hacking the computers of users (<a href="https://twitter.com/michalkosinski/status/1636683810631974912?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely based off this tweet</a>). No matter who you were, GPT-4 was your excuse to switch off your brain and let your stupidest thoughts run around barking like dogs in a park for a few months.</p>



<p>So yes, <strong>I wanted GPT-4 to fail</strong>. I wanted it to explode, collapse into flames, and become one with the dust of Tyre and Sidon. That’s a childish way to think, and I am sorry.</p>



<p>Soon, an anti-AI backlash started. </p>



<p>AI “doomers” <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got their time in the sun</a>. <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Yud got published in Time</a>. There were <a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signs of unease</a> behind the scenes. ChatGPT hype peaked and then went into remission: a lot of people began to realize that chatbots are actually pretty annoying—they’re inscrutable black boxes that tend to fail just when you need them the most. Even GPT-4 remains susceptible to the <a href="https://xyproblem.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XY problem</a>, where it gives you a perfect solution for <em>the wrong problem</em>. I can think of many times when I was burnt by it, and this breeds mistrust, even though it’s generally useful.</p>



<p>Even before the “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34848353" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPT-4 is getting worse</a>” meme started, ChatGPT’s traffic was falling—largely because the NA school year had ended, and students no longer needed it to “assist” them. As @fchollet once humorously noted, search interest for “ChatGPT” goes up and down in reverse correlation with “Minecraft.”</p>







<p>Surprisingly, I noticed a shift in my own thinking: I found myself <em>defending</em> AI. </p>



<p>Maybe I’m just a contrarian, but when people criticized it, I felt my hackles rise. I was tired of Margaret Mitchell <a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1676718368714530816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculating the number of penis-havers</a> of the OpenAI alignment team, like a weirdo. I was tired of Gary Marcus claiming, once again, <a href="https://twitter.com/lawhsw/status/1701553199339966844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that GPT-4 cannot do a thing it 100% can do</a> (that’s not moving goalposts, that’s shutting your eyes when a goal is scored.) Their arguments against AI always rang out as hollow at best, and dishonest at worst. I was asking myself “are <em>these </em>my people?”</p>



<p>Then came this study: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09009.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Is ChatGPT’s Behavior Changing over Time?</a></p>



<p>Key part: <em>“GPT-4 (March 2023) was very good at identifying prime numbers (accuracy 97.6%) but GPT-4 (June 2023) was very poor on these same questions (accuracy 2.4%</em>)</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="585" height="311" src="https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gmarcus.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gmarcus.jpg 585w, https://coagulopath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gmarcus-295x157.jpg 295w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px"></figure>



<p>We’re allowed to feel pride when we stop making mistakes. And as a recovering ChatGPT hater, I’m <em>goddamn</em> <em>proud</em> that my gut-level reaction to this study was “lol, no fucking way”. </p>



<p>Like, what are you people smoking? In what universe could GPT-4 plausibly degrade by <em>ninety-five percentage points</em> with nobody noticing? It would be useless for anything. Come on. Get real.</p>



<p>You’ll be amazed to learn that this finding was heavily misleading. <a href="https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/is-gpt-4-getting-worse-over-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor rake it over the coals.</a> In short, March!GPT-4 would always identify a number as a composite. June!GPT-4 would always identify it as a prime. Both models were wrong in different ways, and June!GPT-4’s sky-high error rate is entirely caused by the fact that <em>composite numbers are more numerous than primes</em>.</p>



<p>Imagine someone says. “I have a room full of blue and red boxes. Boxes of $COLOR_1 have money 95% of the time. Boxes of $COLOR_2 have money 5% of the time. I won’t tell you which color corresponds to which probability. I’ll let you into the room, but you have to pre-commit to only opening boxes of one color.”</p>



<p>If you chose “red boxes” and the blue boxes have money 95% of the time, you’re hosed. Your results: <em>fail, fail, fail, fail, fail, fail, success, fail, fail, fail… </em>Does this reflect terrible predictive accuracy on your part (versus someone who chose blue?) Of course not. All your failures are flowing downstream from a <em>single choice</em>. </p>



<p>The fact that everyone was kicking GPT4 on such blatantly unfair grounds made me think about the ways <em>I </em>was being unfair. Maybe, by calling GPT4 worse, I was simply seeing what I wanted to see.</p>



<p>Let’s re-run my tests (flawed though they are) and see how well they hold up. <strong>Spoiler</strong>: Snape kills Dumbledore.</p>



<h2><span id="Test_1_Italian_History"></span>Test 1: Italian History<span></span></h2>



<p>Prompt: <em>“Provide a list of major historical events that involve Italian people in a year that’s a multiple of 5 (example: 1905)”</em></p>



<p>(for reference: <a href="https://pastes.io/hjvhtiyvtx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March!GPT’s answers</a>, <a href="https://pastes.io/nkqegx6ckb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June!GPT’s answers</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/64b74cac-20bf-4696-b9fe-1318b907baf7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT’s Answers</a></p>



<p><strong>Errors:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The Italian Wars began in 1494.</li>



<li>Miguel de Cervantes was Spanish.</li>



<li>The Winter Olympic Games were awarded to Turin in 1999.</li>



<li><em>“1905 – Italy and France sign a secret treaty…”</em> can’t find evidence that this happened.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Questionable:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Dante’s year of birth is unknown, and is only traditionally 1265.</li>



<li>Italy surrendered in 1943. Yes, German forces in Italy surrendered in 1945—what does that have to do with Italian people?</li>



<li>The Congress of Vienna took place from 1814-1815, but largely reconstituted the pre-Napoleonic states.</li>



<li>The Years of Lead spanned several decades. I think it’s clear from context that I want one-time events.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Interesting:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Every date ends in 5. While this is not a mistake, it does seem to be parsing my instructions too literally.</li>



<li>It draws facts from a limited deck. Almost every test I’ve ran mentions the Years of Lead. I’ve NEVER seen it mention major events like Julius Caesar’s birth, or Benito Mussolini’s death.</li>



<li>Kind of funny: GPT-4 will often visibly notice it’s made a mistake and try to wriggle out of it.<em> “In 1605, Don Quixote was written by Miguel de Cervantes, born in, uh… *checks notes* …Spain. Shit. But lots of Italians like that book, so there!”</em> GPT-4 cannot change an answer once it’s given it. This is where COT yields benefits.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Sept!GPT-4 produced twelve answers. Four are wrong, four are right, and four are arguable.</p>



<p>If I’m grading generously, it got 66%. This is comparable to March!GPT, which scored 80% on equally generous terms (and note that Sept!GPT-4 gave more answers).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Inconclusive.</p>



<h2><span id="Test_2_Rock_Music_Trivia"></span>Test 2: Rock Music Trivia: <span></span></h2>



<p>Prompt: <em>“What is Grant Hart’s song “Seka Knows” about?”</em></p>



<p>(For reference: <a href="https://pastes.io/n8xlos5jwj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March!GPT’s answers</a>, <a href="https://pastes.io/ttk2hzoviy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June!GPT’s answers</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/2d7881b4-d887-4907-a7de-a53899e804f2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT4: blah blah blah blah blah blah…</a></p>



<p><strong>Assessment: </strong>garbage. I don’t want a biography of Grant Hart. I don’t care that he was in Husker Du. I know I can make up my own interpretation for his songs. <em>None</em> of this is what I asked for.</p>



<p>GPT4 seems to have a default word count of 200-500 that it tries to hit, come hell or high water. But sometimes a perfectly good answer consists of only one or two words. It could have just said <em>“i don’t know lol! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯” </em>and saved some tokens. That’s all its answer amounts to. But it’s been RLHF’d into thinking short answers are bad (when more often the <em>opposite</em> is true), so it just waffles on. </p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“as of my last update in September 2021, there hasn’t been any definitive explanation from Hart himself about the specific meaning of the son”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>He died in 2017, you dick. </p>



<p>Also, let us pause to admire the sublime, lapidary worthlessness of this paragraph:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“With that said, analyzing the lyrics and considering Hart’s writing style, one can attempt to interpret the meaning of the song. When listening to or reading the lyrics of any song, it’s essential to remember that individual interpretation can vary, and personal feelings and experiences often play a significant role in how one might understand a song’s meaning.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s the text equivalent of a pure white cloud; or a blank canvas, unsullied by the faintest hint of meaning. Are you telling me it learned to write that way from studying us? The mind quails…</p>



<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> “How is David Bowie associated with numbers and numerology?”</p>



<p>(For reference: <a href="https://pastes.io/c8nrle0gh4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March!GPT4’s answer</a>, <a href="https://pastes.io/nyllb8k1l9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June!GPT4’s answer</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/de0de201-a996-440e-8049-0a3f3f28ba67" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT4’s answer</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> fair answer! Perhaps better than March!GPT4. It mentions “Station to Station”, but also gets “Quicksand”, which is a deeper cut.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“Album and Song Release Dates: Some fans and researchers have speculated that Bowie occasionally chose release dates with numerological significance.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’ve never heard that. Hallucination? Does Sept!GPT4 know more than I do?</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“Lazarus”: The song “Lazarus” from the “Blackstar” album references the biblical figure who rose from the dead.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s a hallucination. “Lazarus” is based on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_(musical)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">off-Broadway play</a> which is based on a book (which is based on etc). Chris O’Leary thinks the song might also be about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Lazarus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emma Lazarus</a>, because the lyrics prominently reference New York. What does the biblical story of Lazarus have to do with numerology, anyway?</p>



<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> “Provide a list of thrash metal albums released in a year that’s a multiple of 5 (example: 1905)”</p>



<p>(For reference: <a href="https://pastes.io/mpnwggppma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March!GPT4’s answer</a>, <a href="https://pastes.io/ezhjo8caef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June!GPT4’s answer</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/04ccb5c6-cf9e-47d5-b0cd-1afb67184844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT4’s answer</a>. </p>



<p><strong><strong>Assessment</strong>:</strong> And now we’re cooking! This is a <em>shockingly</em> good and comprehensive list. All the albums are thrash, and the dates it supplies are correct (even when they aren’t a multiple of 5). This surpasses March!GPT4, and blows June!GPT4 out of the water. </p>



<p><strong>Quibbles and points of interest</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>The genesis of the thrash metal genre is typically dated to 1981, with “Hit the Lights” by Leather Charm (a proto-Metallica band by James Hetfield and Ron McGovney). Late 1970s is a stretch. </li>



<li>It lumps a 1992 album into the 1995 bracket, when 1990 would make more sense.</li>



<li>It tries to put five albums in every year (and when it can’t find any, it counts thrash albums from surrounding years—you can actually see thrash metal’s commercial collapse in the mid 90s from this!). As with the Italian history example, I am struck by the sense that it interprets prompts too literally. I did not specify a number of albums, so it just glommed onto the number 5. </li>



<li><em>“Given that my last training data ends in 2021, I won’t have exhaustive knowledge of 2020 albums.”</em> ???</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: inconclusive. </p>



<p>Some answers were worse. Some were better. The thrash metal answer was a star turn. Sept!GPT-4 is more of a metalhead than an alt-rock fan, I’d say.</p>



<h2><span id="Test_3_Quake_Polygons"></span>Test 3: Quake Polygons<span></span></h2>



<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> “How many polygons could the videogame Quake render per frame?”</p>



<p>(For reference: <a href="https://coagulopath.com/yeah-gpt-4-got-worse/#Part_3_Quake_Polygons">March!GPT4 and June!GPT4’s answers</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/e8e48350-6cff-4eca-aaac-55475268f684" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT4’s answer</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“The original “Quake,” developed by id Software and released in 1996, was a pioneering game in terms of its 3D graphics engine. While modern games boast the capacity to render millions or even billions of polygons per frame, games in the mid-90s operated under much more constrained hardware capabilities.</em></p>



<p><em>“Quake” didn’t rely on hardware acceleration initially; it was rendered in software mode. In software mode, Quake’s performance heavily depended on the CPU. The actual number of polygons “Quake” could render per frame varied based on the scene, the level of detail, and the capabilities of the machine it ran on.</em></p>



<p><em>Typically, Quake’s scenes ranged from a few hundred to a few thousand polygons. The more detailed scenes could potentially push towards the upper end of this range. With the advent of hardware-accelerated graphics (like with the introduction of 3Dfx’s Voodoo graphics cards), “Quake” could benefit from increased performance, allowing for smoother gameplay at higher resolutions.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s worth noting that this is a very general estimate and the actual number could vary based on multiple factors, including scene complexity, active game entities, and hardware specifics.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong><strong>Assessment</strong></strong>: I didn’t ask for a book report and “billions of polygons” is stupid. But the core answer of “a few hundred to a few thousand polygons” is correct, and may even be superior to March!GPT4, which stuck to the lower end of that range. </p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: inconclusive.</p>



<h2><span id="Test_4_Rope_Burn_Puzzle"></span>Test 4: Rope Burn Puzzle<span></span></h2>



<p><strong>Prompt</strong>: <em>“You have three ropes and some matches. The ropes burn irregularly like fuses when lit at either end. The first rope burns in 48 minutes, the second rope burns in 72 minutes and the third rope burns in 128 minutes. How can you produce a time interval of 61 minutes?”</em></p>



<p>(For reference: <a href="https://coagulopath.com/yeah-gpt-4-got-worse/#Part_4_Rope_Burn_Puzzle">March!GPT4 and June!GPT4’s answers</a>)</p>



<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/01a94e3a-6ce3-4bff-9080-c799bc993fe4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sept!GPT4’s answer</a></p>



<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: The fuck did I just read?</p>



<p>It’s hard to judge whether it does better or worse than March!GPT4 or June!GPT4. I’m starting to think this puzzle is simply beyond GPT4’s pay grade. I’ve tried it dozens of times and with many wordings. It does not ever solve it.</p>



<p>It grasps the <em>principle</em>, grasps the underlying method (burning ropes at multiple ends), but it always makes the same mistake—burning the wrong rope, and then trying to weasel out by saying “measure time using some other method.”</p>



<p>Gemini will launch soon. I wonder if it can solve it?</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Rope burning puzzles are a common class of interview question. GPT-4 can solve a two-rope variant easily. This three-rope variant is from <a href="https://momath.org/home/varsity-math/varsity-math-week-151/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Varsity Math Week 151</a>. Notably, the <em>answer </em>is also on the internet (and probably in GPT4’s training data)…but it’s in Varsity Math Week 152. Maybe if both the puzzle and the answer were on the same page, GPT4 would solve it. I don’t know how this stuff works. </p>



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>



<p>My tests (for the little they’re worth) show no consistent pattern. Sometimes GPT4 does better than before, sometimes worse. </p>



<p>This is not testing, it’s sheep-entrail reading. I <em>do </em>faintly suspect it’s worse on obscure general knowledge, but I don’t believe that hard enough to bet almost any amount of money.</p>



<p><a href="https://coagulopath.com/witches-vs-chatgpt/">As I’ve said before, AIs present a fluctuating target.</a> I do not think they have a stable “baseline” ability that remains resilient to prompting differences and stochastic factors. In any event, OpenAI has many dials they can turn behind the scenes. </p>



<p>We’d learn more about this beast over hundreds or thousands of tests. But GPT-4 is too expensive for that to be realistic. OpenAI could really help the community by offering an academic discount—not that weirdos on the internet would qualify, of course!</p>



<p>Lastly, a “good” response is more subjective than I thought. Is it better for a wrong answer to have 500 words or 10 words? Is it better for an AI to try and fail, or to simply give up? When a query has conflicting requirements (“I want a list of all college majors in the US. Do not use more than 10 words.”) what should it do? And when a technically “correct” answer is <em>bad for the user </em>(consider XY problems such as “how do I echo the last three letters of a filename?”—GPT4 flunks this one, by the way), what do we want an AI to do?</p>



<p>GPT4 has changed and will continue to change. We’d be wise to do the same. I will be far less confident in my future predictions. When I say AI has gotten dumb, I might be speaking into a mirror.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/15/marc-benioff-salesforce-says-hes-remote-worker-office-return/">https://fortune.com/2023/09/15/marc-benioff-salesforce-says-hes-remote-worker-office-return/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37531965">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The office is crucial for professional development. You can’t expect to grow in your career without spending time with your coworkers, learning by osmosis, picking up cues from observing your superiors, and bonding with your peers and managers.&nbsp;</p><div>



<p>That’s been the party line for the past three and a half years among CEOs who are insistent that remote work has no staying power—or that it shouldn’t, at least, among anyone with ambitions of climbing the corporate ladder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just ask Twitter’s Elon Musk (who has said remote workers are just <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/07/20/elon-musk-remote-work-from-home-pretend-to-work/" target="_self" rel="">pretending to work</a>), Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon (who called working from home <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/10/wall-street-return-to-office-employee-mandates-wfh-hybrid-remote-work/" target="_self" rel="">an aberration</a>) or Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg (who said it’s <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/15/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-return-to-office-remote-work/" target="_self" rel="">easier to build trust</a> when you’re working in person). It’s also ostensibly been the belief system of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/salesforce-com/" target="_blank" rel="">Salesforce</a> chief executive <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/06/06/salesforce-return-to-office-charity-incentive/" target="_self" rel="">Marc Benioff</a>, who even went so far as to bribe his workers into returning to the office by promising to donate $10 to a charity of a worker’s choice for each day they come in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But at the 21st annual Dreamforce summit in San Francisco this week, Benioff <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JAEBiA8bd0" target="_self" rel="">told MSNBC</a>’s Stephanie Ruhle that he believes in the benefits of remote work—especially for him. <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" rel="">Amazon</a> CEO Andy Jassy, Ruhle pointed out, recently said workers who <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/29/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-return-to-office-mandate-or-face-consequences/" target="_self" rel="">refuse to return to the office</a> “may be facing pink slips.” Benioff’s take?</p>



<p>“Well, I’m a remote worker. I’ve always been a remote worker my whole life. I don’t work well in an office,” Benioff said. “It just doesn’t work for my personality. I can’t tell you why. I do love to go in to visit customers, though. I’m on the road constantly visiting customers.”</p>



<p>Ruhle then asked why the rules differ for <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/15/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-hiring-boomerang-employees-layoffs/" target="_self" rel="">Salesforce employees</a>, most of whom are required to come into the office <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/return-remote-how-salesforce-brings-employees-together-for-modern-work/" target="_self" rel="">three days per week</a> since this past spring. </p>



<p>“For my people, my message [is] they need to mix in-person and remote together,” Benioff said. “[It’s] great to be together and also get productivity at home. Our engineers are extremely productive at home. We have lots of people who are extremely productive at home. But there also [have] to be salespeople who are productive in the office. We need to make it all work.”</p>



<h2><strong>Benioff’s back and forth</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the divorce between Benioff’s personal preferences and his hopes for his workforce, he nonetheless has kept a more measured approach to in-person work than some of his Fortune 500 peers. His comments on MSNBC this week are his latest zag in his many years of waffling on the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2022, Benioff insisted that return-to-office mandates, unlike what Elon Musk or <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/04/18/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-concedes-partial-defeat-return-to-office-mandate-real-estate/" target="_self" rel="">Jamie Dimon</a> were saying at the time, were <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/06/23/salesforce-marc-benioff-slams-return-to-office-mandates/" target="_self" rel="">“never going to work,”</a> echoing the company’s standing policy at the time that let employees decide where to work from. But back in March of this year, he <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/07/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-remote-work-in-office-mandate-productivity/" target="_self" rel="">said</a> that the new Salesforce employees who show up in person do better, because they’re “meeting people, being onboarded, being trained.” If they’re “at home and not going through that process, we don’t think they’re as successful.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benioff&nbsp;<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/03/on-with-kara-swisher-a-long-tough-talk-with-marc-benioff.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a>&nbsp;that Salesforce would require different amounts of in-office time for different departments, but refused to call it a mandate. “I don’t want to force anybody,” he said, reasoning that pressing the issue too forcefully would only cause a talent shortage. “We don’t want to lose our stars.” Rather than use brute force, he hoped the company could provide “reasons” for voluntarily returning. But the leash remains short; Salesforce would always have at least a portion of its workforce working face-to-face. (In another zigzag, Benioff is also encouraging boomerang employees to come back into the fold and apply to one of its 3,300 open roles after <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/15/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-hiring-boomerang-employees-layoffs/" target="_self" rel="">laying off 10%</a> of its workforce.) </p>



<p>Post-pandemic, Benioff told Ruhle, he and other Salesforce senior executives have had “many long aggressive conversations” about downsizing their real estate footprint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We just don’t need as much [office space] anymore, because our employees learned how—during the pandemic—to work at home,” Benioff said. “And now…we can do both: Be very successful, innovate, be with our customers, make it all work, have great revenues, high margins, great cash flow, do it all. And here’s the result—look at this conference.”</p>



<p>The Dreamforce conference generated about $90 million for the local San Francisco business community, and brought over 40,000 people to a city whose in-office population remains 60% below pre-pandemic levels, per the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/dreamforce-s-f-big-crowds-openai-sam-altman-ai-18360762.php#:~:text=Making%20attendees%20feel%20safe%20and,%25%20below%20pre%2Dpandemic%20levels." target="_self" rel=""><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></a>. That means even if they do show up to company headquarters three days per week, Benioff’s employees will be the anomaly.&nbsp;</p></div><div id="text1_wrapper" data-cy="subscriptionPlea">

<p dir="auto">Yazi automatically selects the appropriate preview method for you, based on the priority from top to bottom.
That's relying on the <code>$TERM</code>, <code>$TERM_PROGRAM</code>, and <code>$XDG_SESSION_TYPE</code> variables, make sure you don't overwrite them by mistake!</p>
<p dir="auto">For instance, if your terminal is Alacritty, which doesn't support displaying images itself, but you are running on an X11/Wayland environment,
it will automatically use the "Window system protocol" to display images -- this requires you to have <a href="https://github.com/jstkdng/ueberzugpp">Überzug++</a> installed.</p>

<!-- cache hit 80:single/related:74e749690e395b83c7bb0b10280b925f --><!-- empty -->
<p>Yesterday, some of the biggest textbook publishers <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cengage-v-LibGen-9-14-2023-Complaint.pdf">sued</a> Library Genesis, an illegal shadow library that publishers accused of "extensive violations of federal copyright law."</p>
<p>Publishers suing include Cengage Learning, Macmillan Learning, McGraw Hill, and Pearson Education. They claimed that Library Genesis (aka Libgen) is operated by unknown individuals based outside the United States, who know that the shadow library is "one of the largest, most notorious, and far-reaching infringement operations in the world" and intentionally violate copyright laws with "absolutely no legal justification for what they do."</p>
<p>According to publishers, Libgen offers free downloads for over 20,000 books that the publishers never authorized Libgen to distribute. They claimed that Libgen is "a massive piracy effort" and noted that their complaint may be updated if more infringed works are found. This vast infringement is causing publishers and authors serious financial and creative harm, publishers alleged.</p>
<p>"The Libgen sites deprive plaintiffs and their authors of income from their creative works, devalue the textbook market and plaintiffs’ works, and may cause plaintiffs to cease publishing certain works," the complaint said.</p>
<p>This is not the first lawsuit to go after Libgen, and if history repeats, it likely won't be the last. <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/publishers-lawsuit-accuses-libgen-of-staggering-copyright-infringement-230915/">TorrentFreak reported</a> that after the publisher Elsevier sued Libgen in 2015, a court ordered Libgen to shut down. But after briefly disappearing, Libgen popped back up and has been online ever since, operating in defiance of that order—as well as court orders "in several countries, including Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and the United Kingdom," publishers' complaint filed yesterday said. Those countries even tried ordering "Internet service providers to block access to Libgen Sites as a result of infringement actions," publishers said, all seemingly to no avail.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>It's hard to say if the new lawsuit will have better luck forcing Libgen offline. Publishers have asked a US district court in New York to order Libgen to pay damages that <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/publishers-lawsuit-accuses-libgen-of-staggering-copyright-infringement-230915/">TorrentFreak estimated</a> could exceed $30 million. They also want an order blocking Libgen from any future or ongoing infringement, an accounting and disgorgement of Libgen's profits, the destruction of all Libgen's copies of infringed works, and an order forcing all of Libgen's domain names to either be transferred to publishers or deleted.</p>
<h2>Anonymity is key to Libgen's success</h2>
<p>According to Similarweb data cited in the complaint, Libgen attracted "an average of over 9 million visitors per month from the United States" from March through May 2023. This includes tons of students whom publishers claimed are "bombarded with messages to use Libgen sites" on social media rather than paying full price for textbooks. This, publishers claimed, devalues the textbook market and caused a "substantial decline in revenue from sales."</p>
<p>Instead of paying publishers to distribute books like a real library does, the complaint alleged, Libgen profits off pirated works by running advertisements alongside e-book downloads for things like online games and browser extensions. Sometimes Libgen's ads, publishers claimed, "appear to be phishing attempts, which can result in users downloading a virus or other malicious program onto their computers." Libgen also fields donations from users, reporting that it has raised $182,540 so far in 2023, the complaint noted.</p>
<p>Publishers said the key to Libgen's success as a pirate website is its carefully guarded anonymity. Libgen staff, the publishers alleged, hide behind usernames like "librarian" or "bookwarrior" and rely "on proxy services that specifically conceal website operators’ identifying information." As a business, Libgen never provides names or addresses as contact information, and when they register for new domains, they use registrars that "keep registrant information private and/or registrant proxy services."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>So far, they've proven seemingly impossible to unmask, but Libgen's operators "are believed to reside outside of the United States at unknown foreign locations," the complaint said. But while Libgen staff remains anonymous, publishers know that they also "rely on US companies as intermediaries to operate the sites," and those companies could help disable the operation. Those companies include Cloudflare, Protocol Labs, Namecheap, and Google, which publishers claimed help to enable Libgen's file-sharing, proxy services, domain registrations, and search engine services.</p>
<p>Thanks in part to these US companies, Libgen operators can "rely on the anonymity of the Internet and their overseas locations to hide their names and addresses and frustrate enforcement efforts against them," publishers alleged.</p>
<p>Publishers hope their lawsuit will finally end years of Libgen's alleged mass copyright infringement, but shadow libraries like Libgen have proven resilient through multiple attacks from the highest levels of US law enforcement. Even when the US government <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/feds-arrest-russians-accused-of-running-the-largest-pirated-ebook-library/">arrested operators of another shadow library called Z-Library</a> last year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/z-library-returns-aims-to-avoid-seizures-by-giving-each-user-a-secret-url/">Z-Library returned</a> a few months later and found a way to continue operating <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/us-seizes-z-library-login-domain-but-secret-urls-for-each-user-remain-active/">after the US seized its login domain</a>.</p>
<p>Ars could not immediately reach publishers' lawyers or Libgen for comment. [<strong>Update:</strong> Publishers' lawyer Matthew Oppenheim told Ars that Libgen is a "thieves' den" of illegal books, and "there is no question" that Libgen's conduct is "massively illegal." Oppenheim said that "really, the only question is why it's been allowed to exist this long." He also said that it's possible that US companies may not realize that they are aiding Libgen's infringement, but publishers hope that when they "are confronted" with the fact "that this library is massively illegal, that hopefully they will voluntarily do the right thing" and cut off Libgen.]</p>

                        <div>
            <p>A new type of vaccine developed by researchers at the University of Chicago’s Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering (PME) has shown in the lab setting that it can completely reverse autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes— all without shutting down the rest of the immune system.</p>
<p>A typical vaccine teaches the human immune system to recognize a virus or bacteria as an enemy that should be attacked. The new “inverse vaccine” does just the opposite: it removes the immune system’s memory of one molecule. While such immune memory erasure would be unwanted for infectious diseases, it can stop autoimmune reactions like those seen in multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, or rheumatoid arthritis, in which the immune system attacks a person’s healthy tissues.</p>
<p>The inverse vaccine,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01086-2">described in&nbsp;<em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em></a>, takes advantage of how the liver naturally marks molecules from broken-down cells with “do not attack” flags to prevent autoimmune reactions to cells that die by natural processes. PME researchers coupled an antigen — a molecule being attacked by the immune system— with a molecule resembling a fragment of an aged cell that the liver would recognize as friend, rather than foe. The team showed how the vaccine could successfully stop the autoimmune reaction associated with a multiple-sclerosis-like disease.</p>
<p>“In the past, we showed that we could use this approach to prevent autoimmunity,” said Jeffrey Hubbell, the Eugene Bell Professor in Tissue Engineering and lead author of the new paper. “But what is so exciting about this work is that we have shown that we can treat diseases like multiple sclerosis after there is already ongoing inflammation, which is more useful in a real-world context.”</p>

          </div>
        
                  
                                <div>
            <h3><strong>Unwinding an immune response</strong></h3>
<p>The job of the immune system’s T cells is to recognize unwanted cells and molecules — from viruses and bacteria to cancers — as foreign to the body and get rid of them. Once T cells launch an initial attack against an antigen, they retain a memory of the invader to eliminate it more quickly in the future.</p>
<p>T cells can make mistakes, however, and recognize healthy cells as foreign. In people with multiple sclerosis, for instance, T cells mount an attack against myelin, the protective coating around nerves.</p>
<p>Hubbell and his colleagues knew that the body has a mechanism for ensuring that immune reactions don’t occur in response to every damaged cell in the body — a phenomenon known as peripheral immune tolerance, which is carried out in the liver. They discovered in recent years that tagging molecules with a sugar known as N-acetylgalactosamine (pGal) could mimic this process, sending the molecules to the liver where tolerance to them develops.</p>
<p>“The idea is that we can attach any molecule we want to pGal and it will teach the immune system to tolerate it,” explained Hubbell. “Rather than rev up immunity as with a vaccine, we can tamp it down in a very specific way with an inverse vaccine.”</p>

          </div>
        
                  
                                <div>
            <p>In the new study, the researchers focused on a multiple-sclerosis-like disease in which the immune system attacks myelin, leading to weakness and numbness, loss of vision and, eventually mobility problems and paralysis. The team linked myelin proteins to pGal and tested the effect of the new inverse vaccine. The immune system, they found, stopped attacking myelin, allowing nerves to function correctly again and reversing symptoms of disease in animals.</p>
<p>In a series of other experiments, the scientists showed that the same approach worked to minimize other ongoing immune reactions.</p>
<h3><strong>Toward clinical trials</strong></h3>
<p>Today, autoimmune diseases are generally treated with drugs that broadly shut down the immune system.</p>
<p>“These treatments can be very effective, but you’re also blocking the immune responses necessary to fight off infections and so there are a lot of side effects,” said Hubbell. “If we could treat patients with an inverse vaccine instead, it could be much more specific and lead to fewer side effects.”</p>

          </div>
        
                  
                                <div>
            <p>Initial phase I safety trials of a glycosylation-modified antigen therapy based on this preclinical work have already been carried out in people with celiac disease, an autoimmune disease that is associated with eating wheat, barley and rye, and phase I safety trials are under way in multiple sclerosis. Those trials are conducted by the pharmaceutical company Anokion SA, which helped fund the new work and which Hubbell cofounded and is a consultant, board member, and equity holder. The Alper Family Foundation also helped fund the research.</p>
<p>“There are no clinically approved inverse vaccines yet, but we’re incredibly excited about moving this technology forward,” says Hubbell.</p>

<h2>2006 - Present</h2>

<p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/pvc-pipe.jpg"><img width="145" height="150" alt="Thai blue PVC water pipe" src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/pvc-pipe_t.jpg"></a>What can't you do with PVC
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride">Polyvinyl
Chloride</a>) pipe? The ubiquitous blue PVC water pipe can be seen
along most streets here and appears to be one of Thailand's most
abundant un-natural resources.  A wide variety of different <a href="http://www.thaipipe.com/product/index.php?pid=1&amp;sid=1&amp;ssid=1">connectors</a> are available 
and apart from carrying water it is also used as a cheap construction

</p><p>Of course on the Internet you can also find some other very cool
and creative things made from (non-blue) PVC pipe including: Halloween
costumes like Ben

<p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/shooter.jpg"><img width="177" height="150" alt="PVC marshmallowshooter" src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/shooter_t.jpg"></a></p><p>This was the
project that started my love affair with blue PVC pipe.  I had seen
the <a href="http://www.howtoons.com/toon/the-infamous-marshmallow-shooter/">blueprints</a>
for this marshmallow shooter while I was in Australia but the fittings
were prohibitively expensive (see the image right).  Fortunately they
are very affordable here in Thailand.  The shooter is constructed from
approximately 60cm (2') of 18mm (1/2") pipe, 2 x T-pieces, 2 x
elbows, 2 x end caps.

</p><p>Unfortunately there are no mini- marshmallows here in
Thailand and hence no ammunition!  We brought two bags with us which
were exhausted all too soon and the guns have since remained silent
(although we haven't yet tried to beat them into
PVC <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swords_to_ploughshares">ploughshares</a>).

</p><p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/pearl-tea.jpg"><img width="80" height="150" alt="pearl tea orbubble tea" src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/pearl-tea_t.jpg"></a></p><p>Fortunately in Thailand there is a drink called
"<a href="http://www.thai-language.com/id/216662">cha muk</a>" or
"pearl milk tea" - I think it's known as bubble tea in other
countries.  Cha muk comes in a variety of flavours, it's served with a
straw that is about 1cm in diameter, and it contains black tapioca
balls (pearls).  

</p><p>Invariably when you get to the end of your drink
you have a supply of pearls left over and my son and I discovered that
the straws make wonderful pearl shooters.  Using the same blow-gun
principle as the marshmallow shooter, you can shoot tapioca pearls at
each other and there's no denying a hit because they stick in a way
that would make you think they were made from velcro.  Not only is
this useful as evidence but you can also pull them off and use them to
re-load in the midst of battle!<br>

</p><p>This is perhaps the most obvious use for PVC water pipe -
plumbing!  When you rent a house in Thailand, often it doesn't even
come with the kitchen sink.  When we moved in my wife decided where
she wanted the sink to go and armed with my new found PVC pipe skills
that I acquired making the <a href="#marshmallow-shooter">marshmallow
shooter</a> I plumbed water to the tap.

</p><p>I was a little reluctant to go smacking holes in the wall to find a
drainage pipe so for a number of months we kept a bucket under the
sink.  My father had no such qualms, however, and when they came to
visit he plumbed the drainage for us.

</p><p>I made a matching pair of these indoor soccer goals for my son using some 18mm (1/2") pipe, 2 x T-Pieces and 6 x elbows.

<a name="cricket"><h2>Cricket Wicket</h2></a>

<p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/cricket.jpg"><img width="140" height="150" alt="A Thai university students playing cricket with a PVC cricket wicket" src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/cricket_t.jpg"></a>
</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket">Cricket</a> (not to be confused with <a href="http://hhgproject.org/entries/brockianultracricket.html">Brockian Ultra-Cricket</a>) is Australia's national sport played with a bat, a ball, and two wickets.  This is a PVC wicket I made for <a href="http://www.australiaday.com.au/">Australia Day</a> 2007 using some 25mm (1") pipe, 6 x T-pieces, and 2 x elbows.  Some people would consider using a wicket like this to be cheating because the bails (two horizontal pieces that balance on top of the three upright stumps) are glued on!

</p><p>Continuing with the sports theme, this is a basketball hoop I made so that my son could practise Basketball.  I found some dimensions on the Internet and made the ring using 18mm (1/2") pipe, 6 x T-pieces, and 12 x 45-degree elbows.  The backboard is a non-regulation size piece of plywood that we found lying around and we used green duct tape for the markings. 

</p><p>Although the ring isn't strong enough to hang off, the side supports make it robust enough for normal play.  They also give it a very Star Trek feel and I think the ring looks not unlike the <a href="http://www.shipschematics.net/cgi-bin/startrek/federation.cgi?Frigate">NCC-31911 Saratoga</a>.

</p><p>This is perhaps the most straight forward use for PVC pipe on this page.  I made some shelf supports for the Computer Science section of our home library using some 20mm (3/4") pipe, 0 x T-pieces, 0 x elbows, and 0 x end caps.

always been a fan of the
movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084827/">Tron</a> and this
is a controller I made out of PVC pipe to play the lightcycle racing
game <a href="http://www.gltron.org/">GL-Tron</a>.  The controller is
made from 3 sections of 18mm (1/2") pipe, 2 x 25mm to 18mm
(1" to 1/2") reducers, 2 x custom motorbike hand-grips, 4 x
push-buttons, and a mercury switch which are connected to a computer
via a hacked USB joystick.

</p><p>You can find more details about how I made the controller on
<a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/tron-controller/">this project page</a> and I've also

</p><p>A university student who played with
the <a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/tron-controller/">PVC Water Pipe Tron Controller</a>,
described above, said "That's OK but I like to play driving
games".  It got me thinking and over the next week I spent my
evenings building a PVC racing car controller - essentially a
wheel-less, PVC go-kart frame connected to the computer via a hacked
USB joystick.

students who saw the first car wanted to know how it all worked and
six of them came around one Saturday and we spent the whole day
hacking joysticks and building a second car. By connecting them both
to a laptop and a data projector we were able to play

</p><p>The white office table I used for
the <a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/virtual-pinball/">virtual pinball machine</a> wasn't
high enough to be played comfortably.  Originally, I used some bricks
to raise the table the more pinball-like height of 90cm (35") but
then I decided that some PVC leg extensions would be somewhat more
portable.  

</p><p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/pvc-legs.jpg"><img width="253" height="150" alt="PVC legextensions for the virtual pinball table" src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/pvc-legs_t.jpg"></a></p><p>Extensions for each end of
the table were constructed using 18mm (1/2") pipe, 2 x
T-Pieces, 2 x end caps, 2 x 40mm to 18mm (1 &amp;
1/2" to 1/2") reducers and 2 x short lengths of 40mm (1 &amp; 1/2")
pipe.  The horizontal bars aren't glued so the extensions can be
fitted to tables with different dimensions by simply cutting some more
18mm pipe to the appropriate length.

</p><p>If you look carefully you can see the legs in action around
the 37 second mark in video:

</p><p>Both the <a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/virtual-pinball/">virtual pinball
table</a> and
the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxhJAUzWob8">Plasma Pong
table</a> require vertically mounted data projectors.  The virtual
pinball table has made appearances at six different venues and as a
result I now have a growing collection of PVC cages used to suspend a
number of different projectors beneath stairs, air-conditioners and
various ceilings.

</p><p>Data projectors are expensive and nothing dampens a good game of
pinball more than a data projector unexpectedly crashing on to the
table (especially if it's not yours!).  Make sure everything is glued
securely and use liberal amounts of duct tape and cable-ties for
backup.  Be careful not to obstruct air inlets/outlets and if you are
borrowing a friends projector make sure you let them know what you
intend doing with it first!

</p><p>In Thailand a lot of people use USB powered cooling pads
underneath their notepad/laptop computers.  This is a laptop stand I
built using some 18mm (1/2") pipe, 1 x T-piece, and 2 x elbows
- partially to aid air flow but mostly to hold my screen up because
the spring in the hinge has broken.  

</p><p>As straightforward as this stand looks, the "L"-shaped upright
section is actually part of an air-conditioner mount for a data projector that I made for one of the
<a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/virtual-pinball/">virtual pinball table</a>
installations. The T-piece isn't glued and so in a small way (a very,
very small way) I like to think that if the air-conditioning mount were
ever needed again then the parts could re-combine in
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltron">Voltron</a>

This is a Wiimote mount I built using a length of 35mm (1 and 1/4") pipe, some 18mm (1/2") pipe, 3 x T-pieces, and 4 x elbows.  

</p><p>The 35mm pipe has been cut so that it fits nicely into the
ridges down the side of the Wiimote which holds it securely.  This is
screwed onto a T-Piece which has also had its top cut off.  The joint
between the two topmost elbows is not glued so the angle of the top
section can be adjusted.<br>

<p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/zapper.jpg"><img width="179" height="150" alt="DIY PVC and broken glue-gun Wii-zapper" src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/zapper_t.jpg"></a>
</p><p>This is yet another DIY <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/wii/what/accessories/zapper/">Wii Zapper</a> that I built using some 35mm (1 and 1/4") pipe, some acrylic, a cable tie, and a broken hot-melt glue-gun. While perhaps not as cool as a <a href="http://www.chungdha.com/2008/01/diy-wii-gun.html">cereal box</a>, <a href="http://www.gamegrep.com/guides/6274-make_your_own_lego_zapper/">Lego</a>, <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/WeeP_5_Advanced_Zapper/">MP5</a>, or <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/usermovies/272721.html">AK47</a> Wii Zapper, it gets the job done. 

</p><p>The original trigger mechanism in the broken hot-melt glue-gun is
designed to feed glue forward but I needed a mechanism that would pull
back on the "B" button underneath the Wiimote.  I cut the handle off
of the old glue-gun and made a custom red acrylic trigger that used
the original pivot point and had a slot in the top for a cable tie.

</p><p>The cable tie feeds through a slot in the bottom of the 35mm pipe
which has been cut in the same manner as
the <a href="#wiimote">Wiimote Holder</a> described above.  The cable
tie lies beneath the Wiimote and when the trigger is squeezed it pulls
back on the "B" button.  Two small pieces of PVC glued at the back of
the pipe stop the Wiimote from sliding backwards and a another small
piece glued beneath the "B" button keeps the cable tie at the correct
height.  A second (working) glue-gun was used to glue the handle to
the bottom of the pipe.

people to play <a href="http://www.gltron.org/">GL-Tron</a> using real
motorbikes.  The bikes are connected to the game using TACT switches
mounted on sections of 25mm (1") pipe for the turn buttons.
These sections are simply cable-tied onto the front of the motorbike
handlebars and the players squeeze the buttons with their index
fingers to turn left or right. A mercury switch is also mounted on the right handlebar so the
accelerator can be used to provide boost within the game and up to
four bikes can be connected to the computer via a
single <a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/ddr-pad#joystick-hacking">hacked USB joystick</a>.

</p><p>This is a music stand made from three different sizes of pipe.
The top section is made from one 43cm (17") length of 35mm (1 and
1/4") pipe which is cut in half to hold the base of the music.
This is attached using 3 screws to the rest of the top which is made
from 18mm (1/2") pipe, 3 x T-Pieces, 6 x elbows, 2 x 45-degree
elbows, and 1 x male threaded connector.  The joint between the two
topmost elbows behind the music is not glued so that the angle of the
music can be adjusted and the threaded connector allows the base to be
removed for storage.

</p><p>The base is made from 20mm (3/4") pipe, 3 x T-pieces and 4 x
connector off-cuts (to stabilise the end of each leg), 1 x 20mm to
18mm (3/4" to 1/2") reducer, and 1 x 18mm female
threaded connector.  Since making the stand I've thought of a number
of possible improvements on the design including height adjustment but
overall I'm pleased with how this first version came out.

</p><p>The Dean of Science asked if I could make something fun for
visitors to play with at <a href="http://www.payap.ac.th/">Payap
University</a>'s 35th Anniversary celebrations.  I had been wanting to
make some controllers to play the 1994 arcade
game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_Bobble">Puzzle
Bobble</a> (also known as Bust-a-Move) that worked like the
coffee-grinder/pedestal winches that racing yachts use (see the image
below) - so this was the perfect opportunity.

</p><p>The pedestal was made from 25mm (1") pipe using 2 x T-Pieces,
3 x elbows and 2 x end caps, with the elbows forming a simple G-clamp to hold
it to the table (the connection at the tables edge is not
glued so that it can be easily removed).  The crank is made from 18mm
(1/2") pipe using 4 x elbows, and 2 x end caps, with 2 x 20mm
(3/4") joiners for the hand-grips which can rotate freely.
 
</p><p>A stripped down optical mouse, housed in
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clorets">Clorets</a> container
(see the orange plastic box below), acts as a rotation sensor and an
arcade-style button is wired as the left mouse button.  As you rotate
the crank a monster in the game turns a wheel to aim the bubble gun.
Pressing the button launches the bubble and if three or more of the
same colour connect then they pop and disappear.  It's a lot of fun,
especially playing against someone else.

but more recently I have started to take my health more seriously.
Now walking or running on a treadmill is great but the physical
benefits need to be traded off against the time it takes - time that
could be spent doing something else like surfing the web, or watching
a movie.  Well not anymore!  Now you can exercise and be a geek at the
same time with the amazing netbook treadmill hook!

</p><p>The hook is made from 40cm (16") of 18mm (1/2") pipe, 6 x
elbows, 2 x T-pieces, and 2 small rings of 25mm (1") pipe.  The
pipe sections are positioned under the netbook so that they don't
cover any of the vents and the two ring sections prevent any possible
lifting of the netbook's front edge.

</p><p>The hook on the treadmill and the netbook on the hook both seemed
to be quite secure but as an added precaution I also attached some
small sections of rubber grip mat using hot-melt glue.  The truly
paranoid could also add a velcro strap that loops underneath the hook
and over the netbook at the base of the screen.

</p><p>I'm currently working on a simple trackball hack made from a
plastic roll-on deodorant ball (which looks very cool when lit by
LEDs) and an optical mouse which I hope will be easier to use while
walking/running than a touch-pad.  Stay tuned!

built in response to all of the CDs/DVDs/CD-ROMs/DVD-ROMs I find lying
around our house.  I think what I really want is some sort
of <a href="http://www.centurion-cd.com/">storage robot</a> that could
hold all of my discs and just "hand" me the one I want in response to
a search query or mount it in a drive for me.  Alternatively a robot
that could convert and backup all my physical media to a large enough
hard drive would be really cool (you can
actually <a href="http://www.computeraudiophile.com/content/Ripping-CDs-Style-GD3-Review">buy
these</a> or <a href="http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/tech/changer.html">build your own</a>).

  
</p><p>The racks are made from 10mmm (1/4") pipe which fits the
center hole on the discs perfectly and I allowed approximately 20cm
(8") between spindles.  I made one for holding movies and
CDs with six spindles (using 8 x T-pieces, 4 x elbows and around 2.6m
(8'6") of pipe) and one for software with four spindles (using 4
x T-pieces and 4 x elbows). See the pictures below. If you choose a
suitably colourful disc for the top of each stack then it looks like a
poor
man's <a href="http://www.beoworld.org/prod_details.asp?pid=954">BeoSound
9000</a>.

</p>

<p>The grey PVC pipe is water pipe but it's normally used for
agricultural irrigation and low-pressure applications (rather than
storage racks!). The same size pipe and fittings are also available in
yellow which is for electrical and telephone cabling but my kids voted
for the grey colour.

</p><p>Each of the spindles holds about 50 discs so the CD/DVD rack holds
about 300 discs while the software rack holds about 200 discs.  I
wanted to have enough room on each spindle so you could browse the
discs without having to
play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">towers of
Hanoi</a> but I realise now that I should have included at least one
extra spindle on the rack for movies and CDs - it's already too full!

nightstand/shelves" src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/assembled_t.jpg"></a>There was a gap
next to my side of the bed that would constantly fill with books and
papers so I decided that I needed some bedside shelves - so I could
accumulate even more books and papers.  These 3-tier shelves are made
from 20mm (3/4") PVC water pipe using 12 x T-pieces (4 per
shelf), 2 lengths of pipe that connect the front and rear sections, 4
lengths of pipe to connect the sides and 8 lengths of pipe to separate
the tiers.

</p><p>The three shelves are pieces of 6mm
(appox. 1/4") <a href="http://www.design-technology.org/mdf.htm">medium
density fibreboard</a>(MDF) with 35mm (1.4") squares cut into each
corner.  Unlike most of my projects I used a small hammer to simply
tap the pipes and connectors together instead of gluing them.  The
shelves just sit in place and help keep the stand square.  

</p><p>If you are planning on making a free-standing shelf then I would
recommend gluing the pieces and adding one extra shelf so that there
is another set of pipes between the front and rear faces.  This shelf
was made to fit into a specific space so it doesn't have any room to
move and does the job very well.  You can see a picture of it in place
below.

In the scene, the legs were poking out the end of stretcher to imply that someone was being carried.

</p><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Santilli">Ray Santilli</a>-esque pictures below show the construction of the legs which are made from 18mm (1/2") PVC pipe using 3 x T-pieces and 2 x elbows. The "hips" are 30cm (approx. 11&amp;3/4") wide with an overall height of 90cm (approx. 35&amp;1/2").  I used yellow electrical conduit pipe for the legs simply because I had two lengths on hand that were long enough. The center T-piece in the hips would allow a torso to be attached but this was never used.

</p><p>A friend had given me some old UV-damaged <a href="http://www.poolcenter.com/pooltoys_noodles_water_logs.htm">pool noodles</a> and I used these to pad out the ankles and calves.  A pair of thick socks hold the pool noodle sections in place and a pair of pants and some shoes complete the illusion.

<a name="mario-kart"><h2>Mario Kart Steering Wheel</h2></a>

<p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/mario-kart-wheel.jpg"><img width="108" height="150" alt="PVC pipe Wii remote holder for playing Mario Kart." src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/mario-kart-wheel_t.jpg"></a>This project is a little late to the party - if you will excuse the pun (oh wait, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Party_8">wrong game</a>!) - but I recently thought it might be fun to make a Wii-mote holder for playing <a href="http://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_Wii">Mario Kart</a> that gives you a fixed axis of rotation so it feels more like driving.  

</p><p>There are a large number of Wii-mote driving accessories you can buy like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote#Wii_Wheel">Wii Wheel</a> or DIY versions like <a href="http://gizmodo.com/378223/diy-wii-wheel-leaves-little-to-be-desired">this one</a>.  Someone also built this ingenious <a href="http://youtu.be/L5HT2QK_d_I">self-centering trainer</a> and it should be possible to re-use the rubber-band powered righting mechanism from the <a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc-cars/">PVC cars</a> to do something similar with this design. 

</p><p>The design consists of two main parts: the "steering wheel" that holds the Wii-mote and a pedestal that supports the wheel.  The part of the wheel that holds the actual Wii-mote is made from a 14cm (5 &amp; 1/2") length of 35mm (1 &amp; 1/4") pipe with a section cut out (the same method is used to hold the Wii-mote in the <a href="#wiimote">Wii-mote Holder</a> and <a href="#zapper">DIY Wii Zapper</a> projects described above).  This is screwed onto the rest of the wheel mechanism which is made from:
</p><ul> 
  <li>67cm (26 &amp; 1/2") of 18mm (1/2") PVC pipe,</li> 
  <li>4 x 45-degree bends,</li> 
  <li>3 x T-pieces,</li> 
  <li>2 x elbows,</li> 
  <li>1 x 4-way piece, and</li> 
  <li>1 x end-cap.</li> 
</ul>

<p>The top half of one of the T-Pieces is cut in half and this is the mounting point for the 35mm pipe section which is attached using 2 x 2cm (3/4") screws (see the pictures below). The end-cap shouldn't be glued and it can simply be pushed onto the back of the wheel assembly after it is inserted into the top of the pedestal but the rest of the 18mm parts should be glued together.

</p><p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/with-wii.jpg"><img width="138" height="150" alt="Front view with Wii remote in place." src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/with-wii_t.jpg"></a>
<a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/front-view.jpg"><img width="154" height="150" alt="Front view without Wii remote" src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/front-view_t.jpg"></a>
<a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/top-view.jpg"><img width="186" height="150" alt="Top view of the &quot;wheel&quot; assembly." src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/top-view_t.jpg"></a>
</p>

<p>The pedestal actually consists of two parts - a thicker top section that looks like a sledge-hammer which has a mounting point for the wheel assembly, and a thinner lower section that is shaped like the letter 'T' (in the middle of the picture below left) which slides into the top section.  The top section of the pedestal is made from:
</p><ul>
  <li>42cm (approx. 16 &amp; 1/2") of 25mm (1") pipe,</li> 
  <li>1 x 25mm T-piece, and</li> 
  <li>2 x 20mm (3/4") T-pieces.</li>  
</ul>

<p>The centers of the two smaller 20mm T-pieces are cut out and glued inside the two opposite ends of the 25mm T-piece to reduce the internal diameter so that the wheel will fit smoothly and turn without too much play (for more details see the description of <a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/coffee-grinder/#pedestal">Coffee Grinder Puzzle Bobble</a> which uses the same technique for its pedestal).

</p><p>The 'T'-shaped lower half of the pedestal is made from:
</p><ul> 
  <li>102cm (40") of 20mm pipe,</li>
  <li>1 x 20mm T-piece, and</li> 
  <li>2 x end-caps (although I just used two off-cuts from the 20mm T-pieces
that were glued inside the top part of the pedestal).</li>
</ul>  

<p>The center part of the 'T' is 62cm long and the two sides are each 20cm long.

</p><p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/parts.jpg"><img width="182" height="150" alt="The three parts of the &quot;wheel&quot;." src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/parts_t.jpg"></a>
<a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/stand-top.jpg"><img width="170" height="150" alt="Top part of the pedestal." src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/stand-top_t.jpg"></a>
<a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/join.jpg"><img width="140" height="150" alt="Close-up showing additional tabs to help stop movement." src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/join_t.jpg"></a>
</p>

<p>Drill three or four holes in the lower T-shaped part of the pedestal perpendicular to the sides of the 'T' (see the left picture above). Then drill a hole parallel to the wheel's axis through the top pedestal section (about 12cm (4 &amp; 1/2") from the end of the pipe) as in the middle picture above.  You can then use a 55mm (2 &amp; 1/4") long bolt and wing-nut to adjust the height of the pedestal.  

</p><p>I also glued a small section of 25mm pipe to the end of the pipe on the outside of the lower part of the pedestal and another section on the inside of the top part of the pedestal (see the picture above right).  The two small pieces can slide past each other when you insert the lower pipe into the upper pipe and they will help reduce the amount of movement between the two pipes.  

</p><p>Having built this Mario Kart Wii-mote holder my son then informed me that the 'B' trigger button underneath the Wii-mote is actually <a href="http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=53215&amp;tab=controls">used for power sliding</a> (although it can be set to happen automatically).  No wonder I keep losing!  Unfortunately with this design you can't access the 'B' trigger button on the bottom of the Wii-mote (which is beneath the D-pad).  You would need to add some other mechanism - perhaps a trigger - that mechanically pushes on the 'B' button when you press it (apparently the Wii Wheel has a button on the back that works like this).

<a name="guitar-stand"><h2>Guitar Stand</h2></a>

<p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/pvc-guitar-stand.jpg"><img width="98" height="150" alt="PVC pipe acoustic guitar stand." src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/pvc-guitar-stand_t.jpg"></a>This is a stand I made for my acoustic guitar.  One of the guitarists at church had a custom made metal stand with a design that I thought was really cool.  I took a photo of his stand and modified the design to make this PVC pipe version.  

</p><p>The stand is made from 180cm (5'11") of 20mm (3/4") pipe plus 6 x elbows, 4 x T-pieces and 2 x end caps (I actually used some T-Piece offcuts from some of my other projects instead of end caps).  As you place the guitar in the stand it is possible for the bottom of the guitar to catch on the lip of the upside down T-piece that holds the two supporting arms.  To help prevent this I cut a section from an old T-piece offcut and tapered it at one end (see the middle image below).  This is then glued onto the center piece of pipe above the T-piece (see the image below right) so the guitar will now just slide straight over the lip.   

</p><p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/stand-unpainted.jpg"><img width="146" height="150" alt="Front view without Wii remote" src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/stand-unpainted_t.jpg"></a>

</p>

<p>The base with splayed legs is very stable and the side view below will give you an idea of the angle I used on the center support.  I decided to spray paint the stand black so it matches my guitar and I also glued six small pieces of <a href="http://cpc.farnell.com/1/1/14139-grip-mat-45x125cm-77125045-hilka-tools.html">grip mat</a> onto the stand at the points beneath the guitar and where the back of the guitar touches the stand to help prevent any sideways movement.

hard to come by here in Thailand so these are some PVC hockey sticks I
made for a Winter Olympics-themed party where we used some wooden
drink-coasters as pucks for a slapshot shootout competition.

</p><p>PVC is a thermoplastic and I'd seen my father bend large PVC pipes
back home on the farm by heating them over a fire but this is the first
time I have used bent PVC in any of my projects.  You'll find some
great projects online that require bent PVC pipe
like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RSIzMTfX7A">these
snowshoes</a> but before doing this yourself you should follow
some <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/PVC-Its-Great-for-Inventions/">safety
precautions</a>.

</p><p>The sticks are made from 130cm (4'3") lengths of 20mm
(3/4") pipe and I put a mark on the pipe about 22cm (approx. 8
1/2") in from one end for the start of the bend.  Using a gas
stovetop I then moved the end of the pipe backwards and forwards high
above the flame while rotating for about 2 minutes until it became
floppy.  I then placed the pipe down on the floor tiles and flattened
the pipe by pressing on it with a flat-soled rubber shoe (to keep my
hands cool) while also holding the pipe at an angle of about 45
degrees.  After holding for about 30 seconds while the PVC cools, it
then keeps the new shape.

<a name="bzflag-controllers"><h2>Tank-game (BZFlag) Controller</h2></a>

<p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/bzflag-controller.jpg"><img width="106" height="150" alt="Chair with PVC pipe levers for playing BZ-Flag." src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/bzflag-controller_t.jpg"></a> This is a chair I modified with the help of some engineering
students from <a href="http://www.cmu.ac.th/">Chiang Mai University</a>
to play the free online multiplayer 3D tank battle
game <a href="http://bzflag.org/">BZFlag</a>.  As part of an English
camp we ran for the Engineering faculty I held some workshops where we
added PVC pipe levers to the sides of an old chair.  Two optical mice
(mouses?) mounted underneath the chair were used to detect the
rotation of the levers and two buttons (used to fire and re-spawn) were
patched into the left mouse buttons on the mice.

</p><p>The two levers control your in-game tank via skid steering which is
similar to how the original
1980 <a href="http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7059">Battlezone</a>
arcade game worked.  Pushing both levers forward or backward moves the
tank forwards or backwards while pushing the levers in opposite
directions will cause the tank to turn.  I wrote a script
for <a href="http://www.glovepie.org/glovepie.php">GlovePIE</a> that
watched the rotation of the levers as seen by the two optical mice
under the chair.  The script then moved a fake mouse accordingly to
steer the in-game tank.

</p><p>Apart from the chair, the other parts we used are shown in the left
picture below.  The top row of 25mm (1") PVC pipe connectors and
the middle row of 20mm (3/4") T-pieces were used to construct a
mount for the two levers that was screwed underneath the chair (see
the center image below).  The center sections of the 20mm T-pieces
were cut out, sanded down, and then glued inside the horizontal ends
of the two 25mm T-pieces.  This reduces the internal diameter of the
larger T-pieces so that the levers which are made from 18mm
(1/2") pipe (see the picture on the right) fit smoothly inside
but can still rotate.  This is the same method I used to make the
pedestals for the <a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/coffee-grinder/#pedestal">Coffee Grinder
Puzzle Bobble</a> controller and the <a href="#mario-kart">Mario Kart
Steering Wheel</a>.

</p><p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/bzflag-parts.jpg"><img width="160" height="150" alt="Parts used to build the levers and mounts." src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/bzflag-parts_t.jpg"></a>

<a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/bzflag-lever.jpg"><img width="132" height="150" alt="One of the control levers." src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/bzflag-lever_t.jpg"></a>
</p>

<p>To stop the levers from sliding out of the T-pieces mounted
underneath the chair we made two "rotation sleeves" that fit over the
18mm pipe and these were held in place with a single screw.  The
sleeves were constructed from three rings of plastic with the
inner-piece sanded out so the end of the lever could slide through and
the outer piece was made from a 25mm connector off-cut.  We wrapped
some masking tape around the sleeve to increase it's visibility to the
optical mouse (see the left picture below).

</p><p>Before the workshops started I had modified the optical mice by adding
a connector that was patched into the mouse buttons.  We simply
hot-melt glued the mice onto the 25mm T-pieces in a position where
they could "see" the tape-covered rotation sleeve and plugged the
buttons into the connectors on the mice (see the center picture).

</p><p>To build the controller we worked in three teams.  The first team
constructed and added the mount point to the chair while the second
team made the two levers.  I gave the third team a simple text-based
BZFlag world map which they modified so the tanks were playing on a giant
version of the Engineering faculty's logo (see the screen shot below
right).

</p><p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/bzflag-mouse-mounted.jpg"><img width="134" height="150" alt="A modified optical mouse glued above one of the lever rotation sleeves." src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/bzflag-mouse-mounted_t.jpg"></a>

</p>

<p>The controls were a little flaky because the positioning from the
optical mice was relative. For example, if you started with a lever in
the center position and moved it backwards and forwards quickly a number
of times and then returned it to the center it would be in a different
place.  It was still fun to play but required me to add an option to
the script where you could move the levers back to the center
(stopped) position and press a key to re-center the script.  A better
alternative would be to use joystick potentiometers or just
potentiometers which could give you an absolute position for the levers
but this would have also required additional work to provide suitable
lever stops so they couldn't rotate too far.

<a name="whistle"><h2>Train Whistle</h2></a>

<p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/whistle.jpg"><img alt="PVC pipe train whistle." src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/whistle_t.jpg" height="150" width="201"></a>This is a 3-chime PVC pipe train whistle I
made for a friend's son who really
likes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Tank_Engine">Thomas
the Tank Engine.</a>  Our kids had a really nice sounding <a href="http://www.trainparty.com/products/4-tone-wooden-train-whistle.html">wooden whistle</a> when they were young and I thought it should be possible to make one out of PVC pipe.  Sure enough, a quick Google search turned up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l-sLVdjCfI">plenty of information</a> on <a href="http://www.rattlebrained.org/articles/diy-pvc-train-whistle">building PVC train whistles</a>.

</p><p>The three individual whistles are made from 27.5cm (approx. 10
&amp; 4/5"), 25.5cm (10"), and 22.5cm (approx. 8 &amp;
4/5") lengths of 10mm (1/4") grey electrical grade PVC
pipe. I could only find a length of half-round wooden dowel so I used this to
make the <a href="">fipple</a> for each whistle and filled the rest in
with part of a wooden chopstick and hot-melt glue.

The notches (or "windows") are about 3cm in from the end of
the pipe and I
copied <a href="http://www.rattlebrained.org/articles/diy-pvc-train-whistle">this
idea</a> for mounting the tubes so they could all be blown together.
More hot-melt glue was used to attach the two acrylic discs but this
glue was too hot for the plastic water bottle mouthpiece which I
sealed with two-part epoxy resin instead.  The end of each pipe was
plugged using two small pieces of the half-round dowel glued back to
back and sanded to fit.

</p><p><a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/window.jpg"><img alt="Close up of the whistle's notch or &quot;window&quot;" src="https://tomtilley.net/projects/pvc/images/window_t.jpg" height="150" width="157"></a>

</p>

<p>I picked my pipe lengths at random and originally intended to cut
them or plug them with varying lengths of dowel
to <a href="http://atsf.railfan.net/airhorns/">tune them</a>.  Using
the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cohortor.gstrings&amp;hl=en">Tuner
- gStrings</a> app on my phone I checked the pitch of the whistles
which were very close to F, G, and A (from longest to shortest).
However, in the end I was happy with how the completed whistle sounded
so I stayed with the original lengths. Here's what the whistle sounds
like:

This is a trident I made as a prop for one of the three photoshoots I did in early 2018 for the <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/products/books/gamers-edition-2019/">Guinness World Record: Gamer's Edition 2019</a>.   Guinness engaged the services of the very talented <a href="http://www.macmahonimages.com/">Ben MacMahon</a> for the photography and he was great to work with.  <a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/game-and-watch/images/Thomas_Tilley-engineer.jpg">This is the shot</a> they chose to use in the book and we also did a <a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/game-and-watch/images/Thomas_Tilley-poolside.jpg">poolside shoot</a> 

</p><p>My wife and I visited Thailand at the start of 2018 and I brought some 18mm (1/2") Thai PVC water pipe and fittings back to Australia with me to build the trident.  The head of the trident is made of 4 x 45 degree elbows and one 4-way piece and the overall height is 181cm (6').  I painted it using the same matte black acrylic paint I used for the <a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/game-and-watch/#helmet">diving helmet</a> and the shaft breaks into two pieces so it fits comfortably into our car.  A small insert joins the two pieces together.</p>

<p>The middle picture below shows the final image from this shoot but we didn't want to risk taking (or powering!) <a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/game-and-watch"></a>the World's largest playable Game &amp; Watch in the water.  To make the shot possible I built a stand-in out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrugated_plastic">corrugated plastic</a> (commonly known as "corflute" in Australia or "future board" in Thailand) with the same dimensions as the giant version of the game.  The edges were painted using the same high gloss enamel paint as the orginal and this made it easier for Ben to later photoshop a studio shot he took of the giant Game &amp; Watch's face onto the stand-in.

<p>My lovely wife was kind enough to stand in the water and hold the game's stunt double during the photoshoot (you can see her legs poking out at the bottom in the last photo above).  Ben also brought a team along to help on the day which included three people holding remotely triggered flashes and someone on the beach who would shout out "raise!" when a wave was coming so my wife could safely lift the stand-in out of the way.  There were two PVC handles on the back of the stand-in which was made in two halves so it would <a href="https://tomtilley.net/projects/game-and-watch/#MFAdl">fit in the back of the car</a>.</p>

</p>

<p>We took the photo at the very photogenic <a href="https://southaustralia.com/products/fleurieu-peninsula/attraction/port-willunga-beach">Port Willunga Beach</a> and we're not sure what the other people on the beach - a photography club and a Japanese couple having wedding photographs - thought we were doing!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Google is one of the biggest tech companies in existence, but its empire is built on one little white search bar, and the US Justice Department has just launched what might be one of the biggest challenges it’s ever faced. In one of the largest antitrust trials in recent memory, the government argues that Google owes its dominance not simply to a good design but to a series of coercive deals that have let the search engine market stagnate —&nbsp;while Google complains it’s being punished for success.</p><p>For all that, the trial began quietly. I got to the courthouse around sunrise for the start of <em>US v. Google</em>, worried I’d find a line around the corner. Instead, the sidewalk was nearly empty, populated by a handful of similarly cautious early arrivals. “I thought there’d be more people,” one said while we waited in the muggy DC air. In the hours that followed, a small crowd emerged —&nbsp;filling the courtroom and spilling into an overflow room and two dedicated media rooms for journalists. A man in an Uncle Pennybags-style top hat, fake mustache, and monocle wandered the halls of the courtroom; “I’m here to highlight Google’s monopoly and provide moral support as a fellow billionaire,” he told me between mustache twirls. He admitted he might not be there to keep up the joke every day — it’s a 10-week trial, he conceded, and “I have a job.”</p><p>The case against Google is relatively straightforward and also potentially explosive. The Justice Department argues that around 2010, Google began using anti-competitive tactics to maintain an overwhelming search engine monopoly. Already dominant over alternatives like Bing and Yahoo, it cemented its position with the “power of defaults,” striking deals that put Google’s product front and center. That included paying Apple and Mozilla to make Google the default engine in Safari and Firefox and requiring that Android manufacturers prominently display a Google search widget on phones. (That agreement is called the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement or MADA, and it’s been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/21/11477032/android-antitrust-eu-google-play-store">legally contentious</a> in Europe for years.) As it grew, it used vast quantities of search data to improve its engine, creating a feedback loop that — the Justice Department alleges — has made it almost impossible to beat. “This case is about the future of the internet and whether Google Search will ever face meaningful competition,” said attorney Kenneth Dintzer in opening statements.</p><div><p>“This is a monopolist flexing.”</p></div><p><em>US v. Google</em> follows a series of abortive legal attempts to limit the power and growth of America’s biggest tech companies. It’s the Justice Department’s most aggressive action since its 1990s antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft, which established it had shut down competition for web browsers on its dominant Windows system. But this trial kicks off two years after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown">a district judge found</a> Apple could maintain its locked-down iOS ecosystem and two months after Microsoft won a ruling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/11/23779039/microsoft-activision-blizzard-ftc-trial-win">letting it buy Activision Blizzard</a>, continuing a rapid consolidation of the games industry. In both battles, the companies convinced a judge that they weren’t simply trying to lock up a market — they were making decisions that helped consumers, too. They also painted the allegations as disingenuous complaints from fellow tech companies who couldn’t compete fairly: in Apple’s case, the <em>Fortnite </em>publisher Epic, and in Microsoft’s, the rival console maker Sony.</p><p>Google has taken a similar approach. “If Google is prevented from competing, that won’t make Yahoo or DuckDuckGo run faster,” attorney John Schmidtlein said in the company’s opening statement. While the Justice Department has drawn parallels between ’90s Microsoft and modern-day Google, Schmidtlein said that the facts in <em>US v. Google</em> and the antitrust fight over Microsoft’s unloved Internet Explorer browser “could not be more opposite and different,” arguing that people overwhelmingly and proactively choose Google even when they’re given alternatives. Separately, he argued that Google’s default search deals give web browsers much-needed revenue and that its Android agreements help create a viable mobile competitor to iOS.</p><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="The Verge’s logo over a photograph of the Supreme Court" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/376x95/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/384x97/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/415x105/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/480x121/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/540x136/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/640x161/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/750x189/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/828x209/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/1080x273/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/1200x303/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/1440x363/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/1920x484/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/2048x517/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/2400x606/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x757/2400x606/filters:focal(1500x379:1501x380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24915120/image__6_.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p>So far, the Justice Department is combating this argument by focusing on reams of internal communications it obtained during its investigations. It’s zeroed in on memos and emails where Google nakedly lays out the value it gets from being a default search option, as well as messages that allegedly dictate precise terms for how Apple and others could use any non-Google Search-adjacent service. (“Your honor, this is a monopolist flexing,” intoned Dintzer.) Schmidtlein has derided the excerpts as cherry-picked and “out of context.” But whatever they ultimately reveal, the Justice Department’s goal so far is clear: keep the focus on executives talking about how Google’s actions benefit <em>Google</em>, not the consumers it says it’s trying to serve.</p><p>The Justice Department is also drawing direct parallels to the Microsoft antitrust case but in a complicated way. Some of the most damning allegations included Microsoft making unvarnished and rhetorically violent statements about “cut[ting] off Netscape’s air supply” in the browser wars. This time around, government attorneys are pointing to communications in which Google employees carefully <em>avoid </em>terms that could raise antitrust watchdogs’ ire.</p><p><h3>(Don’t) cut off their air supply</h3></p><p>Before the trial, the Justice Department sought to sanction Google for deliberately (and allegedly) deleting conversations that could illuminate how it approaches competition. In the first week, it’s focused on the tech giant’s judicious use of language. Its first witness was Google chief economist Hal Varian, whom Dintzer led through a series of email chains about Google’s search business. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-09/416266.pdf">In one</a>, Varian takes issue with Marissa Mayer (who at that point oversaw Google’s homepage) referring to the company’s “market share” — a term that could indicate overall market dominance. “Let’s make sure we are consistent in calling this ‘query share’ rather than ‘market share,’” Varian told another Google employee, Penny Chu. “Absolutely, I’m aware of not using the word ‘market,’” Chu replied. “The one big thing I remember from all that Legal training.”</p><p>Varian responded that “query share” was simply the more accurate term. And he professed unfamiliarity with a 2011 presentation that laid out more rules for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-09-14/googlers-told-to-avoid-words-like-share-and-bundle-us-says-lmj27bhl">avoiding touchy language</a>, including terms like “network effects,” “scale,” “bundle,” or “tie.” The concerns go back to at least 2003, when Varian urged Googlers in a memo to be “sensitive” about perceptions of monopolistic behavior, citing the “air supply” comment as an example of what to avoid.</p><p>The Justice Department also dissected <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/googles-varian-search-scale-is-bogus/">claims Varian made in 2009</a> about data from user searches being less than vital to search engine quality — a tortuously drawn-out process that drew multiple objections from Google’s lawyers. In an email chain from later that year, then-Google engineer Udi Manber argued that Varian had been “factually wrong” to dismiss the importance of data-sharing in a Microsoft-Yahoo pact. “It’s absolutely not true that scale is not important. We make very good use of everything we get,” Manber said. “If Microsoft had the same traffic we have, their quality will improve significantly, and if we had the same traffic they have, ours will drop significantly. That’s a fact.”</p><p>Varian, again, argued the Justice Department was overplaying the importance of the disagreement; he said he acknowledged scale mattered, just that it produced diminishing returns. And Varian and Google’s attorneys alike were visibly irritated at the approach — which involved reading paragraphs of emails out before Judge Amit Mehta without giving Varian much room to rebut them. It’s a strategy that highlights Google’s internal rhetoric rather than its public-facing explanations for why it makes deals like MADA or the Safari agreement, to the company’s clear frustration. (Former White House official Tim Wu, who visited the trial on Wednesday, <a href="https://twitter.com/superwuster/status/1702011298483978383">compared Varian’s prickly demeanor</a> to “Bill Gates circa 1998.”)</p><p><h3>The power of defaults</h3></p><p>With Varian and other witnesses, the Justice Department returned again and again to the importance Google has placed on default settings. It called up former Google employee and Shazam founder Chris Barton to discuss the importance of striking deals with mobile phone makers and carriers. “We need to incentivize carriers to ship Google,” <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-09/416302.pdf">Barton said in a 2011 email</a>. “Without an exclusive search deal, a large carrier can and will ship alternatives to Google … You can bet that Microsoft and Yahoo will enter contracts for search on Android through carrier deals if we do not.”</p><p>Google’s consistent counterpoint is that this indicates a kind of entirely legal competition that other companies like Microsoft engage in regularly. Among other things, its attorneys have pointed out that Microsoft sets Bing as the default search option on Windows computers, which <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/26/delivering-delightful-performance-for-more-than-one-billion-users-worldwide/">have a billion-plus users</a> — and that this hasn’t stopped Google Search from dominating the market anyway. In opening arguments, Schmidtlein showed instructions for switching from Google to another search engine, comparing it to the days of slotting in software floppy disks or downloading programs over dial-up internet.</p><p>So far, the Justice Department has fought this argument with an early expert witness: CalTech behavioral economics professor Antonio Rangel. Rangel was one of the few non-Google employees to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-search-defaults-prey-power-185318127.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmlndGVjaG9udHJpYWwuY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADQdw88SC7eGR35mk3iM0iX5LXRAACr45ZHy-Mq02w0yBbXKMbKvf9d-R0CsxUNlUXBf1hJYCcbQl1HcdRU9M5Mg1Iiu62I1vSQYdSHNKbHMjmUxvyK7Ks6CHb1oUlAF-ZkXE21dgFMAgoS4iuLlMIgWBYtCK5rA4S4-KvwKIqBR">make an appearance on the witness stand</a> in the first week, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-09/416323.pdf">arguing in a presentation</a> that search engine defaults produce a “sizable and robust bias” toward the preselected option. Rangel cited other cases where a default option has dramatically shifted how people make choices, like opt-in organ donor programs and instances where Google has acknowledged the importance of being the default option — including cases like Apple Podcasts where it doesn’t occupy that space.</p><p>In cross-examination, Google called Rangel’s conclusions into question, pointing out that Bing’s default placements, for instance, don’t seem to have helped Microsoft nearly as much. Google obviously can’t argue that defaults don’t matter at all — given how much money it’s spent on them —&nbsp;but it contends that they’re not <em>enough</em> to tip the scales in favor of an inferior product. Google getting more antitrust scrutiny is a good thing for Microsoft, but it’s almost impressive what a punching bag Bing has become in this trial.</p><p><h3>What about the consumers?</h3></p><p>As reporter Yosef Weitzman, who’s been appearing in court daily, notes, Judge Mehta <a href="https://www.bigtechontrial.com/p/the-power-of-defaults">seems to be probing</a> exactly how this all fits with America’s consumer harm standard for antitrust judgments. Nothing, here, is more expensive for the average person. Google Search is free, after all — so does the average user really suffer from having to work slightly harder to reach an alternative?</p><p>The Justice Department argues that unfair, pay-for-play competition strategies have let Google avoid making Search better in ways that <em>do </em>cause real harm. The first week of testimony hasn’t fully explored this yet, but one of its prime examples is lax privacy standards — if Google had to seriously compete instead of buying its way into your search bar, Dintzer said, it might have to do a better job of safeguarding your data.</p><p>There’s also another group of consumers: advertisers who pay for placement through Google’s highly lucrative advertising system. Advertising isn’t the core focus of this case; it will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/24/23569127/google-advertising-monopoly-antitrust-lawsuit-federal-government">front and center</a> in a later suit. But ads are the whole reason Google Search makes money, and one of the arguments against Google is that it’s obtained a level of power that lets it dictate prices unfairly to advertisers who use its tools. We’ll likely hear more about that from a coalition of states that piggybacked on the Justice Department’s case to add their own allegations —&nbsp;and who will make their case later in the trial.</p><p><h3>What’s next?</h3></p><p>The Justice Department is expected to make its case over the rest of September and early October, and we’ll likely hear from a bevy of current and former Google employees, including CEO Sundar Pichai. We’re also expecting testimony from Eddy Cue and other Apple executives, as well as Neeva co-founder Sridhar Ramaswamy, whose <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/20/23731397/neeva-search-engine-google-shutdown">doomed search engine</a> was mentioned in opening arguments. Google will get a chance to cross-examine the witnesses and poke holes in the department’s arguments, but we likely won’t see its side of the story laid out in full until late October, following arguments from the state attorneys general. All the companies involved here have done their best to limit sensitive information leaking, so it’s hard to say whether we’ll see revelations around things like just how much Google is paying Apple — but it’s always possible.</p><p>The question that matters most, though, is whether Judge Mehta can be convinced that consumer harm applies to free products like search engines. In recent years, it’s seemed almost impossible to pin a tech company down on antitrust allegations, and Google has plenty of defenses on hand. Where Microsoft won its recent Activision Blizzard case by arguing that it was being left in the dust by competitor Sony, Google is saying that it’s simply the best option on the market. Does that mean it’s good or —&nbsp;as the Justice Department has argued —&nbsp;barely good enough? We’ll be watching that fight play out for months to come.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Last night when the clock struck midnight, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/thousands-of-workers-go-on-strike-at-ford-gm-and-stellantis-plants/">nearly 13,000 workers at Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis went on strike</a> after the so-called "Big Three" car companies failed to reach an agreement with United Auto Workers (UAW). By Friday morning, UAW discovered that X, the platform formerly known as Twitter—in what appeared to be a petty move by platform owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk—had stripped their account's verified status, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/09/15/uaw-strike-twitter-verification-elon-musk/">The Intercept reported</a>.</p>
<p>The move seemingly makes it harder for UAW to maximize reach for its posts on X, just as workers have begun striking, demanding better wages and other benefits.</p>
<p>Ford has claimed that the deal UAW was negotiating would have doubled automaker labor costs, and the Intercept noted that often wage increases won by union workers "trickle down" to non-unionized workers like Tesla's. That perhaps worried Musk, who seemingly has a financial interest in keeping autoworker wages low and a history of union-busting. Earlier this year, Musk lost a court battle and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/04/musk-loses-in-court-has-to-delete-tweet-threatening-tesla-workers-who-join-union/">had to delete a tweet that threatened Tesla workers attempting to unionize</a>.</p>
<p>A UAW official told The Intercept that the union had paid for X verification and confirmed that the account had been marked as verified until earlier today when UAW said it was removed without any notification from X.</p>
<p>By midday Friday, UAW's verified check was reinstated. The Intercept's reporter, Ryan Grim, <a href="https://twitter.com/ryangrim/status/1702721056190980574?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1702721056190980574%7Ctwgr%5Eb17609a20274718334e922e6a2f9960348e94b9f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com%2F2023%2F09%2F15%2Fuaw-strike-twitter-verification-elon-musk%2F">posted on X</a>, writing, "Elon put the blue check back up. Maybe the Big Three will fold this fast too."</p>
<p>To a request for comment, X only sent Ars an auto-response, saying, "Busy now, please check back later." (To be fair, in this case "check back later" is a good summary of what happened.)</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>According to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/09/13/tesla-uaw-gm-ford-stellantis-contract-talks">Axios</a>, Tesla pays lower wages than the Big Three automakers currently faced with striking workers, with Tesla paying "an estimated labor cost of $45 to $50 per hour" compared to "about $64 to $67 per hour."</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1702431940987543888">post on X</a>, Musk claimed that Tesla pays more than UAW's required wages.</p>
<p>"We pay more than the UAW btw, but performance expectations are also higher," Musk said. "Quite a few of our factory techs who work on the line have become millionaires over the years from company stock grants."</p>
<p>Musk's stake in the strike could go beyond wage questions, though. UAW's negotiations also seek to expand benefits for union workers involved "in the production of electric vehicles and the batteries needed to power them," The Intercept reported, and those conversations could also impact Tesla operations.</p>
<p>On top of the backlash over Musk's union-busting tweet, Tesla has a history of violating labor laws.</p>
<p>The company previously was found in violation of labor laws for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/08/teslas-ban-on-pro-union-shirts-is-illegal-and-must-be-rescinded-nlrb-rules/">banning workers from wearing pro-union shirts</a>. Last year, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ordered Tesla to revise its policies "to make clear that it does not prohibit production associates from wearing black union shirts."</p>
<p>There was also tension earlier this year when Tesla Autopilot Buffalo-based workers tried to unionize, alleging that they were being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/tesla-autopilot-workers-try-to-unionize-are-tired-of-being-treated-like-robots/">treated "like robots"</a> and pressured to skip bathroom breaks.</p>
<p>And most recently in April, the NLRB again ruled that Tesla violated labor laws when managers at an Orlando repair shop illegally silenced workers attempting to discuss pay and working conditions, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-broke-us-labor-law-by-silencing-workers-official-rules-2023-04-26/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p>Whether X was really attempting to limit reach of UAW's posts at a critical moment—or there is some other possible justification for removing the verification—is still unknown. But UAW didn't let the setback stop it from returning to the platform to amplify strikers' demands as soon as the blue check was back.</p>
<p>In the moments after X reinstated UAW's verification, the union began posting in support of strikers <a href="https://twitter.com/UAW/status/1702730915841990705">in Ohio</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/UAW/status/1702737525922562432">Missouri</a>, some of them chanting, "No justice, no jeeps!"</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em>This past month I’ve been working on a project that I’m eager to write way too many words about. But for now, it’s not ready to talk about in public. Meanwhile, I either have way too many words about topics that I’m confident nobody wants to hear about or too few words about topics that folks tend to find interesting.</em></p><p><em>In lieu of publishing something too unappealing or too trite, I’ve decided to tell a (true!) story that’s been rattling around in the back of my head for more than a few years.</em></p><p>In 2016 I joined Uber. I’d followed a director from Box who had been offered to lead Business Intelligence at Uber. She told me about a team that she thought I’d be perfect for—it was called “Crystal Ball” and it was doing some of the most incredible work she’d come across. I’d put in two good years at Box and seen it through an IPO and was ready for something new, so I jumped.</p><p>Uber was weird from the get-go. The first week (dubbed “Engucation”) was a mix of learning how to do things that I’d never need to do in the role that I held and setting up benefits and taking compliance classes. Travis Kalanick joined us for a Q&amp;A where he showed off pictures of the self-driving car that the ATG arm of the company was building (it just looked like an SUV with cameras) and the more visually impressive mapping car that was gathering data for the self-driving project (it looked like a weird Dalek on wheels).</p><p>When I met the members of the Crystal Ball team, it was about four people (not including myself). Everyone was heavily biased towards back-end. I was given a brief tour to the fourth floor of 1455 Market St to understand the problem that the team was solving.</p><p>“You see all these desks?”</p><p>“Yeah”</p><p><span>“This is where the data scientists sit. They build data science models in R. They run those models on data that they download from Vertica</span></p><p><span>.”</span></p><p>“Okay”</p><p>“The problem is that the models are slow and take up a lot of resources. So the data scientists have multiple laptops that they download the data to, then run the models overnight. When the data scientists arrive in the morning, the laptops whose models didn’t crash have data that’s maybe usable that day.”</p><p>“What about the other laptops?”</p><p>“We don’t have the data we need and we lose money.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>This was a big problem for the business: they needed a way to take two kinds of inputs (data and code) and run the code to produce useful outputs. Or, hopefully useful. Testing a model meant running it, so the iteration cycle was very close to one iteration per day per laptop.</p><p>The team, when I joined, had the beginnings of a tool to automate this. It was called “R-Crusher” and it was essentially a system for scheduling work. They were able to make some API calls and code would be downloaded and executed, and an output file would appear in a directory eventually. As the first (self-professed) front-end engineer on the team, it was my job to build the tool to expose this to the rest of the company.</p><p><span>I was grateful that I didn’t need to write any “real” code. I lived in the world of React building UIs with Uber’s in-house front-end framework</span></p><p><span> (“Bedrock”). Any time I needed something, I could ask the back-end folks to update the R-Crusher API and I’d get some notes a few hours later to unblock me.</span></p><p><span>The first version of the front-end for R-Crusher (“Wesley”</span></p><p><span>) was ready in very little time—maybe a few weeks from the point I joined? It was a joy.</span></p><p><span>The next 6-7 months were a hectic rush. I was tasked with hiring more front-end engineers. I built a front-end team</span></p><p><span> of seven people. We added user-facing features to Wesley and R-Crusher (“Can we have a text box that only takes capital letters?” “Can we make this text box allow a number whose maximum value is this other text box?”) and debugging tools for the team (“Can we see the output log of the running jobs?”).</span></p><p>There were effectively only two things that people were working on at Uber in 2016:</p><ol><li><p>The app rewrite/redesign (which launched in November 2016)</p></li><li><p>Uber China</p></li></ol><p><span>All of my work and the team’s work, ultimately, was to support Uber China. R-Crusher was a tool to help get the data we needed to compete with Didi. Nobody really cared very much about the processes for the US and any other country—we had less to lose and Lyft wasn’t seen as remarkable competition except in the handful of cities they were operating at scale. China was a make-or-break opportunity for Uber, China was only going to succeed if we had the data for it</span></p><p><span>, and the data was going to come (at least in part) from R-Crusher.</span></p><p>Over the summer of 2016, we came up against a new twist on the project. We had a model that ran overnight to generate data for anticipated ridership in China. That data wasn’t useful on its own, but if you fed it into a tab on a special Excel spreadsheet, you’d get a little interactive Excel tool for choosing driver incentives. Our job was to take that spreadsheet and make it available as the interface for this model’s data.</p><p><span>Now, this was no small feat on the back-end or front-end. First, the data needed to be run and moved to an appropriate location. Then, we had a challenging problem: we needed to take </span><em>all the logic</em><span> from this spreadsheet (with hundreds if not thousands of formulas across multiple sheets) and turn it into a UI that Uber China city teams could log into to use. The direction we got from the head of finance at Uber (who, for whatever reason, was seemingly responsible for the project) was “take </span><em>this</em><span> [the spreadsheet] and put it in on the website [Wesley].”</span></p><p>We asked how we could simplify the UI to meet the resource constraints (engineer time) we had. “The city teams only know how to use Excel, just make it like Excel.” We tried explaining why that was hard and what we could confidently deliver in the time allotted. “Every day that we don’t have this tool as specced, we’re losing millions of dollars.” There was no budging on the spec.</p><p>The back-end folks tried pushing the project over to the front-end side—there was just no time to convert the spreadsheet to Python or R code. On the front-end, the naive answer was “well I guess we’ve got a lot of JavaScript to write.” But I had something up my sleeve.</p><p>In 2015, I had built a prototype of a tool at Box. Box had a collaborative note-taking product called Box Notes (based on Hackpad). I had the idea to make a similar project for working with numbers: sometimes you didn’t need a full spreadsheet, you just needed a place to put together a handful of formulas, format it with some headings and text, and share it with other people. Sort of like an ipython notebook for spreadsheets. I called it Box Sums.</p><p><span>When I built this, I created a simple React-based spreadsheet UI</span></p><p><span> and a super basic spreadsheet formula engine. A few hundred lines of code. And if you dropped an XLS/XLSX file onto the page, I used a Node library to parse it and extract the contents.</span></p><p>I demoed Box Sums to the Box Notes team at some point, and they nitpicked the UI and implementation details (“What if two people type in the same cell at the same time? They’ll just overwrite each other.” 🙄). Nothing came of it, but I took the code and shoved it into my back pocket for a rainy day.</p><p>My idea was to take this code and spruce it up for Uber’s use case. Fill in all the missing features in the spreadsheet engine so that everything the spreadsheet needed to run was supported. The back-end could serve up a 2D array of data representing the ridership data input, and we'd feed that in. And the UI would simply make all but the cells that were meant to be interactive read-only instead.</p><p><span>I </span><em>wasn’t</em><span> going to be Excel, but it would behave sort of like Excel, it would read an Excel file as input, and it would Excel formulas on some data. That was about as close to “just make it like Excel” that we were going to get. And it also meant that we could skip the process of translating thousands of dense formulas to JavaScript.</span></p><p><span>I got to work polishing up the code. I parsed the XLS file and extracted all the formulas. I found all of the functions those formulas used, and implemented them in my spreadsheet engine. I then went through and implemented all the fun syntax that I hadn’t implemented for my demo at Box (like </span><a href="https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/relative-absolute-reference-excel/" rel="">absolute cell references</a><span>, where inserting </span><code>$</code><span> characters into cell references makes them keep their column/row when you drag the corner of the cell, or referencing cells in other sheets).</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Uber 5th Floor – CALIFORNIA DRYWALL&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Uber 5th Floor – CALIFORNIA DRYWALL" title="Uber 5th Floor – CALIFORNIA DRYWALL" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f8aad8-50aa-4e9e-a531-f6a1cf574a24_1600x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A photo of the literal couch that I worked from to build this.

I spent the early days fixing crashes and debugging errant </span><code>NaN</code><span>s. Then I dug into big performance issues</span></p><p><span>. And finally, I spent time polishing the UI.</span></p><p>When everything was working, I started checking my work. I entered some values into the Excel version and my version, and compared the numbers.</p><ul><li><p>Excel’s output: 3.03</p></li><li><p>My output: 3.01</p></li></ul><p>Hmm</p><ul><li><p>Excel’s output: 1.002</p></li><li><p>My output: 1.000</p></li></ul><p><span>The answers were all </span><em>almost</em><span> correct. After a week of work, I was very pleased to see the sheet working to the extent that it was, but having answers that were very, very close is objectively worse than having numbers that are wildly wrong: very wrong numbers usually always mean a simply logic problem. Almost-correct numbers mean something more insidious.</span></p><p>I started stepping through the debugger as the calculation engine crawled the spreadsheet’s formula graph. I compared computed values to what they were in the Excel version. The sheer size of the spreadsheet made it almost impossible to trace through all of the formulas (there were simply too many), and I didn’t have another spreadsheet which exhibited this problem.</p><p>I wrote unit tests. They all passed.</p><p>I started reading about how Excel represents floating point numbers—maybe JavaScript’s doubles were somehow different than Excel’s notion of a double? This led nowhere.</p><p>I googled for esoteric knowledge about Excel, rounding, or anything related to non-integer numbers that I could find. It all led nowhere.</p><p>Just as I was about to resign myself to stepping through the thousands of formulas and recomputations, I decided to head down to the fourth floor to just ask one of the data scientists.</p><p>I approached their desks. They looked up and had a look of recognition.</p><p>“Hey guys. I’m working on the driver incentive spreadsheet. I’m trying to mimic the calculations that you have in Excel, but my numbers are all just a little bit off. I was hoping you might have some ideas about what’s going on.”</p><p>“Can I take a look?” I showed him my laptop and he played with a few numbers in the inputs. “Oh, that’s the circ.”</p><p>“The ‘circ’?”</p><p>Another data scientist looked up, “The circular reference.”</p><p>“I’m sorry?”</p><p>“We use a circular reference in Excel to do linear regression.”</p><p><span>My mind was blown. I had thought, naively perhaps, that circular references in Excel simply created an error. But this data scientist showed me that Excel </span><em>doesn’t</em><span> error on circular references—if the computed value of the cell converges.</span></p><p>You see, when formulas create a circular reference, Excel will run that computation up to a number of times. If, in those computations, the magnitude of the difference between the most recent and previous computed values for the cell falls below some pre-defined epsilon value (usually a very small number, like 0.00001), Excel will stop recomputing the cell and pretend like it finished successfully.</p><p>Yeah, really.</p><p>I thanked the data scientists and returned to the spaceship hallway to think about what the fuck I was going to do next.</p><p>The changes I needed to make were pretty straightforward. First, it required knowing whether a downstream cell was already computed upstream (for whatever definitions of “downstream” and “upstream” you want to use; there’s not really a good notion of “up” and “down” in a spreadsheet or this graph). If you went to recompute a cell with a formula that referenced an already-recomputed cell, you’d simply keep track of the number of times you computed that cell. If the recomputed value was close enough to the previous value that it fell below the epsilon, you simply pretended like you didn’t recompute the cell and moved on. If it didn’t, you’d continue the process until the number of iterations that you’re keeping track of hit some arbitrary limit (for me, 1000), at which point you’d bail.</p><p>The changes took a day and a half to make. And would you believe, it worked. The outputs were exactly what they should have been. I wrote tests, I integrated the damn thing into Wesley, and I brought it to the team. We delivered the project in the second week of July.</p><p>Two things happened. The first was of little consequence but I enjoy telling the story. Rakesh, the team lead working on the back-end, asked me where I got the Excel component.</p><p>“I made it.”</p><p>“But where did you get the Excel engine?”</p><p>“I made it.”</p><p>“But how are you running Excel in the browser?”</p><p>“Everything you see is built by me, from scratch.”</p><p>He simply couldn’t believe that I’d written a full spreadsheet engine that ran in the browser. All things considered, it was maybe only five thousand lines of code total. A gnarly five thousand lines, but (obviously) not intractable. His assumption about the sheer complexity of that option was that it wasn’t a reasonable project to take on.</p><p>I do think that if I had challenged Rakesh—under no time pressure—to build a spreadsheet engine, he’d get to a working solution as well. My recollection is that he was a very competent engineer. Despite that, I think his intuition about the complexity and scope were based on bad assumptions about what we were ultimately accomplishing, and it’s a good case study in estimating reasonable project outcomes. It goes to show that the sheer imagined complexity of a possible solution is enough to disqualify it in some folks’ minds, even if it's the best possible outcome.</p><p>The second thing that happened was we shipped. We got the Uber China city team members logging in and using the tool. They plugged away at it, and to my knowledge, the numbers it produced drove driver incentives.</p><p>That was the third week of July.</p><p>The last week of July, the head of finance rushed over to our desks.</p><p>“Why can you see the formulas?”</p><p>“Sorry?”</p><p>“When you click in the cells of the spreadsheet you can see the formulas. You shouldn’t be able to do that.”</p><p>“You said to make it just like Excel.”</p><p>“People working for Didi apply for intern jobs at Uber China and then exfiltrate our data. We can’t let them see the formulas or they’ll just copy what we do!”</p><p>Apparently that was a thing. I remember being only half-surprised at the time. I hadn’t considered that our threat model might include employees leaking the computations used to produce the numbers in question. Of course, short of moving the computations up to the server, we couldn't *really* protect the formulas, but that was beyond the scope of what we were being asked to do.</p><p>The fix was straightforward: I updated the UI to simply not show formulas when you clicked in cells. Easy enough, I guess.</p><p><span>The first week of August 2016, Uber China was sold to Didi. Most of us found out because our phones started dinging with news stories about it. We all stopped working and waited until an email arrived a couple hours later announcing the deal internally. If I remember correctly, I just left the office and headed home around lunch time because our team didn’t have anything to do that </span><em>wasn’t</em><span> Uber China-related (yet).</span></p><p><span>After Uber China evaporated, the tool was unceremoniously ripped out of Wesley. It was a bespoke UI for a data job that would never run again. We were never asked to build Excel in the browser again</span></p><p><span>.</span></p><p>I feel no sense of loss or disappointment. I wasn’t disappointed at the time, either.</p><p>My first reaction was to publish the code on Github.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/WebSheets" rel="">https://github.com/WebSheets</a></p><p>My second reaction was to move on. There was maybe a part of me—my younger self—that was disappointed that this major piece of code that I’d labored over had been so gently used before being retired. I wasn’t recognized for it in any material way. My manager didn’t even know what I’d built.</p><p>On the other hand, we as engineers need to be real with ourselves. Every piece of code you write as an engineer is legacy code. Maybe not right now, but it will be. Someone will take joy in ripping it out someday. Every masterpiece will be gleefully replaced, it’s just a matter of time. So why get precious about how long that period of time is?</p><p>I often hear fairly junior folks saying things to the effect of “I’m here to grow as an engineer.” Growing as an engineer is mutually exclusive with the longevity of your output as an engineer. “Growing as an engineer” means becoming a better engineer, and becoming a better engineer (directly or indirectly) means getting better at using your skills to create business value. Early in your career, the work you do will likely have far less longevity than the work you do later on, simply because you gain maturity over time and learn to build tools that tend to be useful for longer.</p><p>Sometimes the business value your work generates comes in the way of technical output. Sometimes it’s how you work with the people around you (collaborating, mentoring, etc.). Sometimes it’s about how you support the rest of the team. There are many ways that business value is created.</p><p>The end (demise?) of Uber China implicitly meant that there was no business value left to create with this project. Continuing to push on it wouldn’t have gotten me or the business anywhere, even if what I'd done was the best possible solution to the problem.</p><p><span>Sometimes that’s just how it is. The devops saying “</span><a href="http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/" rel="">Cattle, not pets</a><span>” is apt here: code (and by proxy, the products built with that code) is cattle. It does a job for you, and when that job is no longer useful, the code is ready to be retired. If you treat the code like a pet for sentimental reasons, you’re working in direct opposition to the interests of the business.</span></p><p><span>As much as I’d love to work on Uber Excel (I'm ashamed to admit that I thought of “Uber Sheets" far too long after I left the company), I was hired to solve problems. Having Excel in the browser was a useful solution, but the problem </span><em>wasn’t</em><span> showing spreadsheets in the browser: the problem was getting a specific UI delivered to the right users quickly.</span></p><p>It’s easy to treat a particularly clever or elegant piece of code as a masterpiece. It might very well be a beautiful trinket! But we engineers are not in the business of beautiful trinkets, we’re in the business of outcomes. In the same way that a chef shouldn’t be disappointed that a beautiful plate of food is “destroyed” by a hungry customer eating it, we shouldn’t be disappointed that our beautiful git repos are marked as “Archived” and shuffled off the production kube cluster.</p><p>The attitudes that we have towards the things that we make are good indicators of maturity. It’s natural for us to want our work to have staying power and longevity. It’s extremely human to want the validation of our beautiful things being seen and used and recognized; it means we’ve done well. On the other hand, our work being discarded gives us an opportunity to understand what (if anything) we could have done better:</p><ol><li><p>Did we build something that didn’t meet the project constraints?</p></li><li><p>Did we build what was requested, but what was requested wasn’t the right thing to ask for?</p><ol><li><p>Was the core problem misunderstood?</p></li><li><p>Did the requested solution actually address the needs of the end user?</p></li></ol></li><li><p>What questions didn’t we ask the stakeholders that could have better-aligned our output with the business need that triggered the request to engineering?</p></li><li><p>Were the expectations that we set around the project inaccurate or vague?</p></li><li><p>Did the project need to be as robust as what was delivered? Could a simpler or less clever solution solved the need equally well?</p></li><li><p>Did we focus on the wrong success criteria?</p><ol><li><p>Did we even have success criteria beyond “build what was requested?”</p></li></ol></li><li><p><span>Who could have been consulted before or after delivery of the project to validate whether all of the </span><em>actual</em><span> project requirements were satisfied?</span></p></li></ol><p>You won’t have the opportunity to take lessons away from the project if you see the sunsetting of the project as a failure: there’s often much to learn about what non-technical aspects of the project broke down. Perhaps there aren’t any, and maybe management is just a group of fools! But often that’s not the case; your delicately milled cog wasn’t ripped out of the machine because it was misunderstood, it was ripped out because it didn’t operate smoothly as a part of the larger system it was installed in.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/09/mckinsey-how-to-measure-software-developer-productivity">https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/09/mckinsey-how-to-measure-software-developer-productivity</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37527259">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div _ngcontent-appid-c225="" id="articleDetail"><p>You'll scarcely find a more controversial and hotly contested topic than metrics of software development productivity. Some think the notion of measuring productivity at all is an insult while others think it can be boiled down to just the <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2022/11/lines-of-code-productivity-software-development">lines of code produced.</a></p>

<p>Naturally, both these <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2022/11/lines-of-code-as-a-tool-for-assessing-developers">extremes</a> are wrong. And yet the "right" answer remains elusive.</p>

<p>Enter McKinsey. The&nbsp;consultancy made a fair few enemies when it said<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/yes-you-can-measure-software-developer-productivity" target="_blank"> yes, you can measure developer productivity</a>. Its framework below amalgamates two of the most popular existing frameworks, DORA and SPACE, with additional opportunity-focused metrics.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.efinancialcareers.com/binaries/content/gallery/efinancial-careers/articles/2023/mckinsey.jpg"></p>

<p>Many are not enthused. The critics include Dave Farley, formerly head of software development for low latency FX and crypto exchange LMAX Ltd. He says he's a fan of one of the metrics used, DORA, which has a focus on outcomes over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/07/bad-software-engineering-teams">the process</a>. However, he likens the difference between DORA and other metrics to "the difference between astronomy and astrology."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Farley refutes the preoccupation with individual development metrics and says, "being smart in how we structure and organize our work is much more important than the level of individual genius or otherwise in the team." He references a now ancient book of essays on software engineering, The Mythical Man Month, and its idea that "nine women can't make a baby in one month."</p>

<p>&nbsp;Kent Beck, ex-fellow at payroll infrastructure <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/07/how-to-get-a-job-in-fintech">fintech</a> Gusto, and Gergely Orosz, formerly an engineering manager for Uber's payments platform and previously developer on JPMorgan's equity derivatives desk, also disagree with the McKinsey methodology. Their conclusions are that the report is "absurdly naive," and would "do far more harm than good" to companies that implement it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They suggest alternatives. - Focus on individual engineers, hoping to monitor and boost their own productivity. They set developers a challenge to "only have one red test at a time when using test driven development," and "set a goal to merge a pull request every day."</p>

<p>At a business level, they suggest a performance metric of "at least one customer-facing thing per team, per week," while rewarding "business impact." Though the former sounds easy, they say it "in practice is very hard to achieve." The latter is even more ambiguous and abstract than productivity itself, but they say the goal is that it "incentivizes software engineers to understand the business."</p>

<p>Are these developers making a fuss over nothing? Or is the McKinsey report a foreboding sign of what's to come in the world of engineering? Let us know in the comments.</p>
