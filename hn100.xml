<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-2q5oecfc=""> <p>Our relationship with computers and phones has changed. We used to rely on software installed locally on our computers, and are now shifting towards a model based on services and companion apps, sometimes with free tiers and subscriptions.</p>
<p>Most services are provided by organisations, who collect and sometimes resell users’ information to third parties. This massive, indiscriminate, and corporate collection of personal data is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>. While organisations can argue this data collection is necessary to provide their services, this comes with significant privacy implications.</p>
<p>Self-hosting and paid subscriptions are common strategies to escape surveillance capitalism. But what guarantees do they really offer? What alternatives exist for the general public who wants to escape surveillance capitalism, and at what cost?</p>
<h2 id="paid-subscriptions-are-not-enough">Paid subscriptions are not enough</h2>
<p>When services have a free and a paid tier, it can be tempting to think that the provider is going to sell your data on the free tier but they’re going to be mindful of it on the paid tier. Paying a subscription to your provider can sound like a good idea to keep your data safe, and it sometimes is. But it’s not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>As reported by The Verge, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/2/23622227/betterhelp-customer-data-advertising-privacy-facebook-snapchat">mental health service provider BetterHelp shared customer’s email addresses, IP addresses, and health questionnaire information with third parties</a> including Facebook and Snapchat, while promising it was private. Mental health is precisely the type of information that should remain private, making this move particularly appalling from BetterHelp.</p>
<h2 id="self-hosting-but-as-a-service">Self-hosting, but as a service</h2>
<p>One of the major enablers of surveillance capitalism is centralisation. In that sense, paid subscriptions don’t offer any guarantee that the provider will play fair game and keep your data private.</p>
<p>Self-hosting is rather efficient at preventing surveillance capitalism, mostly because the data doesn’t live in a central repository but on the self-hoster’s infrastructure. In that sense, it doesn’t directly enable surveillance capitalism. It’s important here to make a distinction between private and public information though. Posts on federated social media platforms are not centralised, but they are public and can be scraped to be exploited. The threat we’re discussing in this article is a provider growing so big it can collect and exploit data that is not public, at a large scale.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the vendor of the self-hosted solution could theoretically still gather information about the users by making its software send data to the mothership regardless of where it’s installed. To an extent, this can be acceptable as long as the user explicitly knows what data is sent, can opt-out, and that the minimum amount of anonymised data is sent for clearly defined purposes. This practice is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry#Software">telemetry</a>. Open-source software allows any tech-savvy person to look up the code and check what is actually sent to the mothership. Proprietary software makes it much more difficult.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://ergaster.org/posts/2023/08/09-i-dont-want-to-host-services-but-i-do">as we discussed earlier on this blog</a>, self-hosting doesn’t scale well because it requires time and knowledge. There’s a workaround: using software that can be self-hosted, but buying it as a service. A real life example would be the Google Drive ethical alternative <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>: several providers like Ionos offer hosted Nextcloud instances. This makes solutions like these accessible (and safe!) to a broader public.</p>
<p>Using open-source licences means that the software can be audited, but it also allows anyone to take the code and offer it as service. This can lead to a race to the bottom in terms of cost and quality when the service providers are not playing fair game: they benefit from development work they didn’t invest resources in, all while not contributing financially or technically to the upstream project either.</p>
<p>If the customers of such providers encounter problems, support is often minimal: in very budget-tight environments, losing a customer can be more profitable than investigating a significant problem. Such predatory methods harm the ecosystems in which they’re deployed: customers get bad experiences, and the upstream project gets little to no benefit. Similar behaviours have been observed in the Matrix ecosystem where integrators deployed open source products without contributing anything back.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the Nextcloud website's page listing the partners working with Nextcloud." src="https://ergaster.org/_astro/nextcloud-partners.DuAZqLpZ_1XMc1K.webp" width="2880" height="1580" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Ultimately, support contracts are an insurance for the service provider <em>and</em> for their customers. When the service provider pays for upstream’s support and reports an issue, the engineers who developed the product investigate the case, fix the problem, and make the fix permanent for everyone. This also allows the upstream to generate a bit of revenue, contributing to the project’s health, sustainability, and to the emergence of new exciting features.</p>
<p>Nextcloud also allows users to sign up on third party providers directly from <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">nextcloud.com</a>. The sign-up feature makes it extremely easy for the user to choose a provider. Nextcloud’s <a href="https://jospoortvliet.com/">Jos Poortvliet</a> confirmed to me that it’s not a formal certification programme, but more of a group of companies Nextcloud trusts. Nextcloud doesn’t generate revenue from this programme, intentionally, since they’re not in the business of monetising private users. Certification programmes are usually very expensive to run and not necessarily profitable for vendors.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the Nextcloud website prompting the user for their email address, and offering them to get started with a provider near them." src="https://ergaster.org/_astro/nextcloud-signup.Do-jCSrM_Z1Cnz2L.webp" width="2880" height="1580" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="not-trusting-anyone">Not trusting anyone</h2>
<p>When buying a hosted service from a provider, we enable a form of partial re-centralisation… which technically allows the provider to start selling the users’ data for profit.</p>
<p>There’s a third option: making sure the data can only be read by its intended recipients, turning the servers into rather dumb pipes. This is End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). It certainly sounds like a silver bullet! So why doesn’t every service provider implement it, to show their good faith? Because it has drawbacks.</p>
<p>When using E2EE, the files are encrypted. Nobody apart from their owner and people who have been explicitly authorised by the owner can read them. This means neither the server software nor the technical administrator of the server can read them either. This is often what users expect, but this has consequences!</p>
<h3 id="the-server-becomes-dumb">The server becomes dumb</h3>
<p>Since the server can’t read the data, there are some legitimate operations it cannot perform anymore. A typical example is “deep” search, which is functionality where the server spends computing time to read and index all the files so it’s easy for the user to query them. When files are encrypted, indexing and search can only happen on the client. Those operations are quite expensive, and the clients don’t necessarily have the computing power, connectivity or storage required to do so.</p>
<p>There are some new techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic encryption</a> that could eventually enable users to offload this computation to the server&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;the server learning anything about what it is actually doing but they are not yet ready for large-scale use.</p>
<p>Having a dumb server also severely limits its ability to send automated reports or alerts based on specific workflows. In a sense, the server can’t “work” for the user anymore and becomes nothing more than a backup service.</p>
<h3 id="data-can-become-irrecoverable">Data can become irrecoverable</h3>
<p>With E2EE, encryption and decryption keys are stored on the device only, which is a significant risk. Let’s assume you host your important documents exclusively on an E2EE service and your keys only exist on your phone. If your phone is broken or lost, your decryption keys are lost with it.</p>
<p>There are three workarounds to avoid losing the keys entirely:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generating a “paper key” (also called “recovery key”, “seed passphrase”, or even “paper wallet” in the context of cryptocurrencies) directly on the client, and giving the user the 12 to 15 words to write down or print somewhere.</li>
<li>Derive the encryption key from the user’s password. This is <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/firefox-sync-privacy/">the approach Firefox Sync is taking</a> for example.</li>
<li>Storing the encryption keys on the server-side, in a vault encrypted by a key derived from a passphrase. The passphrase must of course be long enough to make it difficult to break by the server administrator.</li>
</ol>
<p>The major inconvenient of these workarounds is that they require the user to either print/write a generated key and store them somewhere safe where they can recover it later, or remember a passphrase to access their en/decryption keys. If the user loses the generated key or can’t remember the passphrase, their data is lost and irrecoverable. The service provider cannot do anything about it because they can’t access the data. In other words: there’s no “forgot my password” link anymore.</p>
<p>The reputational risk of not being able to help users who forgot their password is often unacceptable for service providers. Even Apple who positions itself as a company respectful of their users’ privacy doesn’t turn on E2EE by default, and understandably takes a lot of precautions before <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/108756">allowing users to turn on actual E2EE</a> on their iCloud account.</p>
<h3 id="the-e-in-e2ee-doesnt-stand-for-everything">The “E” in E2EE doesn’t stand for “Everything”</h3>
<p>While E2EE is particularly good at preventing nosy folks from looking at files and messages themselves, it doesn’t mean <em>everything</em> is encrypted. In particular, metadata can be sent in clear text either because it’s necessary for the server to provide the service, <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/why-metadata-matters">or because the service providers can profit from it</a>.</p>
<p>Typically, WhatsApp is an E2EE messenger, but the provider still has access to metadata. WhatsApp also has a moderation feature that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/whatsapp-end-to-end-encrypted-messages-arent-that-private-after-all/">allows users to decrypt an E2EE message they were sent, and send it to Meta for moderation purposes</a>. While moderation is a valid use case which doesn’t break encryption itself, it shows that the client could in theory decrypt the message and send it to the service provider behind the user’s back.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the iOS App Store displaying the &quot;App Privacy&quot; section of WhatsApp. A lot of items are mentioned in the &quot;Data Linked to You&quot; section." src="https://ergaster.org/_astro/whatsapp-data-collected.D2jizaJk_wsrgM.webp" width="1179" height="2556" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>This highlights that E2EE alone is also not enough: even if users don’t need to trust the service provider they need to be able to trust both the protocol and the client they rely on. This means the client necessarily needs to be open source and audited regularly by an independent third party.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-tech">Beyond tech</h2>
<p>As we have seen, there are several strategies to help the general public trying to escape surveillance capitalism. Self-hosting is efficient but doesn’t scale well, paid instances of self-hostable software work generally well but are not a silver bullet, and E2EE is very useful to protect privacy but don’t provide a full guarantee either.</p>
<p>Ultimately E2EE is a very libertarian approach to a societal issue, taking a “myself against the world” stance. It can be a valid stance, especially for minorities and in hostile contexts. But surveillance capitalism is not a technological problem. It is enabled by technology, but at the very core it is a societal problem.</p>
<p>As Molly White said, “there are never purely technological solutions to societal problems”. To fight surveillance capitalism, we need E2EE, regulation, justice, and education.</p>
<p>We need E2EE to prevent the collection from happening in the first place. We need proper regulation to define what is acceptable or not, which will ultimately define what is a viable business model and what is not. This means that the fines must make it prohibitively unprofitable to sell users’ data. We need justice and executive bodies to actually enforce the regulation. And we need education for the general public to understand the risks of surveillance capitalism.</p>

<p>Google News is boosting sites that rip-off other outlets by using AI to rapidly churn out content, 404 Media has found. Google told 404 Media that although it tries to address spam on Google News, the company ultimately does not focus on whether a news article was written by an AI or a human, opening the way for more AI-generated content making its way onto Google News.</p><p>The presence of AI-generated content on Google News signals two things: first, the black box nature of Google News, with entry into Google News’ rankings in the first place an opaque, but apparently gameable, system. Second, is how Google may not be ready for moderating its News service in the age of consumer-access AI, where essentially anyone is able to churn out a mass of content with little to no regard for its quality or originality.</p><p>“I want to read the original stories written by journalists who actually researched them and spoke to primary sources. Any news junkie would,” Brian Penny, a ghostwriter who first flagged some of the seemingly AI-generated articles to 404 Media, said.</p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Do you know about any other AI-generated content farms?

<p>OK, queues.</p>

<p>People misuse queues all the time. The most egregious case being to fix issues with slow apps, and consequently, with overload. But to say why, I'll need to take bits of talks and texts I have around the place, and content that I have written in more details about in <a href="http://www.erlang-in-anger.com/">Erlang in Anger</a>.</p>

<p>To oversimplify things, most of the projects I end up working on can be visualized as a very large bathroom sink. User and data input are flowing from the faucet, down 'till the output of the system:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink1.png" width="534" height="309">
<p>So under normal operations, your system can handle all the data that comes in, and carry it out fine:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink2.png" width="479" height="307">
<p>Water goes in, water goes out, everyone's happy. However, from time to time, you'll see temporary overload on your system. If you do messaging, this is going to be around sporting events or events like New Year's Eve. If you're a news site, it's gonna be when a big thing happens (Elections in the US, Royal baby in the UK, someone says they dislike French as a language in Quebec).</p>

<p>During that time, you may experience that temporary overload:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink3.png" width="452" height="315">
<p>The data that comes out of the system is still limited, and input comes in faster and faster. Web people will use stuff like caches at that point to make it so the input and output required gets to be reduced. Other systems will use a huge buffer (a queue, or in this case, a sink) to hold the temporary data.</p>

<p>The problem comes when you inevitably encounter prolonged overload. It's when you look at your system load and go "oh crap", and it's not coming down ever. Turns out Obama doesn't want to turn in his birth certificate, the royal baby doesn't look like the father, and someone says Quebec should be better off with Parisian French, and the rumor mill is going for days and weeks at a time:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink4.png" width="449" height="303">
<p>All of a sudden, the buffers, queues, whatever, can't deal with it anymore. You're in a critical state where you can see smoke rising from your servers, or if in the cloud, things are as bad as usual, but more!</p>

<p>The system inevitably crashes:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink5.png" width="453" height="314">
<p>Woops, everyone is dead, you're in the office at 3am (who knew so many people in the US, disgusted with their "Kenyan" president, now want news on the royal baby, while Quebec people look up 'royale with cheese baby' for some reason) trying to keep things up.</p>

<p>You look at your stack traces, at your queue, at your DB slow queries, at the APIs you call. You spend weeks at a time optimizing every component, making sure it's always going to be good and solid. Things keeps crashing, but you hit the point where every time, it takes 2-3 days more.</p>

<p>At the end of it, you see a crapload of problems still happening, but they're a week apart between each failure, which slows down your optimizing in immense ways because it's incredibly hard to measure things when they take weeks to go bad.</p>

<p>You go "okay I'm all out of ideas, let's buy a bigger server." The system in the end looks like this, and it's still failing:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink6.png" width="476" height="315">
<p>Except now it's an unmaintainable piece of garbage full of dirty hacks to make it work that cost 5 times what it used to, and you've been paid for months optimizing it for no god damn reason because it still dies when overloaded.</p>

<p>The problem? That red arrow there. You're hitting some hard limit that even through all of your profiling, you didn't consider properly. This can be a database, an API to an external service, disk speed, bandwidth or general I/O limits, paging speed, CPU limits, whatever.</p>

<p>You've spent months optimizing your super service only to find out at some point in time, you went past its optimal speed without larger changes, and the day your system got to have an operational speed greater than this hard limit, you've doomed yourself to an everlasting series of system failures.</p>

<p>The disheartening part about it is that you discover that once your system is popular, has people using it and its APIs, and changing it to be better is very expensive and hard. Especially since you'll probably have to revisit assumptions you've made in its core design. Woops.</p>

<p>So what do you need? You'll need to pick <em>what has to give</em> whenever stuff goes bad. You'll have to pick between blocking on input (back-pressure), or dropping data on the floor (load-shedding). And that happens all the time in the real world, we just don't want to do it as developers, as if it were an admission of failure.</p>

<p>Bouncers in front of a club, water spillways to go around dams, the pressure mechanism that keeps you from putting more gas in a full tank, and so on. They're all there to impose a system-wide flow control to keep operations safe.</p>

<p>In [non-critical] software? Who cares! We never shed load because that makes stakeholders angry, and we never think about back-pressure. Usually the back-pressure in the system is implicit: 'tis slow.</p>

<p>A function/method call to something ends up taking longer? It's slow. Not enough people think of it as back-pressure making its way through your system. In fact, slow distributed systems are often the canary in the overload coal mine. The problem is that everyone just stands around and goes "durr why is everything so slow??" and devs go "I don't know! It just is! It's hard, okay!"</p>

<p>That's usually because somewhere in the system (possibly the network, or something that is nearly impossible to observe without proper tooling, such as <a href="http://www.snookles.com/slf-blog/2012/01/05/tcp-incast-what-is-it/">TCP incast</a>), something is clogged and everything else is pushing it back to the edge of your system, to the user.</p>

<p>And that back-pressure making the system slower? It slows down the rate at which users can input data. It's what is likely keeping your whole stack alive. And you know when people start using queues? Right there. When operations take too long and block stuff up, people introduce a freaking queue in the system.</p>

<p>And the effects are instant. The application that was sluggish is now fast again. Of course you need to redesign the whole interface and interactions and reporting mechanisms to become asynchronous, but man is it fast!</p>

<p>Except at some point the queue spills over, and you lose all of the data. There's a serious meeting that then takes place where everyone discusses how this could possibly have happened. Dev #3 suggests more workers are added, Dev #6 recommends the queue gets persistency so that when it crashes, no requests are lost.</p>

<p>"Cool," says everyone. Off to work. Except at some point, the system dies again. And the queue comes back up, but it's already full and uuugh. Dev #5 goes in and thinks "oh yeah, we could add more queues" (I swear I've seen this unfold back when I didn't know better). People say "oh yeah, that increases capacity" and off they go.</p>

<p>And then it dies again. And nobody ever thought of that sneaky red arrow there:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink6.png" width="476" height="315">
<p>Maybe they do it without knowing, and decide to go with MongoDB because it's "faster than Postgres" (heh). Who knows.</p>

<p>The real problem is that everyone involved used queues as an optimization mechanism. With them, new problems are now part of the system, which is a nightmare to maintain. Usually, these problems will come in the form of ruining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end-to-end principle</a> by using a persistent queue as a fire-and-forget mechanisms or assuming tasks can't be replayed or lost. You have more places that can time out, require new ways to detect failures and communicate them back to users, and so on.</p>

<p>Those can be worked around, don't get me wrong. The issue is that they're being introduced as part of a solution that's not appropriate for the problem it's built to solve. All of this was just premature optimization. Even when everyone involved took measures, reacted to real failures in real pain points, etc. The issue is that nobody considered what the true, central business end of things is, and what its limits are. People considered these limits locally in each sub-component, more or less, and not always.</p>

<p>But someone should have picked what had to give: do you stop people from inputting stuff in the system, or do you shed load. Those are inescapable choices, where inaction leads to system failure.</p>

<p>And you know what's cool? If you identify these bottlenecks you have for real in your system, and you put them behind proper back-pressure mechanisms, your system won't even have the right to become slow.</p>

<p>Step 1. Identify the bottleneck. Step 2: ask the bottleneck for permission to pile more data in:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink7.png" width="387" height="259"> <img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink8.png" width="383" height="259">
<p>Depending on where you put your probe, you can optimize for different levels of latency and throughput, but what you're going to do is define proper operational limits of your system.</p>

<p>When people blindly apply a queue as a buffer, all they're doing is creating a bigger buffer to accumulate data that is in-flight, only to lose it sooner or later. You're making failures more rare, but you're making their magnitude worse.</p>

<p>When you shed load and define proper operational limits to your system, you don't have these. What you may have is customers that are as unhappy (because in either case, they can't do what your system promises right), but with proper back-pressure or load-shedding, you gain:</p>

<ul>
<li>Proper metrics of your quality of service</li>
<li>An API that will be designed with either in mind (back-pressure lets you know when you're in an overload situation, and when to retry or whatever, and load-shedding lets the user know that some data was lost so they can work around that)</li>
<li>Fewer night pages</li>
<li>Fewer critical rushes to get everything fixed because it's dying all the time</li>
<li>A way to monetize your services through varying account limits and priority lanes</li>
<li>You act as a more reliable endpoint for everyone who depends on you</li>
</ul>
<p>To make stuff usable, a proper idempotent API with end-to-end principles in mind will make it so these instances of back-pressure and load shedding should rarely be a problem for your callers, because they can safely retry requests and know if they worked.</p>

<p>So when I rant about/against queues, it's because queues will often be (but not always) applied in ways that totally mess up end-to-end principles for no good reason. It's because of bad system engineering, where people are trying to make an 18-wheeler go through a straw and wondering why the hell things go bad. In the end the queue just makes things worse. And when it goes bad, it goes really bad, because everyone tried to close their eyes shut and ignore the fact they built a dam to solve flooding problems upstream of the dam.</p>

<p>And then of course, there's the use case where you use the queue as a messaging mechanism between front-end threads/processes (think PHP, Ruby, CGI apps in general, and so on) because your language doesn't support inter-process communications. It's marginally better than using a MySQL table (which I've seen done a few times and even took part in), but infinitely worse than picking a tool that supports the messaging mechanisms you need to implement your solution right.</p>

<h3>from the <i>too-big-to-fail,-too-cheap-to-care</i> dept</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160712/15543134951/field-drug-tests-2-tool-that-can-destroy-lives.shtml" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160712/15543134951/field-drug-tests-2-tool-that-can-destroy-lives.shtml">Field drug tests</a> often seem to be more a triumph of imagination than a triumph of science. They’re cheap. Some popular tests run <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2016/11/04/las-vegas-pd-continues-to-use-faulty-2-drug-field-tests-because-convictions-matter-more-than-justice/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2016/11/04/las-vegas-pd-continues-to-use-faulty-2-drug-field-tests-because-convictions-matter-more-than-justice/">less than $3/per</a>. That’s the literal selling point. When in doubt, a cop can get probable cause by grabbing a substance, dumping it into a field test, and deciding whatever results are generated are evidence of guilt.</p>
<p>It rarely is. Sure, if you run enough tests, you’re bound to have some of these field tests confirmed by lab tests that are far more precise and less likely to be interpreted subjectively by the person performing the test. (Theoretically. There’s plenty of evidence out there showing lab drug tests can be just as faulty as field drug tests, although <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/04/10/more-drug-lab-misconduct-results-massachusetts-court-tossing-nearly-12000-convictions/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/04/10/more-drug-lab-misconduct-results-massachusetts-court-tossing-nearly-12000-convictions/">in these cases</a>, the problem is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/04/26/prosecutors-overturn-more-than-21000-drug-convictions-wake-massive-drug-lab-misconduct/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/04/26/prosecutors-overturn-more-than-21000-drug-convictions-wake-massive-drug-lab-misconduct/">usually the person performing</a> the testing [or not!] than the test itself.)</p>
<p>Cheap, fast, and easy. And wrong. So very very often wrong. Field drug tests have labeled everything from <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/08/16/prosecutor-tosses-charges-against-driver-after-field-drug-test-claims-bird-poop-cars-hood-is-cocaine/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/08/16/prosecutor-tosses-charges-against-driver-after-field-drug-test-claims-bird-poop-cars-hood-is-cocaine/">bird poop</a> (on a car’s hood!) to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/10/31/man-gets-37500-payout-after-field-drug-test-says-donut-crumbs-are-methamphetamines/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/10/31/man-gets-37500-payout-after-field-drug-test-says-donut-crumbs-are-methamphetamines/">donut crumbs</a> to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/08/29/man-spends-three-months-jail-because-drug-dog-field-test-said-his-honey-was-methamphetamines/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/08/29/man-spends-three-months-jail-because-drug-dog-field-test-said-his-honey-was-methamphetamines/">honey</a> to the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/06/03/man-sues-after-field-drug-test-says-his-daughters-ashes-are-meth-ecstasy/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/06/03/man-sues-after-field-drug-test-says-his-daughters-ashes-are-meth-ecstasy/">ashes of a deceased loved one</a> as contraband, resulting in the immediate arrest of people not actually in possession of anything illegal. </p>
<p>This is just what’s been observed by those challenging these results in court during criminal trials or filing civil rights lawsuits following wrongful arrests. It’s happened often enough that even a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/28/cheap-field-drug-tests-are-finally-getting-called-out-by-courts-as-the-bullshit-they-are/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/28/cheap-field-drug-tests-are-finally-getting-called-out-by-courts-as-the-bullshit-they-are/">few courts are taking notice</a>, in some cases refusing to accept plea deals predicated on nothing more than field drug tests results.</p>
<p>Data on field drug tests is difficult to obtain. Cops are in no hurry to turn this information over and the patchwork of public records laws across the nation often allows law enforcement to refuse disclosure simply by stating the results are relevant to a criminal investigation (even if the investigation has long since been closed). </p>
<p>What data can be obtained has been collected and parsed by the Quattrone Center for Fair Administration of Justice at the University of Pennsylvania. What’s long been assumed based on mainly anecdotal evidence now has at least some scientific backing: field drug tests aren’t worth what we’re paying for them, even if it is only $3/per. According to the Center’s <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24360980/fdt-study.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24360980/fdt-study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> [PDF], nearly one third of the money spent on field drug tests is misspent. (h/t <a href="https://reason.com/2024/01/09/study-estimates-roadside-drug-tests-result-in-30000-wrongful-arrests-every-year/" data-type="link" data-id="https://reason.com/2024/01/09/study-estimates-roadside-drug-tests-result-in-30000-wrongful-arrests-every-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C.J. Ciaramella at Reason</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Utilizing a nationwide survey of agencies, the report offers national estimates on the frequency of test usage, finding that each year approximately 773,000 drug-related arrests involve the use of presumptive tests. Using the survey data and national estimates of drug arrests, this report examines the impact of the tests on wrongful arrests, racial disparities in their use, and their subsequent impact on drug possession prosecutions and dispositions.</em></p>
<p><em>Although the true error rate of these tests remains unknown, estimates based on the imperfect data that are available suggest that <strong><span>around 30,000 arrests</span> each year involve people who do not possess illegal substances but who are nonetheless falsely implicated by color-based presumptive tests</strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not great. Not even good. Not even close to good. I don’t know where it’s acceptable to rack up a false arrest rate of nearly 4%, but America shouldn’t be one of those places. I realize it’s only probable cause at the point of arrest rather than the courtroom standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt.” But 30,000 bogus arrests a year from a single cause — field drug tests — is unacceptable. </p>
<p>Here’s how that works out in the greater scheme of things, in terms of criminal justice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The use of presumptive field tests in drug arrests is one of the largest, if not the<br>largest, known contributing factor to wrongful arrests and convictions in the United States.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not just arrests. It’s also convictions. And those convictions aren’t happening in bench trials or jury trials. They’re plea agreements where people weigh their options and decide that the <em>best</em> option is to “admit” to a crime they haven’t committed rather than subject themselves to indefinite detention and the <a href="https://interrogatingjustice.org/uncategorized/fairness-in-sentencing/the-trial-tax-in-america/" data-type="link" data-id="https://interrogatingjustice.org/uncategorized/fairness-in-sentencing/the-trial-tax-in-america/">full weight of prosecutorial forces that love to punish people</a> for insisting on their innocence and/or seek to have their rights respected.</p>
<p>The whole system is stacked against defendants, beginning with the tests that cops treat as actual probable cause when they realistically should be considered nothing more than a hunch. This is the depressing reality of criminal justice in the United States when it comes to field drug tests and people falsely accused by faulty tests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In our survey, <strong>89% of prosecutors reported that guilty pleas are permitted without confirmatory testing</strong> (i.e., follow-up testing by a lab to verify that a field test “positive” result accurately detected an illegal drug).</em></p>
<p><em><strong>67% of drug labs in the U.S. report that they are not asked to review samples when there are plea agreements, and 24% do not receive samples for confirmatory testing</strong> when there are field test results available.</em></p>
<p><em>Even when labs receive samples, <strong>46% report that they will not conduct a confirmatory test if there has been a guilty plea, and 8% report that they will not retest</strong> if there has been a presumptive identification</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn’t justice. This isn’t even a polite hat tip in the direction of justice. This is railroading, aided and abetted by drug labs beholden to cops and almost as disinterested in what happens to people facing criminal charges possibly predicated on incorrect test results. On the law enforcement side, the fact is no one cares and no one cares that no one cares. Courts are the last hope, and even most of those are more than willing to clear dockets quickly and easily by signing off on any plea deal placed in front of them.</p>
<p>As the report notes, it’s not as though cops and prosecutors aren’t aware of the limitations of field drug tests. It’s that they don’t care. All tests come packaged with plenty of verbiage stating how any field test should be verified with a lab test, how dozens of legal substances can trigger false positives, and how tests can be rendered useless by exposure to UV light or elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>But none of that is legally binding. It’s not like improper use results in a voided warranty. It’s not like field drug test makers are going to stop selling to cops just because cops ignore every single instruction printed on the package. Again, this is up to the courts. And low level courts that handle a large percentage of possession cases aren’t going to increase their own workload by forcing prosecutors to verify tests or refuse plea deals based on nothing more than what a cop claimed to have observed while misusing a cheap test prone to false positives.</p>
<p>It’s not that better field drug test tech doesn’t exist. It does. Portable Raman spectrometers, which are capable of producing results comparable to lab equipment (at least according to the Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs), very few law enforcement agencies are going to trade in cheap drug tests they can buy in bulk with actually accurate testing equipment than can cost up to $20,000 per device.</p>
<p>As the report states, the 30,000 wrongful arrests is an extreme undercount. Its survey managed to only find 93 law enforcement agencies willing to discuss field drug test use and only 82 of those actually provided enough information to warrant being included in this report. </p>
<p>Of the few that did respond, there’s even more bad news. This is quite the pair of sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Twelve agencies recently stopped using the tests due to concerns about fentanyl exposure (i.e., a belief that physical contact with fentanyl is, by itself, dangerous for the officer), and two agencies reported that the tests were an unnecessary expense as <strong>suspects were arrested and charged regardless of the test outcome</strong>.</em></p>

<p>Did you get all of that? Twelve agencies have gone <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/20/omnipresent-fentanyl-copaganda-is-turning-normal-citizens-into-fainting-goats/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/20/omnipresent-fentanyl-copaganda-is-turning-normal-citizens-into-fainting-goats/">full fainting goat</a> and two agencies flat out admitted they arrested people whether or not the tests indicated illegal substances. And if arrest is the inevitable outcome, why blow money on field drug tests? </p>
<p>There’s nothing positive in this report, other than the recommendations it suggests, like refusing plea deals backed by nothing but field tests and ensuring all field tests are verified by lab testing. But if <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161206/15130336213/more-prosecutors-refuse-to-accept-guilty-pleas-based-faulty-2-field-drug-tests.shtml" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161206/15130336213/more-prosecutors-refuse-to-accept-guilty-pleas-based-faulty-2-field-drug-tests.shtml">very little of this</a> is happening yet, it’s hard to believe there will be widespread adoption in the future. So, we’ll just get what we’ve been getting for years: tens of thousands of bogus arrests every year — arrests that will be touted by those performing them as indicative of their tireless service to the War on Drugs. The reality, however, will be tens of thousands of destroyed lives and violated rights by tests so questionable they should never have been considered evidence of anything.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p>Mixing new technology and new laws is always a fraught business, especially if the tech in question relates to communication. Lawmakers routinely propose bills that would sweep up all sorts of First Amendment-protected speech. We've seen a lot of this with social media, and we're starting to see it with artificial intelligence. Case in point: the No Artificial Intelligence Fake Replicas And Unauthorized Duplications (No AI FRAUD) Act. Under the auspices of protecting "<a href="https://salazar.house.gov/media/press-releases/salazar-introduces-no-ai-fraud-act">Americans' individual right to their likeness and voice</a>," the bill would restrict a range of content wide enough to ensnare parody videos, comedic impressions, political cartoons, and much more.</p> <p>The bill's sponsors, Reps. María Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) and Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), say they're concerned about "AI-generated fakes and forgeries," per a <a href="https://salazar.house.gov/media/press-releases/salazar-introduces-no-ai-fraud-act">press release</a>. They aim to protect people from unauthorized use of their own images and voices by defining these things as the intellectual property of each individual.</p> <p>The No AI Fraud Act cites several instances of AI being used to make it appear that celebrities created ads or art that they did not actually create. For instance, "AI technology was used to create the song titled 'Heart on My Sleeve,' emulating the voices of recording artists Drake and The Weeknd," states the bill's text. AI technology was also used "to create a false endorsement featuring Tom Hanks' face in an advertisement for a dental plan."</p> <p>But while the examples in the bill are directly related to AI, the bill's actual reach is much more expansive, targeting a wide swath of "digital depictions" or "digital voice replicas."</p> <p>Salazar and Dean say the bill balances people's "right to control the use of their identifying characteristics" with "First Amendment protections to safeguard speech and innovation." But while the measure does nod to free speech rights, it also expands the types of speech deemed legally acceptable to restrict. It could mean way more legal hassles for creators and platforms interested in exercising their First Amendment rights, and result in a chilling effect on certain sorts of comedy, commentary, and artistic expression.</p> <h2><b>An Insanely Broad Bill&nbsp;</b></h2> <p>At its core, <a href="https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/090C34FC92DED2E83456EB85C8E64E44.no-ai-fraud-act.pdf">the No AI Fraud Act</a> is about creating a right to sue someone who uses your likeness or voice without your permission. It states that "every individual has a property right in their own likeness and voice," and people can only use someone's "digital depiction or digital voice replica" in a "manner affecting interstate or foreign commerce" if the individual agrees (in writing) to said use. This agreement must involve a lawyer, and its terms must be governed by a collective bargaining agreement. If any of these three elements are missing, the person whose voice or likeness was used can sue for damages.</p> <p>The bit about <i>interstate or foreign commerce</i> might appear to significantly limit this bill's provisions. But basically, anything involving the internet can be deemed a matter of interstate or foreign commerce.</p> <p>So just how broad is this bill? For starters, it applies to the voices and depictions of all human beings "living or dead." And it defines <i>digital depiction</i> as any "replica, imitation, or approximation of the likeness of an individual that is created or altered in whole or part using digital technology." <em>Likeness</em> means any "actual or simulated image… regardless of the means of creation, that is readily identifiable as the individual." <i>Digital voice replica</i> is defined as any "audio rendering that is created or altered in whole or part using digital technology and is fixed in a sound recording or audiovisual work which includes replications, imitations, or approximations of an individual that the individual did not actually perform." This includes "the actual voice or a simulation of the voice of an individual, whether recorded or generated by computer, artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other digital means, technology, service, or device."</p> <p>These definitions go way beyond using AI to create a fraudulent ad endorsement or musical recording.</p> <p>They're broad enough to include reenactments in a true-crime show, a parody TikTok account, or depictions of a historical figure in a movie.</p> <p>They're broad enough to include sketch-comedy skits, political cartoons, or those Dark Brandon memes.</p> <p>They're broad enough to encompass you using your phone to record an impression of President Joe Biden and posting this online, or a cartoon like<em> South Park</em> or <em>Family Guy</em> including a depiction of a celebrity.</p> <p>And it doesn't matter if the intent is not to trick anyone. The bill says that it's no defense to inform audiences that a depiction "was unauthorized or that the individual rights owner did not participate in the creation, development, distribution, or dissemination of the unauthorized digital depiction, digital voice replica, or personalized closing service."</p> <p>What's more, it's not just the creators of off-limits content that could be sued. Potentially liable parties include anyone who "distributes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to the public a personalized closing service"; anyone who "publishes, performs, distributes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to the public a digital voice replica or digital depiction"; and anyone who "materially contributes to, directs, or otherwise facilitates any of the above" with knowledge that the individual depicted had not consented.&nbsp;This is broad enough to ensnare social media platforms, video platforms, newsletter services, web hosting services, and any entity that enables the sharing of art, entertainment, and commentary. It also applies to the makers of tools that merely allow others to create audio replicas or visual depictions, including tools like ChatGPT that allow for the creation of AI-generated images.</p> <h2><b>But…the First Amendment</b></h2> <p>Apparently aware of obvious First Amendment issues with this proposal, the lawmakers inserted a section saying that "First Amendment protections shall constitute a defense to an alleged violation." But this isn't terribly reassuring, considering that lawmakers are simultaneously trying to expand the categories of speech unprotected by the First Amendment.</p> <p>At present, intellectual property—<a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/law/academics-clinics/what-can-i-study/intellectual-property/intellectual-property-law-basics-certificate/explore-the-four-areas-of-ip-law#:~:text=Intellectual%20Property%20Law%20includes%20patents,ways%20they%20are%20very%20different.">such as copyrighted works and trade secrets</a>—falls under free speech exceptions, meaning restrictions are permitted. By defining one's voice and likeness as intellectual property, the lawmakers are trying to shoehorn depictions of someone else's voice or likeness into the category of unprotected speech.</p> <p>Even as intellectual property, voice replicas and digital depictions of others wouldn't <em>always</em> be prohibited. Just as the doctrine of <a href="https://reason.com/tag/fair-use/">fair use</a> provides some leeway with copyright protections, this bill defines circumstances under which replicas and depictions would be OK, such as when "the public interest in access to the use" outweighs "the intellectual property interest in the voice or likeness."</p> <p>But even if people being sued ultimately prevail on First Amendment grounds, it still means they have to go to court, with all the time and expense that entails. Even for those with the resources to do this, it would be a big headache. And many people do not have the resources to do this, which means that even when the First Amendment is on their side, they're still likely to lose, to cave (by taking down whatever content is being challenged), or to avoid making said content in the first place.</p> <p>You can see how this might seriously chill speech that is protected. People may be afraid to even create art, comedy, or commentary that could get challenged.&nbsp;And tech companies could be afraid to allow such content on their platforms.</p> <p>If this measure becomes law, I would expect to see a lot more takedowns of anything that might come close to being a violation, be it a clip of a <i>Saturday Night Live</i> skit lampooning Trump, a comedic impression of Taylor Swift, or a weird ChatGPT-generated image of Ayn Rand. I would also expect to see more platforms institute blanket bans on parody accounts and the like.</p> <p>The bill stipulates that imitators aren't liable "if the harm caused by such conduct is negligible." But emotional distress counts as harm, which makes this a pretty subjective designation.</p> <p>And some categories of content—such as "sexually explicit" content and "intimate images"—are declared per se harmful (which means there could be no arguing that they did not actually harm the party being depicted and therefore were not actually violations). Supporters will likely argue that this targets things like deepfake porn (where AI is used to make it appear someone appeared in a porn video when they did not). But the language of the law is broad enough to potentially ensnare a wide range of content, including erotic art, commentary that conjures two political figures intimately involved (like those—yes, often silly and sophomoric—images of Trump and Putin in bed together), and comedic/parodic depictions of sexual encounters.</p> <p>There's no doubt that AI is opening up new parameters for creative expression <em>and</em> for deception, raising new questions and presenting new issues that society will have to deal with. But we shouldn't let lawmakers use these hiccups to justify a broad new incursion on free speech rights.</p>						</div></div>]]></description>

</p><p>Situation: Company A creates a service or buys out Company B and integrates them with their website. Years and years go by, with updates to the service slowing to a complete stop as employees quit or are reassigned. One day, Company A decides managing it is too expensive and not worth the effort, so they shut it down.
</p>
<h2><span id="Pushed_out_by_a_competitor">Pushed out by a competitor</span></h2>

</p><p>Situation: Company A runs a service, maybe with a limited market (country, age group etc.) One day multinational Company B appears, covering Company A's services, and soon more and more users think "why not use <i>that</i> service if so many others do?", and a bit later "why use <i>any other</i> service, if everyone uses <i>that</i>?" Unless company A is lucky enough or finds a way to keep users, it can soon end its business, left by the users.
</p><p>Company A may end with symptoms of <a href="#Abandoned">Abandoned</a>, but also may try a redesign to keep users (this can also cause data loss, see <a href="#teh_futurez.211.21">below</a>).
</p><p><b>Exercise</b>: Think of some services you used happily back then, but now even mentioning their name is embarassing. If these services are still active (used by a group of "hardcore" users), it's not too late (but definitely time) to archive them!

</p><p>Situation: Company A does <a rel="nofollow" href="http://itsthisforthat.com/">"Facebook for cats"</a>. Company A grows a small community of loyal <strike>cat soldiers</strike> users, but doesn't gain enough traction to keep things profitable. Company A can't find anyone who's interested in acquiring them, so they shut down.
</p><p>Variation: Company B starts a service that becomes very popular in a short time, showing an exponential growth. CEO of Company B (in fact, just Joey in the garage) has no idea of a good business policy, or never even wanted to make it a big business, so as soon as the HDD gets full, he pulls the plug.

</p><p>Situation: Either Company A releases the new Singing and Dancing Version 2.0 website, which is supposed to succeed nasty old version 1.0, or Company A "pivots" and becomes The All New Shiny Company A. In either case, Company A removes their old website and deletes all of the user data.

</p><p>Situation: Company censors parts of the website for violating its Terms of Service. The evidence for the removal may not be legit. For example, YouTube used an artificial intelligence algorithm to remove videos sympathetic to terrorist groups like <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=ISIS&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="ISIS (page does not exist)">ISIS</a> or <a href="https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Al-Qaeda&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Al-Qaeda (page does not exist)">al-Qaeda</a>. Videos and entire channels documenting war crimes have been removed because the algorithm falsely identified them to be sympathetic to terrorist groups. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2017/11/02/war-crimes-youtube-facebook-syria-rohingya/">[1]</a><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/world/middleeast/syria-youtube-videos-isis.html">[2]</a>

We are excited to announce the creation of a European project December 1st 2023, which 
will run for the next 36 months. This Next Generation Internet pilot named "NGI TALER" is 
operated by a consortium of 11 partners from 8 European countries with the mandate to roll 
out an innovative electronic payment system for the greater benefit of European citizens, 
merchants, and banks. This payment system is different from current online payment 
methods, like credit cards or bank transfers, in that it offers privacy for the buyer: 
neither merchants nor banks can trace or link the payments. It is also a no-risk payment 
option for the merchant as there is no equivalent of fake or stolen credit cards, as 
payments are cleared and confirmed instantly. The payment system is socially, ecologically 
and fiscally responsible: it is not a new currency, there is no energy-consuming 
proof-of-work or proof-of-stake method and clearing is processed much faster than payments 
by credit cards. NGI TALER enforces transparency on the merchants so that states ensure 
that businesses can be held accountable for their income and pay their taxes.
</p>
<p>
NGI TALER is funded as a pilot under the Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative within 
the European Commission's Horizon Europe research funding program. This project is based 
on the free software GNU Taler which has been developed by the GNU community and Taler 
Systems S.A., and which has received wide praise from financial experts including experts 
from several central banks - including the Swiss National Bank (SNB). The goal is to make 
GNU Taler available as payment system via two European banks - GLS Bank (Germany) and 
MagNet Bank (Hungary). NGI TALER's ambition is to reach the European market during the 
project period and have the payment mechanism accepted and widely adopted by the end of 
the project.
</p>
<p>
Under the hood, GNU Taler deploys state-of-the-art cryptography to achieve these features. 
The initial investment into the required infrastructure is low and the payment mechanism 
operates more cost efficiently than existing payment solutions, with lower transaction 
fees - a benefit that will be shared by consumers and merchants. This makes even 
micro-payments possible, creating an interesting and privacy preserving alternative to 
subscription- or advertisement-based revenue for newspapers and other publishers.
</p>
<p>
NGI TALER is coordinated by the Coding Theory and Cryptology group at Eindhoven University 
of Technology and has 10 more partners:
</p><ul>
 <li>Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH),</li>
 <li>small for-profit (Code Blau GmbH, Taler Systems S.A., VisualVest),</li>
 <li>non-profit structures (petites singularités, E-Seniors Association),</li>
 <li>cooperative banks (GLS Bank, MagNet Bank),</li>
 <li>a philanthropic organization (Stichting NLnet) and</li>
 <li>a grassroots movement (Homo Digitalis).</li>
</ul>

        <p>On October 20th, my seven year old son Nikolas suffered cardiac arrest while undergoing a procedure at the hospital to treat an underlying congenital condition. The doctors performed CPR and succeeded in reviving him but ultimately he suffered catastrophic brain damage. My wife and I were in the hospital for nearly a month at his bedside as we awaited his ultimate prognosis.</p><p>What is there to say?</p><div><p><strong>First</strong>, I'm devastated. </p><p><strong>Second</strong>, I'm not going to be giving more details beyond what I write here for now.</p><p><strong>Third</strong>, I'll address those the most common questions, and concerns.</p></div><p><strong>Fourth</strong>, I'm making major changes to my life.</p><p><strong>Fifth</strong>, I will describe a bit about what this situation feels like from the inside. If you have not experienced this kind of tragedy, it will likely surprise you, as it did me.</p><h2 id="devastation">Devastation</h2><div><p>There's three things everybody says to me now:</p><p>"I can't imagine what you're going through."<br>"I don't know how you're handling it."<br>"That must be so hard."</p><p>These statements are true. If you haven't been through this, you don't get it. So let me tell you all about it. It'll be okay. Well, actually it's <em>not </em>okay, but it's okay that it's not okay.</p></div><p>My son is alive, but all of his higher mental functions have been wiped out. He still sleeps and wakes, breathes under his own power, and responds to certain stimuli, but he makes no intentional movements. He moves reflexively, and occasionally smiles and even laughs, but he can't speak and it's not clear what degree of awareness he still has of his situation, if any. The MRI results were conclusive that the damage was widespread and severe, and to such a degree that short of an outright miracle, there is no hope for regeneration through brain "plasticity" or any other known path towards recovery. People don't come back from this kind of injury.</p><p>That's important to say. I believe in miracles, but part and parcel of that belief is the acknowledgement that miracles are by definition rare, and the faith that God is able to grant them must be paired with a complete lack of presumption of receiving one (Daniel 3:17-18, emphases mine):</p><blockquote><sup>17</sup><strong> If it be so</strong>, our God whom we serve <strong>is able to deliver us </strong>from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.<br><sup>18</sup><strong> But if not,</strong> be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</blockquote><p>I would be delighted to hear Nikolas' voice calling out to me tomorrow morning, but I hold no lingering hope that this will happen. That's what it takes to get me through my day. </p><p>I'm reminded of one the little flavor quotes in Act VII in my game <em>Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten</em>:</p><figure><img src="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/image-1.png" alt="Act VII: It is said that men fear death. In my experience, what men truly fear is the uncertainty of death. In all that ordeal, when death was certain, I was possessed by an unassailable calm I have never felt before or since. It was only when the hope of survival appeared that I felt the true grip of terror. - from the Memoirs of Gedemon Dalavbar, Master of Archers, being a History of his Adventures and Exploits in Service to the Ash King" loading="lazy" width="1704" height="960" srcset="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/image-1.png 600w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/12/image-1.png 1600w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/image-1.png 1704w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My friend James Cavin, the game's writer, wrote those words over a decade ago, and I couldn't think of a better way to describe the strangeness of my current situation.</p><p>While hope yet remained, I suffered the most. The most devastating moment in the hospital was opening the MRI report. Up until then we were clinging to hope, and afterwards there was nothing left to do but to live with the loss. Our crushed hopes allow us to get on with the long road ahead.</p><p>As for "I can't imagine how hard that must be"–</p><p>Turns out, unfathomable tragic loss isn't very <em>hard</em>. It's <em>easy</em>, in fact. Easy in the same way that falling off a cliff is "easy"–gravity does all the work for you. It's not like climbing mount Everest, desperately putting one foot in front of the other. It's not like struggling to answer questions in a final exam. Tragic loss is just something that happens to you.</p><h2 id="its-not-hard-just-terrible">It's not hard, just terrible. </h2><p>The grief is different than people expect, too. I cried a lot, but after a certain point you only have so many tears left to cry. I can't cry all day, every day, for months on end.</p><p>And honestly, at this point crying feels <em>good</em>. Crying isn't really when I feel like I'm suffering the most, although I think people on the outside sort of had that expectation. There's this implicit assumption from other people that you will have a very legible grief, to "put on sad-face," so to speak.</p><p>But!</p><p>This isn't one of those essays where the author describes their personal suffering in great detail and then passively aggressively berates all the readers who haven't suffered to the exact same level for being somehow morally deficient, as has become vogue in the popular press over the last ten years.</p><p>Because guess what – two months ago I would have been <em>just like </em>most of you! Two months ago, if I were talking to someone who was in the position I find myself in now, I'd ask all the same "insensitive" and "inappropriate" questions, all the while being desperately afraid I was being insensitive and inappropriate. So everyone should just relax. I lost my son, it's terrible. No, you're not a bad person for asking me how I'm doing. Yes, everything's weird. I know you don't know what to say. I don't know what to say either. Nobody does. It's fine. </p><h2 id="what-were-in-for">What We're In For</h2><p>My son is alive, severely brain damaged, bedridden, and unable to care for himself. We took him off of all medical supports and moved him into home hospice care. This means that we stopped the artificial ventilator and IV's, as well as all medicines and treatments other than those aimed at comfort and pain relief, and moved him into a hospital bed we have installed at home. </p><p>The doctors initially thought he would quickly die after being taken off the ventilator, but he has persisted for about a month now. He receives food and water through a feeding tube, medicine for pain relief and comfort, and daily care from my wife and I as well as from hospice nurses who visit during the week. </p><p>The fact is, Nikolas could very well live for years or even decades to come, and my wife and I will take care of him up until that moment. We do not stand for euthanasia, but neither will we prolong his life through heroic and artificial life support measures. Food, water, comfort, and daily care–these he will receive from us, indefinitely.</p><p>This is not the sort of thing that can be easily outsourced unless I were to commit my son to a facility, which we will not do as it would drastically reduce our ability to see him on a daily basis. This puts a large daily burden of work, material expense, and restriction on personal freedom. We take this burden gladly.</p><p>Fortunately, we have been able to qualify for public medical assistance in this regard and it looks like we are going to be financially okay for the time being. I am grateful that I also have a strong private support network should I have to lean on it. <strong>To be 100% clear, I am not asking for money and I neither need nor want anyone to offer me any.</strong></p><h2 id="changes">Changes</h2><p>My nearly complete game, <em>Defender's Quest 2: Mists of Ruin</em> was originally supposed to ship at the end of 2023, but that's now been obviously delayed. I'm very grateful to our publisher, Armor Games, for being understanding in the midst of this tragedy.</p><p>A couple things are changing from the original plan before this all happened.</p><p><strong>First</strong>, this is the end of my professional game career. There will be a lot I have to say about this in the future, but the short version is with all the obligations I now have (particularly ongoing medical expenses) I am suddenly in the need of a much more stable, predictable, and boring career. I was successful early on, but as the years went by I found myself having to juggle development with any number of day jobs and side gigs due to the inherent instability of indie game development. I've loved my time in games, but I have to move on. I will write a post-mortem of my 10+ years in games sometime, as I have had some real accomplishments above and beyond the two Defender's Quest games that I am quite proud of to this day.</p><p><strong>Second</strong>, I am no longer a daily member of the DQ2 development team. This is particularly painful for me given that I was nearly at the end of a ten year journey for a game that's been in development since before any of my three children were born, but losing one of those children has upended my priorities.</p><p>But DQ2 is neither cancelled nor abandoned. </p><p>It was always Level Up Labs, LLC, not Lars Doucet, who bore the ultimate responsibility for the game's development, and I am but a part of that company. My co-founder, Anthony Pecorella, has heroically stepped up to the plate and coordinated the final stages of development in my absence. I am still in an advisory role and will make sure the final game is a good one, but I simply no longer have the capacity to do this with the new daily burdens in my life. I will try, if possible, to make sure we fulfill all of the pre-order campaign obligations (I've kept all the records), but I will ask for people's understandings if we fall short in certain regards or some of the goodies wind up being delayed. </p><p>As always, if you are unhappy with your preorder for any reason, email leveluplabs@gmail.com and we will cheerfully refund your money.</p><p><strong>Third</strong>, GameDataCrunch.com is officially defunct for good, at least under my direction. I still have all the source code, scripts, databases and other stuff for it, so anyone with decent web development skills (it's mostly just a pile of php, javascript, cron jobs, and MySQL) could easily resurrect it and keep it going. I have some people in mind for this already, but if you want to make your own pitch for why I should turn it over to you I'd be more than happy to hear it: email me at lars dot doucet at gmail dot com.</p><p><strong>Fourth</strong>, I now have one and only one job, which is working on real estate mass appraisal valuation technology for the purposes of accurately and credibly measuring the value of land separately from buildings and improvements. This is the kind of straightforward, steady, stable, boring work that I need to support my family right now. It also conveniently lines up with <a href="https://www.landisabigdeal.com/?ref=fortressofdoors.com" rel="noreferrer">my niche interests</a>.</p><p>And with that, I'm left with the new normal.</p><h2 id="its-strange">It's Strange</h2><p>I'm shocked at how quickly our family adapted to the situation. Our two girls (ages five and ten) have proved remarkably resilient, and help with Nikolas' daily care with eagerness and calm. We still read to him at bed time, pray with him, and sing his favorite songs. I know that he almost certainly can't hear us in his current physical form, and though I don't know how eternity relates to the physical world that's welded to the arrow of time, I like to think that Nikolas watches us from Heaven and hears us in that way (and perhaps I am watching there alongside him from the other side).</p><p>The best metaphor I can give for the daily home hospice care of your own seven year old son is a monastic vocation. It's menial work, tied to the hours of the day, an obligation and an obedience, for the rest of my life, or his, whichever comes first. Nikolas has becomes a living altar to his own memory.</p><p>I do not want to paint an overly rosy picture. I re-experience the trauma of losing him every time I see him, and it is deeply painful to see him in his reduced state. But all I have left to give him is my love, expressed in his daily care.</p><p>There are many costs, and not just in terms of time and money. My wife and I can no longer leave the house at the same time without finding someone with adequate training to watch over Nikolas while we are gone. I'm grateful that we were fairly boring homebound personalities, as this means we have been forced to give up much less than other couples would experience in this situation.</p><p>I won't be traveling much in the future, for obvious reasons, but we will find a way to make the most essential trips should the need arise.</p><p>The other thing I want to convey to people is that although I'm sad and experiencing a great loss, I cling relentlessly to joy. Since I was a small child I always hated a particular kind of tragic story, and I still feel that way today. I did not hate tragedies in general, or any story with a sad ending, but specifically the kind of story where not only does something terrible happen to beloved characters, but the kind of story where it's very obvious that the author is making some kind of nihilistic statement in doing so, sort of turning to face the reader, saying, <em>Now do you see, you naïve moron? Life is naught but pain, and you're a fool and a worm for not being as miserable as me!</em></p><p>Enough.</p><p>Look, the news media inundates us every day with endless tales of genuine horror and suffering, because in a world with billions of people <em>that will always be happening somewhere</em>. Life is and will always be fundamentally unfair, and the vale of tears filled with a never-ending parade of horrors. And yet, it's also true that for the median person on Earth, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better?ref=fortressofdoors.com" rel="noreferrer">life is much better today than ever before in human history</a>. </p><p>My own story is exactly one such example – the fact that I'm devastated to lose my son to a crippling injury highlights another fact–that this very thing has become so rare in my country as to be "unimaginable." We should rejoice at this! Losing a child used to be so unremarkably commonplace that <em>everyone</em>, even emperors and kings, routinely suffered it until approximately yesterday.</p><p>The correct adjective for the tragedy I'm experiencing is not "unimaginable" but <em>unfathomable</em>. I can imagine it just fine because it's happening to me, and you can imagine it too now because I'm describing it to you. And because we can imagine it, we can turn and face it, and, with God's grace, we can lift up our cross and bear it, somehow. </p><p>But what none of us can do is to measure–to <em>fathom–</em>the depth of it.</p><blockquote>Stand at the brink of the abyss of despair, and when you see that you cannot bear it anymore, draw back a little and have a cup of tea.<p>— Elder Sophrony of Essex</p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png 600w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png 1000w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/11/portable-web-documents.html">https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/11/portable-web-documents.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39036774">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><img src="https://getpolarized.io/assets/images/portable-web-documents-scaled.png">

<p>Portable Web Documents are a technology similar to PDFs (Portable Document
Format) implemented in Polar which support offline caching of full HTML
documents, and with (in the future) improved support for video, charts, and
other compelling features.</p>
<p>Polar uses PWDs and PDFs to manage the users reading and allows the user to keep
all documents in a central repository and allows for suspend/resume of reading,
tagging, and annotation.</p>
<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkEo5YmNukY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<br>
<h2>Why a New Document Format?</h2>
<p>PDFs are great and have gotten us pretty far to date but I think their future
is limited.</p>
<p>They're perfect for laying out text and charts in a static format plus
preserving the document long term and of course sending them via email or
storing them in the cloud.</p>
<p>But they also have a few major limitations.</p>
<p>They only support static layouts - not fluid/dynamic layouts that change when
you resize the page.</p>
<p>Don't have support for features like video, animated images, interactive charts.</p>
<p>They also have limited form support.</p>
<p>Printing HTML pages as PDFs is also difficult as HTML wasn't designed to be
paginated and without explicit support for CSS form-feed on certain items
(large images) the resulting PDF becomes mangled and hard to read. </p>
<h2>HTML in a Portable Document Format?</h2>
<p>What if we could combine the benefits of PDFs with the benefits of HTML content?</p>
<p>HTML is amazing and supports a lot of compelling features that are not possible
in PDF but they're also limited in a few key areas.</p>
<p>If any of the resources in your document vanishes it's effectively broken.</p>
<p>It would also be nice to have the ability to cache a page offline in perpetuity.  </p>
<p>HTML pages can (for the most part) be censored.  If your ISP or government orders
a website offline you might be out of luck.</p>
<h2>Portable Web Documents to the Rescue</h2>
<p>Polar supports a file format called Portable Web Documents (PWDs) (note
internally we still refer to these as PHZs since we're still in development of a
finalize document format) which supports the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>PWDs are essentially a full HTML document including all dependent resources
bundled in a zip file archive.</p>
<p>There are some associated file formats like WARC and MHTML that attempt to solve
this problem but only really get you about 30-50% of a complete solution.</p>
<p>WARCs or example can't actually be loaded properly in Chrome due to chrome's
inability to handle service workers elegantly in chrome extensions or to serve
resources directly via request handlers. </p>
<p>Request handlers can only redirect you to a new URL.  They can't really replace
content.   </p>
<p>Due to cross origin issues and other web complexities it's better to take the
entire document, rewrite the URLs and properly handle dependent resources,
and re-bundle into a new layout which bypasses all these technical challenges.</p>
<h2>Capture and Storage.</h2>
<p>Capture is by far the biggest challenge in making PWDs as representing the
original form an intent of the web designer (and the reader) as a document can
sometimes be very challenging.</p>
<p>To create a PWD we first have to capture it and this requires support from the
browser.</p>
<p>Right now Polar implements capture via Electron.  We allow the user to preview
the URL then store the data directly into a rewritten PWD image.</p>
<p>However, the web isn't really static anymore.</p>
<p>You can't just take the CSS stylesheets and  references and store them.</p>
<p>You also have to look at the <em>live</em> DOM.</p>
<p>Many toolkits like React actually modify the DOM directly and manipulate and
redefine CSS styles.  These have to be written correctly or you will break
page load.</p>
<p>Now you have to deactivate all scripts and event handlers so that when the
PWD loads it's in a neutralized document. You wouldn't want scripts running due
to potential security issues.</p>
<p>Now you have to think about web fonts, iframes, and potentially extract metadata
from the page including title, description and possibly microdata so that the
PWD has the same metadata exposed in its internal metadata manifest.</p>
<p>This is just an abbreviated list of course of some of the challenges.  There are
another 10-20 issues that we have to be careful when creating PWDs.</p>
<p>We still have some challenges now that we're unsure how to handle.</p>
<p>For example, some iframes only load when they're visible so we enabled a cheat
to expand the preview window to trigger them to load.</p>
<p>However, this caused another ugly bug where some websites like to 'auto-paginate'
so that when you're at the bottom of a page you're given a full related article
in the hope that you stay with the site longer.</p>
<p>These issues are mutually exclusive though.  A solution for one breaks the
solution for the other so we're stuck in a catch 22 until we have a workaround.</p>
<h2>Current Limitations</h2>
<p>We do have some limitations currently which I'd like to lift in the future.</p>
<p>Technically we only support static layouts. PWDs could also support fully fluid
layouts as well which would be really exciting.</p>
<p>It would be nice to support caching of video, audio, images, and interactive
charts.  </p>
<p>This would make PWDs sort of like a 'young lady's illustrated primer' (if you've
ever read Diamond Age) where a book is now fully interactive.</p>
<p>This would also mean that this interactivity would work offline and be fully
interactive!  </p>
<p>Right now Polar is limited to capturing within Electron which means we can't
access the user's cookies and prevents some URLs from loading properly.</p>
<p>We're porting our capture code to our chrome extension to mitigate this and
this should be fixed shortly.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>Polar wanted something like PWDs so that we can enable some cool features in the
future.</p>
<p>The first (which we have now actually) is just full offline archival of web
pages to prevent them from being deleted.  If the content is important you don't
want it to vanish.</p>
<p>We also want a way for users to collaborate around web content.  Add
annotations, comments, etc.</p>
<p>We ideally don't want the content to vanish so PWDs allow us to keep it
associated with the users document store.</p>
<p>We'd also like to enable features where users can exchange documents directly
without relying on the original site.</p>
<p>This allows us to bypass censorship for documents that might be sensitive
outside of their host country.  </p>
<p>We also want to support video, audio, and interactive charting formats. Video
is a bit difficult as we need to determine how to stream and store the video
within the compressed archive and stream it efficiently.  </p>
<p>Our plan is to use web workers and service workers to decompress it in a
background thread.</p>
<p>Interactive charts and spreadsheets are also compelling but I don't want to just
enable raw Javascript support.  It might be possible that something like WASM
could solve this by putting the controls in a sandbox.</p>
<p>We also need a strategy to preserve teh fonts long term.  Right now we don't
store the fonts along with the PWD because they can increase the size by about
2x.  </p>
<p>It might be nice for a system like Polar to have sort of a shared CDN so that
fonts are only stored once but this creates problems with dependencies which
aren't ideal.</p>
<h2>Working with Portable Web Documents</h2>
<p>If you'd like to play with the current version of PWDs download Polar and take
it for a spin.</p>
<p>Right now you can view them in the webapp but can't create them so you need to
download the desktop version of Polar.</p>
<p>We're planning on fixing this issue in the next big refactor to embed the
capture process in our chrome extension.</p>
<p>Once created the captured document is stored within Polar as a normal document
just like any PDF doc.</p>
<p>You get all the normal Polar features including tagging, annotation, flashcard
creation, cloud sync, etc.</p>
<p>If you have any feedback please jump on our Discord or create a github issue.</p></section></div>]]></description>

                  Web Components
                </h2><p>Web Components are a set of browser APIs that allow us to create custom HTML elements. <strong>They are one of the major things that SPA (Single Page Application) frameworks have been giving us for a long time.</strong> Frameworks like Vue, React, Angular or Svelte have their own approach and APIs for creating and using reusable, isolated UI components. This framework-specific philosophy has been widely used for quite a long time right now. It has a few unfortunate consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>It depends on a specific framework </li>
<li>Complexity - to be used productively, most SPA frameworks require complex tooling and host of dependencies</li>
<li>Components can be reused only in the context of a specific framework</li>
<li>Framework updates often render components not usable anymore (anyone has changed, or tried to, major versions of Vue or React recently?)</li>
<li>If we decide to change the framework, we have to throw away our own components or a library we were using, and migrate to another one. This new library might not have everything that we need or may have a completely different API</li>
<li>We need to learn the specifics of each framework in order to use and create components. This knowledge is framework-specific and not universal at all</li>
</ul>
<p><br>Luckily, for quite a long time right now, we have <em>Web Components</em>, native to the browser way of creating reusable, custom HTML elements. In a nutshell, <strong>we can encapsulate any behavior we want in the specific JavaScript class. We can then use it in the HTML, in the same way as we use <em>div</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>input</em>, <em>button</em> or any other, browser-native element</strong>.</p>
<p>Creating <em>Web Components</em> is extremely straightforward. To illustrate, let's say that we would like to have something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;custom-message 
  category="Curiosities" 
  message="Some interesting message"&gt;
&lt;/custom-message&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>All we need is a few lines of JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code>class CustomMessage extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    const category = this.getAttribute("category");
    const message = this.getAttribute("message");
    this.innerHTML = `
      &lt;div&gt;You've got an interesting message, from ${category} category:&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;${message}&lt;/div&gt;`;
  }
}

customElements.define('custom-message', CustomMessage);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>That is all! No extra tooling and zero dependencies required.</strong> If we add to this the ability to observe attribute values changes and lifecycle callbacks:</p>
<pre><code>...

static observedAttributes = ["category", "message"];

attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) {
  console.log(`${name} attribute was changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}!`);
}

connectedCallback() {
  console.log("Element was added to the DOM!");
}

disconnectedCallback() {
  console.log("Element was removed from the DOM!");    
}

...
</code></pre>
<p>...there is virtually no limit to what we can do with <em>Web Components</em>! Moreover, <strong>there is also a possibility of creating Shadow (hidden) DOM with scoped CSS, but it is quite complex, has its drawbacks and is frankly not needed in the majority of cases</strong>. Because of that, we will stick with the basics here:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating custom elements in JavaScript by extending <em>HTMLElement</em> class and registering them in the <em>customElements</em> registry</li>
<li>consuming custom elements in the HTML</li>
<li>using plain old DOM (Document Object Model) and CSS</li>
<li>using lifecycle callbacks and attributes change observers</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we shall ask the question: how and why can we utilize <em>Web Components</em> in the context of <em>HTMX</em>?</p>

                <h2 id="htmx">
                  HTMX
                </h2><p>I wrote quite an extensive article about <a href="https://htmx.org/" target="_blank"><em>HTMX</em></a> which you can find <a href="https://binaryigor.com/htmx-simpler-web-based-app-or-system.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
For the sake of completeness, let's give a short definition: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTMX is a JavaScript library that allows making arbitrary http requests from any HTML element, not only from forms, links or videos. It expects HTML in response, and renders whole HTML pages or fragments directly in the page section we have specified. We do not need to exchange JSON or any other data format with the server only to then translate it to HTML on the client side, so that it can be rendered. It is done automatically by HTMX, we just need to use its own, custom HTML attributes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>It is highly interesting, useful and a promising technology. It simplifies many things and allows us to build <em>SPA</em> or <em>SPA-like</em> applications without complex tooling, dependencies, frameworks and mostly without writing application-specific JavaScript code. In a way, it is a JavaScript library thanks to which we do not need to write our own JavaScript. We can just have one application, no frontend/backend distinction, and that is it (simplifying a little of course, but <a href="https://www.ufried.com/blog/simplify_1/" target="_blank">it simplifies soo many things</a>). There is one thing that I find missing though. There is no straightforward way to create isolated and reusable components where we can encapsulate HTML templates and JavaScript (if needed) related to a given component. <strong>Wouldn't it be amazing, if we can create a library of reusable, framework-agnostic components that can be then used in all HTMX-based applications?</strong> All of that is perfectly doable with Web Components, so let's dive in!</p>

                <h2 id="assumptions">
                  Assumptions
                </h2><p>In our solution, we make the following assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>We will not use <em>Shadow DOM</em>. HTMX does not work with it and I would argue that it complicates things and is mostly not needed to create useful, isolated and reusable Web Components</li>
<li>We will make our components fully configurable from the outside. This generic approach will allow us to arbitrarily, externally style these components, make using them together with HTMX extremely simple, and at the same time components do not need to know anything about HTMX</li>
<li>For styling, we will use <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a>. We could also use custom, scoped CSS, but it is significantly easier to do with Tailwind, and it is an amazing and astoundingly simple tool on its own, so why not use it? </li>
<li>This is about <em>Web Components</em> in the context of <em>HTMX</em> afterall, so they need to be easy to use together. Luckily, point <em>2.</em> covers us here</li>
</ol>

                <h2 id="solution-walkthrough">
                  Solution walkthrough
                </h2><p>Repo with referenced code, all and more examples can be found <a href="https://github.com/BinaryIgor/code-examples/tree/master/flexible-web-components" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to be as generic as possible, but at the same time to have as simple API as possible, so to make configuring our components simple (by HTML attributes) I have come up with the following convention:</p>
<pre><code>{component-element}:{attribute}="{value}"
</code></pre>
<p>To illustrate how it works, here is the <em>InfoModal</em> example (classes are from Tailwind CSS):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;info-modal 
  id="info-modal" 
  container:class="bg-black/80"
  content:class="bg-amber-300 border-solid border-4 border-black rounded-md m-auto mt-32 px-8 pt-8 pb-32 w-3/5"
  message:class="text-lg italic"
  close:class="text-2xl p-4 cursor-pointer"
  close-icon="&amp;#10006;"&gt;
&lt;/info-modal&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, <em>container:*</em> attributes will be copied without <em>container:</em> prefix to the <em>container element</em> of the <em>info-modal</em> component. <em>Content:*</em> attributes will be copied without <em>content:</em> prefix to the <em>content element</em> and so on, for all supported and exposed elements of the <em>info-modal</em> component. Resulting HTML is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;info-modal 
  id="info-modal" 
  container:class="bg-black/80" 
  content:class="bg-amber-300 border-solid border-4 border-black rounded-md m-auto mt-32 px-8 pt-8 pb-32 w-3/5" 
  message:class="text-lg italic" 
  close:class="text-2xl p-4 cursor-pointer"
  close-icon="&amp;#10006;"&gt;

  &lt;!-- style attributes are set internally by the component --&gt;
  &lt;div 
    style="display: none;" 
    &lt;!-- container has its own non-overridable class, ours is appended --&gt;
    class="fixed z-10 left-0 top-0 w-full h-full overflow-auto bg-black/80"&gt;
    &lt;div 
      style="position: relative;" 
      class="bg-amber-300 border-solid border-4 border-black rounded-md m-auto mt-32 px-8 pt-8 pb-32 w-3/5"&gt;
      &lt;span 
        &lt;!-- close has its own non-overridable class, ours is appended --&gt;
        class="absolute top-0 right-0 text-2xl p-4 cursor-pointer"&gt;
          &amp;#10006;
      &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;!-- title has its own default class --&gt;
      &lt;div class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2"&gt;Default title&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;!-- message does not have a default class, ours is set --&gt;
      &lt;div class="text-lg italic"&gt;Default message&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/info-modal&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><br>To make it possible, I created a <em>Components object</em>, which has the following, main method:</p>
<pre><code>export const Components = {
  // element is a custom element reference,
  // elementId is a name of atrributes element,
  // like "container", "content", "input" and so on
  mappedAttributes(element, elementId,
    { defaultAttributes = {},
      defaultClass = "",
      // add (concatenate) attributes/class to the current ones
      toAddAttributes = {},
      toAddClass = "",
      // skip some attributes while copying/transforming
      toSkipAttributes = [],
      // change content:class to class, 
      // while copying attributes, or keep it as it is
      keepId = false } = {}) {

    let baseAttributes = baseAtrributesFromDefaults(defaultAttributes, defaultClass);

    let mappedAttributes = mappedAttributesWithDefaults(element, elementId, baseAttributes, toSkipAttributes, keepId);

    mappedAttributes = mappedAttributesWithToAddValues(mappedAttributes, toAddAttributes, toAddClass);

    // turn this map of element attributes into a string like:
    // id="custom-element-id"
    // class="custom-element-class"
    // hx-post="/validate"
    return Object.entries(mappedAttributes)
      .map(e =&gt; `${e[0]}="${e[1]}"`)
      .join("\n");
},

...
</code></pre>
<p>Default attributes will be overridden by anything that a client supplies and additional attributes will be added to the current ones, using simple string concatenation. <em>DefaultClass</em> and <em>toAddClass</em> are treated in the same way as <em>defaultAttributes</em> and <em>toAddAttributes</em> - they are separate parameters for the sake of API simplicity.</p>
<p>We then make use of the <em>Components object</em> in our custom components (<em>InfoModal</em> again):</p>
<pre><code>...

const containerAttributes = Components.mappedAttributes(this, "container", {
  toAddClass: containerClass,
  defaultClass: containerClassDefault
});
const contentAttributes = Components.mappedAttributes(this, "content", {
  defaultClass: contentClassDefault
});

...

this.innerHTML = `
&lt;div style="display: none;" ${containerAttributes}&gt;
  &lt;div style="position: relative;" ${contentAttributes}&gt;
    &lt;span ${closeAttributes}&gt;${closeIcon}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div ${titleAttributes}&gt;${titleToRender}&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div ${messageAttributes}&gt;${messageToRender}&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;`;

...
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, <strong>this is extremely generic and has nothing to do with HTMX: we just allow to inject arbitrary, external attributes into all elements exposed by a component</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Using HTMX is mostly about setting its attributes on HTML elements.</strong> Our generic approach has thus interesting consequences: we can take components created in that way (without any knowledge about HTMX) and use them together with HTMX in the following manner (<em>InputWithError</em>):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input-with-error 
  input:type="text"
  input:name="message"
  input:placeholder="Input something..."
  &lt;!-- HTMX starts here --&gt;
  input:hx-post="/validate"
  input:hx-trigger="input changed delay:500ms"
  input:hx-swap="outerHTML"
  input:hx-target="next input-error"&gt;
&lt;/input-with-error&gt;
</code></pre>

                <h2 id="htmx-examples">
                  HTMX examples
                </h2><p>Let's walk through a few concrete examples of <em>Web Components</em> used together with <em>HTMX</em>.</p>

                <h3 id="confirmable-modal">
                  Confirmable Modal
                </h3><p>We quite often face a need for certain requests to be confirmed by the user, before actually issuing them. There is a special HTMX attribute that we can use for that purpose: <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-confirm/" target="_blank">hx-confirm</a>. Having <em>confirmable-modal</em> similar to <em>info-modal</em> from one of the previous examples, we can write the following HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;confirmable-modal 
  title="Delete confirmation"
  ok-text="Delete"&gt;
&lt;/confirmable-modal&gt;

&lt;button 
  hx-delete="/test"
  hx-confirm="Are you sure to delete this test entity?"
  hx-target="#delete-result"&gt;
  Try to confirm
&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To capture requests, sent by HTMX, and show <em>confirmable-modal</em> beforehand, we need to add the following JavaScript to our page:</p>
<pre><code>const confirmableModal = document.querySelector("confirmable-modal");

document.addEventListener("htmx:confirm", e =&gt; {
  // do not issue http request
  e.preventDefault();

  confirmableModal.onOk = () =&gt; {
    // ok clicked, issue stopped previously http request
    e.detail.issueRequest(e);
    // hide modal after sending the request
    confirmableModal.hide();
  };

  // show confirmable modal with question configured through htmx attribute
  confirmableModal.show({ message: e.detail.question });
});
</code></pre>
<p>This will show our modal before issuing a http request which looks like:</p>

    <figcaption>ConfirmableModal after calling show() method</figcaption>
</figure>



                <h3 id="order-form-and-list">
                  Order Form and List
                </h3><p>Building on previously shown <em>input-with-error</em> and <em>info-modal</em>, we can have a <em>form-container</em> that provides common form functionalities. As the name suggests, it is just a container, so it accepts and can work with any number of inputs, specification of which is left completely to a client. Common form functionalities include features like enabling/disabling form submission, clearing all inputs after successful submission, or showing generic error after failed submission. In the context of HTMX, having a form element allows us to send all form inputs data in a straightforward way. To make the example more relevant to HTMX, in the form we will be able to specify a new <em>order</em> entity. After failed submission, an error will be shown, using <em>info-modal</em>. After successful submission, a new <em>order</em> will be added to the orders list. Here is the simplified HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;info-modal 
  id="error-modal" 
  &lt;!-- Add value to default title class attribute --&gt;
  title:add:class="text-red-500" 
  title="Something went wrong..."&gt;
&lt;/info-modal&gt;

&lt;form-container
  form:id="order-form"
  form:class="rounded bg-slate-200 p-2 max-w-screen-md"
  form:hx-post="/orders"
  form:hx-target="#orders"
  submit:class="py-2 rounded bg-slate-100 mt-4 w-full"
  submit:value="Add Order"&gt;

  &lt;input-with-error 
    container:class="mb-2"
    &lt;!-- Add value to default input class attribute --&gt;
    input:add:class="w-full"
    input:name="id"
    input:placeholder="Order id"
    input:hx-post="/orders/validate-id"
    input:hx-trigger="input changed delay:500ms"
    input:hx-swap="outerHTML"
    input:hx-target="next-input-error"
    &lt;!-- Send also secret input from below (secret-input is its id),
     id and secret validations are related --&gt;
    input:hx-include="#secret-input"&gt;
  &lt;/input-with-error&gt;
    
  &lt;!-- Similar to above, definitions of other inputs:
   name, description, secret --&gt;

&lt;/form-container&gt;

&lt;ul id="orders" class="space-y-2 max-w-screen-md"&gt;
  ${ordersHtml()}
&lt;/ul&gt;

...

function ordersHtml() {
  return orders.map(o =&gt;
  `&lt;div class="rounded bg-slate-100 p-2"&gt;
     &lt;div&gt;Id: ${o.id}&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div&gt;Name: ${o.name}&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div&gt;Description: ${o.description}&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div&gt;Secret: ${o.secret}&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;`)
  .join("\n");
}
</code></pre>
<p><br>Additionally, we need to add some JavaScript, so that <em>info-modal</em> and a few of the <em>form-container</em> features can work:</p>
<pre><code>const errorModal = document.getElementById("error-modal");

const formContainer = document.querySelector("form-container");

formContainer.addEventListener("htmx:afterRequest", e =&gt; {
  const form = document.getElementById("order-form");
  // we only care about requests sent by the form,
  // not other of its many elements (inputs mainly)
  if (e.srcElement == form) {
    // error text response from the server
    const error = e.detail.failed ? e.detail.xhr.response : "";
    // this will enable form submission again,
    // and clear inputs only if error is empty/undefined
    formContainer.afterSubmit({ error: error });
    // show error only if there is one
    if (error) {
      errorModal.show({ message: error });
    }
  }
});
</code></pre>
<p><br>This how it looks with input errors:</p>

                <h2 id="flexible-and-copyable-web-components-collection">
                  Flexible and Copyable Web Components collection
                </h2><p>With the described approach, it is possible to create a collection of generic, reusable, flexible and framework-agnostic Web Components. <strong>When it comes to UI components, I think white box philosophy is superior: we should have access to the simple source code of components, they should be designed to be copied and possibly tinker with, and not used as a black box dependency.</strong> This is because, it is often the case that a given component <em>almost</em> matches our needs, but not exactly - in that situation it is a true lifesaver to have control and ability to change them. <a href="https://tailwindui.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind UI</a> takes a similar approach, but is not open-sourced; it is a paid tool and it focuses on framework-specific components.</p>
<p>There are a few libraries and collections of Web Components out there, most notably <a href="https://shoelace.style/" target="_blank">Shoelace</a>. This is a step in the right direction, but unfortunately, they also use other tools, dependencies and additional abstractions and take a rather black box approach - they are meant to be used as a closed dependency, not something to copy, understand and tinker with. Additionally, they mostly use <em>Shadow DOM</em> and because of that, they can not be used with <em>HTMX</em>. I would love to see a collection of components created with a similar approach to the one described here: without unnecessary abstractions and with different, white box philosophy in mind. It means that these components would have a simple to understand source code with zero or minimal dependencies. Furthermore, they would be completely configurable from the outside, designed to be rather copied and possibly modified - not used as a black box dependency.</p>

                  Closing thoughts
                </h2><p>As we saw, Web Components are extremely easy to create and use with HTMX. <strong>They solve an important problem when working with HTMX: how and where should we define reusable components that also might need to use JavaScript to enhance their behavior, not only HTML?</strong> Additionally, if created with described here, generic approach to configuration through attributes, they can be extremely flexible and reusable:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input-with-error 
  container:class="mb-2"
  input:add:class="w-full"
  input:type="password"
  input:name="secret"
  input:id="secret-input"
  input:placeholder="Order secret, compatibility with id is required"     
  input:hx-post="/orders/validate-secret"
  input:hx-trigger="input changed delay:500ms"
  input:hx-swap="outerHTML"
  input:hx-target="next input-error"
  input-error:id="secret-error"&gt;
&lt;/input-with-error&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Even though they do not know anything about HTMX, it turns out that it is a breeze to connect these two technologies!</p>

        <p>PANAMA CITY (AP) — A severe drought that began last year has forced authorities to slash ship crossings by 36% in the Panama Canal, one of the world's most important trade routes.</p>
              <p>The new cuts announced Wednesday by authorities in Panama are set to deal an even greater economic blow than previously expected. </p>
              <p>Canal administrators now estimate that dipping water levels could cost them between $500 million and $700 million in 2024, compared to previous estimates of $200 million. </p>
              <p>One of the most severe droughts to ever hit the Central American nation has stirred chaos in the 50-mile maritime route, causing a traffic jam of boats, casting doubts on the canal's reliability for international shipping and raising concerns about its affect on global trade.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, Panama Canal Administrator Ricaurte Vásquez said they would cut daily ship crossings to 24, after already gradually slashing crossings last year from 38 a day in normal times.</p>
              <p>"It's vital that the country sends a message that we're going to take this on and find a solution to this water problem," Vásquez said.</p>
              <p>Vásquez added that in the first quarter of the fiscal year the passageway saw 20% less cargo and 791 fewer ships than the same period the year before.</p>
              <p>It was a “significant reduction” for the country, Vásquez said. But the official said that more “efficient” water management and a jump in rainfall in November has at least enabled them to ensure that water levels are high enough for 24 ships to pass daily until the end of April, the start of the next rainy season.</p>
              <p>Canal authorities attributed the drought to the El Niño weather phenomenon and climate change, and warned it was urgent for Panama to seek new water sources for both the canal's operations and human consumption. The same lakes that fill the canal also provide water for more than 50% of the country of more than 4 million people.</p>
              <p>“The water problem is a national problem, not just of the Canal,” Vásquez said. “We have to address this issue across the entire country.”</p>

<p>Private equity firms are increasingly buying hospitals across the US, and when they do, patients suffer, according to two separate reports. Specifically, the equity firms cut corners, slash services, lay off staff, lower quality of care, take on substantial debt, and reduce charity care, leading to lower ratings and more medical errors, the reports collectively find.</p>
<p>Last week, the financial watchdog organization Private Equity Stakeholder Project (PESP) released <a href="https://pestakeholder.org/news/new-report-details-harm-caused-to-healthcare-industry-by-apollo/">a repor</a>t delving into the state of two of the nation's largest hospital systems, Lifepoint and ScionHealth—both owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Through those two systems, Apollo runs 220 hospitals in 36 states, employing around 75,000 people.</p>
<p>The report found that some of Apollo's hospitals were among the worst in their respective states, based on a ranking by The Lown Institute Hospital Index. The index ranks hospitals and health systems based on health equity, value, and outcomes, PESP notes. The hospitals also have dismal readmission rates and government rankings. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ranks hospitals on a one-to-five star system, with the national average of 3.2 stars overall and about 30 percent of hospitals at two stars or below. Apollo's overall average is 2.8 stars, with nearly 40 percent of hospitals at two stars or below.</p>
<h2>Patterns</h2>
<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2813379">The other report</a>, a study published in JAMA late last month, found that the rate of serious medical errors and health complications increases among patients in the first few years after private equity firms take over. The study examined Medicare claims from 51 private equity-run hospitals and 259 matched control hospitals.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Specifically, the study, led by researchers at Harvard University, found that patients admitted to private equity-owned hospitals had a 25 percent increase in developing hospital-acquired conditions compared with patients in the control hospitals. In private equity hospitals, patients experienced a 27 percent increase in falls, a 38 percent increase in central-line bloodstream infections (despite placing 16 percent fewer central lines than control hospitals), and surgical site infections doubled.</p>
<p>"These findings heighten concerns about the implications of private equity on health care delivery," the authors concluded.</p>
<p>It also squares with PESP's investigation, which collected various data and media reports that could help explain how those medical errors could happen. The report found a pattern of cost-cutting and staff layoffs after private equity acquisition. In 2020, for instance, Lifepoint cut its annual salary and benefit costs by $166 million over the previous year and cut its supply costs by $54 million. Staff that remained at Apollo's hospitals were, in some cases, underpaid, and some hospitals cut services, including obstetric, pediatric, and psychiatric care.</p>
<p>Another pattern was that Apollo's hospitals were highly indebted. According to Moody's Investor Services, Apollo's ScionHealth has 5.8 times more debt than income to pay that debt off. Lifepoint's debt was 7.9 times its income. Private equity firms often take on excessive debt for leveraged buyouts, but this can lead cash to be diverted to interest payments instead of operational needs, PESP reported.</p>
<p>Apollo also made money off the hospitals in sale-leaseback transactions, in which it sold the land under the hospitals and then leased it back. In these cases, hospitals are left paying rent on land they used to own.</p>

Ward’s reaction to the scandal was all too familiar: first, attempting to <a href="https://twitter.com/henrysward/status/1743713154721554849" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">downplay</a> the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/07/carta-henry-ward-investigating-allegations-confidential-information/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">concerns</a>; then, publicly <a href="https://twitter.com/henrysward/status/1743794996732735679" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">attacking</a> the person reporting them; then, rushing out a “thought leadership” <a href="https://henrysward.medium.com/how-we-handle-captable-information-c98d85d79277" rel="noopener">puff piece</a> that raised <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/01/09/carta-unanswered-questions" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">more questions</a> than it answered; before finally pulling a 180 and <a href="https://henrysward.medium.com/should-carta-facilitate-secondary-trading-c319e0c9f080" rel="noopener">announcing</a> that the company would exit the liquidity business entirely<a href="#51d0" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">²</a>…without ever explaining what had <em>actually</em> gone wrong, or how Carta would change its operating procedures moving forward.</p><p id="5f46">For customers, it was a confusing whirlwind of a week that broke trust and left many <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/carta-a-key-silicon-valley-player-for-startups-stumbles-prompting-customers-to-consider-competitors-89800bb8" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">considering</a> alternative vendors. For shareholders, including thousands of current and former Carta employees, it was like watching a forest fire, as much of the value of their stock — <a href="https://tribecap.co/1-trillion-in-equity-how-carta-is-set-to-unlock-the-private-markets/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">predicated</a> on Carta’s plans to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/crisis-at-carta-how-henry-wards-dream-of-a-nasdaq-for-private-startups-died?rc=hx9mul" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">become</a> “a Nasdaq for private startups” — went up in smoke.</p><p id="d0ba">For me, it was déjà vu all over again.</p><p id="fa25">Fourteen months ago I was Carta’s CTO, well-regarded, praised by Ward for “bleeding Carta blue” (then the color of our logo), and working nights and weekends to <a rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/building-carta/engineering-levels-at-carta-d33db2a55a20">take care</a> of “the people, the products, and the profits…in that order.” But the more time I spent in Carta’s C-suite, the more concerned I became about the company’s leadership. After witnessing behavior that veered from bad-for-business to ethically questionable to potentially illegal, I met privately with several other executives and board members. When these meetings only increased my unease, I sent a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17UwfZfvcyfXKNR43FNbYefwI7vVg-rqn/view" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">signed letter</a> to the entire Carta board and the company’s general counsel, so that they, from their higher vantage, could assess the merits of my concerns and decide what to do.

A major law firm <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-discrimination-lawsuit-carta-vcs-2023-1" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">investigated</a>, and I was questioned for eight hours by a team that included former United States Attorney General <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretta_Lynch" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Loretta Lynch</a>.<a href="#6a9d" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">³</a> Days after my interview — on the Friday before Christmas — I was fired “for cause.” A week later, Carta sued me.</p><p id="22a6">And their lawsuit was a real whopper.</p></div><div><figure><figcaption>Carta’s October 2021 engineering leadership offsite in Chicago</figcaption></figure><p id="da6e">I joined Carta in September of 2018.

The technical challenges Carta was facing when I interviewed were a far cry from the problems I’d worked on during my PhD at <a href="https://www.cs.stanford.edu/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Stanford</a>, but what drew me to the company was the disproportionate impact such simple technology could have on so many people. Making employees <a href="https://mr-p.medium.com/think-like-an-owner-70ebf70644f7" rel="noopener">owners</a> — giving them an economic stake in the value they create — isn’t a panacea for capitalism’s uninternalized externalities, but it’s a damn good start.

When a CEO who has turned over no fewer than eleven C-suite executives in five years — and settled at least <a href="https://trellis.law/doc/197968462/notice-settlement-transaction-id-71484552-filed-by-plaintiff-sheets-amanda" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">three</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-settles-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-with-former-executive-2023-2" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">discrimination</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-lawsuit-former-cto-jerry-talton-2024-1" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">cases</a> in the last year alone — has the gall to dismiss all of the people trying to speak up as “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-startup-discrimination-harassment-boys-club-allegations-henry-ward-lawsuit-2023-10" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">sensationalized noise</a>.” It’s hard to believe that the one board member willing to comment <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231024151205/https:/www.businessinsider.com/carta-startup-discrimination-harassment-boys-club-allegations-henry-ward-lawsuit-2023-10" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">on the record</a> about the complaints would say only that “it was not his place to question management.”<a href="#abf8" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">⁴</a> And it’s hard to believe Carta’s response to my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17UwfZfvcyfXKNR43FNbYefwI7vVg-rqn/view" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">board letter</a> of October 2022 — trying desperately to signal my worry that the company’s leadership was breaking the law and putting the <a href="https://www.altfi.com/article/carta-starts-third-round-of-layoffs-in-2023" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">business</a> at <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/will-investor-patience-for-bad-founder-behavior-finally-wear-thin?rc=hx9mul" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">risk</a> — would be to hire a forensic firm to recover a copy of my <em>personal</em> Apple iMessage history and publish private messages with <a href="https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-is-consent#:~:text=Enthusiastic%20consent%20can%20look%20like%20this%3A" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">enthusiastically-consenting</a> sexual and romantic partners that had nothing <em>whatsoever</em> to do with the company…and then use those messages as a pretext to falsely accuse <strong>me</strong> of harassment and discrimination.<a href="#0159" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">⁵</a></p><p id="afbc">It’s all very hard to believe.</p><p id="5e6e">The way I usually cope with awful things is humor, but it’s been tough to find the laugh in all of this — even amongst the recent <a href="https://x.com/felipetorrvf/status/1717245433750474899?s=46&amp;t=-ZlYMUYUB9R1TOyHeqPeLg" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">wit</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13ncM2D07CSX-Vd90qbsXzvP7X9HVGiCA/view?usp=drive_link" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">witticism</a> of social media. Seeing my private life deliberately twisted and thrust into the public sphere without the consent of <em>any</em> of the people involved is hard enough to swallow. But for a corporation to do it? Because I tried to blow the whistle? <strong>Yuck</strong>.</p></div><div><p id="a11d">At various times in my life, I have been an expert in different things: the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlTJrNJ5lA" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">discography</a> of Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, organizational management principles, reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo. But nobody becomes an expert whistleblower. This turns out to be a major point of contention: “we want people to speak up!” says the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a-4bywFOPLcOnHuRfYJpQ5Ga5KpVh3UA/view?usp=drive_link" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">company handbook</a>, drafted by expensive lawyers. But as soon as someone does, those same lawyers swoop in: “but not like <em>that</em>!”</p><p id="6620">So I have to ask: what form of objection would have been acceptable? Who should it have come from? How should it have been delivered? In May of 2019, Henry messaged the company asking employees to come directly to him with problems, instead of using the newly launched whistleblower platform. At a leadership offsite in August 2022, he described his philosophy of management: “Friction is failure,” Henry proclaimed. “If you’re arguing, you’re not doing your job.” In another lawsuit filed against Carta by a former executive, Henry <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-lawsuits-employees-ceo-retaliation-2023-2" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> “I didn’t fire him because of his performance. I fired him because he was complaining to people he shouldn’t be complaining to.” Just a week ago, in the latest Carta scandal, Henry <a href="https://twitter.com/henrysward/status/1743794996732735679" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">accused</a> a prominent startup CEO of “firebombing” him “for exposure” after the founder posted evidence that Carta had misused customer data. As far as I can tell, the company’s position is that <em>nobody</em> ever speaks up in the right way, or has a legitimate concern. Wrongdoing isn’t the gravest sin: <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1502432636865691648" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">talking</a> about it is.</p><p id="5022">When I finally decided that — as a fiduciary — I had no choice but to write to Carta’s board, I hoped that my record of accomplishment and my commitment to the company would ensure I was taken seriously. I had joined as a Director with a single direct report, been promoted three times in two years to Chief Technology Officer, and then led engineering through a period of <a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/08/13/carta-valuation-fundraising" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">unprecedented growth</a> to a team more than 400 strong. True to the company’s mission, I was an <a href="https://carta.com/about/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">owner</a>: I had invested nearly my entire life’s savings exercising the company’s stock options, and Carta’s success was now my success. I had <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danfike" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">hired</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliaking3" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">so</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kineticrick" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nguyenbaochau" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">amazing</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cupto" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">senior</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ternasky" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">leaders</a> who were smarter and more experienced than I, and we consistently garnered glowing performance reviews and stellar Employee Voice Survey results. I was being paid a $623,000 a year base salary and had a $3.9M annual equity target. What <em>conceivable</em> motivation could I have to put all of that at risk, unless something was seriously wrong? And if I, a 40-year-old 6’2” cis white guy in the C-suite with a Stanford PhD, couldn’t speak up, who could? Plus, I was writing a private letter to the board, not calling reporters or threatening a lawsuit. What was the company going to do, pretend it was a mistake to have hired me in the first place? Say I was bad at my job? Nobody could stomach <em>that</em> much hypocrisy, right?<a href="#42bc" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">⁶</a></p><p id="0932">Turns out some can. And when powerful people attack your reputation, the mud sticks, no matter how mendacious. Those who know me well or have worked closely with me over the years laughed when they heard the names Henry was calling me. But for the many thousands whose first exposure to me has been Carta’s lawsuit or Henry’s blog post, his calumnies have scored. And it’s tough, too, to blame folks for not tripping over themselves running to my defense, as the company continues its “nuke them from orbit” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-lawsuit-former-employee-recordings-of-its-ceo-2023-9" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">legal strategy</a> against anyone who dares raise their head.</p><p id="8c86">It’s hard not to cheer when powerful hypocrites are finally called to account: the evangelical preacher caught embezzling funds; the crypto billionaire’s Ponzi scheme revealed. But don’t forget that shame is also one of the most pernicious weapons of the shameless. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7007297-Emily-Kramer-v-Carta#document/p16" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Telling</a> a female executive that “she was like an alcoholic who needed to admit her problem and have a full-scale recovery from being an asshole” isn’t the worst thing ever done in corporate America, but the effect is still undeniable: to <a href="https://emilykramer.medium.com/equity-for-all-1ae9ac42679e" rel="noopener">break</a> something, just a little, inside. During a long “coaching” session with Henry, another seasoned executive wrote in her notes: “own it; [the problem is] me; what could I have done better?” Months later, I listened to her read back what she had written and start to cry. Nobody as lucky or as privileged as I has any business looking for sympathy, but attempting to shame someone publicly for their (safe, legal, <em>consensual</em>) private life is some dark shit.</p><p id="20db"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Tyler_Clementi" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">People</a> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goo_Hara" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">kill</a> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Copeland" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">themselves</a>, after all.</p></div><div><p id="6cfa">Herodotus, in his<em> Histories</em>, tells how Solon advised Croesus to “count no man happy until the end is known,” so it’s still too early for me to say for sure what I’ll take away from this experience. But there is one thing I’m certain of: the only way any of this is going to stop is if we all <em>collectively</em> decide that we are mad as hell and not going to take it anymore. I have always liked Madeline Albright’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRimyfmz0MA&amp;t=13s" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">quote</a> about the special place in hell reserved for women who don’t help other women, but I think the proper focus should be on <em>power</em>, not gender. What is the point of accruing influence and money and prestige if you won’t use them to help people? Stop saying “this isn’t my job; there’s nothing I can do; I don’t want to know; it didn’t happen to <em>me</em>; it’s none of <strong>my</strong> business.” Mankind is your business. The common welfare is your business. The dealings of your trade are but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of your business.</p><p id="d472">Late in the summer of 2022, I asked a prominent Silicon Valley founder and investor — who had been close to the company and knew something of its rampant dysfunction — for advice. “If you pop up one-by-one,” they said, “Henry can knock you down. You have to stand together.” Yet what is any ocean but a multitude of drops? It has to start with you, with one person deciding that enough is enough. When you see something, <em>say something</em>. Spend some — not all, but some — of the social and professional capital that you have been working so hard for so long to collect, and stand up for someone who can’t do it on their own. Because let me tell you: <em>nobody</em> can do it alone. When you shrug and move on because you don’t want to make waves, some of the people you leave behind are drowning.</p><p id="c015">Before I sent my letter to the full board at Carta, I met with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-startup-discrimination-harassment-boys-club-allegations-henry-ward-lawsuit-2023-10" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Barbara Byrne</a>, the company’s only independent director, and the board’s only woman. We spoke for almost two hours, and the last thing Barbara did was tell me a story about a dispute she’d had at work years before, where her employer sent expensive lawyers to intimidate her. “The only power they have,” she said, “is the power to make you afraid. Don’t let them make you afraid.”</p><p id="a26a">I am tired, disgusted, outraged, disappointed, and incredulous…but I refuse to be afraid. Seeing my good name smeared across the internet is painful and awful — after all, it is my <strong>name</strong>: I cannot have another in my life. But I have accepted that, if the last five years is going to mean anything, it will have to cost something.</p><p id="5229">Don’t let them make you afraid.</p></div><div><p id="5d5f">¹ We are challenging most of these redactions in court.</p><p id="51d0">² This abrupt reversal came forty-eight hours after one Carta board member <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/07/carta-the-cap-table-management-outfit-is-accused-of-unethical-tactics-by-a-customer-after-it-tries-broker-a-deal-for-a-startups-shares-without-consent/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">offered TechCrunch</a> an impassioned defense of the “legitimacy” Carta was bringing to a “messy market”; five days after <a href="https://linear.app/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Linear</a> CEO and Carta customer <a href="https://karrisaarinen.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Karri Saarinen</a> first rang the alarm on social media; and three years after Carta <a href="https://twitter.com/cartainc/status/1334184362120769537?lang=en" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> the launch of <a href="https://carta.com/blog/liquid-rsus/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Carta Liquidity</a>, “a new equity paradigm for private companies.”</p><p id="6a9d">³ The company has refused to release the report of their investigation.</p><p id="abf8">⁴ After this response was published, the article was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231030124219/https:/www.businessinsider.com/carta-startup-discrimination-harassment-boys-club-allegations-henry-ward-lawsuit-2023-10" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">updated</a> to “clarify” the board member’s comment, which is reassuring since “asking management questions” sounds a bit like the board’s basic function.</p><p id="0159">⁵ These claims were so brazen and outrageous that Carta’s counsel was <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W0ROWCkAZ_WU7-RoFgDb5mi9fjqbtRV2/view?usp=drive_link" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">forced</a> to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cw4VWUX7tNZU2DZiUd8L6DI1lria71Gk/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">ask the court</a> for leave to withdraw them, and subsequently amended their complaint to do so. But this didn’t stop Henry from circulating the original, unaltered filing in the blog post that he sent to 40,000 Carta corporate customers four months later.</p><p id="42bc">⁶ I also failed to include “accuse me of being ‘hopped up on drugs’ and ‘high’ at work” on my Carta Bingo card, after I notified the exec team and my direct reports that it would take several weeks to recover from the painful surgeries I had on both feet in September 2022. But I think we are meant to believe that implying my planned convalescence was a drug addiction — as Carta did in their public lawsuit — is appropriate corporate behavior, since “<a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/16/women-claims-mistreatment-carta-unicorn-startup/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Henry does play hardball</a>.”</p></div></div></article></div>]]></description>

I've never used it myself, but it's a self contained IDE that has everything to make decent 2D games.</p><p>I'd advise against the pitfall that 3D games lure you into. That includes engines that are 3D with a 2D "mode". There is so much leaky abstraction, and the doco will be intermingled with 3D all over the place, leading to frustration and unnecessary complexity.</p><p>If a game is fun in 3D, chances are you could write a game in the same vein in 2D and carry the idea and execution across. 3D games are beyond ridiculously hard to execute on by oneself (well), and require exponentially more work to complete.</p><p>There is no gain, in terms of discovering the joy of making games, in diving in 3D first.</p><p>If you prefer a more programming centric approach, with no IDE, I recommend Love2D. It's a joy to use, well documented.</p><p>If you want a full blown low level approach, I recommend Raylib. It's fantastic and fun to use as well. But at this point, you're swimming in the deep end.</p><p>Also worthy of note is PICO-8. It's a fantasy console that can be easily ported on 'open' console (such as the ambernic), making your game feel alive, being played on a hand-held console. But as for the learning experience, I found it to be more of an expert's getaway retreat, rather than a good first choice for an engine. That said there is enough material out there and small enough API, to pick it up  rather quickly, all batteries included.

                  <p><span>What a great response. To follow, this doesn't preclude anyone's child from jumping head first into programming, just that "producing" a game isn't really the goal but "making" it is. My 9 year old son makes mini RPGs on paper. Like he draws hit points and a monster and does attacks and marks damage as he plays. It's awesome. Sometimes "making a game" doesn't need to be programming at all.</span></p></div></td></tr>

My parents sat me down and taught me the very basics of how to code. I didn't learn very well from them, but they also bought me a textbook and I learned great from that. By age 12, I had recreated a lot of the games I was fond of, pacman, snake, space invaders, etc.<p>Maybe the bar was lower for my interests at the time (flash mini games vs AAA 3D games as described here), but just offering a different take: Maybe your son _would_ very much be interested in learning to code. Though starting with 2d retro games might be easier.

Could you just "build" it with cardboard, a board drawn on a computer and printed out and various physical pieces? Or at least, do that for a prototype of the core part of the game and gameplay? I think it would be useful to learn the concept of a "minimum viable product" in this context (or rather, "minimum quantum of utility" to get away from preconceived ideas about what a "product" is..). Being able to get it to a point where people can first actually try to play it is really useful, and lets you get feedback early without all the overhead of the actual computer programming (if needed)</span></p></div></td></tr>

Love2d is a simple library/framework, and Lua is much simpler than python, and you will (are forced to) learn the basics, for example there's no built-in object-orientation, you make it yourself, so you learn how such systems actually work.

This is a serious tool for any kind of creative project.<p>The way to use Venn diagrams is to distill "the game" (which, for any pre-teen, and for most first-time adults too, is going to be a jumble of features and assets) into its absolute core: the big picture, philosophy, principles, themes, "design pillars". The core is the overlap of all the specific stuff: when you implement something, it has code, it has visuals, it has audio, and it should all relate to the core. So, Tetris, Sokoban, and Minecraft are all about "playing with blocks" at some level, but they differ in that the core also contains some other aspect of play. Every piece of media that works for its audience - they find it believable and engaging - is representable in the diagram.</p><p>So when your son asks for this or that feature, have him work through it on a diagram, filling in "what sound does it make" and similar kinds of details while you address the big picture parts that are hardest. Make lots of little diagrams. You'll eventually hit on one where you can reasonably hope to prototype it with your chosen tool. That's good enough, when you are 9 years old.

The only game I ever really made was a top down shooter with SML because I 1) learned that games are hard work 2) had no idea where to get assets besides ripping sprite sheets which I didn’t have the attention span for 3) I found more joy in the coding itself than making a game. I always had some dinky project going and it was almost never a game. Hell, I had more fun making a GameBoy emulator than making games!</p><p>These days, now that I know what I’m doing, I have an idea for a game I’d like to make. I wonder if I’ll ever get around to it? It’s ambitious, but I think doable solo (minus the art). It’d probably be a 5-10 year project. A big part of the reason I haven’t started it is I know how much not fun parts there are involved, like tuning algorithms.

I had I think like 3 or 4 hours until they'd come back and I definitely didn't want to tell my dad that "I broke the computer". I tinkered and tried things for hours and like minutes before they came back I got it to boot into a DOS prompt again. I was so proud. My dad never knew. R.I.P.

You can help him of course and try to steer him towards incremental improvement.<p>With Roblox he will definitely be able to just use pre-made (of not super awesome looking) cars and zombies. In fact the Roblox tutorials come with a pretty good looking Zombie actually. With animations and all. They also have some official item collections which included high and low poly stuff.</p><p>You can help him put together a simple version in a couple days tops probably. Like something that's literally just car that won't drive, some zombies that walk towards the player location if in range, he has to long press to "repair" the car and escape. First version done.</p><p>Then expand from there, like have an actual "broken car" model vs "working car". Start adding houses and streets and an "escape zone" you gotta reach etc.</p><p>That said, don't underestimate his curiosity. I thought my kids wouldn't get past that either and now I sometimes glimpse or they show me what they've been working on. I just showed them some 3D software like Blender, they got a tablet and a cheap graphics tablet for the PC. And I do see them doodling around with it, trying things. Just like we did. But with cooler tech. Just today actually I told one of them when they were on the tablet how I watched Star Trek as a kid and always wanted to "live long enough that I'd have something like the P.A.D.D.". And look here we've had iPads for "forever" now and the kids think it's normal to have.

(yes I've done some developing coz the kids wanted me to build a game for them. "daddy, daddy, I found this pink cow! You gotta put it in!" - I never finished coz it got boring but it was a lot of fun).<p>He can blow up (just super size) the models and maybe find some "motor" asset someone made and published to actually put under the hood or just next to the car, which he needs to repair too. A blown out tire? Go find rubber or a new tire? Lug it back to the car first. A jerry can asset someone made that he needs to find at a gas station (maybe someone already made that asset) to fill up the car. Like "if Jerry can is in inventory - inventory is already pre built in roblox just use it - then long pressing the action key will fill up the car". Find a "lead pipe" asset to use as a weapon. To begin with use one of the premade with animations and everything swords. The learn how to make your own.</p><p>Since it's all for learning nobody has to care about asset licensing or money. When he does, it's a teachable moment.

I also found several other examples on the Scratch website which show how to build 3D graphics on a 2D canvas. After many years of teaching kids to code, I would say the best introduction for a 9 year old is to start with block-based environments to build structural thinking fundamentals, before introducing him to typed programming languages.<p>The issue I see in starting in Unity or an equivalent high-level abstraction (e.g. threejs.org), is that it doesn't build strong fundamentals in how you <i>think</i> about solving problems. Many kids these days think they are "coding" when they are really just modifying a collection of examples and starting points (which has fueled the burgeoning industry of summer camps teaching "Minecraft modding"). As is the case for many other skills, great amateurs make great professionals.

You can add multiplayer over websocket/webrtc, you can write your own shader, you can write your game logic however you want etc. All of that without the overhead/limitation of a modding environment.</p><p>Also, out in the wild the job opportunity for Garry's Mod developers is very scarce, if any. Just something to think about if op wants to do some carrier development for the kid while having fun.

                        <div id="intro">
                <p><em>This article was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2024/01/17/each-facebook-user-is-monitored-by-thousands-of-companies-study-indicates" target="_blank">copublished</a> with The Markup, a nonprofit, investigative newsroom that challenges technology to serve the public good.

<p>By now most internet users know their online activity is constantly tracked. No one should be shocked to see ads for items they previously searched for, or to be asked if their data can be shared with an unknown number of “partners.”</p>
<p>But what is the scale of this surveillance? Judging from data collected by Facebook and newly described in a <a href="http://innovation.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CR_Who-Shares-Your-Information-With-Facebook.pdf">unique study by Consumer Reports</a> (PDF), it’s massive, and examining the data may leave you with more questions than answers.</p>
            </div>

    <!-- related-links -->
<div id="more-on-online-privacy-related-articles">
        <p>Using a panel of 709 volunteers who shared archives of their Facebook data, Consumer Reports found that a total of 186,892 companies sent data about them to the social network. On average, each participant in the study had their data sent to Facebook by 2,230 companies. That number varied significantly, with some panelists’ data listing over 7,000 companies providing their data.&nbsp; The Markup helped Consumer Reports recruit participants for the study. Participants downloaded an archive of the previous three years of their data from their Facebook settings, then provided it to Consumer Reports. </p>
<p>By collecting data this way, the study was able to examine a form of tracking that is normally hidden: so-called server-to-server tracking, in which personal data goes from a company’s servers to Meta’s servers. Another form of tracking, in which Meta tracking pixels are placed on company websites, is visible to users’ browsers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the data came from a self-selected group of users, and because the results were not demographically adjusted, the study does not “make any claims about how representative this sample is of the U.S. population as a whole,” Consumer Reports says. Participants were also likely more privacy-conscious and technically inclined than typical users and more likely to be members of Consumers Reports.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
                 <p>Despite its limitations, the study offers a rare look, using data directly from Meta, on how personal information is collected and aggregated online.</p>
<p>Meta spokesperson Emil Vazquez defended the company’s practices. “We offer a number of transparency tools to help people understand the information that businesses choose to share with us, and manage how it’s used,” Vazquez wrote in an emailed statement to The Markup.</p>
<p>While Meta does provide transparency tools like the one that enabled the study, Consumer Reports identified problems with them, including that the identity of many data providers is unclear from the names disclosed to users and that companies that provide services to advertisers are often allowed to ignore opt-out requests.</p>
<p>One company appeared in 96 percent of participants’ data: LiveRamp, a data broker based in San Francisco. But the companies sharing your online activity to Facebook aren’t just little-known data brokers. Retailers like Home Depot, Macy’s, and Walmart, all were in the top 100 most frequently seen companies in the study. Credit reporting and consumer data companies such as Experian and TransUnion’s Neustar also made the list, as did Amazon, Etsy, and PayPal.</p>
<p>LiveRamp did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
            </div>

    
    <div id="what-exactly-does-this-data-contain">
                <p>The data examined by Consumer Reports in this study comes from two types of collection: events and custom audiences. Both categories include information about what people do outside of Meta’s platforms.</p>
<p>Custom audiences allow advertisers to upload customer lists to Meta, often including identifiers like email addresses and mobile advertising IDs. These customers, and so-called look-alike audiences made up of similar people, can then be targeted with ads on Meta’s platforms.</p>
<p>The other category of data collection, “events,” describes interactions that the user had with a brand, which can occur outside of Meta’s apps and in the real world. Events can include going to a page on a company’s website, leveling up in a game, going to a physical store, or purchasing a product. These signals originate from Meta software code included in many mobile apps, their tracking pixel, which is included on many websites, and from server-to-server tracking, where a company’s server passes data to a Meta server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Markup has written extensively about the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/series/pixel-hunt" target="_blank">Meta Pixel</a> and how it has been used to surveil people as they <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2023/06/13/suicide-hotlines-promise-anonymity-dozens-of-their-websites-send-sensitive-data-to-facebook" target="_blank">dial suicide hotlines</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2023/02/16/forget-milk-and-eggs-supermarkets-are-having-a-fire-sale-on-data-about-you" target="_blank">buy their groceries</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2023/11/22/facebook-watches-teens-online-as-they-prep-for-college" target="_blank">take the SAT</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/11/22/tax-filing-websites-have-been-sending-users-financial-information-to-facebook" target="_blank">file their taxes</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/06/16/facebook-is-receiving-sensitive-medical-information-from-hospital-websites" target="_blank">book appointments with their doctors</a>. Website owners can configure the pixel to track user website interactions such as searches or filling out a form, sending each action to Meta, even if the user doesn’t have an account on Facebook. Although research tools like The Markup’s Pixel Hunt can detect the Meta pixel or SDK tracking, there is no way for a consumer to monitor the traffic between a company’s server and Meta’s. This Consumer Reports study looks at server-to-server data along with the rest.</p>

            </div>
    <div id="how-can-you-see-your-data">
                <p>Facebook users can browse through the list of companies that have sent their data to Facebook by going to the Accounts Center and clicking on “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://accountscenter.facebook.com/info_and_permissions" target="_blank">Your information and permissions</a>.” </p>
<p>From this menu, users can either download or access their information. To see the companies outside of Meta that have been sharing your information, select “Your activity off Meta technologies,” then “Recent activity.” You might be prompted to reenter your password at this point. This view will show you the number of recent connections between various third-party businesses you visited and Meta, and examples of the activity that was shared. You can choose to prevent future sharing by the company by selecting “Disconnect.” To see detailed information about these interactions, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://facebook.com/dyi" target="_blank">request a copy of your data</a>.</p>
<p>But after jumping through the many hoops required to get your hands on this data, you may still be left with lingering questions. For example, in addition to easily recognizable company names more than 7,000 companies in Consumer Reports’ study were named using unreadable gibberish, or just numbers that don’t mean anything to most users. Even those companies with readable names often did not include links to the company website. Some company names were ambiguous, such as Viking, which could be a number of different businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This type of tracking which occurs entirely outside of the user’s view is just so far outside of what people expect when they use the internet,” Caitriona Fitzgerald, deputy director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told The Markup in an interview. Fitzgerald said that while users are likely aware that Meta knows what they are doing while they are on Facebook and Instagram, “they don’t expect Meta to know what stores they walk into or what news articles they’re reading or every site they visit online.”&nbsp;</p>
            </div>
    
    <div>
                 <p>In the report, Consumer Reports calls for a number of policy proposals covering data collection practices, some of which could be part of a national digital privacy law, something that the organization has long advocated for. The recommendations specifically aimed at Meta’s technology and the advertisers who use it include:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>• Requiring companies to adopt “data minimization” strategies</strong>, which call for the collection of the absolute minimum amount of data needed to provide the service being offered.</p>
<p><strong><strong>•</strong> Expanding the powers of “authorized agents” to act on behalf of consumers to act on their rights. </strong><a href="https://www.permissionslipcr.com/">Permission Slip</a> is a mobile app by Consumer Reports that allows users to quickly opt out of and delete data from a long list of companies and data brokers on behalf of users; the app takes advantage of state privacy laws’ authorized agent provisions.</p>
<p><strong><strong>•</strong> Increasing ad transparency </strong>by creating ad archives that allow the public to see all ads that have been served to users on a platform, following the lead of the European Union’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://husovec.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Official-Version-OJ_L_2022_277_FULL_EN_TXT.pdf" target="_blank">Digital Services Act</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>• Improving the quality and readability of the data </strong>that Meta makes available in its existing transparency tools, so that consumers can actually act on the information they review.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald echoed these recommendations, saying the problem lies with the fact that the burden is on the consumer to take action to prevent this data collection. Even a “global opt-out” mechanism allowing users to avoid having their data shared is not enough because “that still requires the user to take an action to protect their privacy. A lot of people are not going to have the time or knowledge to do that,” Fitzgerald said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vazquez, Meta’s spokesperson, said the company would “continue to invest in data minimization technologies to keep up with evolving expectations. As we cover in our terms, businesses are responsible for getting permission to share people’s information with companies like ours.”</p>
<p>For now, the lack of a federal privacy law leaves consumers in most states with few options. “I think people should be encouraging their elected officials to pass privacy laws that require businesses to change some of these business practices to stop this ubiquitous tracking of our every click and every movement,” Fitzgerald said.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1747280541362102287/">Tim Sweeney, on Twitter/X, yesterday at 10:30am</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of today, developers can begin exercising their 
court-established right to tell US customers about better prices 
on the web. These awful Apple-mandated confusion screens are over 
and done forever. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That take didn’t last long.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1747408148799881390">Sweeney, yesterday at 7:00pm</a>, after Apple released <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/16/apple-guidelines-external-purchase-links">the details of its intended compliance</a> with the anti-steering (<em>anti-anti-steering</em>?) mandate from the Epic v. Apple case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A quick summary of glaring problems we’ve found so far: </p>

<ol>
<li>Apple has introduced an anticompetitive new 27% tax on web 
purchases. Apple has never done this before, and it kills price 
competition. Developers can’t offer digital items more cheaply 
on the web after paying a third-party payment processor 3-6% 
and paying this new 27% Apple Tax.</li>
</ol>

<p>[Sweeney’s points 2–4, complaining about Apple’s stringent design, 
presentation, and privacy demands regarding external links, 
omitted.] </p>

<p>Epic will contest Apple’s bad-faith compliance plan in 
District Court. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sweeney’s description makes it sound as though Apple is demanding its commission from all web sales for apps and services that have an iOS app. They’re not. They’re only demanding the commission from web sales that occur within 7 days of a user tapping through to the web from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">the new External Purchase Links entitlement</a> in an app. Any app or service that already sells over the web, without paying a cent to Apple, can continue to do so in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>Also, Apple <em>has</em> done this before: what they announced yesterday is almost exactly in line <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/going_dutch">with their compliance with Netherlands regulations pertaining to dating apps in 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Before yesterday:</p>

<ul>
<li>iOS app developers could sell digital content and subscriptions over the web, without paying Apple any commission.</li>
<li>iOS apps outside <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/01/apple-anti-steering-relaxation">the “reader” category</a> could not link to, nor even tell users about, those web purchases from within their apps.</li>
</ul>

<p>After yesterday:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apps that wish to link to — or, I think, even inform users about — web purchasing options from within their iOS apps must (a) still offer Apple’s IAP for those items; (b) pay Apple its adjusted 27/12 percent commissions on web sales that come from inside iOS apps; (c) send Apple sales data monthly and submit to audits of their sales; and (d) follow Apple’s stringent design edicts for these in-app links to the web.</li>
<li>Apps that do not link out to their web stores from within their iOS apps using Apple’s new External Purchase Links entitlement can continue whatever they were doing before yesterday. For apps that do nothing new, Apple is collecting nothing new.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m only surprised that Sweeney was seemingly surprised by any of this. He genuinely seemed to think that Apple not only would, but <em>had to</em> allow links from within apps to the web for purchases without collecting any commission on those sales, and that developers could present those links however they chose.</p>

<p>I’m glad that Sweeney and Epic plan to contest this, because I’m genuinely curious whether Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers sees Apple’s solution as complying with her injunction against their prior anti-steering rules. But I think it <em>does</em> comply.</p>

<hr>

<p>To be clear, I think Apple should allow apps <em>other than games</em> to just tell users they can pay/buy/subscribe/whatever on the web, without any commission. That the rules which have applied only to “reader” apps since early 2022 should be extended to all apps other than games, perhaps alongside a requirement (which doesn’t apply to “reader” apps) that apps taking advantage of this <em>also</em> offer in-app purchasing.</p>

<p>I’d draw an exception for games — an exception that surely Sweeney would disagree with completely, given that he’s in the games business — because games are different, and hefty un-circumventable revenue commissions to platform owners are clearly standard for the video game industry. The iPhone and iPad are not PCs; they’re consoles for games and apps.</p>

<p>But I’m not sure at all that Apple is doing anything contrary to the law. Sweeney (and other critics of Apple’s stewardship of iOS as a tightly controlled console) believe Apple both shouldn’t and <em>legally can’t</em> comply with the anti-steering injunction this way. I only believe Apple shouldn’t, not that they legally can’t.</p>

<p>Most critics of Apple’s control over all iOS software are seemingly of the view that iPhones and iPads should, on principle, be largely like the Mac, where the App Store is an option, not the only game in town for software distribution. Personally, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/annotating_apples_anti-sideloading_white_paper">I am on the record wishing that Apple would allow some sort of “expert” or “developer” mode</a> — chock full of warnings, perhaps even requiring a developer account to enable — that would basically offer the same options for installing third-party software on iOS as there are on the Mac. That’s me, personally, an expert user. But even setting aside every penny of revenue generated by the App Store,<sup id="fnr1-2024-01-17"><a href="#fn1-2024-01-17">1</a></sup> I see and understand many of the reasons why Apple wouldn’t want to do this. There are a lot of Mac users whose Macs are overrun by adware and other scammy software. I’m not talking about viruses or malware, even — but apps that just abuse the largely free-for-all nature of the Mac platform.</p>

<p>Basically, there’s an argument that iOS devices should be more like traditional PCs (including the Mac), on ethical or moral grounds. The “<em>it’s my device, I should decide and control what software runs on it</em>” argument. I get it. But I also get that most consumers’ Windows PCs, and many Macs,<sup id="fnr2-2024-01-17"><a href="#fn2-2024-01-17">2</a></sup> are riddled with bad software (privacy invasive, resource hogging, and all sorts of <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/12/22/grammarly-disables-spell-checking-globally/">anti-user shenanigans</a> you’d never think of) that App Store policies forbid. App Store review is far from perfect — I mean come on, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/app+store+rejection">that should go without saying</a> — but it is undeniable that adversarial software is not a problem for <em>any</em> typical users on iOS. Nothing you install from the App Store can damage your iPhone or iPad experience. Nothing you install from the App Store is difficult to uninstall if you don’t like it. The same is true of dedicated game consoles like Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox — and to a lesser degree (because Google’s Play Store review seems comparatively lax) for Android.</p>

<p>But the cynical take is that it’s all about the money for Apple. Maybe the cynics are right! Let’s just concede that they are, and that Apple will only make decisions here that benefit its bottom line. My argument remains that Apple <em>should not</em> be pursuing this plan for complying with the anti-steering injunction by collecting commissions from web sales that initiate in-app. Whatever revenue Apple would lose to non-commissioned web sales (for non-games) is not worth the hit they are taking to the company’s brand and reputation — this move reeks of greed and avarice — nor the increased ire and scrutiny of regulators and legislators on the “anti-Big-Tech” hunt.</p>

<p>Apple should have been looking for ways to <em>lessen</em> regulatory and legislative pressure over the past few years, and in today’s climate that’s more true than ever. But instead, their stance has seemingly been “<em>Bring it on.</em>” Confrontational, not conciliatory, conceding not an inch. Rather than take a sure win with <em>most</em> of what they could want, Apple is seemingly hell-bent on trying to keep <em>everything</em>. To win in chess all you need is to capture your opponent’s king. Apple seemingly wants to capture every last piece on the board — even while playing in a tournament where the referees (regulators) are known to look askance at blatant poor sportsmanship (greed).</p>

<p>Apple’s calculus should be to balance its natural desire to book large amounts of revenue from the App Store with policies that to some degree <em>placate</em>, rather than antagonize, regulators and legislators. No matter what the sport, no matter what the letter of the rulebook says, it’s never a good idea to piss off the refs.</p>

        <p>Hi, welcome to the brand new website, HN Reads.  I enjoy reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> and I love buying books (and reading), and I also love data, so what better than doing some processing of data about books to find some interesting results?!  It also gives me the opportunity to write about books that I find interesting.</p>
<p>Here are the top 40 books recommended by HN readers in 2023.</p>
<p>How I generated this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>get stories that contain the word “book”, but not “macbook”, “chromebook”, etc. That were posted in 2023, and also try to only get “ask HN” stories, by excluding stories that have a url in them.</li>
<li>get the comments for the stories</li>
<li>for each comment, use the OpenAI gpt3.5 chat API to extract a list of book details in json format:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback"> 	 [
 	 	{"match":"xxx","title":"xxx", "author":"xxx", "link":"xxx"},
 	 	...
 	 ]
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>standardise titles, e.g. “Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid” is converted
to “Gödel, Escher, Bach”. Any leading “the” is also removed.  I end up with a title
column and an orig_title column in my data. If there are that have the same title, but different subtitles, for example “Javascript: the good parts” and “Javascript: the Definitive Guide”, this isn’t too much of a problem, as the authors are different.</li>
<li>aggregate the resulting information.  There was some manual adjustment to standardise
the book titles and authors names, for example Gödel was sometimes spelled “Godel”
and Douglas Hofstadter was sometimes returned as “Douglas R. Hofstadter”.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also shared some details about this process at <a href="https://blog.reyem.dev/post/extracting_hn_book_recommendations_with_chatgpt_vol_ii/">my blog</a>.</p>
<p>It’s nice to see one of my favourite series appearing on this list, the Hyperion Cantos. I don’t usually go for books with horror elements, but the story is so good, and the science
fiction elements are cool too.</p>
<p>A couple of controversial figures don’t rank in the top 40 of 2023:  Elon Musk’s new biography
wasn’t recommended once in an “Ask HN” about books, although there were plenty of stories
on Hacker News about him and Isaacson’s book.  Also Ayn Rand’s books weren’t mentioned often
enough in 2023 to make the list.</p>
<p>Without further delay, here’s the list:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><em>Context: When I was laid off from Google, I knew I'd be deluged with
questions.  I wrote this FAQ to share with friends and family, to
prevent repeated explanation.  But my other goal was to help so many
of my co-workers process and understand the repeated waves of mass
layoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>
<p>Google just did another big round of layoffs.  I was part of them,
along with hundreds of others.  Many of us had long tenure or
seniority; my run was 18 years!</p>
<p><strong>Oh no!  But why were <em>you</em> targeted?</strong></p>
<p>I wasn’t personally targeted, I didn’t mess up.  In fact these layoffs
were extremely impersonal.  Google seems to be carrying out generic
initiatives to save operational cost.  I was an Engineering Director
with “only” 35 reports (rather than a typical 80+ people), and so it’s
likely that some heuristic decided that the business could do fine
without me.</p>
<p><strong>This is unfair!  After all you’ve done, how could Google do this to
you?</strong></p>
<p>Please understand: <em>Google is not a person.</em> It’s many groups of
people following locally-varying processes, rules, and culture.  To
that end, it makes no sense to either love or be angry at “Google”;
it’s not a consciousness, and it has no sense of duty nor debt.</p>
<p><strong>Are you OK?  I’m so sorry!  How are you coping?</strong></p>
<p>I’m fine.  :-) Google culture changed dramatically last year with its
first major round of layoffs, and I saw the writing on the wall.  I’ve
been preparing myself for this (increasingly inevitable) event for
months now – which included plenty of time for all the stages of
grief.  If anything, I have a mixed set of emotions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>enormous pride in building a Chicago Engineering office over
decades, and achieving really cool things in the Developer, Ads, and
Search divisions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deep gratitude in getting to work with some of the most intelligent,
creative people in the world;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a sense of relief.  The conflict between “uncomfortable culture” and
“golden handcuffs” was becoming intolerable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve seen long-tenured leaders exit Google and go into an identity
crisis; that’s not me.  :-)</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://www.red-bean.com/sussman/">zillion hobbies and shadow
careers</a> – plenty of things to do
and paths to follow.  The <em>first</em> order of business, however, is
probably a long-overdue sabbatical.  After 25+ years in tech, I need a
few months to rest and recover!</p>
<p>I’ll soon publish a couple of ‘post-mortem’ stories.  The first will
be about my own career at Google, and the second will be about how
I’ve seen Google culture change over time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<h2>A suspect</h2>

<p>I think the manufacturer of your son's ball mixed in a Swedish word:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2><em>Yxa</em></h2>
  
  <h3>Swedish, n.: <em>an axe</em></h3>
  
  <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNTu2.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNTu2.jpg" alt="See caption"></a><br>
  <sub>The photograph above is <a href="https://www.bukowskis.com/sv/auctions/562/48-elsa-beskow-j-julgran-och-y-yxa" rel="noreferrer">page 22</a> of the Swedish children's book <em>Vill du läsa I</em> ("Would you like to read [vol I]") by painter Elsa Beskow. The <code>J</code> above it is for <em>julgran</em>, the Swedish word for <em>Christmas tree</em>.</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Forensics</h2>

<p>I say this on the basis that:</p>

<ol>
<li>I checked several thesauruses, like you, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Axes" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia's category for axes</a>, and while I found <em>adze</em>, <em>chopper</em>, <em>cleaver</em>, <em>hatchet</em>, <em>mattock</em>, <em>tomahawk</em>, <em>twibill</em> and so on, I found nothing approaching a word with an initial <code>y</code>.</li>
<li>I used <a href="http://onelook.com/" rel="noreferrer">OneLook.com</a>'s reverse-dictionary functionality to search for "words starting with a <code>y</code> and having a meaning relating to <em>axe</em>"¹ and the only thing suggested was <a href="http://www.onelook.com/thesaurus/?s=axe&amp;f_sw=y&amp;loc=wildcard3" rel="noreferrer"><em>yataghan</em></a>: "a long Turkish knife with a curved blade having a single edge". An <a href="http://www.oriental-arms.com/photos/items/77/001477/ph-0.jpg" rel="noreferrer">image search</a> tells us that no ball-maker would confuse this sword-like blade for an axe.</li>
<li>Going one step further, I checked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Blade_weapons" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia's comprehensive list of bladed weapons</a>, and from all countries, throughout all history, only 3 start with an initial <code>y</code>: <em>yanmaodao</em> (Chinese), <em>yari</em> (Japanese), and <em>yatagan</em> (Turkish). These are all sword-like weapons, not axe-like, and as mentioned in the previous bullet, of the three, only <em>yatagan</em> has made it into English dictionaries.</li>
<li>I used an online tool named <em>Translatr</em> to translate both <em>axe</em> and <a href="http://translatr.varunmalhotra.xyz/?ref=producthunt" rel="noreferrer"><em>hatchet</em> into 90+ languages</a>, and cross-checked these with the manual translations on Wiktionary, and literally the only word of those ~200 options which started with a <code>y</code> was Swedish <em>yxa</em>. </li>
</ol>

<p>Cross-checking the translation from Swedish back into English confirmed that Swedish <em>yxa</em> is English <em>axe</em>. And indeed it is used in Swedish children's primers to illustrate the letter <code>y</code>, as you can see from the children's book excerpt above.</p>

<h2>The crime scene</h2>

<p>As for the other symbols on the ball, we can analyze which letter-symbol pairings make sense in each language. Here I've tagged each pairing with ✅ to indicate "the name a toddler would shout out for the depicted object starts with the corresponding letter", ❌ for "no, it doesn't", and ❓ for "this pairing merits further discussion".</p>

<p>In English, the pairings are <strong>A</strong>pple✅, <strong>B</strong>ear✅, <strong>C</strong>at✅, <strong>D</strong>og✅, <strong>E</strong>lephant✅, <strong>F</strong>rog✅, <strong>G</strong>iraffe✅, <strong>H</strong>ouse✅, <strong>I</strong>ce✅, <strong>J</strong>et✅, <strong>K</strong>angaroo✅, <strong>L</strong>ion✅, <strong>M</strong>ouse✅, <strong>N</strong>ail✅, <strong>O</strong>wl✅, <strong>P</strong>ig✅, <strong>Q</strong>ueen✅, <strong>R</strong>ainbow✅, <strong>S</strong>nail✅, <strong>T</strong>iger✅, <strong>U</strong>boat❓, <strong>V</strong>olcano✅, <strong>W</strong>orm✅, <strong>X</strong>ylophone✅, <strong>Y</strong> / axe❌, <strong>Z</strong>ebra✅.</p>

<p>In Swedish, these correspond to <strong>Ä</strong>pple❌, <strong>B</strong>jörn✅, <strong>K</strong>att❌, <strong>H</strong>und❌, <strong>E</strong>lefant✅, <strong>G</strong>roda❌, <strong>G</strong>iraff✅, <strong>H</strong>us✅, <strong>I</strong>s✅, <strong>J</strong>et✅, <strong>K</strong>änguru✅, <strong>L</strong>ejon✅, <strong>M</strong>us✅, <strong>S</strong>pik❓², <strong>U</strong>ggla❌, <strong>G</strong>ris❌, <strong>D</strong>rottning❌, <strong>R</strong>egnbåge✅, <strong>S</strong>nigel✅, <strong>T</strong>iger✅, <strong>U</strong>båt✅, <strong>V</strong>ulkan✅, <strong>M</strong>ask❌³, <strong>X</strong>ylofon✅, <strong>Y</strong>xa✅, <strong>Z</strong>ebra✅.</p>

<p>As you can see, because most of these words</p>

<ul>
<li>are loanwords to both languages (like <em>kangaroo</em> or <em>giraffe</em>), or</li>
<li>are loanwords from English to Swedish (like <em>jet[plane]</em>), or</li>
<li>have [proto-]Germanic roots shared by both English and Swedish (like <em>house</em> and <em>mouse</em>), or</li>
<li>are completely artificial coinages (like <em>xylophone</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>most pairings are sensible in both languages. </p>

<p>All told, in Swedish there are 8 words which simply do not fit, not to mention that, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment938521_395385">as @jkej points out</a>, a Swedish ball would also have to present the letters <code>Å</code>, <code>Ä</code> and <code>Ö</code>, and would possibly choose to omit <code>W</code>. This rules out the possibility that this is a ball made for the Swedish market.</p>

<p>For English, on the other hand, outside the mysterious <code>Y</code>, all the pairings use straightforward, non-suspicious common nouns an English-speaking toddler would be familiar with<sup>4</sup>. </p>

<p>Except for one. That <em>U-boat</em> is Swedish-fishy.</p>

<h2>A new clue</h2>

<p>Almost no one refers to submarines as U-boats in contemporary English. Quoting <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937798_395382">@tchrist's response</a> to that information:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... especially how a submarine or “U-boat” picture that got used for the U, <strong>given how uncommon a word for a sub that U-boat is in English these days</strong> — and to a toddler rather than to a great-grandfather who might actually remember them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is evidence against the maker of the ball being completely familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_As_She_Is_Spoke" rel="noreferrer">English as she is spoke</a>. </p>

<p>There's also positive evidence for "U" is for "U-boat" in Swedish children's primers. Quoting <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937595_395385">@jkej in the comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The submarine could be seen as circumstantial evidence (although not very strong) for some kind of Swedish mix-up explanation. Although U-boat is an English word, it seems a little strange to use it in this context. But <strong>in Swedish ubåt is the only word for submarine</strong>.  </p>
  
  <p>I used Google Image to examine some English alphabet posters and it seemed like almost all of them used umbrella or unicorn for U, but none of them used a U-Boat. Similarly, <strong>I found several Swedish alphabet posters with ubåt for U</strong>, although uggla (owl) was more common. <strong>I can also confirm that yxa was very common for Y</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And indeed it's easy to turn up Swedish pedagogical material having both <code>Y</code> = <em>yxa</em> and <code>U</code> = <em>ubåt</em>, like this one from the Swedish site <a href="http://www.imgrum.net/tag/barnteckning" rel="noreferrer">imgrum.com</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xzaQ9.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xzaQ9.jpg" alt="2x3 grid of letter-image pairs showing <code>T</code>-<code>Y</code>"></a></p>

<p>But it doesn't stop there.</p>

<h2>Following the footprints</h2>

<p>Following @jkej's lead on Fishpond.com, I found the manufacturer is <a href="http://www.ballbouncesport.com/" rel="noreferrer">Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc.</a><sup>5</sup></p>

<p>This is page 32 of <a href="http://www.ballbouncesport.com/catalog/flash/Default.html" rel="noreferrer">their online catalog</a> (you need to install Adobe Flash; their PDF catalog is broken<sup>6</sup>):</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QSulU.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QSulU.png" alt="page 32 of Hedstrom toy catalog"></a></p>

<p><sub>Item G: 54-4155; #10 <strong>A-Z Phonics</strong>; 0-33149 04155-9</sub></p>

<p>However, though Fishpond.com listed "Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc." as the ball's manufacturer, upon visiting BB&amp;S' site, one immediately notices the headers and copy all immediately point to another name:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ERe05.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ERe05.png" alt="Hedstrom logo"></a></p>

<p>Structurally, Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc. was once a subsidiary of <a href="http://hedstrom.com/" rel="noreferrer">Hedstrom</a>, and through a series of fits and starts in the last century, eventually <a href="http://www.sbnonline.com/article/how-jim-braeunig-took-ball-bounce-and-sport-from-bankruptcy-to-booming-business/" rel="noreferrer">took ownership of the Hedstrom brand</a>, and now is  <a href="http://www.ballbouncesport.com/olditems.php" rel="noreferrer">doing business as</a> Hedstrom.</p>

<p>That is, <em>Hedstrom</em> is the ball manufacturer's preferred name for branding purposes. Which is interesting, because the name "Hedstrom" is Scandinavian; per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedstrom" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia's article on the surname</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hedstrom</strong>, Hedström and Hedstrøm are surnames of <strong>Swedish</strong> and Norwegian origin</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Tailing the suspect</h2>

<p>So is the name <em>Hedstrom</em> indicative of Swedish influences on the ball's manufactoring process?</p>

<p>The <em>Smart Business</em> article linked above on BBS taking ownership of the the Hedstrom brand notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BBS owns 98 percent of U.S. and Canadian rubber ball markets and a growing percentage of the rotational molding market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No mention of international markets. However, one influence I can find of non–North American interests in Hedstrom is that these sources confirm that manufacturing is done in Asia, as other answers and comments suggest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BB&amp;S’s Hedstrom Entertainment Division makes play balls and other toys in Asia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what about Sweden? I've read <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:pxa2mVcNRgMJ:www.hedstromplastics.com/our-company/history/%20&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us" rel="noreferrer">several</a> <a href="http://hedstrom.com/about-us/" rel="noreferrer">different</a> <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20041012/news05/200014205/toy-maker-hedstrom-folds" rel="noreferrer">histories</a> of Hedstrom. The accounts are confusing and at points seemingly contradictory, involving many name changes. </p>

<p>But <a href="http://times-gazette.com/local%20news/2011/02/25/-big-three-carry-on" rel="noreferrer">the salient event</a> was in 1981:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eagle Rubber started making balloons out of a garage in 1916. The company grew and spawned an industry that led to Ashland becoming the balloon capital of the world. The company eventually added lines of plastic play balls. It was <strong>bought out by Hedstrom Inc. in 1981</strong>, which went bankrupt in 2004.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if Eagle was the company who built up the play ball business, whence the the acquiring company, Hedstrom? According to <a href="http://www.harryrinker.com/col-1163.html" rel="noreferrer">this column of Harry Rinker</a>, who is an antiques appraiser and thereby somewhat of an historian:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Carl H. Hedstrom, E. Gustaf Hedstrom, Knute W. Hedstrom</strong>, Wilfred P. Shuffleton, and Walter Beaman founded the Hedstrom Company, Gardner, Massachusets in 1915.<br>
  ...
  The Hedstrom Corporation still exists. Its Bedford plant produces outdoor gym sets, <strong>play balls</strong>, toys, etc.  The Dotham operation is toy focused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus the name <em>Hedstrom</em> originates from three Swedes in 1915. The catalog above is dated ~2012, and page 32 lists several of the playballs as <em>new</em>, but not the phonics one, so it's not clear when the ball was first produced. But certainly a century passed between the reason for naming the company <em>Hedstrom</em> and producing the ball. </p>

<p>So, with a century and countless mergers, bankruptcies, and restructurings intervening, the Swedish name <em>Hedstrom</em>, while intriguing, cannot be adduced as evidence that the <code>Y</code> stands for <em>yxa</em>.</p>

<h2>The interrogation</h2>

<p>I reached out to Hedstrom via their online contact form, Twitter, and Facebook. They replied to me this morning via Facebook:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2YQeQ.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2YQeQ.png" alt="Facebook reply from Hedstrom with photo of A-Z Phonics ball pairing a *yoyo* with <code>Y</code>"></a></p>

<p>They confirm your ball is not an official Hedstrom A-Z Phonics ball. The <strong>official ball has a yo-yo for the letter <code>Y</code></strong>. The Hedstrom ball also has a UPC and producer's mark.</p>

<p>Further, Hedstrom confirms they do no business internationally (outside Canada, one assumes), and they're not aware of any specific producers who have a known history of copying their designs. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoK23.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoK23.png" alt="Follow-up FB message from Hedstrom confirming they do no business internationally"></a></p>

<p>A second customer service representative actually responded separately to my contact via their website, instead of Facebook. She did her own forensics, and corroborated that Hedstrom's opinion is that this is a knock-off ball:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for visiting our website and for your online inquiry about an ABC Playball.  Unfortunately, I do not believe this ball was manufactured by Hedstrom.  I've <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ziA9p.jpg" rel="noreferrer">attached an image from our QA files of our ball</a> for your reference.  <strong>Some of the things that tip me</strong> off that this is not our ball are the elephant and kangaroo colors.  Also, there is considerably more white space on you ball whereas ours has more designs.  So, just for fun, I visited our samples department hoping to find this ball and I was able to find and inflate a sample of our ball.  <strong>Our playball has a Yo-Yo for the letter "Y"</strong>.  Another way you can tell is whether or not there is an official Hedstrom legal patch.  This patch would contain our name, Hedstrom Corporation, our address, our website, made in China in three different languages, a UPC barcode with the number 0-33149-04155-9 and a four-digit date code.  Our inflation valve should be concealed in the Robot "R" picture, too.  I'm not sure if your ball has our legal patch or not or where your inflation valve is located, but these are just a few of the way we identify our products.  It's probably not impossible for another manufacturer to find and use our designs as these are rather old for us and are not licensed or trademarked.  </p>
  
  <p>Hope that helps solve the mystery for you.  <strong>But we are of the opinion that this is a knock off and not an official Hedstrom produced playball</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One last follow-up, and she shared the history of the ball, to the extent she was able to dig up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The records that I can still access tell me w<strong>e created this ball in 2004 and first sold it in 2005</strong>.  The last one was sold in 2008.  <strong>Our records don’t indicate ‘who’ might have been the designer at the time.</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Going under cover</h2>

<p>So that trail runs cold. The ball is a knock-off.  Let's examine it in more detail for clues.</p>

<p>Indeed, additional analysis reveals that your ball and the Hedstrom ball are very similar, but not identical. There are some differences which have to be taken into account.</p>

<p>In particular, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937988_395385">@H Walters points out</a> that the layout — that is, the positions of the symbols relative to one another — are different in your photograph than in the catalog thumbnail for the Hedstrom ball:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are shared designs between the two images. The neighborhood around <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are very different, however; in the OP image <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are adjacent and at each others' "9 o'clock" (<code>E</code> being oriented differently); <code>Q</code> is at <code>K</code>'s 6, and <code>Y</code> at K's 7. In the catalog <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> aren't even adjacent; we can see <code>E</code>'s entire neighborhood (from 1 to 12: <code>BMDGHL</code>), and <code>K</code>'s neighborhood that can be seen is <code>JIDA</code>. So at the very least, if they're the same ball, <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are repeated, which makes little sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937988_395385">as @m69 further points out</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's not just that the lay-out is different; look at which part of the letter E is covered by the elephant's ear; that's different too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i5dwK.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i5dwK.png" alt="side-by-side comparison of Hedstrom and OP ball pictures"></a></p>

<p>Note also that in the photo of the ball that Hedstrom sent me, <code>V</code> is used for <em>vase</em>, not <em>volcano</em>, <code>R</code> is for <em>robot</em>, not <em>rainbow</em>, and the drawing of the nail for <code>N</code> is a slightly different style than on your ball.</p>

<h2>The stake-out</h2>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment941010_395385">at @jkej's prompting</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would add to the "circumstantial" evidence if we could find out the full set of pictures/words used on the original Hedstrom ball. Particularly, it would be very interesting if we could confirm that:   </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>All words that are not sensible in English (i.e. Yxa and U-boat) were absent from the original.   </li>
  <li>All words not sensible in Swedish were present on the original.   </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>If (2) holds it is possible that all words added to the knock-off were taken from a Swedish source. Given the pictures of the original that we already have, we only need to confirm that <strong>O</strong>wl, <strong>Q</strong>ueen and <strong>W</strong>orm were on the original to prove (2).  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked my contact at Hedstrom, and she replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The ‘U’ has a red and white UMBRELLA.</strong>  The ‘O’ has a brown and yellow OWL.  The ‘Q’ has a QUEEN with white hair and a yellow crown with red &amp; blue jewels.  And ‘W’ is an orange and red WORM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on this, @jkej's analysis is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd like to underscore that I think the answer from Hedstrom was a BIG step forward. It may seem like a dead end, but i<strong>t conclusively tells us that A) the pictures on the ball came from two distinctly separate sources, B) the general impression of an English ball can be fully explained by one of the sources, C) the pictures from the second source are better explained in Swedish.</strong> These were things we could only speculate about before. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>DNE evidence</h2>

<p>So a third-party made a knock-off version of the ball, not unusual in Asian manufacture, and introduced these differences, and perhaps picked up some Swedish contagion in the process.</p>

<p>To confirm that, we'll have to pick up the scent of this mysterious DNE you found near the valve of your ball.</p>

<p>But to do that, we have to start at the other end of the trail. I've reached out to Lojas França via email and Facebook. The email bounced, but there's still hope they'll reply on Facebook.</p>

<h2>A hot lead!</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, an informant, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385#comment941032_395385">@Brad Koch</a>, has it from some good sources in shady corners of the internet that <strong>the ball has been found</strong>. From <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14672359" rel="noreferrer">@thedrake on HackerNews</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I found the BALL manufacturer!!!!<br>
  <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Alphabets-print-ball_573748097.html" rel="noreferrer">https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Alphabets-print-ball_573748097.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIkLK.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIkLK.jpg" alt="ball pictures from Alibaba.com"></a></p>

<p>And what do we spy in the SW and SE corners of the right image (zoom in):</p>



<p>Our suspects! Hiding in China, right where our intelligence said they'd be.  And all the other images match as well.</p>

<p>Now to track down the manufacturer of these knock-off balls.</p>

<h2>The chase afoot</h2>

<p>From the Alibaba link, we find (one) producer of these balls is  Shanghai Jianhuiling Sporting Goods Co., Ltd. Tracking down <a href="http://www.hktdc.com/manufacturers-suppliers/Shanghai-Jianhuiling-Sporting-Goods-Company-Limited/en/1X03W4G8/" rel="noreferrer">the markets they operate in leads us to</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nature of Business: Exporter‚ Manufacturer<br>
  Industry: Toys &amp; Games<br>
  Product/Service Range: Toys and Games<br>
  Major Market(s):<br>
  • Eastern Europe<br>
  • <strong>Western Europe</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>A final fingerprint</h2>

<p>So while Hedstrom is not responsible for the axe on your ball, there is one last piece of evidence that <code>Y</code>=<em>yxa</em>.</p>

<p>We find the ball again on <a href="https://www.pinterest.se/pin/431219733041038600/" rel="noreferrer">a Swedish user's Pinterest page</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CnJV3.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CnJV3.jpg" alt="A-Z Phonetics ball found on Swedish Pinterest page"></a></p>

<p>In fact, this one of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Alphabet&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=simg:CAQSlQEJBOaJ0JJxtOkaiQELEKjU2AQaAggKDAsQsIynCBpiCmAIAxIoshS3FKcKsxSmCqgKpxS4FJAK3h2bNZY1sSn2PfM9nTWeNfg9tiecKRowHvzPjflZDiTjoHy0QXGMFiZBvRMAdAuMrhEfdOmr0G6tIG58poQI734deofnHXWnIAQMCxCOrv4IGgoKCAgBEgT5_1KYbDA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin-rzPsNnUAhXMOiYKHdFPCh4Q2A4IJigB&amp;biw=1131&amp;bih=645" rel="noreferrer">only 3 sites</a> I could find anywhere on the Internet with an image of your ball<sup>7</sup>.</p>

<h2>Case <s>closed</s> open</h2>

<p>After all this, one thing is certain. Since the original designer of the ball, an American company whose employees are native speakers of English, used <em>yo-yo</em> to illustrate <code>y</code>, we know <strong>the intended word is not English</strong>.</p>

<p>Overall, adulteration of the ball with Swedish words seems indicated, though far from definitive.</p>

<p>But it's the best theory I've got. Except of course for <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture#comment937271_395382">@Vincent Fourmond's conclusion</a> that we're dealing here with a <strong><em><a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/markknopfler/yaketyaxe.html" rel="noreferrer">yakety axe</a></em></strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>¹ <sub> I also tried "and related to": <em>hatchet</em>, <em>chop</em>, and <em>cut</em>, even though the latter two words are verbs and all the other symbols on the child's ball represent concrete nouns. Nothing material emerged.</sub></p>

<p>² <sub>We could make a case for <em>N</em> also fitting for Swedish, as <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395711#comment938232_395382">@konaya points out</a>, by observing the depicted object could as easily be a tack, which is <strong><em>n</em></strong><em>ubb</em> in Swedish.</sub></p>

<p>³ <sub>Note that the <code>E</code> and <code>K</code> which are on the northermost latitude in the photograph have different orientations, and the symbol always has the same orientation as its letter (i.e., the top of the symbol shows you where the top of the letter is) so there is no concern that the <code>W</code> for <em>worm</em> might be <code>M</code> for <em>maggot</em> or anything.<p>I say this because I wondered for a moment whether the illustrator mistook <code>Y</code> for an upside-down <code>h</code> in <em>hatchet</em>.</p></sub></p>

<p><sup>4</sup> <sub>Which, taken as a holistic pattern, makes the <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/a/395388/55623"><em>yellow</em></a> theory very <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937132_395388">dubious</a>.</sub></p>

<p><sup>5</sup> <sub>Since this question was asked, the Fishpond.com product page has been removed, with no redirect. Likely that's due to the the popularity of this question causing many people to hit that page (which listed an out-of-stock item), causing needless load from their perspective. But <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385#comment939108_395385">through shrewd parameter hacking, @biolauri</a> got Google <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:tOAl0SvloBsJ:www.fishpond.com/Toys/Playground-Ball-Alphabet-Ball-Bounce-Sport/" rel="noreferrer">to serve up a cached version</a>. A <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EKz3d.png" rel="noreferrer">screenshot is available here</a>, for when the cache inevitably gets flushed and also disappears.</sub></p>

<p><sub>With the cached Fishpond.com page in hand, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385#comment939363_395385">@H Walters did some source snooping</a> and noticed a number of references to the same number as in the Fishpond.com URL: 0033149041559. Many of these references were meta tags and hidden input fields, variously labelled <em>barcode</em> as in <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="barcode" value="0033149041559" id="barcode" /&gt;</code> or <em>gtin13</em> as in <code>&lt;meta itemprop='gtin13' content='0033149041559' /&gt;</code>. It also exactly matches the code in the catalog (see caption under catalog screenshot; there it is listed in component form <a href="http://www.pacificbarcode.com/all-about-barcodes/" rel="noreferrer">Indicator-Company Prefix–Item Reference-Check Digit</a>), and <a href="http://gepir.gs1.org/index.php/search-by-gtin" rel="noreferrer">a barcode search</a> confirms the company prefix 0033149 is indeed owned by Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc.</sub></p>

<p><sub>An interesting discrepancy, however. While the Fishpond.com and BBS catalog barcode item reference match (04155), the associated "part numbers" do not. The catalog shows 54-4155: that is, group number 54 (likely "decorated play balls"), species 4155 (same as bar code item reference, less the leading 0). But Fishpond.com shows  <em>Other Information:   54-4246T</em>, which is the same group number (54, decorated play balls), but <strong>a different species</strong> 4246T.</sub></p>

<p><sup>6</sup> <sub>And we also know the wholesale price per dozen as of April 2013 was $1.77, thanks to <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/e48a2f_fa8bb3b5c6a97bd7baf7118b822eafee.xls?dn%3DHedstromSpecialtyPriceListApril2013.xls" rel="noreferrer">this price sheet</a> (file name "HedstromSpecialtyPriceListApril2013.xls") tracked down by <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture#comment939485_395385">@Mari-Lou's UPC hunting skills</a>.</sub></p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lyo33.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lyo33.png" alt="2103 Hedstrom [Specialty] Price list"></a></p>

<p><sub>Note that the UPC / barcode is the same as in the catalog, 0-33149-04155-9, but the item number differs. The ~2012 catalog has 54-4155, but the 2013 price list has 54-4155<strong>4</strong>. This may be a typo, or it may be additional substantiation that one UPC may be used for different versions of the product.</sub></p>

<p><sup>7</sup> <sub>One potential risk here is that the Pinterest.se page was dynamically generated just for me, based on cookies set during the course of my research into "Swedish" and a young child's toy. Note the Swedish header translates to just a generic a "check out these fine products", and all the products offered are to toys for young children, related to reading, and all the descriptions are in English. But I think the risk here is low: I found the site through a reverse image search on Google, which suggests it pre-existed my research.</sub></p>

</p><p>In 2018, the Formosa Plastics Corporation proposed the Sunshine Project, a $9.4 billion industrial complex to be located on the west bank of St. James Parish that is estimated to become the petrochemical and plastics project with the single greatest environmental detriment, at an estimated 13,628,086 tons of greenhouse gas emissions yearly.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> The proposed complex would span 2,500 acres and will be situated one mile from an elementary school,<sup id="cite_ref-biologicaldiversity.org_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-biologicaldiversity.org-15">[15]</a></sup> On January 15, 2020, RISE St. James, a faith-based grassroots organization of St. James Parish community members, in conjunction with the nonprofit conservation organization <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Biological_Diversity" title="Center for Biological Diversity">Center for Biological Diversity</a>, the grassroots organization <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Bucket_Brigade" title="Louisiana Bucket Brigade">Louisiana Bucket Brigade</a>, and the nonprofit Healthy Gulf, sued the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_administration" title="Trump administration">Trump administration</a> for permitting Formosa Plastics' proposed petrochemical complex.

For example, in 2005, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> caused almost 11 million gallons of oil to spill into the water near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-lungcancercenter.com_34-0"><a href="#cite_note-lungcancercenter.com-34">[34]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Harvey" title="Hurricane Harvey">Hurricane Harvey</a> in 2017 caused power outages which led to unrefrigerated chemicals in a plant in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston" title="Houston">Houston</a> decomposing and igniting into a large fireball.<sup id="cite_ref-lungcancercenter.com_34-1"><a href="#cite_note-lungcancercenter.com-34">[34]</a></sup> In 2020, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Laura" title="Hurricane Laura">Hurricane Laura</a> caused a fire at a plant that produced pool chemicals which led to chlorine gas being burned for three days.<sup id="cite_ref-lungcancercenter.com_34-2"><a href="#cite_note-lungcancercenter.com-34">[34]</a></sup>
</p><p>One of the largest environmental impacts happened when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Ida" title="Hurricane Ida">Hurricane Ida</a> hit in 2021. The storm's projected path was through the industrial region. The threat of the hurricane's destruction caused the industries located in Cancer Alley to release unprocessed chemicals and gases into the air via "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaring" title="Flaring">flaring</a>."<sup id="cite_ref-lungcancercenter.com_34-3"><a href="#cite_note-lungcancercenter.com-34">[34]</a></sup> Even though flaring causes chemicals to be released into the air, the process is legal in emergencies and burns the chemicals directly into the air.<sup id="cite_ref-lungcancercenter.com_34-4"><a href="#cite_note-lungcancercenter.com-34">[34]</a></sup> After the hurricane, residents were not only left with damaged homes but also more pollution in the air and water than usual.

<p>In recent years in the United States, the environmental protection and civil rights movements have merged to form an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_justice_movement" title="Environmental justice movement">environmental justice movement</a> in response to minority and low-income communities throughout the country being constantly threatened by pollution.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> Many communities that face the largest burdens from pollution tend to be poor and consist mainly of minorities. Due to this, poor and minority communities will resort to grassroots activism to protect themselves.
</p><p>In September 2022, environmental justice advocates in southern Louisiana were able to declare victory after two decisions denied two major petrochemical complexes from moving forward.<sup id="cite_ref-ncronline.org_36-0"><a href="#cite_note-ncronline.org-36">[36]</a></sup> The state district court judge Trudy White released a decision that reversed and vacated 14 air regulations permits that the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) had issued for the proposed Formosa Plastics Group complex in the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome,_Louisiana" title="Welcome, Louisiana">Welcome</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-ncronline.org_36-1"><a href="#cite_note-ncronline.org-36">[36]</a></sup> The town already has multiple oil refineries and industrial plants and is located in Cancer Alley.
</p><p>Another group that has been actively fighting against the petrochemical industry in Cancer Alley is Rise St. James. Rise St. James is a faith-based grassroots organization that fights for environmental justice and works to defeat the proliferation of petrochemical industries in St. James Parish, Louisiana. The organization successfully defeated the construction of a $1.25 billion plastics manufacturing plant in 2019 and is currently fighting to prevent Formosa Plastics from building a multibillion-dollar plant in the parish.<sup id="cite_ref-Rise_St._James_37-0"><a href="#cite_note-Rise_St._James-37">[37]</a></sup> Rise St. James is also committed to educating the community and those outside of the community about the chemicals they breathe in every day. The organization's website includes a "Chemical of the Month" page and provides information on a specific chemical and how much it is found in certain areas of Cancer Alley.<sup id="cite_ref-Rise_St._James_37-1"><a href="#cite_note-Rise_St._James-37">[37]</a></sup>
