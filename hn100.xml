<p><b>Hundred Rabbits</b> is a small artist collective. Together, we explore the planned failability of modern technology at the bounds of the hyper-connected world. We research and test low-tech solutions and document our findings with the hope of building a more resilient future.</p>

<p>We live and work aboard a ship called <a href="https://100r.co/site/pino.html">Pino</a>. Sailing around the Pacific Ocean made us realize how fragile the modern computing stack was. Living in remote uninhabited parts of the world has offered us a playground to learn how technology degrades beyond the shores of the western world.</p>

<p>Over the years we have received the occasional request for internship, while we appreciate the interest, our small operating budget, erratic work schedule, and intermittent internet connection makes this too difficult. </p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/about/rabbits.polaroid.jpg" title="the rabbits" alt="A dithered scan of two polaroid photos taken by our friend Brady featuring the rabbits rek and dev, both wearing very comfy sweaters" loading="lazy">

<h2 id="story"><a href="https://100r.co/site/story.html">story</a></h2><p>Back in 2016, when first operating on a sailboat, we experienced frequent failures with both software &amp; hardware, largely due to our small <a href="https://100r.co/site/energy.html">energy</a> storage and lack of reliable connectivity. The solution was to create tools that would be better suited to the limits of our new situation. The objective was to replace the bloated, closed-source or subscription software that we were using to do creative work, such as Photoshop, Xcode and Ableton. We were somewhat familiar with web technologies, so we decided to build our programs on this new up and coming framework called Electron.</p>

<p>While solving some of our issues, Electron was rapidly increasing in size and despite it being open-source, soon joined the rest of the software that we wanted to do away with. Our focus shifted toward reducing our energy use, and to ensure reliability we began removing dependencies.</p>

<p>To transition toward our new goals, we developed offline web versions as temporary stand-ins while researching ways to build more resilient software. We eventually ported our tools to C, but while we had achieved ideal energy usage, portability was still an issue, so we kept looking. We learnt <a href="https://100r.co/site/6502_assembly.html">6502 Assembly</a>, seeing players run our games as NES roms on all these different platforms gave us an idea.</p>

<p>In 2021, we began designing a small virtual machine with a focus on implementability; meaning that moving forward, the applications themselves will no longer need to be ported. Instead, to make any one program available on a new platform, the emulator would be the only code needing to be modified, which is explicitly designed to be easily implemented.</p>

<p>This is where we are now. <a href="https://100r.co/site/uxn.html">Uxn</a> may solve our cross-platform issues, while being extremely light. It took us a long while to get here, we hope that one day the Uxn versions of our software replace the desktop and web versions [16.05.21].</p>

<h2 id="why_a_boat"><a href="https://100r.co/site/why_a_boat.html">why a boat</a></h2><img src="https://100r.co/media/content/about/pino_03.png" loading="lazy">

<p>From 2012 to 2014, we lived in Japan. Rek was working in an animation studio, and Devine, in a software company. On weekends and evenings, we worked on our first two games: <a href="https://100r.co/site/hiversaires.html">Hiversaires</a> &amp; <a href="https://100r.co/site/oquonie.html">Oquonie</a>. Originally from Québec, we were traveling back and forth between Canada and Japan often. We wanted to exit the wasteful loop of acquiring the necessities of life each time our lives were uprooted.</p>

<p>We had heard of people living on sailboats but neither of us had even stepped foot on one, nevertheless, we soon found ourselves watching the videos of <a href="https://youtu.be/Aub3MkFxpHE">David Wellsford</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkaH_UUH0Ek">Teresa Carey</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkYfFeySHGN4DPrOc9So7PA">Nike Steiger</a>, and became obsessed with the idea. Lack of experience aside, we thought that traveling was a good catalyst for learning new languages, for developing an interest in foreign cultures and ultimately for building empathy, curiosity, and creativity.</p>

<p>In January 2016, we left the cold of Montréal and moved west to British Columbia, where we purchased <a href="https://100r.co/site/pino.html">Pino</a>. Our curiosity soon led us to make our first trip out to sea, which <i>escalated</i> into a circumnavigation of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Our life at sea changed how we work, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW32yUEymvU&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">how we think</a>. We've always made art, and always will, but now we are working on ways to keep doing that sustainably, which translates to making lean and open software that are backward-compatible.</p>

<q>A boat, for all its complexity, is in fact a version of simplicity, but of a satisfyingly complex kind. - Adam Nicolson</q>


<h2 id="where"><a href="https://100r.co/site/where.html">where</a></h2>


<p>Since 2016, Pino has travelled <b>22,466.3 nautical miles</b>.</p>

<p>From 2016-2020 we circumnavigated the Pacific Ocean. We sailed from <a href="https://100r.co/site/western_canada.html">Western Canada</a> to the <a href="https://100r.co/site/us_west_coast.html">US West coast</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/mexico.html">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/french_polynesia.html">French Polynesia</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/cook_islands.html">Cook Islands</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/niue.html">Niue</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/tonga.html">Tonga</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/new_zealand.html">New Zealand</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/fiji.html">Fiji</a>, The <a href="https://100r.co/site/marshall_islands.html">Marshall Islands</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/japan.html">Japan</a> and then back to Western Canada.</p>

<p>From 2020-2023 Pino has explored the Salish Sea, to see where we have been see <a href="https://100r.co/site/western_canada.html">Western Canada</a>.</p>

<p>In 2024, Pino explored the North Coast of British Columbia, and <a href="https://100r.co/site/us_se_alaska.html">US SE Alaska</a>.</p>

<h2 id="setup"><a href="https://100r.co/site/setup.html">setup</a></h2><p>We carry many devices onboard, some for everyday tasks, while others are reserved for low-power situations.</p>

<p>In 2016, we moved aboard Pino with two MacbookPro 2012s. One of them died in Mexico in late 2016 (see <a href="https://100r.co/site/tools_ecosystem.html">tools ecosystem</a> for details). A friend gave us a used MacbookPro 17", but it was too power-hungy for the boat, and it later died in 2020 during our passage from Japan to Canada across the <a href="https://100r.co/site/north_pacific_ocean.html">North Pacific Ocean</a>(a giant jar of umeshu exploded over it).</p>

<p>Most of our computers are secondhand, donated to the studio between 2017 and now. We'd like to thank the following people: <a href="https://twitter.com/thisismyclone" target="_blank">Josh Auget</a> for the x250Thinkpad, <a href="https://twitter.com/johneternal" target="_blank">John Eternal</a> for the MacbookPro 13" 2010, <a href="https://nnnnnnnn.co/" target="_blank">Brian Crabtree</a> for the Pinebook, and <a href="https://lloydwilliams.co/" target="_blank">Lloyd Williams</a> for the MacbookAir 2013 11".</p>

<p><b>Main work stations:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Rek: Macbook Air 2013 running <a href="https://manjaro.org/download/#i3" target="_blank">Manjaro</a><br><i>2023.11.18.  Uppercase replacement to fix broken keyboard</i>.</li>
	<li>Dev: x250Thinkpad running <a href="https://manjaro.org/download/#i3" target="_blank">Manjaro</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Current issues:</b></p>

<p>In August 2023, the Pinebook(Manjaro) developed a weird keyboard error, making it impossible to input a password to log in, and then it stopped booting. We'll try to fix it later when in port. The MacbookPro 2012 also stopped booting, not sure why. We'll test it later when we have access to AC (may be battery related).</p>
<p><b>2023.11.18.</b> The Macbook Pro 2010 has a faulty bottom ram slot. The good news is that both ram modules still work, but we can now only use one(we can upgrade the working one for larger capacity).</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> We are always looking for backup used laptops, if you can help us on that front, let us know at <b>rabbits ౷ 100r · co</b>.</p>

<p><b>Other work stations:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>MacbookPro 2010 running <a href="https://manjaro.org/download/#i3" target="_blank">Manjaro</a> <br><i>(changed battery, for the third time, bit too power demanding to use at anchor)</i></li>
	<li>ChromeBook running ChromeOS<br><i>(working, low-power, but doesn't permit the use of Uxn tools, can barely run Gimp)</i></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="documenting"><a href="https://100r.co/site/documenting.html">documenting</a></h2>
<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/about/wiki.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><b>Wiki</b>. In April 2021, this website was converted into a wiki. This type of website is a kind of archive and mirror of everything that we have done, and that we have learnt. It's a living document that outlines where we've been, and a tool that advises where we could go.</p>

<p>Rek is the steward of this wiki, and authors most of its write-ups and articles(unless stated otherwise). Devine proofreads Rek's writing, and appends to the documentation of our projects regularly. You can download a copy of the entire website content and sources as a <a href="https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" target="_blank">.zip</a>.</p>

<p>In all that is shared on the many pages populating this wiki, we reserve the right to be wrong, and to change our minds. We are always learning, and deepening our view and understanding of any one thing.</p>

<p><b>Videos</b>. Between 2016 and 2020, we filmed our travels. We filmed regularly, but kept many experiences to ourselves, wishing to be present during worthwhile moments instead of hiding behind a lens. At the end of each month, we would watch our footage and write a summary of that month's events. We planned the monthly <a href="https://100r.co/site/videos.html">videos</a> ahead, and we would gather footage based on what we needed. While one was busy recording the narration, the other would write music. We had our respective tasks when it came time to edit, but both of us took part in the filming.</p>

<p>In rough weather, we prioritize our own safety above all, and so we rarely had footage of rough seas.</p>

<p>What we use to film and edit our <a href="https://100r.co/site/videos.html">videos</a>:</p>

  <p>We are excited to introduce Stable Fast 3D, Stability AI’s latest breakthrough in 3D asset generation technology. This innovative model transforms a single input image into a detailed 3D asset in just 0.5 seconds, setting a new standard for speed and quality in the field of 3D reconstruction.</p><p><strong>How It Works</strong></p><p>Users start by uploading a single image of an object. Stable Fast 3D then rapidly generates a complete 3D asset, including:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>UV unwrapped mesh</p></li><li><p>Material parameters</p></li><li><p>Albedo colors with reduced illumination bake-in</p></li><li><p>Optional quad or triangle remeshing (adding only 100-200ms to processing time)</p></li></ul><p>Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT96UCBSBko" target="_blank"><span><span>video</span></span></a> describing how the model works and the improvements vs previous models.</p><p>Stable Fast 3D's unprecedented speed and quality make it an invaluable tool for rapid prototyping in 3D work, catering to both enterprises and indie developers in gaming and virtual reality, as well retail, architecture and design.</p><p>You can also use the model easily on<a href="https://platform.stability.ai/" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference#tag/3D" target="_blank"><span><span>Stability AI API</span></span></a> and on<a href="https://stability.ai/stable-assistant"> <span><span>Stable Assistant</span></span></a> chatbot where you can share your 3D creations in a 3D viewer and play with them in AR (on Augmented Reality (WebXR) compatible devices).</p><p><strong>Use Cases</strong></p><p>Stable Fast 3D has several use cases in gaming and movie production.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Use the fast inference time during pre-production, where experimentation is key</p></li><li><p>Static assets for games (Background objects, clutter, furniture)</p></li><li><p>3D models for E-commerce</p></li><li><p>Fast model creation for AR/VR</p></li></ul><p><strong>Speed Meets Quality</strong></p><p>Stable Fast 3D outperforms competitors in several key areas:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Unmatched speed: 0.5 seconds per 3D asset generation on a GPU with 7GB VRAM or in close to a second on<a href="https://platform.stability.ai/" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference#tag/3D" target="_blank"><span><span>Stability AI API</span></span></a></p></li><li><p>High-quality UV unwrapped mesh and material parameters</p></li><li><p>Reduced illumination entanglement in textures</p></li><li><p>Ability to generate additional material parameters and normal maps</p></li></ul><p>Compared to our previous SV3D model, Stable Fast 3D offers dramatically reduced inference times - 0.5 seconds versus 10 minutes - while maintaining high-quality output.</p>

We're defining what “AI co-pilots” truly mean in marketing for small brands. This is a team that's helped brands grow for 20+ years and had several exits before. Not random founders. Not a random problem. Not randomly playing around with "gen ai."

    <div data-article-body="">

        

      

      <p>In the fall of 1985, Scott L. Gardner found himself standing over his toilet bowl, fishing around in the squishy output of his empty bowels with a chopstick.</p>

<p>He had recently returned to graduate school in New Mexico from a three-month expedition to Bolivia, where he was studying parasites in wild mammals. His field site near the city of Trinidad had been sparse: portable microscopes, preserved specimens, and a local pig that oinked as it waddled between the tents.</p>

<p>Gardner felt healthy, but he decided to check himself for parasites, as one looks for ticks after a hike. He put a sample of his own feces on a microscope slide and peered through the glass. Immediately, he was shocked: Hidden within the sample were clusters of tiny, light-yellow eggs.</p>

<p>“I’m used to looking at that with regular animals,” says Gardner. “But I’m not a regular animal—I’m me!”</p>

<p>Gardner went to the student health center to get treated, microscope slide in tow. Sure enough, the doctor confirmed he had contracted <em>Ascaris</em>, a pencil-thin parasitic worm affecting around one billion people today, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Gardner was prescribed an antiparasitic pill, and the next morning, he pooped out his intestines’ inhabitant—all 12 inches of it.</p>

<p>Driven by curiosity, Gardner probed around in the toilet until “out came this noodle on a chopstick.” He dumped the specimen in a jar and brought it to work, disgusting and fascinating his colleagues.</p>

<p>Today, nearly 40 years later, Gardner is surrounded by noodles in jars at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Manter Laboratory of Parasitology, where he has served as curator for three decades. Housed in a few modest rooms adjacent to a botanical collection and the floor’s only bathroom, the laboratory is the world’s largest university collection of parasites.</p>

<p>“You can compare us to a library,” says Gábor Racz, the Manter Lab’s collections manager. Each week, he catalogs and ships out specimens hailing from the Nebraska sandhills, the Caribbean islands or Mongolia’s grasslands, helping biologists around the world access parasites for research.</p>

<p>Racz and Gardner oversee around 170,000 cataloged vials, microscope slides and jars of creepy crawlies. But each item doesn’t contain just one specimen. Many parasites are so small or, in the case of worms, so jumbled up that it’s impossible to count them individually. A single vial can hold thousands of creatures, bringing the true collection closer to 17 million. Donations from researchers have made the number of slides and vials double every decade.</p>

</figure>
<p>Aside from a rotating cast of graduate students, the Manter Lab only receives enough funding to employ the two men. Besides, few biologists have the necessary training to manage a collection that encompasses all types of parasites. It’s like “asking someone to do mammals and <a href="https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/echinoderms">echinoderms</a>,” says Gardner. “That’s how far apart [the types of parasites] are.”</p>

<p>Gardner, 67, typically sports thick aviator glasses with a bright blue strap and various parasite-adorned T-shirts. Each year, when he teaches parasitology to a room full of University of Nebraska undergraduates, he begins with his chopstick horror story. His students groan, giggle and gag.</p>

<p>Gardner’s task—to pique young scientists’ interest in his field—is a daunting one. Parasites’ horrible reputation precedes them. For some, like <em>Plasmodium </em>(which causes malaria) and <em>Leishmania</em> (which causes <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis">leishmaniasis</a>), their reputation is justified due to their devastating impacts on human health. Malaria <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/php/impact/index.html#:~:text=Key%20points,population%20at%20risk%20for%20infection.">kills more than 600,000 people a year</a>, and leishmaniasis <a href="https://www3.paho.org/hq/dmdocuments/2017/2017-cha-leishmaniasis-factsheet-work.pdf">kills around 30,000</a>.</p>

<p>But parasites are also diverse and understudied creatures that have evolved to flourish in nearly every animal and ecosystem on Earth. They <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534706001522">keep ecosystems in balance</a>, providing a natural control on host species while stimulating their co-evolution over many generations. For example, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27373339/">one group of the mussel <em>Mytilus edulis</em> evolved</a> to tolerate infection from the small, parasitic crustacean <em>Mytilicola intestinalis</em> in the southeastern North Sea, while another group grew to resist it. This could cause the mussel to diverge into different species over time.</p>

<p>Parasites also change host species’ behavior, leading to oddities like the pop-culture-worthy <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-real-zombie-fungus-that-inspired-hbos-the-last-of-us-180981514/">zombie ants that mysteriously climb ten inches</a> up plants, permanently lock their jaws into the plant, and allow their parasitic fungus (<em>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</em>) to grow out of their body and rain spores onto unsuspecting ants below. And parasites keep food webs miraculously complex, forming hundreds of connections among themselves, other parasites and host species. Often, in an effort to travel between host animals, parasites will expose their hosts to new predators, like the tapeworm<em> Ligula intestinalis</em>, which<em> </em>grows so large it changes the buoyancy of the fish it inhabits, causing the fish to swim closer to the surface and get eaten by birds.</p>

<p>Parasitism, a relationship between two species where one benefits at the other’s expense, has<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436119/"> </a><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436119/">evolved independently over 220 times in animals</a>—more than any other animal lifestyle. Nearly half of all animals are parasites, with conservative estimates at 3.5 million species. Like the mammals, birds, insects and fish all around us, each parasite serves important functions in its environment—ones that, without the parasite, could spell <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5222570/#:~:text=While%20many%20uncertainties%20exist%2C%20the,%2C%20communities%2C%20and%20even%20ecosystems.">widespread ecological change</a>, if not disaster. For example, a widely supported idea called the <a href="http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/levin/bio213/articles/nature.pdf">“enemy release hypothesis”</a> suggests that as parasites of invasive plants and animals decrease, the spread and abundance of the invasive species increase.</p>

<p>As Gardner, Racz and their colleague Judy Diamond wrote in their 2021 book <em>Parasites: The Inside Scoop</em>, “Getting rid of all parasites would not make the world a healthier place.”</p>

<p>Just as the fascinating and ecologically vital roles of parasites are coming to light, researchers realize many are in trouble. With warming temperatures and deforestation threatening biodiversity around the globe, the parasites on and inside other animals will soon feel the effects. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1602422">As many as a third</a> of parasites may be endangered.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, parasitology is confronting a loss within its own field. According to data provided by the American Society of Parasitologists, in 1973, its membership had grown to nearly 1,900 members from its modest start at 320 nearly 50 years earlier. As of its 100th anniversary this year, the society has dropped by 76 percent, with just around 450 members.</p>

<p>The reason for the drop is two-pronged: Older parasitologists are retiring or passing away, while few new researchers are entering the field.</p>

<p>“I started off in this [field] pretty young and I got to know all these people, and they’re all expiring,” says Gardner. “It’s so sad. But what can you do, right?”</p>

<p>Gardner and his colleagues are trying to entice the next generation to study parasite biodiversity. They are sneaking parasites into their college biology curriculums when traditional textbooks leave them out. They are handing out parasite stuffed animals to children at museum events to make the creatures seem cuddlier. And they are running the world’s first ever parasite conservation program for a tiny tick so that conservation organizations will see parasites as creatures worthy of protection.</p>

<p>As the field shrinks around them, parasitologists hope to give their discipline a boost, ensuring that researchers will continue to study the overlooked creatures that call other animals home.</p>

<p>Scientists often call parasites the “dark matter” of the animal world: They’re unseen but incredibly important.</p>

<p>They’re also wildly diverse. Parasites can have segmented bodies, hard outer shells, many tiny legs, suckers, hooks, antennae, bristles or flagella; or they can be a single, tiny cell.</p>

<p>Parasites are unique in that they are “not linked by a shared ancestry but by a shared lifestyle,” explains Mackenzie Kwak, a parasite ecologist at Japan’s Hokkaido University. Think of it like herbivores: Cows and human vegetarians both avoid eating meat, but they’re not part of the same family or genus. Animals, plants, fungi and protozoa can all be parasites.</p>

<p>What defines a parasite is its reliance on a host species to get energy—not to mention free shelter and transportation. Parasitism is far from easy living; hundreds of millions of years of evolution have prodded parasites to find and manipulate other animals, just as those animals have evolved their own unique methods of survival.</p>

<p>Parasites are “almost like Pokémon,” says Carrie Cizauskas, a freelance science consultant with a background in disease ecology. “They’re like these weird little alien creatures that you can be like, ‘Ooh, this one has these capabilities and this kind of power.’”</p>

<p>Parasites are everywhere. Most animals host at least one species, with the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK214895/">average</a> mammalian host harboring eight. In some ecosystems, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06970">the total mass of parasites is larger than the total mass of predators</a>, despite parasites’ often microscopic size.</p>

<p>In fact, biologists can use the presence of parasites as an indication of an ecosystem’s health: The more parasite species an environment has, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15374">more biodiverse</a> it is, and therefore more resilient in the face of disturbances and threats.</p>

<p>Research also increasingly suggests that parasites play an essential, regulatory role in complex ecological networks. Their functions can be compared to top predators, like wolves or lions: Parasites keep populations in check so host species don’t outpace available resources, like food or prime habitat. Sometimes, parasites can indirectly alter the interactions between other animals. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0700062104">New England snails infected with a wormy parasite eat less algae</a> than their uninfected counterparts, leaving more algae for other animals to munch on.</p>

<p>Parasites are particularly important in food webs. In one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685421/">study on a California salt marsh</a> published in the journal <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B</em>, removing a single snail species decreased the food web’s stability by around 1,000 links between species. It’s not that the snail was itself so important, but that its removal caused the secondary extinction of 17 different species of parasitic flatworms. In turn, since the parasites moved between so many host animals during their complex life cycles, the food web lost those connections. For example, one of the most common worms in the marsh, <em>Euhaplorchis californiensis</em>, causes its California killfish host to <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/2265536">shimmy and jerk around</a> so it gets eaten more often by birds—meaning that the parasite’s removal also diminished the birds’ food source.</p>

<p>Globally, <a href="https://chelsealwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Carlson-et-al.-2020-1.pdf">at most 4 percent of parasite worm species infect humans</a>, though multiple parasitologists shared in interviews that the true estimate for all parasites is closer to 0.1 percent. Understandably, however, our perceptions of parasites are far from favorable.</p>

<p>“The way most people [in the U.S.] encounter them is in their dog’s [poop],” says Chelsea Wood, a parasitologist at the University of Washington. “That’s not really a thing that’s going to endear itself to you at first blush.”</p>

<p>Teachers and parents know the nightmare of lice, hikers are no strangers to ticks, and public health officials are on guard for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/giardia/causes/index.html">giardia</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/well/family/how-worried-should-cat-owners-be-about-toxoplasmosis.html">toxoplasmosis</a>. But causing human suffering is far from parasites’ whole story.</p>

<p>As the wide-ranging ecological effects of parasites come more clearly into view, many scientists hope our perception of them will change, too: from fear to wonderment.</p>

<p>“It might seem unimaginable that 40 years into the future, we’re all going to look at parasites and be like, ‘Oh, so beautiful, so magnificent,’” says Wood. “But I do think that’s what’s coming.”</p>

<p>Human parasitic infections in the Western world are far less prevalent today than at any point in history. Access to clean water is likely the biggest reason: <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-dirty-secrets-about-our-hands-role-in-disease-transmission-180983919/">Washing your hands</a> and food are the first steps to parasite prevention. When people do get infected, antiparasitic drugs, surgical procedures or sometimes a change in diet can take care of the parasite. Gardner mused on how his longtime colleague, renowned parasitologist Robin Overstreet, was once sad that a meal of particularly spicy curry had caused him to poop out a parasite with which he had intentionally infected himself to show his students.</p>

<p>As parasite infections have decreased, so has parasite education. Medical schools often no longer mandate parasitology classes, with such courses falling into small concentrations like tropical medicine or infectious disease. Undergraduate biology programs do not require parasitology, and high school courses are practically nonexistent, according to Kwak, Wood and others. They say only veterinarians are still required to learn about parasites.</p>

<p>“Somehow, we’re giving people full-on degrees in biology when they don’t know anything about a plurality of animal life,” Wood says.</p>

<p>A lack of parasite education leads many scientists to stumble into the field by accident. Wood, who originally wanted to be a marine biologist, was no exception. When her college didn’t have any marine biology labs, Wood wound up working with parasitic worms at a nearby university. The experience changed her career trajectory entirely.</p>

<p>“I realized that there was this whole sub-world, this whole alternate dimension that was present in nature and in all the animals that I had been interested in since I was little,” Wood says. “It was sort of like waking up from the Matrix.”</p>

<p>Others, like Chenhua Li, a parasitologist who now works in biotechnology, had never even heard of parasitology before her graduate studies in the field. “English is not my native language,” Li explains of researching Western graduate programs while living in China. “I didn’t recognize ‘parasitology’ as a word, but it started with a ‘P-A’ and ended with ‘ology,’ so I mistook that word as ‘pathology.’”</p>

<p>Li ended up loving parasites and pursuing a PhD.</p>

<p>If budding biologists don’t get a chance to learn about parasitology, established ones, too, aren’t always considering parasites in their research.</p>

<p>Utah State University ecologist Sara Weinstein worries that ecologists exclude parasites from studies where they might play crucial roles, since they’re often hidden inside more visible species. Cizauskas says they are bothered by how members of the biology community tend to read literature only about a particular specialty, remaining unexposed to other fields, including parasitology. They think that parasitology should not be an isolated discipline, since the organisms are, by definition, members of other biological systems.</p>

<p>Many parasitologists see a plainer reason that their creatures aren’t widely studied: They’re not cute. Since humans evolved to care for our young, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3596402/">research</a> suggests we’re drawn to infantile features in other animals, like big eyes, round cheeks and stubby limbs. There’s even a German word for it: <em>Kindchenschema</em>, which literally translates to “baby schema.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately for parasites, says Kwak, they’re “not nearly as charismatic” as polar bears or puppies. And, he emphasizes, parasites aren’t simply unsightly—they’re often invisible. Some can only be seen with a microscope, and many make their livings inside other creatures.</p>

<p>“You don’t see a tapeworm walking down the street,” says Sarah Orlofske, a parasitologist at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. “Most students have seen a bird, maybe they’ve seen a lizard, maybe they’ve seen a snake. But unless you’re, like, really keen on mosquitoes and ticks, most students don’t interact.”</p>

<p>If you can’t see the parasites, Orlofske continues, you “don’t relate to them”—and won’t study them. In her career, she has mentored over 80 biology undergraduates; only two of them initially came to her wanting to study parasites.</p>

<p>For many parasitology instructors, a partial solution could lie in changing biology curriculums to introduce parasites earlier. If high school students learned about parasites in introductory biology, they mused, students would be more likely to study them in college. Even at universities, however, biology textbooks largely leave out parasites; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320710004751?via=ihub">a 2011 study</a> published in <em>Biological Conservation</em> found that 72 percent of English language conservation biology textbooks did not mention parasites or portrayed them negatively.</p>

<p>Some parasitologists aren’t waiting for curriculums to change. Orlofske has a “parasite of the day” in her college introductory biology class, and Gardner can’t help but incorporate his favorite worms into college zoology. Much of the time, says Gardner, professors will recruit future parasitologists by pulling aside their top students to suggest that they join their labs.</p>

<p>Kwak thinks parasitology could take inspiration from disciplines like entomology, which have amateur societies that naturally recruit people to careers studying insects. “You can’t just take a butterfly net out and catch ticks,” he acknowledges, but plenty of hands-on parasite activities are available for participants willing to get a bit messy. Some of his favorites include tick flagging (sweeping a cloth sheet attached to a pole along vegetation to gather ticks), scooping leeches out of ponds with nets, and dissecting fresh fish to find and identify their wormy inhabitants.</p>

<p>Orlofske keeps realistic expectations about peddling parasitology. “I think the future of parasitology, if it’s not convincing people completely to go to the dark side and call themselves parasitologists, is to make career-oriented professionals in other fields more parasite-minded,” she says.</p>

<p><br>
If other disciplines pay attention to parasites, she thinks, the threats the creatures pose and face will worm their way to light.</p>

<hr>
<p>For one world-renowned parasitologist, studying worms followed him into retirement. When Mike Kinsella graduated in 1969 with a PhD in parasitology from the University of Montana, he struggled to find a faculty position where he could discover new species of parasitic worms. He ended up back in school for pharmacology, then worked as a pharmacist for two decades to pay the bills. Upon retiring, Kinsella realized his love for worms hadn’t faded.</p>

<p>For the past 30 years, Kinsella has been a stay-at-home parasitologist, identifying species for zoos, wildlife biologists and fellow parasitologists from the comfort of his home desk in Missoula, Montana. Every week, he opens his mailbox to find packages of worms from different countries and host animals. Then he gets to work with two modest microscopes and volumes of parasite reference books. In total, Kinsella has described over 30 new species, published more than 200 papers, and had 20 species named after him.</p>

<p>Kinsella runs his personal parasitology lab, which he calls HelmWest—Helm for the helminth worms he studies, and west for its residence in Montana—all out of pocket. He washes and reuses slides 200 times and asks colleagues to send him chemicals when he can’t purchase his own. His wife, ever supportive, only “draws the line at dissecting things in the living room,” Kinsella says, acknowledging that she’ll sometimes let small mammals slide.</p>

<p>Despite this bare-bones set up, Kinsella is one of the world’s leading experts on nematodes, of which an estimated half a million species exist. He’s also 83.</p>

<p>Since parasite varieties are so numerous, parasitologists like Kinsella are sometimes the only expert on a specific group. When these scientists die, their intricate understanding of how to classify and connect species goes with them. “When I’m gone, I don’t know if there’s anybody left that can do what I do,” Kinsella says.</p>

<p>A<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020751922000534?via=ihub"> 2022 study</a> published in the <em>International Journal for Parasitology</em> found that for the past two decades, a small handful of productive scientists have found and described most new parasite species. These individuals are mostly in the later stages of their careers, with little turnover to younger scientists—a fact that, according to the authors, is “putting the whole field at risk of collapse.”</p>

<p>At the American Society of Parasitologists’ 100th anniversary meeting in June, the attendance was bimodal: a mix of older or retired scientists and college- and graduate school-age biology students brought by their professors. The gap in early career scientists was palpable, says Orlofske, who herself brought three students.</p>

<p>Indeed, the society’s membership data reflects the same: In the <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-parasitology/volume-109/issue-6/23-76/Big-Science-at-Small-Institutions--Parasitology-Research-at-Primarily/10.1645/23-76.short">2023 presidential address</a>, parasitologist Tamara J. Cook reported that only 44 percent of members were active scientists in America; the rest were students, retirees or international members. Of the American scientists, over a third work at primarily undergraduate institutions, where <a href="https://digitalrepository.trincoll.edu/facpub/154/">financial support for research is much lower than at larger universities</a>.</p>

<p>Importantly, this gap isn’t the case for the subfield of disease ecology, which concerns itself more with parasites’ ecological roles rather than their identities. Unlike taxonomy, which Kwak, himself a taxonomist, describes as “dusty and traditional,” disease ecology is booming in America in the wake of public interest in diseases like Covid-19 and Zika. Orlofske sees the field growing out of a natural instinct to protect ourselves, our pets and our livestock, while the funding for taxonomy “just has evaporated.”</p>

<p>As tenure-track ecology positions and conferences increase, the work of discovering, naming, connecting and cataloging parasites is petering out.</p>

<p>Tyler Achatz, a parasitologist at Middle Georgia State University, echoed his colleagues’ concern. As an early career scientist, Achatz, who described 25 new parasite species during his PhD, has watched the community of parasitologists he can consult dwindle around him. He worries young biologists like himself aren’t learning the necessary skills to identify and describe new parasite species.</p>

<p>“Unless people step up and start filling that gap, the knowledge is going to get lost,” he says.</p>

<p>Gardner, who has described around 50 new parasite species in his career—and has had three named after him—estimates that the Manter Lab’s collection holds thousands of new but un-described species, a number that would be astonishing in fields like mammalogy or ornithology.</p>

<p>And that number keeps increasing. Many parasitologists have spent their careers amassing private collections from their fieldwork, bequeathing them to the Manter Lab upon their deaths. Gardner and Racz have received donations of as many as 40,000 specimens at one time.</p>

<p>The Manter Lab mirrors a global trend. <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.1841">A 2020 paper</a> estimated that, at current rates, cataloging every species of helminth would take 745 years—and that doesn’t even touch the numerous other kinds of parasites.</p>

<p>“Gábor and I are trying to do the best we can, but there’s no way to actually do it,” says Gardner, who estimates that the work of maintaining the growing collection would be best suited to ten people. “The task is daunting, and time is short.”</p>

<hr>
<p>On a slushy winter afternoon, Racz stepped out onto the fourth floor of the University of Nebraska State Museum to a warm greeting from a white-haired museum employee. She was sitting down after a day of classroom museum visits but was eager to tell Racz about a child’s response to a parasite exhibition that he and Gardner designed.</p>

<p>“Someone asked what the giant snakeskin was,” she recounted, referring to a 100-foot-long plastic tapeworm suspended from the ceiling. “And I said, ‘It’s a parasite from a whale.’ And he said, ‘What’s a parasite?’”</p>

<p>This question is precisely what visitors are supposed to ask—and learn the answer to.</p>

<p>Pull-out drawers of taxidermy host animals, a simple microscope with an oversized wheel of specimens, and a ten-foot touchscreen table for interactive games round out the parasite exhibit. On one wall, snug in a jar, sits Gardner’s chopstick-scooped <em>Ascaris</em>.</p>

<p>The goal is simple: to show the public that parasites are more fascinating than fearsome. With children, specifically, parasite outreach will hopefully “spark some folks’ imaginations about career paths that are not dolphin training, but instead learning about what’s inside of dolphins,” says Wood of the University of Washington.</p>

<p>Around the country, parasitologists are adopting the tactic of creating colorful and interactive parasite activities and materials. At the University of Georgia, a program called EcoReach sends scientists to classrooms and science fairs to teach about ecology topics including parasitology. At the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, Orlofske runs an event where kids comb out glitter from stuffed animals’ fur to mimic ticks.</p>

<p>Wood is publishing a children’s book in fall 2024 called <em>Power to the Parasites!</em> Cizauskas, who is also an illustrator, is designing a parasite coloring book featuring scientific explanations of the creatures on each page. Li sells packs of Pokémon-esque cards highlighting parasites with unique qualities. One notable card describes <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, a parasitic protozoan that boasts “Mind Control,” because it attracts its rodent host to the smell of cat urine, where the rat spreads the parasite to felines. Another card features <em>Leucochloridium paradoxum</em>, a flatworm touting “Mimicry” by pulsating rapidly inside snails to attract birds searching for worms.</p>

<p>“Not only dinosaurs are cool,” says Li, who also commissions monthly parasite comics and has created a<a href="https://www.globalpc.org/parasite-personality-quiz"> </a><a href="https://www.globalpc.org/parasite-personality-quiz">parasite personality quiz</a> taken by 5,000 people.</p>

<p>Still others, like science illustrator Mona Luo, want to capture public interest by subverting people’s parasite expectations. Her goal is to make the creatures “so beautiful that people don’t have time to think about how disgusted they are.”</p>

<p>Luo is known among parasitologists for her pun-filled<a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/twistedwingpress"> </a><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/twistedwingpress">parasite Valentine’s Day cards</a> and was personally asked to design the logo for the 100th anniversary meeting of the American Society of Parasitologists.</p>

<p>“There is a lot of value in trying to cut these negative associations people have,” says Supraja Rajagopal, the coordinator of EcoReach, about parasites. They hope EcoReach can “get that idea in kids’ heads when they’re younger that this isn’t bad, this thing isn’t gross, or icky.”</p>

<p>The Manter Lab also dabbles in parasite paraphernalia. By Racz’s desk sits a cardboard box of parasite stuffed animals featuring cartoonish lice, ticks and the protozoan that causes Chagas disease. They’re leftover from outreach events at the University of Nebraska State Museum, and Gardner tosses extras to students who answer questions correctly in class.</p>

<p>“I think you can cuddle up to tapeworms, too,” says Gardner.</p>

<hr>
<p>Sparking children’s and students’ interest in parasites are two fronts in the quest to revitalize parasitology. But their effects won’t be felt for decades, if and when some of those people grow up to be scientists.</p>

<div><p>That’s a problem given the more immediate threats facing parasitology: climate change and habitat loss.</p><p>

“Parasites face a double threat,” wrote Kwak, Wood and colleagues in<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320719319937"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320719319937">2020 in the journal </a><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320719319937"><em>Biological Conservation</em></a>. “They are directly vulnerable to extinction due to anthropogenic factors like climate change or invasive species, and indirectly vulnerable through coextinction.”</p></div>

<p>Many parasite extinctions will be silent, since we don’t know what creatures live in endangered hosts to begin with. Out of the millions of parasite species, only two have been assessed for the Red List, an inventory of threatened species maintained by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</p>

<p>Kwak, who serves as the co-chair of the IUCN’s Parasite Specialist Group, is on a mission to put parasites on ecologists’ radars with the first parasite conservation program. He studies the Ryukyu rabbit tick, <em>Haemaphysalis pentalagi</em>, which lives exclusively on a dark-furred rabbit species inhabiting Japan’s lush Amami Oshima and Tokunoshima islands. By learning about the endangered rabbit’s needs, as well as breeding captive populations of the rabbit and its tick, they will conserve both.</p>

<p>Kwak says it’s “two for the price of one conservation.” If successful, his study will show that parasite conservation is easy and cheap: Just don’t remove parasites from a host species you’re already saving. For the amount of money spent to save one or two large mammals, says Kwak, you could save “a thousand [parasite] species, many of which probably have much more significant value to ecosystems.”</p>

<p>Extinction isn’t in store for every parasite species;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5755797/"> </a><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5755797/">some may thrive in a warmer world</a>. This can be a major public health concern, as warmer, wetter regions—perfect habitats for mosquitoes and ticks—expand into previously cooler ranges. Changing climates may also alter the behavior of host animals, making them more suited to contracting or transmitting parasites.</p>

<p>With diverse hosts, life cycles and habitats, predicting the future of parasites is messy, if not impossible. But Wood sees existing evidence suggesting that climate change and habitat loss will harm far more species than they help. “Parasites might be among the most imperiled species on the planet, which cuts against most people’s understanding of what parasites are and where they’re going,” says Wood.</p>

<p>Parasitologists are in an accelerating race: to catalog the world’s parasite biodiversity faster than parasites—and their own community—disappear. This situation is called the taxonomic impediment.</p>

<p>“We’re obliterating biological diversity on the Earth as fast as we can,” says Gardner. “There’s not enough people who will take those [species] and describe them and understand what they are before they’re gone.”</p>

<p>Scientists often argue for studying biodiversity because we don’t know what any species might reveal, be it the missing puzzle piece to an evolutionary question or a new ingredient for a lifesaving drug. With parasites, we could learn which threatened species are keeping ecosystems ever-so-gently in balance, or which ones might be future human-killers.</p>

<p>We also might not. Still, some dedicated scientists are committing their lives to ticks and worms simply because they like them—and because they hope others, in time, might like parasites, too.</p>

<p>“There’s so much biodiversity everywhere, you know, right under [our] feet, even in the city, even in [our] own bodies, potentially,” says Cizauskas. “And that stuff is just as important as, say, a panda.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5453">

<div>
<p><span>It has been brought to my attention that I have never actually written this story down before, merely told it in person to many students for valuable lessons and also for laughs over cocktails. It is a litany of bad ideas from several people that all came together at once to reach out and zap me.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>DISCLAIMER FOR THE SQUEAMISH:</strong> My eyes and vision are fine. There was some slight retinal bleaching in the peripheral vision of my right eye. If I hold up a large plane of white paper in front of me, like when helping a friend make posters for Ren Faire, there’s a small patch of yellowish tint in the lower right corner. Not a big deal, but damage is damage.</span></p>
<p><span><em>[Scene – A very overcast morning in the spring of 1999. Exterior driveway between Building 6 &amp; 15 of $LASER_COMPANY, roughly 10am]</em></span></p>
<p><span>It was a day much like any other in my four years, five months and eighteen days of working there, not that I was counting or anything. After checking on a couple laser labs and talking to people, I needed to go across the way to visit the optics coating facility. So, I walked out the side door of Building 6 to cross the driveway, go down the stairs and over to the loading dock of Building 15. As I was walking across the driveway, I heard a weird noise. Something was rhythmically clicking away a bit faster than once a second. My thought process went a bit like this.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Me: What is that noise?</span><br>
<span>Me [a few seconds later]: Ohhhhh, I know that noise. That’s the flashlamps of a Quanta-Ray system going off.</span><br>
<span>Me [immediately after, spinning on my heels to head toward the source of the sound]: Why am I hearing this outside?</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>It was at some point while walking that way and waving my hands and yelling “SHUT IT DOWN!!!” that I took my laser hit from a scattered, fractional beam from the shenanigans going on (I didn’t notice the damage from the hit until several months later). I am going to try to describe what I saw in enough detail that hopefully you can reconstruct the scene in your head, because I don’t want to use my non-existent art skill in Paint to draw this.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_5454" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5454"><a href="https://www.funraniumlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Qaunta-Ray.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.funraniumlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Qaunta-Ray.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="300"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5454"><span>Quanta Ray PRO350 with frequency doubling, emitting a 532nm beam – Sales brochure image from Quanta Ray, unknown date</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><span>The back of&nbsp; Building 6 had their shipping and receiving area and the rear parking lot. In the parking spaces closest to the shipping &amp; receiving area, several spaces had been taken up by a Quanta-Ray’s power supply, a Rubbermaid cart with a large Quanta-Ray laser balanced on it, and it was connected to some Caltrans utility trailer looking contraption downstream and in line with the output aperture of the laser. Beyond the contraption trailer was a VP of Sales’ brand new cherry red Jeep Grand Cherokee. There were umbilicals for chilled water and power running across the parking lot back into the loading dock. Three men are standing behind the laser with another rolling cart being used as moveable workbench, fiddling with the controls for the laser and the contraption it was connected to on the trailer. Two of them were wearing laser safety eyewear. The third, one of our sales engineers who is named Bob, was not wearing any.</span></p>
<p><span>After making sure everything was shut down, I assessed the scene and realized something had gone wrong beyond simply “this entire situation”. This was a sales demo for prospective customers gone horribly awry. I identified myself as the Laser Safety Officer and that I had some questions. The customers looked very much like they wanted to be anywhere but here.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Me: May I see your glasses?</span><br>
<span>[Customers 1 &amp; 2 hand me them]</span><br>
<span>Me: These are argon filters. Are these your glasses at you brought with you?</span><br>
<span>Customer 1: Yes.</span><br>
<span>Me: Shame you’re working with a Nd:YAG laser, not an argon one.</span><br>
<span>Customer 2: Better than nothing, right?</span><br>
<span>Me: These are utterly useless at 1064nm. You both should go make appointments with your ophthalmologists. But at least you understood that you need gogs. Bob, where are yours?</span><br>
<span>Bob: In the lab.</span><br>
<span>Me: Would that be the lab that this laser was in before you wheeled it outside?</span><br>
<span>Bob: Yes.</span><br>
<span>Me: Bob, why is this laser outside? What are you even doing here?</span><br>
<span>Customer 1: You see, we had an idea…</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>I want to say that, on first blush, their idea was admirable. They were trying to come up with a less destructive way to remove striping from roadways. You have to grind that stuff off, which damages the road surface, leading to increased wear &amp; tear and thus potholes. Their solution was to do it with a laser instead.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Me: Let me see if I understand this right. You want to mount a high power laser on a cart, towed by a Caltrans or contractor truck, to burn the striping off roads?</span><br>
<span>Customer 1: Yes, ingenious isn’t it?</span><br>
<span>Me: The striping with <strong>REFLECTIVE</strong> paint?</span><br>
<span>Customer 2 [looks with concern at Customer 1]: Umm.</span><br>
<span>Me: I’m sure you can find a way with enough power.</span><br>
<span>Customer 1: But look, it worked!</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>The customer motioned for me to look at the parking lot space stripe that a whole bunch of of round spots on it which had, indeed, burnt the paint off the asphalt.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Me: Bob, $FACILITIES_GUY is going to kill you. He&nbsp;<em>just</em> repaved and striped this parking lot a couple of weeks ago.</span><br>
<span>Bob: [looks morose, as he’s starting to get an inkling of how bad this looks]</span><br>
<span>Me: But you’ve been having some trouble, haven’t you?</span><br>
<span>Customer 1 [surprised]: Yes! We can’t get beam no matter what we do.</span><br>
<span>Me: That’s because you’ve blown the coating on one of your steering optics.</span><br>
<span>Customer 1 &amp; 2: How do you know?</span><br>
<span>Me: Because your beam is not being steered to raster the stripe on the ground. Instead, it’s been firing a flat beam forward and doing a raster scan of [gestures] that Grand Cherokee.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Bob and Customer 1 &amp; 2 looked up to see the stripe of exposed metal on the door of the VP of Sales’ car where the paint had been burnt away. On closer inspection, we later leaned that the Quanta-Ray had burnt through the wheel well and cut the brake line. At this point, I decided I want to really rub in what a terrible idea all this was to them. How they had failed on so many levels.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Me: That’s $VP_of_Sales’ car, isn’t it Bob?</span><br>
<span>Bob: [groans] Yes.</span><br>
<span>Me: Pretty sure that’s your boss, Bob.</span><br>
<span>Bob: Yeah.</span><br>
<span>Me: When did you start doing this?</span><br>
<span>Customer 1: Around 8am.</span><br>
<span>Me: And when did you start having problems?</span><br>
<span>Customer 1: 8:30ish, maybe?</span><br>
<span>Me: Ah, so you were lasing through break time. Bob, what’s behind the car?</span><br>
<span>Bob: Building 15.</span><br>
<span>Me: $VP_of_Sales doesn’t normally get here until after 9am and the roach coach always pulls up at the loading dock of Building 15 at 8:45. So, hopefully you were aiming above eye level for all the employees on break. Also, that exposed brushed steel on the Cherokee is a mirror for near-infrared, so you’ve been shining that beam right back at yourselves. You <em>definitely</em> should call your ophthalmologists. But what’s behind you, Bob?</span><br>
<span>Bob: The fence.</span><br>
<span>Me: What kind of fence is it?</span><br>
<span>Bob: Chain-link.</span><br>
<span>Me: So, not a solid fence then. What’s on the other side of the fence, Bob?</span><br>
<span>Bob: [now staring at the ground in shame] The elementary school.</span><br>
<span>Me: If you’re very lucky, recess happened before your optic failed but we’re still gonna have to send a letter to the school about a potential exposure. Of course, that brushed steel mirror isn’t flat, which means your reflections went all over. Bob, what’s above us?</span><br>
<span>Bob: [picking up where I was going] Planes.</span><br>
<span>Me: How many airports worth of airspace travels over us?</span><br>
<span>Bob: SFO, Oakland, San Jose, the tiny municipal ones.</span><br>
<span>Me: You forgot a really important one. Our neighbor, Moffett fucking Field. Firing a laser into military airspace is an act of war. Are you declaring war on the United States, Bob?</span><br>
<span>Bob: [stands silently]</span><br>
<span>Me: Bob, what else is above us?</span><br>
<span>Bob: [looks up] Clouds.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Because timing is the essence of comedy, that would be when it started to rain on the quarter million dollar laser system, destroying it. Bob no longer worked at $LASER_COMPANY two weeks later.</span></p>
<p><strong>MORAL: </strong>Of all the bystanders you could injure, DO NOT HURT THE SAFETY PERSON.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="incArticle"><h2>"When AI is mentioned, it tends to lower emotional trust, which in turn decreases purchase intentions."</h2><h2>Trough Luck</h2><p>Researchers have found that including the words "artificial intelligence" in product marketing is a major turn-off for consumers, suggesting a growing backlash and disillusionment with the tech — and that startups trying to cram "AI" into their product are actually making a grave error.</p><p>As detailed in a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19368623.2024.2368040">new study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Hospitality Marketing &amp; Management</em>, researchers presented 1,000 respondents with questions and descriptions of products. Surprisingly — or <a href="https://futurism.com/google-ai-ad-sad">perhaps not</a>, depending on <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-adding-work-study">your perspective</a> — they found that products described as using AI were consistently less popular.</p><p>"When AI is mentioned, it tends to lower emotional trust, which in turn decreases purchase intentions," said lead author and Washington State University clinical assistant profess of marketing Mesut Cicek in a <a href="https://news.wsu.edu/press-release/2024/07/30/using-the-term-artificial-intelligence-in-product-descriptions-reduces-purchase-intentions/">statement</a>. "We found emotional trust plays a critical role in how consumers perceive AI-powered products."</p><h2>Strong Pass</h2><p>In an experiment, the researchers found that a group of participants were far less likely to purchase a smart television when its description included the words "artificial intelligence." A separate group was far <em>more</em> likely to buy it when the words were omitted from an otherwise identical description.</p><p>For "high-risk" purchases such as expensive electronics or medical devices, the effect was even more pronounced, with Cicek suggesting that consumers are more wary of monetary loss or danger to physical safety.</p><p>"We tested the effect across eight different product and service categories, and the results were all the same: it’s a disadvantage to include those kinds of terms in the product descriptions," Cicek said.</p><p>That kind of growing mistrust is symptomatic of a much larger trend. Earlier this year, technology research and consulting firm Gartner found that the hype surrounding generative AI had passed the "peak of inflated expectations," which is marked by "overenthusiasm and unrealistic projections."</p><p>Companies are feverishly trying to stuff what they claim to be AI into every product, from <a href="https://futurism.com/bumble-founder-future-ai-dating-other-ais">dating apps</a> to <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-bot-disabled-dpd">automated car salesmen</a> — despite <a href="https://futurism.com/meta-ai-trump-wasnt-shot">glaring shortcomings</a> that have yet to be solved and <a href="https://futurism.com/investors-concerned-ai-making-money">mounting, astronomical costs</a>.</p><p>And consumers are getting tired of their desperate attempts to capitalize on all the hype.</p><p>"Marketers should carefully consider how they present AI in their product descriptions or develop strategies to increase emotional trust," said Cicek. "Emphasizing AI may not always be beneficial, particularly for high-risk products. Focus on describing the features or benefits and avoid the AI buzzwords."</p><p><strong>More on AI:</strong> <em><a href="https://futurism.com/meta-ai-trump-wasnt-shot">Meta's AI Says Trump Wasn't Shot</a></em></p><br></div></div>]]></description>

Servo has had several new features land in our nightly builds over the last month:</p>
<ul>
<li>as of 2024-06-27, <strong>document.fonts.ready</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mukilan">@mukilan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32576">#32576</a>)</li>
<li>as of 2024-07-03, the <strong>getCompilationInfo() method on GPUShaderModule</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/sagudev">@sagudev</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32642">#32642</a>)</li>
<li>as of 2024-07-08, window.<strong>customElements.getName</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/keithamus">@keithamus</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32715">#32715</a>)</li>
<li>as of 2024-07-09, <strong>&lt;caption&gt; in tables</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Loirooriol">@Loirooriol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mukilan">@mukilan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32657">#32657</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32695">#32695</a>)</li>
<li>as of 2024-07-13, <strong>document.visibilityState</strong> and <strong>document.hidden</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/wusyong">@wusyong</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32635">#32635</a>)</li>
<li>as of 2024-07-18, the <strong>measureText() method on CanvasRenderingContext2D</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/chocolate-pie">@chocolate-pie</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32704">#32704</a>)</li>
<li>as of 2024-07-23, <strong>URL.parse()</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/shanehandley">@shanehandley</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32819">#32819</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also landed an experimental <strong>OpenXR backend</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/msub2">@msub2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32817">#32817</a>), allowing Servo to display WebXR content on actual headsets like the <strong>Quest 3</strong> in Quest Link mode.
You can enable it with <code>--pref dom.webxr.openxr.enabled</code>, though the backend currently only works on Windows.</p>

<h2 id="rendering-changes" tabindex="-1"><span></span>Rendering changes <a href="#rendering-changes">
        <span><i></i></span>
      </a></h2>
<p><strong>Parallel table layout</strong> is now enabled (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32477">#32477</a>), spreading the work for laying out rows and their columns over all available CPU cores.
This change is a great example of the strengths of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rayon">Rayon</a> and the opportunistic parallelism in Servo’s layout engine.</p>
<p>We‘ve also made progress on our new <strong>flexbox layout engine</strong> (<code>--pref layout.flexbox.enabled</code>), landing support for <strong>‘min-height’</strong> and <strong>‘max-height’</strong> on row containers (<a href="https://github.com/delan">@delan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mukilan">@mukilan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32785">#32785</a>), as well as <strong>baseline alignment of row containers</strong> with their siblings (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mukilan">@mukilan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/delan">@delan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32841">#32841</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32810">#32810</a>) and for their items by setting <strong>‘align-items’</strong> or <strong>‘align-self’</strong> to <strong>‘baseline’</strong>, <strong>‘first baseline’</strong>, or <strong>‘last baseline’</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/delan">@delan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mukilan">@mukilan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nicoburns">@nicoburns</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32787">#32787</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32790">#32790</a>).</p>

<p>We’ve landed support for <strong>generic font families</strong> like ‘sans-serif’ and ‘monospace’ (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mukilan">@mukilan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32673">#32673</a>), as well as <strong>commas in &lt;font face&gt;</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32622">#32622</a>) and fixes for font matching on Android and OpenHarmony (<a href="https://github.com/jschwe">@jschwe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32725">#32725</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32731">#32731</a>).</p>
<p>For <strong>replaced elements</strong> like &lt;img&gt; and &lt;canvas&gt;, the <strong>‘min-width’</strong>, <strong>‘max-width’</strong>, <strong>‘min-height’</strong>, and <strong>‘max-height’</strong> properties now <strong>respect the aspect ratio</strong> of the element (<a href="https://github.com/valadaptive">@valadaptive</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32777">#32777</a>), and you can now change that aspect ratio with the <strong>‘aspect-ratio’ property</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/valadaptive">@valadaptive</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32800">#32800</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32803">#32803</a>).</p>

<figcaption>Figure 3: console logging is now supported when using the Firefox devtools.</figcaption></figure>

<p>When debugging in Servo <a href="https://book.servo.org/running-servoshell.html">with the <strong>Firefox devtools</strong></a>, you can now see <strong>console messages</strong> from the page (<a href="https://github.com/eerii">@eerii</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32727">#32727</a>), as shown in <em>Figure 3</em>, and you can even debug the devtools connection itself with our new <strong>devtools protocol analyzer</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/eerii">@eerii</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32684">#32684</a>).</p>
<p>servoshell now has experimental <strong>OpenHarmony support</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/jschwe">@jschwe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32594">#32594</a>), in addition to our experimental Android support and nightly releases for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
We’ve also landed <strong>directory listings</strong> for local files (<a href="https://github.com/Bobulous">@Bobulous</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32580">#32580</a>), made the location bar behave more consistently on Android (<a href="https://github.com/jschwe">@jschwe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32586">#32586</a>), and servoshell no longer quits when you press Escape (<a href="https://github.com/mrego">@mrego</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32603">#32603</a>).</p>

<p><span></span>
To reduce servoshell’s binary size, we now build our nightly releases with <strong>ThinLTO</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/jschwe">@jschwe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32651">#32651</a>), and you can go even further by building Servo <strong>without debug symbols</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/jschwe">@jschwe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32651">#32651</a>) or <strong>without the legacy layout engine</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/jschwe">@jschwe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32759">#32759</a>).
Note that these builds use the <code>production</code> profile in Cargo, not the <code>release</code> profile.</p>

<p><a href="https://book.servo.org/"><strong>The Servo book</strong></a> is now the place to go for Servo’s documentation (<a href="https://github.com/delan">@delan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32743">#32743</a>).
It includes our architecture and design docs, a link to our API docs, as well as docs on building, running, testing, debugging, and profiling Servo.</p>
<p>Servo now builds without the <code>crown</code> linter by default (<a href="https://github.com/jschwe">@jschwe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32494">#32494</a>), simplifying the build process in some cases.
If you’re working on DOM code, you can enable it again with <code>./mach build --use-crown</code>.</p>

<p><span></span>
When contributing to Servo, <strong>your commits must now be <a href="https://developercertificate.org/">“signed off”</a></strong>, which is essentially a promise that you own (or are allowed to contribute) the code in your patch.
If the DCO check fails, click Details for help on signing off your commits (<em>Figure 5</em>).</p>

      </a></h2>
<p>Thanks again for your generous support!
We are now receiving <strong>2955 USD/month</strong> (+32.6% over June) in recurring donations.</p>
<p>Servo is now on <a href="https://thanks.dev/">thanks.dev</a>, and already <strong>three GitHub orgs</strong> that depend on Servo are sponsoring us there.
If you use Servo libraries like <a href="https://crates.io/crates/url/reverse_dependencies">url</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/html5ever/reverse_dependencies">html5ever</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/selectors/reverse_dependencies">selectors</a>, or <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cssparser/reverse_dependencies">cssparser</a>, signing up for <a href="https://thanks.dev/">thanks.dev</a> could be a good way for you (or your employer) to give back to the community.</p>
<p>We are still receiving donations from <strong>14 people</strong> on LFX, but we will stop accepting donations there soon — <strong>please move your recurring donations to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/servo">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://opencollective.com/servo">Open Collective</a></strong>.
In the meantime, we’ve transferred <strong>2723 USD</strong> of donations from LFX to our Open Collective account.</p>
<figure><div>
        <p><strong>2955</strong> USD/month</p>
        
        
        <p><strong>10000</strong></p>
    </div></figure>
<p>As always, use of these funds will be decided transparently in the Technical Steering Committee.
Our updated proposal for a <a href="https://github.com/servo/project/issues/94#issuecomment-2252262955">dedicated server for CI runners</a> (<a href="https://github.com/delan">@delan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sagudev">@sagudev</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nicoburns">@nicoburns</a>) was accepted, which should reduce build times significantly, and this is just the start!</p>

This is the default execution mode for both PyTorch and torchchat. It performs inference
without creating exporting artifacts or using a separate runner.</p>
<p dir="auto">The model used for inference can also be configured and tailored to specific needs
(compilation, quantization, etc.). See the <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/torchchat/blob/main/docs/model_customization.md">customization guide</a> for the options supported by torchchat.</p>

<p dir="auto">While we describe how to use torchchat using the popular llama3 model,
you can perform the example commands with any of these models.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Design Principles</h2><a id="user-content-design-principles" aria-label="Permalink: Design Principles" href="#design-principles"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">torchchat embodies PyTorch’s design philosophy <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/community/design.html" rel="nofollow">details</a>, especially "usability over everything else".</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Native PyTorch</h3><a id="user-content-native-pytorch" aria-label="Permalink: Native PyTorch" href="#native-pytorch"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">torchchat is a native-PyTorch library. While we provide integrations with the surrounding ecosystem (eg: Hugging Face models, etc), all of the core functionality is written in PyTorch.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Simplicity and Extensibility</h3><a id="user-content-simplicity-and-extensibility" aria-label="Permalink: Simplicity and Extensibility" href="#simplicity-and-extensibility"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">torchchat is designed to be easy to understand, use and extend.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Composition over implementation inheritance - layers of inheritance for code re-use makes the code hard to read and extend</li>
<li>No training frameworks - explicitly outlining the training logic makes it easy to extend for custom use cases</li>
<li>Code duplication is preferred over unnecessary abstractions</li>
<li>Modular building blocks over monolithic components</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Correctness</h3><a id="user-content-correctness" aria-label="Permalink: Correctness" href="#correctness"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">torchchat provides well-tested components with a high-bar on correctness.

<p dir="auto"><strong>Installing ET Fails</strong>
If <code>./scripts/install_et.sh</code> fails with an error like <code>Building wheel for executorch (pyproject.toml) did not run successfully</code> It's possible that it's linking to an older version of pytorch installed some other way like via homebrew. You can break the link by uninstalling other versions such as <code>brew uninstall pytorch</code> Note: You may break something that depends on this, so be aware.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>How does the genome encode the form of the organism? What is the nature of this genomic code? Common metaphors, such as a blueprint or program, fail to capture the complex, indirect, and evolutionarily dynamic relationship between the genome and organismal form, or the constructive, interactive processes that produce it. Such metaphors are also not readily formalised, either to treat empirical data or to simulate genomic encoding of form in silico. Here, we propose a new analogy, inspired by recent work in machine learning and neuroscience: that the genome encodes a generative model of the organism. In this scheme, by analogy with variational autoencoders, the genome does not encode either organismal form or developmental processes directly, but comprises a compressed space of latent variables. These latent variables are the DNA sequences that specify the biochemical properties of encoded proteins and the relative affinities between trans-acting regulatory factors and their target sequence elements. Collectively, these comprise a connectionist network, with weights that get encoded by the learning algorithm of evolution and decoded through the processes of development. The latent variables collectively shape an energy landscape that constrains the self-organising processes of development so as to reliably produce a new individual of a certain type, providing a direct analogy to Waddingtons famous epigenetic landscape. The generative model analogy accounts for the complex, distributed genetic architecture of most traits and the emergent robustness and evolvability of developmental processes. It also provides a new way to explain the independent selectability of specific traits, drawing on the idea of multiplexed disentangled representations observed in artificial and neural systems and lends itself to formalisation.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Throughout the last year I’ve written in detail about the rot in tech — <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/sam-altman-is-full-of-shit/"><u>the spuriousness of charlatans looking to accumulate money and power</u></a>, <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/rotcombubble/"><u>the desperation of the most powerful executives to maintain control and rapacious growth</u></a>, <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/pop-culture/"><u>and the speciousness of the latest hype cycle</u></a> — but at the end of the day, these are just companies, which leads to a very simple question: can the largest, most prominent company in tech’s latest hype cycle actually survive?&nbsp;</p><p>I am, of course, talking about OpenAI. Regulars to this newsletter will know that I’m highly skeptical of OpenAI’s product, its business model, and its sustainability. While I don’t want to rehash the arguments made in previous newsletters and podcasts, here’s the crux of the matter: generative AI is a product with no mass-market utility - at least on the scale of truly revolutionary movements like the original cloud computing and smartphone booms - and it’s one that costs an eye-watering amount to build and run.&nbsp;</p><p>Those two factors raise genuine questions about OpenAI’s ability to exist on a medium-to-long term, especially if — or, if I may be so bold to say, when — the sluice of investment money and cloud computing credits dries up.</p><p>I don't have all the answers. I don't know every part of every deal that informs every part of every aspect of generative AI. I am neither an engineer nor an economist, nor do I have privileged information. However, I do have the ability to read publicly-available data, as well as evaluate the independent reporting of respected journalists and the opinions of well-informed experts and academics, and come to conclusions as a result.</p><p>I am hypothesizing that for OpenAI to survive for longer than two years, it will have to (in no particular order):</p><ul><li>Successfully navigate a convoluted and onerous relationship with Microsoft, one that exists both as a lifeline and a direct source of competition.</li><li>Raise more money than any startup has ever raised in history, and continue to do so at a pace totally unseen in the history of financing.</li><li>Have a significant technological breakthrough such that it reduces the costs of building and operating GPT — or whatever model that succeeds it — by a factor of thousands of percent.</li><li>Have such a significant technological breakthrough that GPT is able to take on entirely unseen new use cases, ones that are not currently possible or hypothesized as possible by any artificial intelligence researchers.</li><li>Have these use cases be ones that are capable of both creating new jobs and entirely automating existing ones in such a way that it will validate the massive capital expenditures and infrastructural investment necessary to continue.</li></ul><p>I ultimately believe that OpenAI in its current form is untenable. There is no path to profitability, the burn rate is too high, and generative AI as a technology requires too much energy for the power grid to sustain it, and training these models is equally untenable, both as a result of ongoing legal issues (as a result of theft) and the amount of training data necessary to develop them.</p><p>And, quite simply, any technology requiring hundreds of billions of dollars to prove itself is built upon bad architecture. There is no historical precedent for anything that OpenAI needs to happen. Nobody has ever raised the amount of money it will need, nor has a piece of technology required such an incredible financial and systemic force — such as rebuilding the American power grid — to <em>survive,</em> let alone <em>prove itself as a technology worthy of such investment.</em></p><p>To be clear, this piece is focused on OpenAI rather than Generative AI as a technology — though I believe OpenAI's continued existence is necessary to keep companies interested/invested in the industry at all. OpenAI has raised the most money of any generative AI company (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openai?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>$11.3 billion</u></a>), has arguably the most attention in the press, and both popularized and created the Large Language Mode (LLM)l business model that allowed the current generation of "AI-powered" startups to exist.</p><p>What I am <em>not</em> saying is that OpenAI will for sure collapse, or that generative AI will definitively fail.<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/pop-culture/"><u> I have exhaustively discussed the problems with this industry</u></a> in the past, and I won't reiterate those points other than to illustrate what I believe is a deep instability in the tech ecosystem, and my point here is to coldly explain why OpenAI, in its current form, cannot survive longer than a few more years without a stunning confluence of technological breakthroughs and financial wizardry, some of which is possible, much of which has no historic precedence.</p><p>Let's have a look, shall we?</p><h2 id="the-microsoft-and-valuation-problem"><strong>The Microsoft (and Valuation) Problem</strong></h2><p>Before we continue, I should note that OpenAI and Microsoft have not publicly-disclosed the terms of their deals, and there may be things I do not know that change this picture.</p><p>Regardless, OpenAI's relationship with Microsoft is deeply strange,<a href="https://openai.com/index/microsoft-invests-in-and-partners-with-openai/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> starting with a $1 billion cash infusion in 2019</u></a>, framed as a "<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/22/microsoft-invests-1-billion-in-openai-in-new-multiyear-partnership/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>multiyear exclusive computing partnership</u></a>" that "port[ed OpenAi's] existing services to work on Azure" (Microsoft's cloud computing product) and made Microsoft "OpenAI's preferred partner." OpenAI CTO Greg<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20498087&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> Brockman added at the time</u></a> that this was a "cash investment," but noted that OpenAI would "plan to be a big Azure customer."&nbsp;</p><p>One particular thing to note is that Brockman stated that Microsoft would<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20498087&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=pre%2DAGI%20technologies"><u> get access to sell OpenAI's pre-AGI products</u></a> based off of [OpenAI's research] to Microsoft's customers, and in the accompanying blog post added that Microsoft and OpenAI were "<a href="https://openai.com/index/microsoft-invests-in-and-partners-with-openai/?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=develop%20new%20Azure%20AI%20supercomputing%20technologies"><u>jointly developing new Azure AI supercomputing technologies</u></a>."&nbsp;</p><p>Pre-AGI in this case refers to anything OpenAI has ever developed, as it has yet to develop AGI and has<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/put-up-or-shut-up/#:~:text=According%20to%20Bloomberg%2C%20these%20five%20levels%20go%20from%20Level%201%20(%22Chatbots%2C%20AI%20with%20conversational%20language%22)%20to"><u> yet to get past the initial "chatbot" stage of its own 5-level system of evaluating artificial intelligence</u></a>.</p><p>In essence, the terms of this funding round involved OpenAI handing over the research it had made to Microsoft, along with the ability for Redmond to sell OpenAI's technology as its own under the Azure banner. Furthermore, Microsoft has access to OpenAI's "pre-AGI product research," meaning that it is able to see exactly how it works, which would allow it to both sell the technology and directly compete with it. This is something that Microsoft is already working on, with<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meet-mai-1-microsoft-readies-new-ai-model-to-compete-with-google-openai?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> The Information reporting in May that Microsoft was readying its own "MAI-1" generative model</u></a>, run by Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of Deepmind (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/26/google-deepmind/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>acquired by Google in 2014</u></a>),<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/28/mustafa-suleyman-deepmind-co-founder-quits-google-ai-role-to-be-vc.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> which he left in 2022</u></a> to become a VC. Suleyman later went on to found Inflection ,<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91069182/microsoft-inflection-ai-exclusive?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> a transformer-based chatbot company that was sort-of acquired by Microsoft in March</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/inflection-ai-raises-13-bln-funding-microsoft-others-2023-06-29/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>which Microsoft backed</u></a> prior to its acquisition.</p><p>The Information also noted that the OpenAI partnership "<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-openai-inside-techs-hottest-romance?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>helped Microsoft get ahead of their rivals</u></a>." I am, again, hypothesizing, and the terms of this deal alone are extremely concerning for OpenAI in general.</p><p>Things now get a little confusing.</p><p>Apparently, in 2021 Microsoft made some sort of investment in OpenAI (<a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>cited here in a 2023 blog post about <em>another </em>funding round I'll get to in a minute</u></a>). Confusingly, I cannot find many details on this round.<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/openai-secondary-market--ac1e85f3?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> Crunchbase references a 2021 secondary market</u></a> offering of an undisclosed amount (meaning that then-current stockholders at OpenAI were able to sell liquidate their stock), but cites that the money came from Tiger Global Management, Sequoia Capital, Bedrock and Andreessen Horowitz, valuing the company at $14 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>It's unclear whether this was the same round, or if Microsoft otherwise infused capital.<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/microsoft-openai-new-multi-billion-dollar-investment?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> The Information mentions in an article from early 2023</u></a>, but somehow <em>nobody</em> covered it at the time. If I'm wrong, I'd love to see how it did so.</p><p>Regardless,<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/microsoft-to-invest-10-billion-in-chatgpt-creator-openai-report-says.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> in early 2023 Microsoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI</u></a> — but the most important parts of the deal are both its <em>terms</em> and its <em>distribution. </em>Though the terms of the deal aren't public, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567448/microsoft-openai-partnership-extension-ai?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>reports state that Microsoft will may receive 75% of OpenAI's profits until it secures "its investment return [a clunky way of saying "makes back the $10 billion it invested],"</u></a> along with a 49% stake in the company,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/sam-altman-freed/"><u> though OpenAI's convoluted non-profit-for-profit structure is strange in and of itself</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2023/openai-has-received-just-a-fraction-of-microsofts-10-billion-investment?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Semafor reports that</u></a>, at least by November 2023, OpenAI had received "a fraction" of the $10 billion investment, which was (is?) delivered in tranches (stages), and that a "significant portion" of that money was in cloud compute credits, meaning that Microsoft's investment was predominantly in the supposed value of a currency that can only be used on its own services. For those who don’t fully understand how weird this is, it’s like an airline investing in a company but, instead of providing cash, it hands over air miles. You can still travel, but you are locked into A) one airline and B) their interpretation of what one “mile” is actually worth.</p><p>Furthermore, it’s extremely bizarre that said “investment” also may have - again, we don’t know the terms of the deal - allowed OpenAI to raise its valuation in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>Semafor also adds (vaguely) that Microsoft has "certain rights to OpenAI's intellectual property," and that it "would still be able to run OpenAI's current models on [its] servers" even if the relationship were to break down.</p><p>What's confusing is that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/microsofts-complex-bet-on-openai-brings-potential-and-uncertainty.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>multiple</u></a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-28/microsoft-s-13-billion-openai-pact-faces-extra-eu-scrutiny?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> reporters</u></a> have said that Microsoft had invested "$13 billion" in OpenAI, yet I can't find the two billion dollars anywhere. Was it in 2021? Was the amount $2 billion? Was it cash, or credits? This number has been reported so regularly for so long, and it's extremely strange that so many have just assumed this happened.</p><p>The reason I think this is concerning is that two billion dollars is a great deal of money by any startup's standards.</p><p>For example, Snowflake, a wildly-successful enterprise computing company,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/snowflake-computing?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> raised a total of $2 billion</u></a>, mostly before going public (though it sold $621.5 million in stock post-IPO in 2022). Also, Snowflake lost $316 million last quarter.</p><p>On top of that, this deal was totally unannounced and unreported, happening in the same year (2021) that Microsoft and OpenAI announced their Azure OpenAI services (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/general-availability-of-azure-openai-service-expands-access-to-large-advanced-ai-models-with-added-enterprise-benefits/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>which took until 2023 to launch publicly</u></a>). While I am guessing here — if I'm wrong, please email me — it seems that Microsoft gave another $2 billion to OpenAI in 2021 at the same time that OpenAI raised an undisclosed amount from other sources. I hypothesize this deal is likely to have been a mixture of cash and cloud credits, though ChatGPT didn't reach the public until November 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>It could also be that those reporting that Microsoft had put "$13 billion" into OpenAI could simply be wrong, but it would be a very commonplace error and one that would likely quickly be refuted by either Microsoft or OpenAI.</p><p>The reason that I'm raising these issues is that Microsoft, at this point, effectively <em>owns</em> OpenAI.<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-openai-protected-by-silicon-valley-friends-f3efcf68?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was instrumental in Altman's return after he was fired in November 2023</u></a>, and<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/news/366560318/Fallout-after-Microsoft-hires-former-OpenAI-CEO-Sam-Altman?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> had already planned to poach him if he hadn't returned</u></a>. In many ways, this didn't really matter. Due to the nature of Microsoft's deal with OpenAI, it effectively owns — or at least has access to — all of the intellectual property behind OpenAI's products, along with all of the research, as well as the ability to license it at will.</p><p>OpenAI is inextricably tied to Microsoft. It is bound to use Azure, Microsoft's cloud compute platform, both by its agreements and the fact that the majority of its funding is in credits that can only be used on Microsoft Azure. Microsoft sells access to GPT through Azure, while also directly competing with it with its own upcoming model, and takes three-quarters of any of the (theoretical) profit that would come out of OpenAI's services.</p><p>Microsoft has also not had to really sacrifice anything to do these deals. Even if we assume that the <em>entirety</em> of the previous rounds of funding — a theoretical $3 billion — was in cash, and that, say, 25% of the 2023 deal was in cash versus credits, that's only $5.5 billion, with the latter half delivered in tranches on an indeterminate timeline. Assuming (again, I do not have the exact terms) that this was really $5.5 billion in cash, that's <em>nothing</em> for Microsoft, a company that had over $21 billion in <em>profits </em>in its most recent financial quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of this deal, Microsoft has effectively purchased the rights to OpenAI's "pre-AGI" technology, and licensed all of its technology in a way that extends past any partnership or, I imagine, future deals. Microsoft also "invested" in cloud credits at an indeterminate valuation, both in how OpenAI was valued <em>and the credits themselves.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Ask yourself, what is a dollar of "cloud compute credits," and what do they gain you access to?<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing?ref=wheresyoured.at#Estimate-and-budget"><u> Microsoft's Azure cloud has many, many products,</u></a> and it's unclear if OpenAI would receive preferential pricing on them, what products they'd be using, and the terms under which OpenAI receives them.Microsoft effectively created its own currency to invest in OpenAI, which OpenAI would then pay Microsoft in, which Microsoft would, in turn, receive as revenue.</p><p>In many ways, OpenAI's continual existence is as an R&amp;D facility for Microsoft's generative AI business unit, one with the dice rigged in Microsoft's favor. In the event of OpenAI's collapse, OpenAI's technology would still run on Microsoft's servers, and Microsoft would still have access to both OpenAI's intellectual property and products, and in turn be able to sell them. In the event that OpenAI thrives and future generations of GPT become remarkably profitable and successful, Microsoft harvests billions of dollars of profits while still retaining access and license to any research or products used to get there. Even Microsoft's $100 billion supercomputer project is reportedly tied to Altman and OpenAI "meaningfully improving" the capabilities of its AI,<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-plot-100-billion-stargate-ai-supercomputer?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> according to sources talking to The Information</u></a>.</p><p>I am obviously not certain, and have no way of confirming this, but do you not think “pre-AGI” technology and research includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24205701/openai-searchgpt-ai-search-engine-google-perplexity-rival?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>SearchGPT, OpenAI’s recently-announced competitor to Google Search</u></a>? Is it worth considering, for a second, that Microsoft could benefit whether OpenAI lives or dies?&nbsp;</p><p>It's a devil's deal, one that you would only make if you were burning so much cash that it was necessary to find a benefactor with deep pockets, one that could bail you out repeatedly as you chewed through billions of dollars every year.</p><p>Sadly, that may be the truth for OpenAI.</p><h2 id="the-funding-problem"><strong>The Funding Problem</strong></h2><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-openai-could-lose-5-billion-this-year?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>The Information reported that OpenAI could burn as much as $5 billion dollars in 2024</u></a> based on "previously undisclosed internal financial data and people involved in the business."</p><p>The piece makes several informed estimates (and I encourage you to pay for The Information for this article alone) that I am going to draw upon. While it’s <em>possible</em> that these estimates may be wrong, or that the data they were based on was misleading or incorrect, I trust the Information’s analysis and the rigor of its reporting:</p><ul><li>"OpenAI as of March [2024] was on track to spend nearly $4 billion this year on renting Microsoft's servers to power ChatGPT and its underlying LLMs," sourced to a "person with direct knowledge of the spending."</li><li>"OpenAI's training costs — including paying for the data — could balloon to as much as $3 billion this year."<ul><li>As a note, training costs are not simply getting the data, but cleaning and preparing it — a laborious task — and then using massive amounts of cloud compute to train the model using it.</li></ul></li><li>The Information "guesstimates" that OpenAI's 1500-person (and growing) workforce could cost around $1.5 billion a year. While that sounds a little high — especially considering that figure works out to $1m per person — it’s actually quite plausible. Top AI talent is extremely, extremely expensive, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-fight-for-ai-talent-pay-million-dollar-packages-and-buy-whole-teams-c370de2b?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Some%20of%20these%20hard%2Dto,million%20a%20year%20or%20more.&amp;text=Salespeople%20in%20AI%20are%20also,set%20and%20depth%20of%20knowledge."><u>seven-figure salaries are far from unusual</u></a>. You then have to factor in things like office space, payroll taxes, equipment, and the other operational costs</li><li>The Information also estimates that OpenAI has<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-annualized-revenue-doubles-to-3-4-billion-since-late-2023?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> somewhere between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in revenue</u></a>, combining both ChatGPT and charging developers to access OpenAI's APIs to integrate generative functions.</li></ul><p>The Information surmises that OpenAI thus has an operating loss of <strong>$5 billion a year.</strong> That also assumes that OpenAI's revenue is on the higher-end, and could balloon to <strong>$6 billion or more.</strong></p><p>Though we don't have direct knowledge, OpenAI's operating costs have continued to rapidly increase over time.<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-chatgpt-costs-openai-to-run-estimate-report-2023-4?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> An estimate from early 2023 suggested that it cost $700,000 a day to run ChatGPT</u></a> at a time when it was <em>popular</em> but not <em>as popular as it is today, </em>and would put ChatGPT's costs alone at around $235.3 million a year. I would also hypothesize that they were much larger based on OpenAI having raised over $13 billion in the last five years, with the majority of the capital (and credit) raises happening between 2021 and 2023.</p><p>OpenAI has historically, based on reporting, failed to make its models more efficient,<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-model-arrakis-dystopian-desert-world-dune-2023-10?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> failing to deliver their more efficient "Arrakis" model to Microsoft in late 2023</u></a>. While the recent launch of its GPT-4o mini model has been hailed as an "efficiency" play,<a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-intelligence/?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=developers%20to%20build%20and%20scale%20powerful%20AI%20applications%20more%20efficiently%20and%20affordably"><u> it appears to only be more efficient and cost-effective for those developing using OpenAI's tools</u></a>, and while one could posit that this suggests that OpenAI found a more efficient/cost-effective model and thus made it cheaper, it has yet to volunteer this information to confirm.</p><p>Assuming everything exists in a vacuum, <strong>OpenAI needs at least $5 billion in new capital a year to survive. </strong>This would require it to raise more money than has ever been raised by any startup in history, possibly in perpetuity, which would in turn require it to access capital at a scale that I can find no comparable company to in business history.</p><p>WeWork — the decrepit failson of Silicon Valley —<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wework/investor_financials?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> raised a total of $22.2 billion</u></a>, with nearly half of it (over $10 billion) raised in debt financing (loans with varying terms) from Goldman Sachs and SoftBank's Vision Fund,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/17/business/wework-softbank-debt-deal.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> some of which it had to restructure as the company collapsed</u></a>. Much of WeWork's capital was raised during a time with lower interest rates and thus much more available money, and heavily relied on SoftBank's continual willingness to dump cash into a fire.

What OpenAI is offering is entirely hype-driven, hard to explain to the layman, a movement driven by a lack of hypergrowth markets.&nbsp;</p><p>Uber was priced to replace a monopoly, and one that most people hated. Taxis were expensive, inconvenient, artificially scarce (especially in cities like New York, which limited the supply of taxis through its medallion system), and seldom accepted credit cards. Worse, discrimination against those of a minority background by drivers was rife and unchallenged (</p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/19/nyregion/nyc-taxis-medallions-suicides.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>and involved exploitative loan schemes</u></a>).

"Better" is also somewhat of a misnomer — a "better" version of ChatGPT may be faster, give answers that are more accurate or that are generated more-quickly, but it is not able to do significantly <em>more</em>. Since November 2022, ChatGPT has grown more sophisticated, faster at generations, capable of ingesting more data, but has yet to generate a true "killer app," an iPhone-esque moment.</p><p>Furthermore, transformer-based models have become heavily-commoditized, with competition from independent(ish) companies like Anthropic's Claude and Meta's LLama, all trained on the same massive data-sets, to the point that ChatGPT's biggest advantage is in its brand. As a result, we're already seeing a race to the bottom, with<a href="https://x.com/minimaxir/status/1813985834728919249?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> GPT-4o Mini (OpenAI's "cheaper" model) already beaten in price by Anthropic's Claude Haiku model</u></a>, and I am confident somebody is already working on a similarly-powerful model that they'll sell <em>for even cheaper.</em></p><p>As a result, OpenAI's revenue might <em>climb</em>, but it's likely going to climb by reducing the cost of its services rather than its own operating costs. OpenAI appears to be operating in the standard valley monopoly model — get as many customers as possible and then work out how to get profitable — but is doing so using a technology that is uniquely expensive to both operate and iterate upon.</p><p>As discussed previously, OpenAI — like every single transformer-based model developer — requires masses of training data to make its models "better," and the<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-training-data-synthetic-openai-anthropic-9230f8d8?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> next generation of GPT will require four to five times the amount it needed for GPT-4</u></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/technology/ai-data-restrictions.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> at a time when publishers and the wider internet have found numerous ways to block them from taking it</u></a>.</p><p>Doing so is also likely going to lead to perpetual legal action, especially as 404 Media reports that Runway, a generative video company,<a href="https://www.404media.co/runway-ai-image-generator-training-data-youtube/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> likely trained its model on thousands of hours of videos taken from YouTube and pirated sources</u></a>. OpenAI has<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/peakai/"><u> been incredibly evasive when asked if it trained their "Sora" model on YouTube videos</u></a>, and if I had to guess, it absolutely has. If it hasn't, it likely will be required to buy tens of thousands — if not millions — of hours of footage, which<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/22/24162782/openai-licensing-deal-wall-street-journal-news-corp?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> will be multitudes more expensive than the $250 million it paid to News Corp to train on its articles</u></a>.</p><p>And, to be abundantly clear, <em>I am not sure there is enough training data in existence</em> to get these models past the next generation. Even if generative AI companies were able to legally and freely download every single piece of text and visual media from the internet, it doesn't appear to be enough to train these models, with some model developers <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/bubble-trouble/"><u>potentially turning to model-generated "synthetic" data</u></a> — a process that could introduce "<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/beware-of-ai-model-collapse-how-training-on-synthetic-data-pollutes-the-next-generation/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>model collapse</u></a>," a form of inbreeding that Jathan Sadowski called "Habsburg AI" that destroys the models over time.</p><p>Even if they were successful in somehow acquiring this much training data, and doing so in a way that was legally sound (which, to be clear, I do not think is possible), they would then have the increasing costs of training these models. Anthropic CEO recently said on a podcast that "<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/ai-models-that-cost-dollar1-billion-to-train-are-in-development-dollar100-billion-models-coming-soon-largest-current-models-take-only-dollar100-million-to-train-anthropic-ceo?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>AI models that cost $1 billion to train are underway</u></a>," and that there are ones in the future that will cost $100 billion. As models become more complex and require more training data, so too does the cost of ingesting the larger (and likely more complex) training data.</p><p>And then there's the very big, annoying problem — that generative AI doesn't have a product-market fit at the scale necessary to support its existence.</p><p>To be clear, I am not saying generative AI is completely useless, or that it hasn't got <em>any</em> product-market fit. It's useful for digging through massive data-sets, quick summaries of articles (for better or worse), and generating images. These models have utility,<u> </u><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24154808/ai-chatgpt-google-gemini-microsoft-copilot-hallucination-wrong?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>despite the propensity of these models to "hallucinate" (authoritatively state something that isn't true, or generate hands with too many fingers)</u></a>,<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c35ce925-d7b3-4920-a431-c4ca1aa33503?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> and people are finding useful things for them to do, particularly in finance</u></a>.</p><p>But what they are not, at this time, is <em>essential.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Generative AI has yet to come up with a reason that you<em> absolutely must integrate it,</em> other than the sense that your company is "behind" if you don't use AI. This wouldn't be a problem if generative AI's operating costs were a minuscule fraction — tens or hundreds of thousands of percent — of what they are today, but as things stand, OpenAI is effectively subsidizing the generative AI movement, all while dealing the problem that while <em>cool</em> and <em>useful</em>, GPT is only changing the world as much as the markets allow it to.</p><p>While complex, generative AI is a technology that probabilistically generates answers, and has no "intelligence." It is inherently limited by its architecture, and in turn can only get "better" in a linear fashion. I see no signs that the transformer-based architecture can do significantly more than it currently does.</p><p>For OpenAI to continue growing, it will either have to significantly increase functionality — something it hasyet to do, but is theoretically possible — or vastly reduce pricing, which will only increase its operating costs.</p><p>And OpenAI <em>must grow,</em> because $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion a year in revenue is simply not enough to keep this company going. This isn't about any personal beliefs I have about generative AI. It's about the fact that this company costs more money to run than any other privately-held startup, and its technology does not — based on OpenAI’s sales — do enough to make up for the fact that it costs so much money.</p><p>Outside of reducing prices, which would increase revenues <em>and </em>operating costs, OpenAI could, theoretically, find new functionality in GPT — though I'm not sure how — or create something entirely different, something it has yet to show any sign of doing. While you could point to tools like Sora (which doesn’t seem particularly useful, and is still far from commercialization), or searchGPT (which would have the same hallucinatory issues that dogged Google search’s own pivot to AI, while also competing against the GPT-enabled Bing), it’s tough to make the case that these products will fill the burning shortfall in OpenAI’s balance sheet, and would likely only add to its operational costs</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-working-new-reasoning-technology-under-code-name-strawberry-2024-07-12/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>In July, Reuters reported</u></a> that OpenAI was "working on a new technology called Strawberry" that would be "capable of delivering advanced reasoning capabilities." However, on a deeper read of the article, OpenAI is <em>thinking about this </em>and <em>trying to</em> do it, and has <em>yet to do it.</em></p><p>If it succeeds — which I add would require potentially entirely new branches of psychology and mathematics to do so, as we humans barely understand our brains — that would be a huge technological achievement that still <em>wouldn't</em> turn things around. OpenAI would own a completely new kind of technology, which would be immensely valuable, and could potentially raise in perpetuity off of that, but it would be heavily-dependent on the level of reasoning and the accompanying tasks it could achieve.</p><p>And, to be clear, it is very, very unlikely this happens. It could — and there is always stuff I might not know about OpenAI's research and development — but we have seen little sign of OpenAI innovating, and far more signs that it’s only capable at this time of iterating on GPT.</p><p>OpenAI also has a problem with its marketing.<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/sam-altman-is-full-of-shit/"><u> Sam Altman has repeatedly misled the media about what "AI might do,"</u></a> conflating generative AI — which does not "know" things and is not "intelligence" — with the purely-theoretical concept of an autonomous, sentient artificial intelligence. As a result, expectations are higher of what future generations of GPT might do, making it inevitable that the company will disappoint investors and customers.</p><p>While there may be ways to reduce the costs of transformer-based models, the level of cost-reduction would be unprecedented, and likely require entirely new chips, cooling solutions and physical server architecture, none of which OpenAI develops.&nbsp;</p><p>While theoretically Nvidia could produce a much-more-efficient chip, doing so would likely take longer than OpenAI has.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/etched-is-building-an-ai-chip-that-only-runs-transformer-models/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> Though there are companies like Etched that <em>claim</em> they are working on specialized chips</u></a>, they are years from delivering any working silicon at the scale that OpenAI would need, and said chips are focused on singular models, making them iterative rather than innovative concepts.</p><p>One thing I am not heavily-discussing is the fact that there doesn't seem to be general-purpose adoption of generative AI. These numbers are hard to establish, but what I have previously established for certain —<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/pop-culture/"><u> in particular based on Goldman Sachs' reporting</u></a> — is that <em>actual meaningful revenue</em> is yet to materialize. This is a bigger existential threat than a lack of adoption. It means people are using it and not getting enough out of it, which could potentially lead to a significant loss of revenue as the hype cycle dies down.</p><p>To summarize:</p><ul><li>OpenAI's only real options are to reduce costs or the price of its offerings. It has not succeeded in reducing costs so far, and reducing prices would only increase costs.</li><li>To progress to the next models of GPT, OpenAI's core product, the company would have to find new functionality.</li><li>OpenAI is inherently limited by GPT's transformer-based architecture, which does not actually automate things, and as a result may only be able to do "more" and "faster," which does not significantly change the product, at least not in such a way that would make it as valuable as it needs to be.</li><li>OpenAI's only other option is to invent an entirely new kind of technology, and be able to productize and monetize said technology, something that the company has not yet been able to do.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>A Note On Energy: </strong>Most of the problems I've listed are existential threats to the future of OpenAI, ones that I can see no quick or easy way out of, but another stands in the way — energy.&nbsp;</p><p>For OpenAI to scale, it would require a massive capital expenditure on multiple levels, chief of them the American power grid (<a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/gs-research/gen-ai-too-much-spend-too-little-benefit/report.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>see page 15 of this Goldman Sachs report for a conversation with Microsoft's former VP of energy</u></a>), which will likely require extensive expansion the likes of which hasn't happened in decades at a time when America is far less apt at infrastructural development.&nbsp;</p><p>While the US steadily added new electricity generation capacity in the second half of the 1900s, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/188521/total-us-electricity-net-generation/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>things started to plateau in the 2010s</u></a>.

Small modular reactors — a promising approach designed to reduce the cost and build times of nuclear power generations — are still far from mass-commercialization, and even if they weren’t, they’d still have to tend with the bureaucracy of the sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even if changing this were possible — and it'd be good for society if it was — artificial intelligence (driven by generative AI) is already massively increasing global emissions, particularly from companies like Google,<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yvz51k2xo?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> which saw its emissions increase by 48% in the last five years thanks to AI</u></a>.</p><p>For OpenAI to continue scaling, it is reliant on a dramatic expansion of the power grid, at a time when (according to Brian Janous of Cloverleaf Infrastructure) the wait times are <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/gs-research/gen-ai-too-much-spend-too-little-benefit/report.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>ranging from 40-70 months to spin up new power projects</u></a>. And OpenAI isn't the company doing the scaling — much like it’s dependent on Nvidia to continue to produce GPUs for generative AI's cloud compute, so too is it dependent on companies like Microsoft, Google, and Oracle working with power companies to expand the grid.</p><h2 id="a-grim-situation"><strong>A Grim Situation</strong></h2><p>Absolutely nothing about what I've written here is based on personal grievance, or a dislike of generative AI, or really anything other than a frank evaluation of a company that I believe may be teetering on the brink of collapse.</p><p>For OpenAI to continue operating, things have to change dramatically.</p><ul><li>In the event that OpenAI is making the highest-end of their reported revenue range — $4.5 billion — and it has that much in the bank as we speak, it will have to raise at least $2 billion, or as much as $10 billion, within the next 12 months.</li><li>In the event that it hasless than a billion in the bank, OpenAI will likely have to raise $5 billion, and do so in the next three to six months.</li><li>Otherwise, OpenAI will either have to <em>at least </em>halve their operating costs, <em>all while maintaining the current pace of revenue,</em> or find a way to literally double its revenue while keeping costs at the same rate. Even then, these numbers are extremely concerning — though I add there are always things that I don't know as OpenAI is a private company, and thus isn’t subject to the same disclosure rules as publicly-traded companies.</li></ul><p>Survival would require OpenAI to raise more money than anybody ever has. This is technically possible, but would require venture capitalists and investment banks to effectively provide a lifeline to the company in perpetuity, unless the company is capable of either heavily reducing costs or finding billions of dollars more in revenue. Even if it succeeds, if the cost of revenue increases along with sales, all growth would be for nought, and create further problems and dependencies on venture capital — or on companies like Microsoft.</p><p>It would require a way of expanding what OpenAI can sell to address the entirety of corporate America, which would require use cases that I do not believe generative AI is capable of meeting, like automating chunks of the economy rather than<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-replace-freelance-jobs-51807bc7?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u> bankrupting freelance designers and copy-editors</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, I am not advocating for workers being replaced by AI. I am simply saying that for OpenAI to grow to the $10+ billion revenue a year it needs to survive, it would need to replace entire chunks of the labor force. And as a reminder, generative AI is not automation.</p><p>Even if these problems are surmountable, there is simply not enough training data, and even if there were, the cost of processing it will likely vastly outweigh whatever revenue OpenAI makes. Even if this were resolved — which would likely require $30 billion in, at best, cloud credits — doing so would not necessarily make transformer-based models capable of doing what it takes to sell $10 billion of software a year.</p><p>If I had to just choose a number, I hypothesize that OpenAI needs to raise $20 billion in the next two years to even stay in the game, and to get any further — something that isn't guaranteed — will cost them another $20 billion. For context, according to Crunchbase, the aggregate of all funding in 2023 was $299.2 billion, with $147 billion raised so far in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI would have to regularly make up 5-10% <em>of all startup funding, forever</em>, <em>or at least until it works out how to lose less or make more money.</em>&nbsp;</p><blockquote>The only other company that has done so is Uber — and as I’ve discussed above, their situation is very, very different. Comparing the two is ahistorical on the funding climate alone, with Uber existing at a time with lower interest rates. Along with $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment fund and over $8 billion from Softbank, the latter a secondary market sale, it also raised (equity and debt financing respectively) from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — two parties I do not believe are going to be willing to subsidize generative AI. <p>Even if I’m wrong — which I could be, stranger things have happened — the willingness and ease of getting people to hand over hundreds of millions or billions of dollars became markedly different between Uber’s last funding round (September 14 2020) and 2024. The majority of its funding was raised between 2016 and 2019, too, when interest rates were low and, thus, VC coffers were overflowing. </p><p>And, crucially, investors had an incredibly clear path to liquidity — an IPO. Uber was always a dog of a company, but they always knew it’d chug along as a growth-at-all-costs monster on the market. How would OpenAI IPO? Its most recent round was a secondary market raise, selling insider stock to new investors. </p><p>If we humor this idea as the ultimate goal of pumping this company full of money, what are its plans to go public? </p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-ceo-has-no-ipo-plan-due-strange-company-structure-2023-06-06/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Altman said as recently as June 2023 that its company structure would prohibit an IPO</u></a>, but do you think that OpenAI wants to subject itself to the scrutiny of the public markets, especially given their approach to copyrighted material? <p>Microsoft has a built-in profit share, but what of Sequoia? How does it get paid, other than finding another investor who wants the stock?</p><p>Perhaps there’s something I’m missing, but if investors have no path to an IPO, this feels like a game of hot potato, except the loser is left with a big, useless stock.Unless, of course, that investor is Microsoft, who will end up being able to use any leftover tech, and will benefit if OpenAI becomes profitable.</p></blockquote><p>Furthermore, I hypothesize a race to the bottom in generative AI will significantly hamper OpenAI's ability to expand revenue, compounded by the fact that we're approaching the limits of transformer-based architecture.</p><p>And because OpenAI (and the competition) are so deep in the hole with transformer-based models, I believe they will continue to drive billions into them, burning money on training them using data that may or may not have been legally acquired, and any lawsuit that goes in favor of the plaintiff would have potentially apocalyptic consequences for these models, requiring them to be retrained from scratch with an entirely new dataset, costing further hundreds of millions or <em>billions</em>.</p><p>And, quite frankly, I am just not sure how OpenAI will make this all work.</p><p>While OpenAI could — and I believe will — raise another huge, industry-defining round, doing so will require pulling in Canadian pension funds, Saudi sovereign wealth funds, or massive investment funds that would require swaths of equity. Doing so multiple times is possible, but very, very unlikely, in the same way that continuing to increase revenue at hundreds of percent each year is <em>possible,</em> but very, very unlikely. It could come up with something new, or find a way to make generative AI much cheaper, but again, that is so very, very unlikely.</p><p>OpenAI could be the most important tech company of all time, in that it will have to devour the very Gods of Silicon Valley to continue its rapacious growth. In doing so, it will break records in funding and software revenue, and do so while warding off competition from startups — as well as its own investor Microsoft.</p><p>I don't know how OpenAI does it. Writing this piece took me hours, and in doing so, I genuinely tried to work out how OpenAI survives, and every single corner I turned ended with "it can do it if it does something that has never happened."</p><p>I have written this with a dispassionate tone because I need people to take me seriously when I say that to survive, generative AI must do so much more than it currently does, and much cheaper than it's currently doing so. To survive, OpenAI must break every startup record known to man, and to thrive, it must either reinvent transformer-based architecture to reduce its compute requirements, and then invent an entirely new kind of artificial intelligence to do the things that people want AI to do.</p><p>Perhaps I'm wrong. Perhaps there are things that I don't know — about OpenAI, about the things it’s working on in secret, about some sort of energy or chip breakthrough that will approach so suddenly that I will eat crow. Perhaps it has more money in the bank than I thought, or perhaps their costs are currently inflated in a way that I — and the entirety of the tech media — are unaware of.</p><p>But if there were, I believe we would know, or at least have some sort of sign.</p><p>I don't know what happens next, but I do know things have to change. I fear OpenAI will compete on price, sending its costs upward, or charge what it needs to to approach break-even, which I don't think it’s willing to do. I fear for Anthropic, which has less money, less revenue, and equally gruesome burn. I fear for those founders relying on the current pricing for GPT and other models.</p><p>Without OpenAI, the bottom drops out of the entire generative AI market, and will more than likely brutalize any public stock associated with the generative AI boom.</p><p>I recognize reading this you might dismiss me as a cynic, or a pessimist, or as someone rooting for the end, and I have taken great pains to explain my hypotheses here in detail without much opinion or editorializing. If you disagree with me, tell me how I’m wrong — explain to me what I’ve missed, show me the holes in my logic or my math.&nbsp;</p><p>I caution you not to dismiss me, even if what I’ve written deeply upsets you. What I am describing here is a deeply unsustainable company that many have pinned their hopes on, and even if I’m wrong, this kind of analysis is necessary when there is a company burning billions of dollars that will likely attempt to absorb billions more dollars of capital to survive.&nbsp;</p><p>This discussion is equal parts necessary and troubling, uncomfortable in its implications and possibilities, and unsettling in its potential outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope I'm wrong. I really do.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Vanilla OS is an experimental distro testing out new implementations of immutability, cross-distro packaging, A/B failover, and more.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://vanillaos.org/blog/article/2024-07-28/vanilla-os-2-orchid---stable-release" rel="nofollow">Vanilla OS 2 Orchid</a> appeared earlier this week. It's a very different OS from version 1, which came out 18 months ago and that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/03/vanilla_os_2210/">we tried out in January 2023</a>, but the same overall goals remain.</p>
<p>Vanilla OS is a general-purpose desktop Linux that shares some of the design features of ChromeOS. Like ChromeOS, it's immutable. The root file system is read-only, which should make it much more resistant to corruption or malware. Also like ChromeOS, it has two separate root partitions, which update one another, so if an update goes wrong and renders that instance unbootable, you can still boot the other and undo the changes. However, unlike ChromeOS, you can install and run your own applications – from multiple different distros.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/07/30/vanilla-os-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/07/30/vanilla-os-2.jpg?x=648&amp;y=487&amp;infer_y=1" alt="Vanilla OS desktop showing a terminal windows with Neofetch in front of the Tour application" title="Vanilla OS looks like any other GNOME distro, and you can install .deb packages from the shell easily enough" height="487" width="648"></a></p><p>Vanilla OS looks like any other GNOME distro, and you can install .deb packages from the shell easily enough – click to enlarge</p>
</div>
<p>Version 2, codenamed Orchid, is based on different foundations than version 1, which was codenamed "Kinetic." As the name suggests, Vanilla OS 1 was based on Ubuntu, specifically <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/20/ubuntu_2210_kinetic_kudu/">version 22.10</a> "Kinetic Kudu." For the Orchid release, the team has moved away from the Ubuntu base in favor of Debian Sid, the rolling, test release that's upstream of the slow-moving Debian stable. It's an interesting choice. Sid is <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable" rel="nofollow">unstable by name</a> and unstable by nature, and there's always the&nbsp;possibility that an update could break things.</p>
<p>That's why the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/05/siduction_2022_1/">Debian meta-distro siduction</a> exists. You get the latest components from Sid, but you also get openSUSE-derived snapshot support, so if something breaks you can "roll back" to a working version. Vanilla OS has something comparable, but simpler. Rather than lots of snapshots to manage, it has "A" and "B" root partitions, so should be robust against bad updates.</p>

    

<p>Leaving its Ubuntu base behind also means that Orchid drops Snap support, though. In theory, there's a wide choice of software. As well as Flatpaks, Vanilla OS also has built-in support for Alpine, Debian, Fedora, Arch, and openSUSE packages via its own package-management wrapper called <a target="_blank" href="https://vanillaos.org/blog/article/2023-01-28/apx-an-unconventional-package-manager" rel="nofollow">Apx</a>… and it also claims support for the AppImage format, and an Android runtime based on Waydroid.</p>

        


        

<p>All of these different environments run via built-in OCI containers, managed&nbsp;by Podman. However, we couldn't get anything except Debian packages&nbsp;working in our testing. For instance, AppImage needs the <code>libfuse</code> libraries, but they weren't installed – and as it's an immutable distro you can't readily do that.</p>
<p>Orchid offers the GNOME Software store to add programs, but this&nbsp;is aimed at Flatpaks, which means GUI apps, not command-line tools and system components. For instance, when searching for "fuse" you get a <a target="_blank" href="https://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">free ZX Spectrum emulator</a> and a <a target="_blank" href="https://diffuse.sourceforge.net/download.html" rel="nofollow">file-compare utility</a>.</p>

        

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/apx-gui" rel="nofollow">apx-gui</a> command for configuring repositories showed configured entries for&nbsp;<code>alpine</code>, <code>arch</code>, <code>fedora</code>, <code>opensuse</code>, <code>ubuntu</code>, <code>vanilla-dev</code>, and <code>vanilla</code>, but the column that should open a terminal in each container was empty. Due to the complex partitioning layout, which uses thin-provisioned LVM volumes, we couldn't work out how to invoke the Apx GUI from a shell, so we couldn't run&nbsp;it as root.</p>

</div>
<p>The project has a <a target="_blank" href="https://vanillaos.org/help" rel="nofollow">help and documentation site</a>, but it's still rather patchy, and some sections seem not to have been updated from Vanilla OS 1 yet. For instance, we found it refused the <a target="_blank" href="https://handbook.vanillaos.org/2023/01/11/install-and-manage-applications.html" rel="nofollow">command syntax in the handbook</a> for installing packages. We tried to start the Android runtime, but the OS complained that this didn't work if Secure Boot was enabled – which it wasn't in our QEMU-based <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/29/utm_apple_hypervisor_foss_fest/">UTM virtual machine</a>.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/30/lz4_gets_much_faster/">Latest update for 'extremely fast' compression algorithm LZ4 sprints past old versions</a></li>

</ul>
<p>We used UTM because Vanilla OS only supports UEFI (still an experimental feature in Virtualbox), and it has quite high system requirements, like at least 50 GB of disk space. We also tried to install it on a testbed ThinkPad X220, but the installation failed to complete, complaining about being unable to format the <code>var</code> partition. It comes with the latest <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/21/gnome_46_beta_released/">GNOME 46.1</a> and kernel 6.9.8, which means it's too new for any of <em>The Reg</em> FOSS desk's Nvidia-GPU test kit.</p>
<p>Vanilla OS looks great, thanks to GNOME's impeccable graphic design, and things like having disk encryption on by default, GPU switching, and support for packages from all the leading distros sound appealing. However, this is a very bleeding-edge experimental distro, and in practice, we found it felt unfinished and not fully working.</p>
<p>Vanilla OS is trying out quite major technical innovations, and even so, it's already functional, which is impressive. Rather than the minor UI tweaks that are most distros are doing, it is changing the way Linux boots, updates itself, handles applications, and more besides. In these areas, it's more radical than <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/22/fedora_40_at_rc_stage/">Fedora's "Atomic" immutable variants</a> or even than the other consumer-targeted immutable distro we're watching, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/31/endless_os_6/">Endless OS</a>.</p>
<p>It uses Btrfs for the OS volumes, which is safer in an immutable OS. Due to this and the complexity of its volume management, it's hard to estimate its disk usage, but it's in the region of 18 GB, and it used 1.1 GB of RAM. Although elaborate, its partitioning is simpler than that of ChromeOS Flex, and in principle it can dual-boot. The dual-partition failover concept is already working in the field in tens of millions of Chromebooks, of course.</p>

        

<p>Despite its version number, though, Vanilla OS 2 feels to us more like a prototype or alpha-test release. If you can dedicate a modern, well-specified machine to it and would like to explore some new technology, it has great promise, but it's not ready for prime time yet. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>More than a million domain names — including many registered by Fortune 100 firms and brand protection companies — are vulnerable to takeover by cybercriminals thanks to authentication weaknesses at a number of large web hosting providers and domain registrars, new research finds.</p>
<div id="attachment_68225"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68225" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/duckstarget.png" alt="" width="750" height="433"></p><p id="caption-attachment-68225">Image: Shutterstock.</p></div>
<p>Your Web browser knows how to find a site like example.com thanks to the global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domain Name System</a> (DNS), which serves as a kind of phone book for the Internet by translating human-friendly website names (example.com) into numeric Internet addresses.</p>
<p>When someone registers a domain name, the registrar will typically provide two sets of DNS records that the customer then needs to assign to their domain. Those records are crucial because they allow Web browsers to find the Internet address of the hosting provider that is serving that domain.</p>
<p>But potential problems can arise when a domain’s DNS records are “lame,” meaning the authoritative name server does not have enough information about the domain and can’t resolve queries to find it. A domain can become lame in a variety of ways, such as when it is not assigned an Internet address, or because the name servers in the domain’s authoritative record are misconfigured or missing.</p>
<p>The reason lame domains are problematic is that a number of Web hosting and DNS providers allow users to claim control over a domain <em>without accessing the true owner’s account at their DNS provider or registrar</em>.</p>
<p>If this threat sounds familiar, that’s because it is hardly new. Back in 2019, KrebsOnSecurity wrote about thieves employing this method to seize control over thousands of domains registered at GoDaddy, and using those <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/01/bomb-threat-sextortion-spammers-abused-weakness-at-godaddy-com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to send bomb threats and sextortion emails</a> (GoDaddy says they fixed that weakness in their systems not long after that 2019 story).</p>
<p>In the 2019 campaign, the spammers created accounts on GoDaddy and were able to take over vulnerable domains simply by registering a free account at GoDaddy and being assigned the same DNS servers as the hijacked domain.</p>
<p>Three years before that, the same pervasive weakness was described in a blog post by security researcher <strong>Matthew Bryant</strong>, who showed how one could <a href="https://thehackerblog.com/the-orphaned-internet-taking-over-120k-domains-via-a-dns-vulnerability-in-aws-google-cloud-rackspace-and-digital-ocean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commandeer at least 120,000 domains</a> via DNS weaknesses at some of the world’s largest hosting providers.</p>
<p>Incredibly, new research jointly released today by security experts at <strong>Infoblox</strong> and <strong>Eclypsium</strong> finds this same authentication weakness is still present at a number of large hosting and DNS providers.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to exploit, very hard to detect, and it’s entirely preventable,” said <strong>Dave Mitchell</strong>, principal threat researcher at Infoblox. “Free services make it easier [to exploit] at scale. And the bulk of these are at a handful of DNS providers.”</p>
<h2>SITTING DUCKS</h2>
<p><a href="https://blogs.infoblox.com/threat-intelligence/who-knew-domain-hijacking-is-so-easy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infoblox’s report</a> found there are multiple cybercriminal groups abusing these stolen domains as a globally dispersed “traffic distribution system,” which can be used to mask the true source or destination of web traffic and to funnel Web users to malicious or phishous websites.</p>
<p>Commandeering domains this way also can allow thieves to impersonate trusted brands and abuse their positive or at least neutral reputation when sending email from those domains, as we saw in 2019 with the GoDaddy attacks.</p>
<p>“Hijacked domains have been used directly in phishing attacks and scams, as well as large spam systems,” reads the Infoblox report, which refers to lame domains as “<strong>Sitting Ducks</strong>.” “There is evidence that some domains were used for Cobalt Strike and other malware command and control (C2). Other attacks have used hijacked domains in targeted phishing attacks by creating lookalike subdomains. A few actors have stockpiled hijacked domains for an unknown purpose.”</p>
<p>Eclypsium researchers <a href="https://eclypsium.com/blog/ducks-now-sitting-dns-internet-infrastructure-insecurity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimate</a> there are currently about one million Sitting Duck domains, and that at least 30,000 of them have been hijacked for malicious use since 2019.</p>
<p>“As of the time of writing, numerous DNS providers enable this through weak or nonexistent verification of domain ownership for a given account,” Eclypsium wrote.</p>
<p>The security firms said they found a number of compromised Sitting Duck domains were originally registered by brand protection companies that specialize in defensive domain registrations (reserving look-alike domains for top brands before those names can be grabbed by scammers) and combating trademark infringement.</p>
<p>For example, Infoblox found cybercriminal groups using a Sitting Duck domain called <strong>clickermediacorp[.]com</strong>, which was a CBS Interactive Inc. domain initially registered in 2009 at GoDaddy. However, in 2010 the DNS was updated to DNSMadeEasy.com servers, and in 2012 the domain was transferred to <strong>MarkMonitor</strong>.</p>
<p>Another hijacked Sitting Duck domain — <strong>anti-phishing[.]org</strong> — was registered in 2003 by the <strong>Anti-Phishing Working Group</strong> (APWG), a cybersecurity not-for-profit organization that closely tracks phishing attacks.</p>
<p>In many cases, the researchers discovered Sitting Duck domains that appear to have been configured to auto-renew at the registrar, but the authoritative DNS or hosting services were not renewed.</p>
<p>The researchers say Sitting Duck domains all possess three attributes that makes them vulnerable to takeover:</p>
<p>1) the domain uses or delegates authoritative DNS services to a different provider than the domain registrar;<br>
2) the authoritative name server(s) for the domain does not have information about the Internet address the domain should point to;<br>
3) the authoritative DNS provider is “exploitable,” i.e. an attacker can claim the domain at the provider and set up DNS records without access to the valid domain owner’s account at the domain registrar.</p>
<div id="attachment_68226"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68226" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sittingduckattack.png" alt="" width="751" height="337" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sittingduckattack.png 784w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sittingduckattack-768x345.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sittingduckattack-782x351.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-68226">Image: Infoblox.</p></div>
<p>How does one know whether a DNS provider is exploitable? There is a frequently updated list published on <strong>GitHub</strong> called “<a href="https://github.com/indianajson/can-i-take-over-dns?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Can I take over DNS</a>,” which has been documenting exploitability by DNS provider over the past several years. The list includes examples for each of the named DNS providers.<span id="more-68214"></span></p>
<p>In the case of the aforementioned Sitting Duck domain clickermediacorp[.]com, the domain was originally registered by , but it appears to have been hijacked by scammers by claiming it at the web hosting firm <strong>DNSMadeEasy</strong>, which is owned by <strong>Digicert</strong>, one of the industry’s largest issuers of digital certificates (SSL/TLS certificates).</p>
<p>In an interview with KrebsOnSecurity, DNSMadeEasy founder and senior vice president <strong>Steve Job</strong> said the problem isn’t really his company’s to solve, noting that DNS providers who are also not domain registrars have no real way of validating whether a given customer legitimately owns the domain being claimed.</p>
<p>“We do shut down abusive accounts when we find them,” Job said. “But it’s my belief that the onus needs to be on the [domain registrants] themselves. If you’re going to buy something and point it somewhere you have no control over, we can’t prevent that.”</p>
<p>Infoblox, Eclypsium, and the DNS wiki listing at Github all say that web hosting giant <strong>Digital Ocean</strong> is among the vulnerable hosting firms. In response to questions, Digital Ocean said it was exploring options for mitigating such activity.</p>
<p>“The DigitalOcean DNS service is not authoritative, and we are not a domain registrar,” Digital Ocean wrote in an emailed response. “Where a domain owner has delegated authority to our DNS infrastructure with their registrar, and they have allowed their ownership of that DNS record in our infrastructure to lapse, that becomes a ‘lame delegation’ under this hijack model. We believe the root cause, ultimately, is poor management of domain name configuration by the owner, akin to leaving your keys in your unlocked car, but we acknowledge the opportunity to adjust our non-authoritative DNS service guardrails in an effort to help minimize the impact of a lapse in hygiene at the authoritative DNS level. We’re connected with the research teams to explore additional mitigation options.”</p>
<p>In a statement provided to KrebsOnSecurity, the hosting provider and registrar <strong>Hostinger</strong> said they were working to implement a solution to prevent lame duck attacks in the “upcoming weeks.”</p>
<p>“We are working on implementing an SOA-based domain verification system,” Hostinger wrote. “Custom nameservers with a Start of Authority (SOA) record will be used to verify whether the domain truly belongs to the customer. We aim to launch this user-friendly solution by the end of August. The final step is to deprecate preview domains, a functionality sometimes used by customers with malicious intents. Preview domains will be deprecated by the end of September. Legitimate users will be able to use randomly generated temporary subdomains instead.”</p>
<p>What did DNS providers that have struggled with this issue in the past do to address these authentication challenges? The security firms said that to claim a domain name, the best practice providers gave the account holder random name servers that required a change at the registrar before the domains could go live. They also found the best practice providers used various mechanisms to ensure that the newly assigned name server hosts did not match previous name server assignments.</p>
<p>[Side note: Infoblox observed that many of the hijacked domains were being hosted at <strong>Stark Industries Solutions</strong>, a sprawling hosting provider that appeared two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine and has become <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the epicenter of countless cyberattacks against enemies of Russia</a>].</p>
<p>Both Infoblox and Eclypsium said that without more cooperation and less finger-pointing by all stakeholders in the global DNS, attacks on sitting duck domains will continue to rise, with domain registrants and regular Internet users caught in the middle.</p>
<p>“Government organizations, regulators, and standards bodies should consider long-term solutions to vulnerabilities in the DNS management attack surface,” the Infoblox report concludes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>So, let's say that a security vendor, we'll call them ClownStrike, accidentally
takes down most of their Windows install base with a poorly tested content
update. Rough day at the office, huh? There are lots of things you could say
about this, lots of reasons it happens this way, lots of people to blame and
not to blame, etc., etc., but nearly every time a major security incident like
this hits the news, you see a lot of people repeating an old refrain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>these systems shouldn't be connected to the internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every time, I get a little twitch.</p>
<p>The idea that computer systems just "shouldn't be connected to the internet,"
for security or reliability purposes, is a really common one. It's got a lot of
appeal to it! But there's not really that many environments where it's done. In
this unusually applied and present-era article, I want to talk a little about
the real considerations around "just not connecting it to the internet," and
why I wish people wouldn't bring it up if they aren't ready for some serious
considerations.</p>
<h2>We Live in a Society</h2>
<p>In the abstract, computers can perform valuable work by doing, well,
computation. In practice, the computation is rarely that important. In
industry, there is a lot more "information technology" than there is
"computation." Information technology inherently needs to ingest and produce
information, and while that was once facilitated by a department of Operators
loading tapes, we have found the whole Operator thing to be costly and slow
compared to real-time communications.</p>
<p>In other words, the modern business computer is almost primarily a
communications device.</p>
<p>There are not that many practical line-of-business computer systems that
produce value without interconnection with other line-of-business computer
systems. These interconnections often cross organizational and geographical
boundaries.</p>
<p>I am thinking, for example, of the case of airline reservation and scheduling
systems disabled by the CrowdStrike, er, sorry, whatever I called them
incident. These are fundamentally communications systems, and have their
origins as replacements for the telephone and telegraph. It is not possible
to simply not internetwork them, because networking is inherent to their
function.</p>
<h2>Networking is important to maintenance and operations</h2>
<p>But let's consider systems that don't actually require real-time communications
to perform their business purpose. Network connectivity still tends to be really
valuable for these.</p>
<p>For one, consider maintenance: how does a system obtain software updates if you
have no internet connection? How is that system monitored?</p>
<p>And even if you think you can avoid those requirements by declaring a system
"complete" and without the need for any updates or real-time monitoring or
intervention, business requirements have the frustrating habit of changing over
time, and network connectivity reduces the cost of handling those changes
tremendously.</p>
<h2>What does it mean for a system to not be connected to the internet?</h2>
<p>First, we need to consider the fact that there are as many forms of "not
connected to the internet" as there are ways of being connected to the
internet. For this reason alone, proposing that a system shouldn't be
internet-connected is usually too nonspecific to really discuss. Let's consider
a menu of possibilities:</p>
<p>List 1:</p>
<ol>
<li>A single device with no network connection at all.</li>
<li>A system of devices that is "air-gapped" in the strictest sense, with no
connection to any network other than its private local-area one, where data
never crosses the security boundary.</li>
<li>That same system, but someone carries DVD-Rs across the security boundary to
introduce new data to the private network.</li>
<li>That same system, but a cross-domain solution or "data diode" allows
movement of data from a wider (or lower-security) network into the private (or
higher-security) network.</li>
<li>That same system, where the cross-domain solution does <em>not</em> have a costly
and difficult to obtain NSA certification.</li>
</ol>
<p>List 2:</p>
<ol>
<li>A system of devices which interconnect over a private wide-area network
using fully independent physical infrastructure with physical precautions
against tampering.</li>
<li>That same system, but the independent physical infrastructure is run through
commodity shared ducts.</li>
<li>That same system, but the infrastructure is leased dark fiber.</li>
<li>That same system, but the infrastructure is wavelengths on lit fiber.</li>
<li>That same system, but the infrastructure is "virtual private ethernet"
implemented by the provider using, let's say, MPLS.</li>
<li>That same system, but the infrastructure is "virtual private ethernet"
implemented by the provider using a tunneling solution with encryption and
authentication.</li>
</ol>
<p>List 3:</p>
<ol>
<li>A system of devices which interconnect over a common-carrier network (such
as, we might even dare say, the internet), where private network traffic is
tunneled through encryption and authentication performed by hardware devices.</li>
<li>That same system, but the hardware devices do not have a costly and difficult
to obtain NSA certification.</li>
<li>That same system, but the tunneling is performed by a software solution
that is well-designed such that it configures the operating system network
stack, at a low level, to prevent any traffic bypassing the tunnel, and this
has been validated by someone much smarter than me.</li>
<li>That same system, but not so well designed and validated by someone like me.</li>
<li>That same system, but the "software solution" is like Wireguard and an
iptables script that has been "thoroughly tested" by someone on Reddit.</li>
</ol>
<p>List 4:</p>
<ol>
<li>A system of devices which interconnect on a private network that has
interconnection to the internet that is strictly limited by policy-based
routing or other reliable methods, such that only very narrowly defined
traffic flows are possible.</li>
<li>That same system, but the permissible network flows are documented in
some old Jira tickets and some of them were, you know, just thrown in to
make it work.</li>
<li>That same system, but it's basically protected by a firewall that's
pretty liberal about outbound flows (maybe with IPS or something), and
pretty restrictive about inbound flows.</li>
</ol>
<p>List 5:</p>
<ol>
<li>An AWS private VPC without any routing elsewhere.</li>
<li>An AWS private VPC with PrivateLinks and other AWS networking baubles
that allow it communicate with other private VPCs.</li>
<li>That same system, but some of the interconnected VPCs can route traffic
to/from the internet.</li>
<li>An AWS private VPC with NAT GW and IGW but the security groups are set up
pretty tight in both directions.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are all things that I have seen described as non-internet-connected.
Take a moment to work through each list and mark the point at which you think
that is no longer a reasonable claim. It's okay, I'll wait.</p>
<p>I'm not going to provide threat modeling for all of these scenarios because it
would go on for pages, but you can probably see that pretty much every option
is at least slightly different in terms of attack surface and risk.</p>
<p>This might seem like an annoying or pedantic argument, but this is actually the
biggest reason I get irritated when people say that something should never be
connected to the internet. What do they <em>mean</em> by that?  When someone says that
an airline reservation system shouldn't be internet-connected, they clearly
don't actually mean the strictest form of that contention (no network
connection at all) unless their name is Adama and they liked when airline
reservation centers had big turntables of paper cards they spun around to check
off your seat. They must mean one of the midpoints presented above, which are
pretty much all coherent positions, but all positions with different
practical considerations.</p>
<p>This ambiguity makes it hard to actually, seriously consider the merits of
dropping internet connectivity.</p>
<h2>Non-internet connected systems are so very, very annoying</h2>
<p>In my day job, I work with a wide variety of clients with a wide variety of
cultures, IT architectures, and so on. Some of them are in highly regulated
industries or defense or whatever, and so they actually conduct software
operations in networks with either no internet connectivity or tightly
restricted internet connectivity.</p>
<p>When I discover this to be the case, I mentally multiply all of the
schedule/cost estimates by a factor of, I would say, 3 to 10, depending on
where they fall on the above lists (usually 3x to 5x for list 5 and 10x to a
bajillion times forever for list 1, just rule of thumb).</p>
<p>Here's the thing: virtually the entire software landscape has been designed
with the assumption of internet connectivity. Your operating system wants to
obtain its updates from online servers. If you are paying for expensive
licenses for your operating system, the vendor probably offers additional
expensive licenses for infrastructure to perform updates within your private
network. If you are getting your operating system for free-as-in-beer, there's
a good bet you can figure it out yourself, but if you're using anything to new
and cutting-edge it might be a massive hassle.</p>
<p>But that just, you know, scratches the surface. You probably develop and deploy
software using a half dozen different package managers with varying degrees of
accommodation for operating against private, internal repositories. Some of them
make this easy, some of them don't, but the worst part is that you will have to
figure it out about fifty times because of the combinatorial complexity of
multiple package managers, multiple ways of invoking them, and multiple
environments in which they are invoked.</p>
<p>If you are operating a private network, your internal services probably don't
have TLS certificates signed by a popular CA that is in root programs. You will
spend many valuable hours of your life trying to remember the default password
for the JRE's special private trust store and discovering all of the other
things that have special private trust stores, even though your operating
system provides a perfectly reasonable trust store that is relatively easy to
manage, because of Reasons. You will discover that in some tech stacks this is
consistent but in others it depends on what libraries you use.</p>
<p>A bunch of the software you use will want to perform cloud licensing and get
irritated when it cannot phone home for entitlements. You will have to go back
and forth with your vendors to figure out a workaround somewhere between "add
these ninety seven /16s to your firewall exceptions" and "wait six months while
we figure out the internal process to issue you a bespoke licensing scheme."</p>
<p>All of your stuff that requires updates or content updates will have some
different process you have to follow to obtain those updates and then provide
them internally. Here's a not at all made up example, but a real one I have
personally lived through: you will find that a particular (and particularly
hated) enterprise software vendor provides content updates for offline use only
through a customer support portal that is held over from three acquisitions
ago, and that it is only possible to get an account in that customer support
portal by getting an entitlement manually added in a different customer support
portal held over from two acquisitions ago. It will take over three months of
support tickets and escalations through your named account executive to get
accounts opened in successively older customer support portals until you can
finally get into the right one, which incidentally has an invalid TLS cert you
are reassured is not something to worry about. Once you download your offline
content update, you will find that the documented process to apply it no longer
works, and it will take a long email chain with one of the engineers to get the
right instructions. You paid a five-figure sum for a 1-year license to this
software and it has now nearly elapsed while you figured out how to use it. You
will of course get an extension on that license pro bono, because this is
enterprise software sales and what is a quarter worth of my salary between
friends, but they won't manage to issue the extension license until after
your original one has already expired, causing a painful interruption in CI
pipelines and a violent revolution by the developers.</p>
<p>I am sorry, you are not my therapist, I will try to stop remembering that dark
time in my career. Don't worry, the software in question seems to have fallen
out of favor and cannot hurt you.</p>
<p>So, like, that's an over-the-top example (but seriously, a real one!), but you
get the point. It's not really that any individual part of operating in an
offline environment is hard---I mean some of them are, but most of them aren't.
It's a death by a thousand cuts. Every single thing you ever do is harder when
you do not have internet connectivity, and you will pay for it in money and
time.</p>
<p>The largest problem by far is that almost everyone who develops software
assumes that their product will not need to operate in an offline environment,
and if they find out that it does they will fix that with duct tape and shell
scripts because it only matters for a small portion of their customers. You,
the person with the offline environment, will become the proud owner of their
technical debt.</p>
<p>None of this really <em>needs</em> to be that way, it's just how it is! There are not
really that many offline environments, and they tend to be found in big
institutions that have adapted to the fact that they make everything cost more
and take longer, and are surprisingly tolerant of vendors who perform a three
stooges routine every time you say "air-gap," because that's what pretty much
every vendor does. Except for like Red Hat, I genuinely think Red Hat is pretty
good about this, but you betcha what you save in time you are paying in cash.</p>
<h2>Not many people do this</h2>
<p>That's kind of the point, right? The problem with non-internet-connected
environments is that they are rare. The stronger versions, things from List 1
and List 2, are mostly only seen in defense and intelligence, although I have
also seen some banks with pretty impressive practices. You will note that
defense and intelligence, and even banks, are also famously industries where
everything costs way too much and takes way too long. These correlations are
probably not coincidences.</p>
<p>Even the weaker forms tend to be limited to highly-regulated industries
(finance and healthcare are the big ones), although you see the occasional
random software company that just takes security really seriously and keeps
things locked down. Occasionally.</p>
<h2>Okay, let's stop just complaining</h2>
<p>Here's the thing: I genuinely do not think that "fewer systems should be
connected to the internet" is a bad idea. I really wish that things were
different, and that every part of the software industry was more prepared and
more comfortable operating in environments with no or limited internet
connectivity. But that is not the world that we currently live in! So let's
get optimistic, what should we be doing right now?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Apply restrictive network policy on as much of your stuff as possible.
Cloud providers generally make this easier than it has ever been before, it's
not all that easy but it's also not all that hard to operate a practical
non-internet-routed environment in AWS. If you stay within the lanes of all
the AWS managed services, it's mostly pain-free. You will pay for this, but,
you know, AWS always gets their check anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build software with offline environments in mind. Any time that you need
to phone home to get something, provide a way to disable it (if practical)
or a way to override the endpoint that will be used. If the latter, keep in
mind that you will also need to come up with a way for a customer to feasibly
host their own endpoint. If you keep to simple static files, that's really
easy, just nginx and a directory or whatever. If it's an API or something,
well, you're probably going to have to ship your internal implementation.
Brace yourself for the maintenance overhead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to think about the little assumptions that go into connecting to other
services that become more complex in an offline environment. Please, for the
love of God, do not assume you can reach LetsEncrypt. But that's not the only
TLS problem, offline environments virtually always imply internal certificate
authorities. <em>Use the system trust store.</em> Please. I am begging you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid fetching any kind of requirements or dependencies at deploy time. One
of the advantages Docker supposedly brought us was making all of the
requirements of a given package self-contained, but then I still run into
Docker containers that can't start if they can't reach the npm repos or
something. And now I have yet another place to fix configuration and trust
store and etc., in your stupid Docker container. It has made things more
difficult instead of less.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Have I mentioned that Docker, paradoxically, actually makes offline
environments <em>more</em> difficult to manage? Yeah, because virtually every
third-party Docker container has <em>at least</em> a TLS trust store you'll have to
modify. Docker is, itself, a profound example of how the modern software
industry simply assumes that everything is running On The Internet.</p>
<h2>Anyway</h2>
<p>I wrote this out in a bit of a huff because I have seen "why were they
connected to the internet at all?" like four times in response to the
CrowdStrike incident. I know, I am committing the cardinal sin of taking things
that people on the internet say seriously, but I feel obligated to point out:
internet connectivity is pretty much completely orthogonal to what happened.
CrowdStrike content updates are the kind of thing that, in a perfect world,
you would promptly make available in your offline environment. In practice, an
internal CrowdStrike update mirror would probably lag days, weeks, months, or
years behind, because that's what usually ends up happening in "hard" offline
environments, but that's a case of two wrongs making a right.</p>
<p>Which they do, more often than you would think, in the world of information
technology.</p>
<p>Don't worry, I'll be back next time with something more carefully written and
less relevant to the world we live in. I just got in a mood, you know? I just
spent like half the day copying Docker images into an offline environment and
then fixing them all. I have to find something to occupy the time while a
certain endpoint security agent pegs the CPU and makes every "docker save" take
ten minutes.</p>

<p dir="auto">Design a unlimited number of business or information cards about yourself, share a link or QR code to them, print it out, and save other people's cards to your virtual wallet for later. Once you've created a card you can get analytics data on how your cards are getting visited, you can edit your cards as things change, and you can keep cards private so only people with a link to your card can see it.</p>
