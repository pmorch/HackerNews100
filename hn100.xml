Just look at </span><em>Flow</em><span>, the Oscar winner that has no words but captivates anyway. It stays tense, and puts across character, without a line of dialogue.</span></p><p><span>That’s hard to do in a movie. It might be harder in a series: the projects are more broken up, more chaotic and usually faster. Lots of animated shows use talk-y scripts to get through — because it works. Even a classic like </span><em>The Powerpuff Girls</em><span> relies on its snappy, funny writing.</span></p><p><span>Genndy Tartakovsky was central to that show — just after </span><em>Dexter’s Lab</em><span>, his hit from the mid-1990s. </span><em>Dexter</em><span> involved plenty of writing, too. And Tartakovsky was getting sick of it.</span></p><p><span>“After doing</span><em> Dexter</em><span> and </span><em>Powerpuff</em><span>, I was burnt out on dialogue,” he once said.

See episode eight, which finds Jack battling a copy of himself — made from his own anger. Lingering shots of trees on fire, gorgeously painted, punctuate the fight.</span></p><p>Toward the end, Jack realizes that his emotions are out of control. We cut to a burning tree again, and the camera moves in closer, up to the bark. Then the flames stop, and the tree dissolves, and a calm waterfall appears. After almost a minute and 20 seconds of no talking (and no characters on screen), we snap to Jack’s face. Yet a story’s been told.</p><p><span>This stuff asked a lot of the kids in Cartoon Network’s audience. Tartakovsky was defiant about it. “I’ve always felt that kids are a lot smarter than we’ve given them credit for, but we’ve never given them a chance to figure things out as they’re watching television,” he said in one interview. Elsewhere: “as long as I can make films, I’ll always treat kids as adults and at the same intelligence level as I am.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-3-158580375" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p><span>The network execs gave him that freedom. Mike Lazzo greenlit the show’s loose, bare pitch over dinner. Linda Simensky explained, “Genndy had done such a good job up until that point — if there was anyone we could trust, it was Genndy.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-4-158580375" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span></p><p>In fact, she said, “[W]e were really just excited about the fact that it was so different and so unusual.”</p><p><span>Tartakovsky’s team put together a test for </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span> (</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0g8zOF7RCQ" rel="">watch</a><span>), animated by the outsource crew in Korea. The higher-ups didn’t </span><em>request</em><span> a test, but Tartakovsky wanted proof. “[I]t came back. And it </span><em>worked</em><span>,” he remembered. Two minutes of wordless action and atmosphere held up. Something similar happened with episode one:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>… luckily for us, the overseas </em><span>[team]</span><em> did an amazing job, and the first episode came back, and I remember being like, “Wow. There’s something here.” ... And the first episode was so silent, too, ‘cause we had that whole flashback sequence ... Mike Lazzo and Linda Simensky ... </em><span>[go in to watch it]</span><em>, and then you’re sitting in this little editing office … and it’s complete silence. ... I’m looking at them, and they don’t have any expression on their faces. And I go, “Wow.” Then I start sweating.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>He figured the show was dead — but the execs were fascinated. “Speechless” was the word Lazzo used.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-5-158580375" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> This huge, costly experiment in visual storytelling went ahead.</span></p><p><span>Tartakovsky credits a lot of </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span>’s success to art director Scott Wills. “It really came together when [he] came aboard. ‘Cause when Scott started to paint, all of a sudden, we had lighting, we had mood and atmosphere,” he said in the 2000s.</span></p><p><span>These things were critical for the show. Again: images couldn’t carry without depth and richness. Tartakovsky was looking at live-action movies from the ‘60s and ‘70s — </span><em>Doctor Zhivago</em><span>, </span><em>Lawrence of Arabia</em><span>, Kurosawa films.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-6-158580375" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span> Another main influence was Hayao Miyazaki’s work. As Tartakovsky said, films like these:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>… really made the background a character. ... It all kind of came down to filmmaking with me. Because usually we are drawing these backgrounds and they’ll just get a pan and then we’ll just go to the next sequence. I wanted to do, maybe, a minute or two sequence of just establishing the environment. You really get to feel where Jack is … It’s like watching </em><span>Lawrence of Arabia</span><em>, you really </em><span>feel</span><em> that desert. And it’s a really cool feeling and so I thought, “Ah, how much cooler would you feel if you’re looking at these great drawings with this really unique color and a great mood?”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>He wanted to treat background paintings like classic movies treat landscapes — which wasn’t </span><em>done</em><span> on American television. But </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span> did it. And Wills’ painting techniques (which we covered </span><a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/i/162725246/painting-the-samurai-jack-way" rel="">in a recent issue</a><span>) made it possible.</span></p><p>The style was unique. Wills took from mid-century cartoons — the abstract geometry and color — and blended them with other things. He wanted to “combine everything that’s good about realistic painting and feature [animation] painting, and everything that’s good about [UPA-type] stylization,” he said. The idea was to “have cinematic lighting, with mood and depth, but at the same time have it feel stylized.”</p><p><span>For the backgrounds to remain engaging across the series, freshness mattered: there were frequent new locations and surprising color choices. “We’d have … a rule: no green grass, no blue sky,” Tartakovsky recalled.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-7-158580375" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3807719,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://animationobsessive.substack.com/i/158580375?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Stills from </span><em>Samurai Jack</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>And all of this stuff had to be handled delicately, for technical reasons. </p><p><em>Samurai Jack</em><span> doesn’t use black outlines for its characters.

So, if ... </em><span>[a]</span><em> portion of the sky, or whatever, ...</em><span> [ends up]</span><em> flesh-toned, the sequence comes back and then Jack’s nose disappears against the sky because they’re the same color.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In this project, I started to reverse engineer payment card
        terminals because they seemed to be an interesting target for security
        research, given the high stakes involved. Although I initially didn’t
        knew much about this industry, I did expect a ton of security features
        and a very security-hardened device. And to some degree, this was also
        correct.</p>
        <h2>First Look</h2>
        <p>The model I went with is a Worldline Yomani XR terminal. Although it
        seems to be discontinued at the time of writing, this is the model that
        is <i>everywhere</i> in Switzerland. From big grocery chains to the
        small repair shop on the corner, everyone has one or a whole fleet of
        this exact terminal.</p>
        <p>After booting it up and aimlessly clicking through the UI, I did a
        quick port scan, but couldn’t find anything interesting. So naturally,
        I started to take it apart.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>
            <a href="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_pcb.jpg"><img src="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_pcb.jpg" width="100%" alt="Picture of the main PCB of the Yomani XR terminal with annotation of different board components."></a>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>The housing and the PCBs appear to be well-made. The design consists
        of multiple PCBs: a small connector board for the outward-facing
        connectors, the main board, and a vertical board the card slot sits on.
        The main SoC seems to be a custom ASIC, a dual-core Arm processor
        code-named “Samoa II” in the firmware, but I am jumping ahead.
        According to Worldline documentation, this seems to indeed be a custom
        ASIC, rather than just a rebranded off-the-shelf chip. Next to it,
        there is a small external flash and RAM.</p>
        <h2>Tamper Protections</h2>
        <p>During disassembly, I kept looking for a tamper switch that would
        detect when the device’s housing was opened, like I had seen previously
        on laptops and other devices. However, I couldn’t find such a switch.
        Rather, they use the board-to-board interconnects as a way of detecting
        when the device is opened. Because they use relatively
        pressure-sensitive Zebra strips between the boards, they have to be
        tightly screwed together. Even unscrewing some of the screws is enough
        to break contact and trigger a tamper event. Of course, the tamper
        detection must also work when the power is disconnected, so that’s the
        purpose of the coin cell battery.</p>
        <p>But this is not all in terms of tamper resistance: The “vulnerable”
        PCBs are covered by zick-zack traces that act as a tamper detection
        mechanism. Accidentally breaking a single copper trace during a
        physical penetration attempt (hole drill etc.) is enough to trigger the
        tamper detection.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>The card slot itself is contained in an additional, internal
        housing. Wrapped around this housing, there is a flex PCB acting as
        tamper protection.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>
            <a href="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_mesh.jpg"><img src="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_mesh.jpg" width="100%" alt="Inner plastic housing is wrapped in a flex PCB with zick zack traces, acting as a temper detection mechanism."></a>

          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>After putting the device back together, it was clear that my
        intrusion had not gone undetected. Sure enough, the device would now
        only show a big red screen screaming “TAMPER DETECTED”. In this mode,
        the device seems to be fully unresponsive to any kind of external
        input. So, game over?</p>

          </figure>
        </div>
        <h2>Chip-Off Firmware Extraction</h2>
        <p>Since any “runtime” exploration seems to be futile now, I wanted to
        take a look a the firmware. For this, I desoldered the on-board flash
        chip, soldered some wires to it in “dead bug” style and proceeded to
        dump the contents.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>
            <a href="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_chipoff.jpg"><img src="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_chipoff.jpg" width="100%" alt="Flash chip in BGA housing mounted upside-down on a perfboard. Thin copper wires are connected from the chip’s contacts to a flash reader."></a>
            <figcaption>
              BGA flash chip of the card terminal desoldered and connected to a
              flash reader.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>To my surprise, the contents seemed to be entirely unencrypted!
        However, the contents seemed to have a strange ECC layout. Instead of
        following the flash chip’s inherent page layout and putting the ECC
        data in the interleaved spare areas, it appeared as if the some ECC
        data was present in the page and some clear text was in the spare
        areas. With the help of some friends, I figured out the layout: instead
        of using the standard 2048 byte payload + 64 byte ECC/spare layout, it
        uses 3x 694 byte chunks of data each followed by 10 ECC bytes. The ECC
        bytes do not appear to be all used. Instead, the last 16 bytes of the
        spare area seem to act as metadata for the YAFFS2 file system. Now
        normally, there are less ECC bytes per page and therefore the usable
        metadata area for the filesystem is larger than 16 bytes. For this
        reason, the YAFFS2 filesystem had to be patched to work with smaller
        metadata structures.</p>
        <p>I implemented a compatible filesystem reader and with it, I could
        successfully dump the filesystem contents!</p>
        
        <p>Now it was clear that this device runs Linux. I found a standard
        Linux filesystem with a lot of interesting files to browse through. The
        system runs a 3.6 kernel, built with Buildroot 2010.02 (!) in February
        of 2023. The system seems to use a custom bootloader, “Booter v1.7”.
        Although I don’t know how recent the firware version was that I ended
        up dumping, it must have been released after February 2023. So finding
        such an ancient kernel is rather concerning. Userspace-wise, the system
        uses classy init scripts, busybox, and uClibc (final release was 13
        years ago). libcrypt has version 0.9.26, ouch.</p>
        <h2>Finding a Root Shell on Accident</h2>
        <p>Having seen the firmware gave me some new confidence that there
        might be more stuff to find. So I reattached the flash chip using
        wires, ignoring everything I know about signal integrity. To my
        surprise the device booted up again (showing the tamper message).</p>
        <div>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>My next goal was it to find the serial console of the Linux system.
        Surely, it must have one for debugging. By looking at a boot log, I
        might get some more valuable information. So, equipped with a logic
        analyzer, I started poking.</p>

        </div>
        <p>I didn’t take long until I found some activity on one pad of the
        unpopulated debug connector. Bingo!</p>

samoa login: 
</pre>
        <p>It even shows a login prompt, neat! So this is definitely the Linux
        boot log. Many embedded Linux systems will have such a more or less
        exposed serial console, but most of the time the login is disabled
        altogether or a random, hard-to-crack password is either hard-coded or
        generated at boot. Not expecting much, just out of curiosity, I entered
        “root” as the login, and...</p>
        <pre>samoa login: root
~ #
</pre>
        <p>Wait, what!? That’s it? I’m in?</p>
        <p>Well, yes. That was the boring story of how I got the root shell. It
        is just there, exposed. No sophisticated exploit chain, no brute-force
        password cracking required. Additionally, everything seems to still
        work although the device still shows the tamper message.</p>
        <p>Now you may say: well okay, that’s not ideal, but in order to get
        access to the exposed root shell, you need to open up the device, which
        triggers the tamper protection and effectively renders the device
        useless. But in fact, the <b>serial port is accessible from the
        outside!</b>. Without opening up the device and triggering the tamper
        protection, the debug connector can be accessed through a little hatch
        on the back of the device. All an attacker needs is just 30 seconds
        alone with the device to attach to the serial port, log in, deploy
        malware, and leave. This sounds really bad.</p>

          <p>Actually, no. Hear me out: During my analysis of this device, it
          became clear that the Linux system is not the whole story. For
          example, there seems to be no graphics driver for the display and the
          only framebuffer device does not seem to do anything. Instead, only
          text strings seem to be passed to a binary
          (<code>display_tool</code>), that issues some inter-processor
          messages. The same goes for the key pad or the card reader itself. I
          could not find any evidence that these peripherals could be accessed
          directly from Linux.</p>
          <p>Instead, there is an entirely separate processor, refered to as
          <code>mp1</code>, that seems to handle all the “secure” stuff, like
          handling the card, getting the pin and showing information on the
          screen. The “insecure” Linux, running on the second processor,
          <code>mp2</code>, only handles the networking, the updating, and the
          business logic.</p>
          <p>The Linux core seems to always boot, regardless of the tamper
          state. From there, the secure core is booted. For this, Linux
          apparently loads a secure bootloader (named <code>loadercode</code>)
          into memory. This loadercode checks whether the tamper protections
          have been triggered and based on the result, either show the red
          screen or continue to boot the actual “secure” image
          (<code>mp1.img</code>, in the Linux filesystem). This secure image
          seems to be properly encrypted and signed by two entities.</p>

                My current understanding of the Yomani boot process featuring
                the Samoa II ASIC. The first core (insecure, application)
                always boots Linux, which in turn loads a secure bootloader and
                the secure image on the second core. The loadercode is what
                displays the tamper messages on screen. The secure image, that
                handles the card, display, and key pad, is properly encrypted
                and signed.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>While concerning, the exposed root shell does not seem to be as
          big of a risk as initially feared.
			While still being a huge unnecessary attack surface, and a massive oversight from the engineers in my opinion,
			I could not find any evidence that sensitive data, such as card details, could become compromised this way.
			Also, I could not definitively proof which firmware versions were vulnerable. During my research, I also encountered devices that
			had a disabled root login. My guess is that somehow this debug feature accidentally made it into production firmware at some point.
			Chances are that this was discovered and fixed internally before I reported it to the manufacturer (as I had no way of updating the firmware,
			or verifying that I was running the latest firmware).</p>
			<p>
			This project was a lot of fun and I wish I had some more time to dig deeper into the firmware and explore more possibilities.
			If you want to take on this challenge, feel free to reach out to me.
			I’d like to thank anyone involved in this project for their valuable input.

   <p>KYIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian drone attack has destroyed more than 40 Russian planes deep in Russia's territory, a Ukrainian security official told The Associated Press on Sunday, while Russia pounded Ukraine with missiles and drones a day before the two sides meet for a new round of direct talks in Istanbul.</p>   <p>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose operational details, said the attack took over 1 1/2-year to execute and was personally supervised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>   <p>The operation saw drones transported in containers carried by trucks deep into Russian territory, he said. The drones hit airfields including the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk region, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) from Ukraine. It is the first time that a Ukrainian drone has been seen in the region, local Gov. Igor Kobzeva said, stressing that it did not present a threat to civilians.</p>   
   <p>The attack was disclosed on the same day as Zelenskyy said Ukraine will send a delegation to Istanbul for a new round of direct peace talks with Russia on Monday.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5419509-100" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>In a statement on Telegram, Zelenskyy said that Defense Minister Rustem Umerov will lead the Ukrainian delegation. "We are doing everything to protect our independence, our state and our people," Zelenskyy said.</p>   <p>Ukrainian officials had previously called on the Kremlin to provide a promised memorandum setting out its position on ending the war before the meeting takes place. Moscow had said it would share its memorandum during the talks.</p>   <h2>Russian strike hits an army unit</h2>   <p>Russia on Sunday launched the biggest number of drones — 472 — on Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine's air force said.</p>   <p>Russian forces also launched seven missiles alongside the barrage of drones, said Yuriy Ignat, head of communications for the air force. Earlier Sunday, Ukraine's army said at least 12 Ukrainian service members were killed and more than 60 were injured in a Russian missile strike on an army training unit.</p>   <p>The strike occurred at 12:50 p.m., the statement said, emphasizing that no formations or mass gatherings of personnel were being held at the time. An investigative commission was created to uncover the circumstances around the attack that led to such a loss in personnel, the statement said.</p>   
   <p>The training unit is located to the rear of the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) active front line, where Russian reconnaissance and strike drones are able to strike.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5419509-101" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Ukraine's forces suffer from manpower shortages and take extra precautions to avoid mass gatherings as the skies across the front line are saturated with Russian drones looking for targets.</p>   <p>"If it is established that the actions or inaction of officials led to the death or injury of servicemen, those responsible will be held strictly accountable," the Ukrainian Ground Forces' statement said.</p>   <h2>Northern pressure</h2>   <p>Russia's Ministry of Defense said Sunday that it had taken control of the village of Oleksiivka in Ukraine's northern Sumy region. Ukrainian authorities in Sumy ordered mandatory evacuations in 11 more settlements Saturday as Russian forces make steady gains in the area.</p>   <p>Speaking Saturday, Ukraine's top army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said that Russian forces were focusing their main offensive efforts on Pokrovsk, Toretsk and Lyman in the Donetsk region, as well as the Sumy border area.</p>

Sadly it retained the rather large key sizes of the earlier ST models, making typos too easy. It also had the connection for the mouse and joystick under the keyboard, which kept things neat and tidy but was a major pain to connect in the first place. The low profile of the case also meant that the disk drive slot would bump into the keyboard if the two were close together.</p><p><span>Overall, I’d say the keyboard is a solid B+ and it is a sought-after keyboard today for its reliability. This keyboard also </span><a href="https://www.goto10retro.com/p/10-secrets-of-the-atari-mega-ste" rel="">works great with the Mega STE</a><span> and I’d love to get my hands on one.</span></p><p>Other case differences include a built-in fan and a built-in battery-backed clock that ran on simple AA batteries. The fan was probably not really needed, but it likely improved reliability.</p><p>As far as technical specifications, the Mega ST did not have many advantages over a standard 1040ST. Its main improvement was that it had a blitter chip that could move data in memory around fast, which was great for graphics processing.  The Mega ST was the first to include TOS 1.02, which was the first update to TOS in ROM and included several bug fixes.</p><p><span>Perhaps the biggest “innovation” was the RAM. The Mega ST was available with 2MB or 4MB of RAM</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-159691277" href="https://www.goto10retro.com/p/atari-means-business-with-the-mega#footnote-1-159691277" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>, an enormous amount in 1987. This much RAM was a game-changer for developers and desktop publishing.</span></p><p>Lastly there was an internal bus connector slot, which ended up not really being all that important. The only thing I know that used it were some hard drive kits that would provide a way to squeeze the hard drive inside the Mega ST case. This points out a problem in the case design: it was just too short and didn’t have much room for anything else to be in there.</p><p>It would have made sense for Atari to sell an internal hard drive upgrade for the Mega ST, but instead they sold a separate external hard drive, the MegaFile, that you could place under the Mega ST. Modular perhaps, but more expensive and messier than an internal solution that would also not have external cables or a power supply.</p><p>By far the biggest technical limitation was that the Mega ST ran at the same speed at the 520ST and 1040ST: 8Mhz. The blitter certainly could speed up the display operations of some apps, but the Mega ST basically ran everything at the same speed as the older and much cheaper STs.</p><p>The Mega ST was often promoted in combination with the SLM804 Laser Printer as a complete desktop publishing solution for just $3000 to $4000. At the time this was touted as a full system at the same price as just the laser printer for a Macintosh.</p><p>I don’t recall seeing Atari specifically market the Mega ST to developers, but I suspect a lot of developers found the better keyboard and extra RAM to be worth the upgrade.</p><p><span>In general, I think Atari had a tough time selling such an expensive product</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-159691277" href="https://www.goto10retro.com/p/atari-means-business-with-the-mega#footnote-2-159691277" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>. Even in 1987, the Atari brand was closely associated with video games and inexpensive computers. Trying to use the Atari brand for more expensive computers aimed at businesses was always going to be difficult. After all, many business would definitely balk at having the Atari label on their desks.</span></p><p>Although I never owned a Mega ST, my Dad did have a Mega ST 2. Since he also had the SC1224 color monitor, I would sometimes use it to play games. I remember hogging his Mega ST to play Dungeon Master quite often. I also remember that the keyboard was really nice and miles better than the one on my 1040ST. He also had an external hard drive, which he was able to place under the Mega ST.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg" width="1042" height="754" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/af783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:754,&quot;width&quot;:1042,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:221734,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.goto10retro.com/i/159691277?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>My Dad’s Mega ST2 setup from the early 90s</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Mega ST was not a huge success for Atari. Although it was announced in early 1987, systems did not start shipping until late 1987 with most not shipping until 1988. The problem was the extra RAM. The Mega ST used 1Mbit DRAM, which actually had a significant price increase and shortage due to tariffs on overseas DRAM.

In this interview, he talks about the transition of this creative field from film to digital, bridging the gap between feature films and episodic productions, learning from different cultures, and what advice he’d give to his younger self. Between all these and more, Christophe dives deep into his work on the second season of “Andor”.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Please tell us about yourself and the path that took you to where you are today.</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: I finished a trade school as a general electrician, but I wanted to do something more, and I went to film school. During your first year you can choose between editing, sound and image – which is light and camera. So we had our first workshop, and I had the camera in my hands, and I knew this was it. I really loved the mix of technical and creative.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Do you feel that you can teach the technical part, but the artistic part comes from within a person, and if one doesn’t have it, it can’t be learned?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: No, I think you can teach both. When I was growing up, I didn’t have a lot of cultural influences in my life, at home or at school. It is something that I grew over the years. When I started at the film school, I noticed that I needed to catch up on it. I spent a lot of evenings around that time watching movies with my friends, and it grew on me.</p>
<p>You can cultivate it the same way you cultivate the technical skills. There are also people who are more artistic than technical. Maybe I am more naturally inclined to be better at the technical side, but I grew and worked on my creative side over the years. I really believe you can grow the creative part of your brain.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Is there such a thing as universally good art vs universally bad art, or is it all subjective?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: It’s subjective. There’s so many forms and styles of art. And that is good, because there’s something for everybody. Everything can be art, and people with different taste can find things that they appreciate.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Was film still a thing when you were in film school?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: We did most of our projects on 16mm, either Bolex or Arriflex SR2. We did a few things on video, but it was really basic at the time. I remember those assignments to film something and edit it ourselves, and it was a nightmare. The computers were slow, the Video cards didn’t work, the software was basic. It’s incredible to see how all of that progressed since then. These days I teach at that same school, and the difference is night and day. They can edit it in DaVinci, they can grade it, and it’s so accessible. Sometimes I’m a bit jealous to see that [laughs].</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How was the transition from film to digital for you after you finished the film school?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: When I graduated, most of the productions were still on film. I was exposed to both mediums, and I’m happy about it. I know how to light for film. I still have an analog still camera, and I use it a lot.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I’m so happy that the digital revolution happened. It’s a bigger toolbox for your creativity, especially for night scenes. It’s much easier to light something natural, and to do something with less. I started my career in Belgium, and it’s a smaller market with smaller budgets for TV shows and films – but you still want to make good things. I did a TV show called “Cordon” about 10 years ago. It was an ambitious project for its small budget, and that project started my international career. I don’t think it would have been possible to make that project on film. We had a lot of night scenes on it, and it’s so much different to light a night scene on a digital camera.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: There’s a lot of ongoing technological advances in the field, from lights to lenses to sensors. Is it hard to stay up to date on all the latest developments?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: Not for me, because that’s my technical side that I’m interested in. I follow everything, and if there’s something new, I want to test it. But at the same time, I’m a fan of old glass. I like to dig into old equipment and to test new equipment.</p>
<p>Right now there’s a lot of interesting things happening with lights. Camera sensors are getting bigger and we’re getting more pixels, but I don’t think it matters that much. And the camera sensibility has been at a good level for a while now. The latest breakthroughs are all in the LED light space. I used a lot of LED lights on “Andor”. All the lights are RGBW (red, green, blue, white), and you can choose any color you want. There’s someone next to you controlling those lights on their iPad, and you’re almost painting the scene with these controllable lights. You can control the color of each one, you can control the intensity of each one, and you can do it all in real time.</p>
<p>When I graduated, it was all with gel filters, tungsten lights and HMIs. Those lights were shifting their color as they aged, and it was a more time consuming process to tweak the colors. Now you have such fine grained control over LEDs, and it’s the biggest positive change for me in the last few years. Sometimes I still use tungsten lights, but my first preference is LED.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Is there anything today that is a big gap on the technology side?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: Right now everything is going wireless. Video is wireless. Lights are wireless. Sound is wireless. It’s all good, but there’s a lot of congestion on sets with all those things combined. Sometimes those nice tools don’t work because there’s too much technology on set [laughs]. That’s my only complaint.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Getting closer to “Andor”, you’ve spent around 15 years now working on various episodic productions. How do you see audience expectations and production ambitions evolving over that period of time? I look back at how it was in the ’90s, where we had the feature world and the TV world, and there was an almost unbridgeable gap between the two. And now in 2025 that gap is pretty much gone.</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: It’s nice that you say that, because it’s something I fought against for years. Up until about 5 years ago people would say that if you do TV shows, you can’t do feature film work. If you wanted to do something creative on a show, with lights or with a camera, they would push back on it. They would say that it’s a TV show and that it doesn’t need that.</p>
<p>Right now, the audiences watching episodic shows accept and expect a higher level of quality. It’s such a good transition. There are TV shows that look better than films. I worked on some French TV shows where they gave us a lot of freedom even as the budget was not that big, and I’m so happy with what we were able to do there. I’ve been fighting against it for a long time in discussions with agents. They used to push me to go into the feature film world, and I’m happy with where these episodic productions are these days.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Getting to “Andor”, what brought you to it?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: Thanks to David Meanti who is a producer on “Andor”. I knew him from the show “Riviera” that we did a few years ago in the south of France. He was an assistant director on that show, and we had a great working relationship. We kept in touch after that show, as he moved to the UK and started working as a producer. He tried to introduce me to the producers on the first season of “Andor”, but it didn’t work back then. But he kept on trying for the second season, and I’m grateful to David for that. At first I was offered the first 3 episodes, and after that it was extended to the next 3 episodes.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How did you approach bridging this arc between Season 1 and “Rogue One”?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: “Rogue One” is one of the best Star Wars films, and because of that I was so happy when they called me to work on “Andor”. “Rogue One” has a great story and great visuals.</p>
<p>I wanted to elevate “Andor”. The first season was shot on Panavision C lenses on VENICE camera with a cropped sensor. I wanted to use a full frame sensor with a full frame anamorphic lens to get a bit closer to “Rogue One” which was shot on Alexa 65 with anamorphic lenses. A bigger sensor gives you a different feeling, and you see it when you watch a movie in IMAX. With lighting, I wanted to have a natural approach to it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.pushing-pixels.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/andor-still08.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="1592"><br>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How much time did you have in pre-production to talk about ideas, visuals and inspirations?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: We had a lot of time, and it’s a rare thing. The director Ariel Kleiman and I went through the same process for each episode. We were reading the scripts together, and throwing ideas and brainstorming. We did that twice for each episode, and then we started making moodboards. After that we did another read through, and then we started blocking the scenes. We had a lot of 3D pre-viz with ILM, with our camera and lenses in those virtual sets. That allowed us to start looking for shots and to refine everything.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How difficult is it to stay practical, to capture as much as you can in camera on sets that are literally out of this world?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: On some sets it was more difficult, especially the ones with a lot of green screens. You have to imagine what’s behind as you’re lighting it and trying to see through it. There are limitations when working with green screens. You can’t use too much smoke or haze. You can’t use flares. It becomes less natural for me.</p>
<p>This is why for some sets we used either LED walls or painted backdrops. The wedding scene in episode 3 was time-lapsed. Every time we come back to the wedding, the light was slightly different as the Sun was getting lower and we were getting atmospheric effects. We wanted to create a feeling of an estate with the views on the mountains. Eventually we decided to not use green screens. They painted a nice backdrop of the mountains we used in Barcelona, and that was great. You see the final result in camera, and you can light it more naturally. Another set where we used painted backdrops was when Krennic gives his speech to take control of Ghorman. We had a painted backdrop of snowy mountains, and it worked well.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How was your collaboration with VFX? Was it mainly in post-production, or an ongoing process?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: It was ongoing. We were all in one office, including the art department and VFX. We had a lot of meetings to discuss how this planet should look, what we can do in pre-viz, etc. We had full VFX shots of the TIE fighter flying integrated into the larger sequences. Mohen Leo was the VFX supervisor, and he wanted every VFX shot to be physically grounded. You see that in every VFX shot, including the lighting. Some shots started full VFX and then became sets. Luke Hull, our production designer, was always in those meetings. It was a close collaboration between Ariel the director, myself, the art department and the VFX crew from ILM.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: In terms of sets, how much was built on stage and how much was built on location?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: There was a lot built on the stage and back lots at Pinewood and Longcross. Yavin, for example, was all at Longcross. It’s an old military test track, with some buildings and a lot of forest. We used that forest to build Yavin’s landing areas for the fighters. The Ghorman city and plaza were built on a back lot at Pinewood, including most of the interiors.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How much time did you spend shooting the wedding ceremony?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: It was about a week and a half, but we also had a set strike as we were getting close to the finish line. The last bit when they all start dancing like crazy was filmed six months later.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How many countries did this show take you to?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: We were in Barcelona where we shot the Coruscant Senate, and in London where we shot at Barbican and Lloyd’s building.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.pushing-pixels.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/andor-still02.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="1610"><br>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: For some of the bigger sets, is it a combination of a physical build and then digital extensions?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: Some of them were fully physical, and some were extended. The Plaza at Ghorman was built physically as one story, and everything above that is a digital extension. I remember how astonished I was the first time I arrived on that set. It was so big. Another example of combining the two was the Ghorman heist sequence. They built quite a bit of those streets, and then above it we had green screens for extensions. The VFX crew was so good at making extensions look so natural.</p>
<p>We had a great collaboration on this show. We knew how we wanted these places to look before we started shooting. I could plan my lighting ahead of time, including the VFX pieces.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: The show spends a lot of time at the apartment with Bix. How big was it?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: The nice thing about that set is that everything you see is captured in camera, including the view outside which was an LED wall. That wall allowed us to be more creative and find some extra shots. You have shots from the outside where you see the city below in reflection with raindrops on the window. You see cars passing and light coming in.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Did you want to use different colors for different planets or different sets?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: We wanted every arc of three episodes to feel like its own movie. Our first block was episodes 4 through 6, and we wanted that block to feel cold. Our visual reference for it was the city of Turin in Italy, which is a mountain city. We wanted the feeling of that winter light when the Sun is already behind the mountains, but there’s still light, and it’s all blue. And if the Sun is out, it should be low, with a warm magenta feel to it. We have a lot of rain in these three episodes as well. And then when we shot the next block of the first three episodes, we wanted it to be sunny. It all has a summer feel, with lots of sunlight, including Dedra’s apartment.</p>
<p>Then, within each block you have different planets. Some places are more cold with not a lot of colors. The wedding had a more classical look, and I used tungsten lights there to create that look. Yavin feels like an old Star Wars movie. It was such a nice exercise to play with different looks and moods. It’s a gift to be able to do that.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: Was there any color you wanted to stay away from?</em></p>
<p><span>Christope</span>: Yes for certain sets, but not for the whole show. We used a mix of cold moonlight and warm sources on Yavin for consistency, for example.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: What was your most memorable moment, and what was your most challenging moment on this show?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: The most challenging was Mina-Rau and its grain fields. They planted the grain fields, and we had a window of 3-4 weeks to shoot it. And then, just before we started shooting, we had a set strike and we lost half of our actors. We decided to keep on shooting with non-SAG actors, but pretty much every scene was a mix of SAG and non-SAG. So we started shooting bits and pieces of the scenes, also fighting with the elements [laughs], and then we completed the reverse shots six months later, on a stage during winter time.</p>
<p>Our greens department was cutting all those grain stalks to put on stage, but my main challenge was to keep the lighting consistent and natural. Back when we were shooting in the field, I was already thinking about what would happen later on. I was really meticulous, measuring the light of the field, the light of the Sun, the light of the clouds, and noting all the color temperatures. Then when we came to that stage, we had lots of LED fixtures on the ceiling, and we were able to match those color temperatures everywhere. Another interesting challenge was to recreate the feeling of the air with all of the field particles.</p>
<p>It’s easy when you have one scene outside and then another on the stage, but here we were matching shots within the same scenes. I like those kinds of challenges.</p>
<p>As for the most memorable scene, I loved shooting Yavin. I like being outside, and it also reminded me of the old Star Wars movies. Another one was the heist on the streets of Ghorman. We spent about four weeks, mostly during the night, in the UK winter. It was freezing. We had rain machines. It was hard, but it paid off in the end. It was also my first big set to light. It was a big challenge, and I was so happy with the end result.</p>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How does it feel to see these weeks and months of work compressed into a few hours on the screen?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: Before the episode is shown to the public, I see multiple cuts of it. That’s when I see all the faults. That’s when I think of all the things that I could have done better. And then some months later it hits the streaming network, and now I can see it from a distance – and it’s really nice to see it in its final form.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: How was Covid for you and how is it today?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: I’m so happy that it’s all behind me. We still had Covid restrictions when we started working on this season. It was a lot of testing, and it was cumbersome for the entire production. Also, when you work in a mask, it takes away a big part of the human interaction on set. I want to see people that I work with. When you talk with someone and you have a mask on, you lose half of the conversation. From the moment we could work without a mask, it really opened up. Everything became more relaxed. Communication became easier and warmer. It was hard for me to not have the same human interaction with the restrictions in place.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: What are your top three favorite movies of all time?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: One of my favorites is “Apocalypse Now”. It’s incredible, and it’s also maybe another reason why I loved shooting Yavin – it’s the same atmosphere. I love “No Country for Old Men” and “Children of Men” with its incredible camera work.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.pushing-pixels.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/andor-still13.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="1594"><br>

<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: If you had a time machine, and you could go back in time to give your younger self a piece of advice, what would it be?</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: Be patient. I was really impatient with everything, as it was so difficult to get into doing fiction. Everything else comes along. I don’t regret any twists and turns of the path that I took.</p>
<p><em><span>Kirill</span>: What keeps you going? You get to travel the world and work on these great productions, but it also involves long hours and sleepless nights, and being away from your family and friends for long periods of time.</em></p>
<p><span>Christophe</span>: It’s really hard for the family, and it’s a demanding job. As long as I feel that I keep on learning, that I keep on evolving, that I keep on meeting really nice people I work with, I’m happy. When it starts to feel that it’s becoming a routine and that I’m doing the same things all over again, then I’ll stop and see what’s next. There are several other things I would love to do in my life outside of movies, but for now I still love it.</p>
<p>I’m getting to know new people. I’m learning a lot, be it on a bigger project like “Andor” or on smaller ones. When you travel, you get exposed to other cultures. I was on a production that took us to Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and the locals have a different way of working. I worked a lot in the UK, and their way is different from how they do it in France. I’m about to do two French movies, and I’m looking forward to that. The French way is the artists’ way. They spend the whole day talking about it. In the UK it’s a bit more efficient, maybe [laughs].</p>
<p>As long as I have this feeling, it’s good for me. But if I feel that I’m doing the same thing over and over again, I’d want to stop.</p>
<p><em>Kirill: From all the places you’ve traveled to so far, what’s your favorite cuisine?</em></p>
<p>Christophe: French. When I work in France, I gain 5 kilos every time. The food is so good, and they take a full hour to eat. If you don’t take an hour to eat and production decides to do continuous days, they will strike. It’s too much [laughs]. The UK crews don’t like to stop. They keep on going so they can go home on time to spend at least a bit of time with the family. As far as the food goes, I prefer to work in France.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2>Context</h2>
<p>I <a href="https://dustri.org/b/leaving-google.html">left Google</a> in April 2024, and have thus
been casually looking for a new job during 2024. A good friend of mine is currently working
at <a href="https://canonical.com/">Canonical</a>, and he told me that it's quite a nice
company with a great working environment. Unfortunately,
the internet is full of people who had a poor experience:
<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Canonical-Interview-Questions-E230560.htm">Glassdoor</a>
shows that only 15% had a positive interview experience,
famous internet denizens like <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@sara/112117125241735836">sara</a>
rambled on the topic,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/17mmren/canonical_and_their_disrespectful_interviews/">reddit</a>,
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31426558">hacker</a><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37059857">news</a>,
<a href="https://uk.indeed.com/cmp/Canonical">indeed</a>
and
<a href="https://www.teamblind.com/post/canonical-interview-process-is-such-bogus-ojbjgana">blind</a>
all say it's terrible, … but the idea of being decently paid to do security
work on a popular Linux distribution was really appealing to me.</p>
<h2>First application</h2>
<p>I first applied there in October 2023. Canonical's <a href="https://canonical.com/careers">careers'
website</a> asks a bunch of odd questions like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>How did you perform in mathematics at high school?</li>
<li>How did you perform in your native language at high school?</li>
<li>Please share your rationale or evidence for the high school performance
  selections above. Make reference to provincial, state or nation-wide scoring
  systems, rankings, or recognition awards, or to competitive or selective
  college entrance results such as SAT or ACT scores, JAMB, matriculation
  results, IB results etc. We recognise every system is different but we will
  ask you to justify your selections above.</li>
<li>What was your bachelor's university degree result, or expected result if you
  have not yet graduated? Please include the grading system to help us
  understand your result e.g. ‘85 out of 100’, ‘2:1 (Grading system: first
  class, 2:1, 2:2, third class)’ or ‘GPA score of 3.8/4.0 (predicted)’. We have
  hired outstanding individuals who did not attend or complete university. If
  this describes you, please continue with your application and enter ‘no
  degree’.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As I was applying for a <em>senior position</em>, and because there was no such thing as
ranking in my entire scholarship, I didn't think much about this, and wrote
that I wasn't bad at school, and that there was no ranking. I got instantly
rejected. I asked around, and some Canonical employees reached out to me on
<a href="https://infosec.exchange/@jvoisin">mastodon</a> to tell me that I should lie on
this step of the hiring process, as people who aren't in the top 10% in
high-school are automatically rejected. So I made things up, and didn't get
rejected this time.</p>
<p>I then got an email about the "written interview", asking me to provide my
answers to <a href="https://dustri.org/b/files/canonical_questions.txt">38 questions</a> in a PDF.
It took me a couple of hours to write it down, boiling down to 21 pages of
text. Once sent, I was asked to do <del>modern
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology">phrenology</a></del> "psychometric
assessments" from <a href="https://www.thomas.co/">Thomas</a>. The first one is called the
General Intelligence Assessment, and features with questions like those:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Bob isn't as fast as Carl" → Who is the fastest? Carl or Bob?</li>
<li>"a B f H" vs "k b j z" → how many letters in common? (1)</li>
<li>Given 3 numbers, find the bigger and smaller, which one is the farthest from the middle one?</li>
<li>Given a group of 3 words, which one has nothing to do with the 2 other?</li>
<li>Given a pair of letter "R", with some rotated and some mirrored, how many are
  only rotated?</li>
</ul>
<p>The second one is the Behavioural Assessment, and is based on <a href="https://www.thomas.co/thomas-candidate-test">picking "the
word that corresponds the most to your personality and the one that corresponds
the least"</a> for 30 minutes. Their
"methodology" is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment">DISC
assessment</a> from 1928 which is
completely made-up pseudo-science. Heck, even their <a href="https://www.thomas.co/sites/default/files/thomas-files/2024-01/Science-behind-Thomas-Behaviour-assessment-Jan-2024.pdf">brochure</a>
only has 5 references with none from after 1957, and the 5 mentioned "studies" don't
have sources, data, details, … This made me equally amused and worried.</p>
<p>The technical interviews ("Ubuntu Skills Interview", "Security Skills
Interview", "General Management Skills Interview") felt a bit empty
content-wise, and sounded more like some random conversation with open-source
enthusiast people at a bar. The only technical questions I remember were "What's your
favourite git command" and "Can you tell me about Ubuntu packaging". Keep in
mind that the position I was applying for was "Ubuntu Engineering Manager", so
I was expecting a lot of technical questions. Don't get me wrong, the
conversations were really nice, and I really liked the reflections on
Canonical's positions and philosophy.</p>
<p>In December, I had an HR interview with a "Talent Science Partner", which was a
regular bland
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result">STAR</a>
questionnaire. Here is some feedback from the interviewer: "In the first 5
minutes of the call, I asked them about their biggest achievement at NBS and
they replied "Apparently you haven't read my 20-pages written interview". I
then explained to him that I have to ask the same questions to all candidates
and they offered me a terse answer." What's the point of asking for an
extensive written interview with those very same questions,
only for it to be completely ignored? It felt disrespectful to me.
Also, amusingly "During our interview, they will [sic.] be typing away.", so
candidates aren't expected to take notes. I was simply writing the questions
down, as well as some of my answers, likely the very same thing that the
interviewer was doing.</p>
<p>A couple of hours later, I got a "Follow up - Benefits at Canonical" email,
listing all the benefits, but less than 24h after, I got the <strong>very same</strong>
automated rejection email I got when I first applied in October. I sent an
email to enquire about feedback but never got a reply. During the whole
process, I was not once able to ask questions to a recruiter.</p>
<h2>Second application</h2>
<p>A couple of months later, I decided to reapply, hoping that maybe the previous
rejection was a misunderstanding or whatnot, even though seeing that
Canonical <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/canonical/jobs/">had more than 32 000</a>
job openings <del>smelt like bullshit</del> was worrying.</p>
<p>I applied both for a Manager position and an Individual Contributor one. I got
instantly rejected for the former via an automated email, sent twice; but was
invited to continue the process for the latter, via the "Fast Track - Security."
I learnt that this didn't mean that there would be less interviews or that the
process would somehow be faster, but simply that my resume was interesting
enough to warrant interviewing me before picking a team for me to fit in, a bit
like how Google is hiring.</p>
<p>I re-used the written
interview, as the questions didn't really change. This time, I also had to
spend 2h on <a href="https://devskiller.com/">DevSkiller</a> for a bland-at-best "Python
test." The first part was questions like "Which ones of those words aren't
python logging levels: URGENT, CRITICAL, INFO, FATAL, TRACE, …" or "What does
this small python snippet output" which is a matter to copy/pasting in into a
python interpreter locally. The second part was LeetCode-like exercises, but
since there were no humans involved, odds are that the only piece of
information that can be extracted from the candidate is "can they successfully
paste the question verbatim into a search engine/LLM."</p>
<p>Funnily enough, while I could re-use my "psychometric assessments," I chose to pass
the tests again, so I could compare the results, and of course, they showed some
differences. This was followed by a weird "The security
mission and roles at Canonical" email from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth">Mark
Shuttleworth</a> himself, with a
Message-ID <code>…prod-greenhouse-sidekiq-automation-worker…</code>, meaning it's
another generic automated email, sigh. Then came the interviews. I
systematically asked the following questions in all but the final one:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think about the interview process?<ul>
<li>I often got praise about the written interview part, albeit nobody liked
  the process as a whole. Some high-in-the-chain people told me that they
  didn't really like spending time reviewing CV and interviewing people for
  a couple of hours every week. Heck, some of them that interviewed me
  weren't even going to work with me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you like working at Canonical?<ul>
<li>The answers were a resounding <strong>yes</strong>, which kept me motivated to go through the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How is the upper-management, especially Mr. Shuttleworth, as I'll have an
  interview with him and it feels a bit weird, but also because I've heard
  things™?<ul>
<li>Those who work/worked with him told me (I took notes) that he was
<em>peculiar</em>, <em>involved</em>, <em>intense</em>, <em>special</em>, <em>opinionated</em>, <em>could come
across as rude/harsh/know-it-all</em>, and <em>sometimes difficult to work with</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I politely tried to gather feedback on the interviews, and was either told
  that they couldn't answer this question, or that I shouldn't need to worry as
  "everything looks green on the feedback."</li>
</ul>
<p>Some interviews were pleasantly technical, and I really enjoyed the "Security
Deep Dive" one about confidential computing. The "Hiring Lead Interviews" felt
a bit useless, generic and similar, but provided some welcome colouring to how
it is to work at Canonical. Hilariously, someone from the team I applied for
told me that the role has been empty for more than 18 months, and offered a
polite smile when asked why she thought that was the case.</p>
<p>The final interview was with Mark Shuttleworth. He didn't introduce himself,
which I found a bit odd. His first question was whether I was applying for a
managerial or a senior position, which didn't bode well: he had no idea what
position I was applying for, and thus wouldn't be asking role-related questions,
but likely only "vibe" ones. I got asked questions about high-school: how I
performed there, why did I pick a particular university, … I was so surprised
that I didn't think about asking on the spot how was any of this relevant for a
fucking <em>senior</em> position. I did so afterwards, and was told that one of the sole
common point for all Canonical employees is that they all attended high-school,
so it provides a common base. Moreover, it gives some background, personal
history and shows the motivations and goals of the applicants. I don't know
about you, but when I was in high-school (around 15-20 years ago), my goals and
motivation were really different than my current ones, as they were mainly,
ranked in order of interest and importance: getting laid. </p>
<p>To the question "How was your university?", I answered that it wasn't
prestigious, and pretty small and rural, as we could see cows from the windows.
Shuttleworth immediately interrupted me to say "don't play games, don't try to
muddle your answers. I'm interviewing you for a senior position, I'm asking you
questions, I'm expecting straight answers." I was so flabbergasted that instead
of answering properly ("As I'm interviewing for a senior position, I'm
expecting proper senior position related questions."), I gave a meek "Okay…"
Some parts of the conversation were
equally awkward and filled with an unhealthy amount of salt, especially about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstart_(software)">upstart</a> ("They're a reason
why Chromebooks are using it", the reasons are mostly technical
debt, not technical excellence.), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_(software)">mir</a> ("Wayland has the
same design flaws as Xorg"), … At some point, someone bought him a plate, and
he started to eat, without excusing himself about doing so. I asked him why he
would spend time interviewing prospective employees in non-executive positions,
let alone individual contributors,
as this is likely eating a lot of his time, given that Canonical currently has
around 1200 employees. He told me that he like to know who
is hired, and that this process allows to root out average candidates. After 40
minutes out of a 60 minutes scheduled interview, Shuttleworth said "Ok, nice
talking to you, have a nice day," and abruptly ended the interview. I seriously
thought about withdrawing my application, as I really didn't want to work with
him, but since the position was only senior IC, odds are that I wouldn't have
to, so I didn't retract it.</p>
<p>A couple of days after, I got the now familiar automated rejection email. I
asked the hiring lead for feedback about why the rejection happened, but didn't
get a reply. Not once during all the interviews have I had a conversation about
compensation/salary/benefits/… </p>
<p>So I exercised my 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> rights,
and asked to be communicated everything pertaining to my
interviews. I got a bunch of documents, and the reason I was rejected was
"Culture/behaviour/motivation misalignment." Overall, would-you-hire-wise I got
three "strong yes", eight "yes", and a single "no" from Mark Shuttleworth, with
his feedback as following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This interview did not go well at all; the candidate initially gave
startlingly passive-aggressive responses to questions, in a way that I very
rarely see at this late stage of the process. Their application was a duplicate
with the same email address, and previously they had given a similar impression
in Talent Science. I would like to understand why that duplicate, and outcome,
were not noticed during this selection process.</p>
<p>After some difficult exchanges I focused on the candidate's personal
interests, where they opened up. They are clearly passionate about low-level
technical details, but are only engaged on things that personally interest
them, with little evidence of teamwork or willingness to share load that is
uninteresting to them. They would be a poor fit for a team where balancing work
requires deriving some personal satisfaction from helping colleagues get things
done.</p>
<p>In short, there are character issues here that we cannot address through
coaching and development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, to be fair, everyone who knows me would likely agree that I'm not the most
empathetic person ever, and that communication isn't my strongest point,
despite me investing a lot of care and effort there, as it's an important topic
for me: I'm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome">Asperger</a>,
meaning that a lot of social interactions, especially non-verbal and
implicit ones are often non-trivial for me, and that I tend to be (sometimes
overly) frank; but it's the very first time this came up as an issue, let
alone a prohibitive one, in a professional setting. The two other Hiring Lead
who <em>assessed</em> my "Personality Traits" didn't find anything proscriptive there,
nor in any other categories for that matter. Interestingly, Shuttleworth's
feedback is the only one without any supporting notes nor direct quotes, and
reads more like an opinion piece than a proper artefact-supported assessment
like the rest.</p>
<p>So now I'm really curious about the decision process here, as it seems that every
interviewer's opinion is ignored if Shuttleworth puts some red marks. Would the
outcome have been the same if it were someone else who had put them instead?</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I was really looking forward to work at Canonical, being paid to work on
improving a popular Linux distribution security sounded really cool. I now
see that I should have, for once, listened to the collective hive-mind of the
internet, and not pour so much of my time and energy into this. I'm of course a
bit salty about the process, but not about the outcome, as it felt like I
dodged some kind of massive bullet.</p>
<p>A friend suggested that I add some actionable advice hiring-wise to this
blogpost so that it doesn't read too much like an angry rant about not being
hired, but it felt pretentious to me. Moreover, as it seems that hiring at
Canonical is Shuttleworth's pet project, I don't think my opinion on the
topic will be useful in any way. Heck, I bet all the senior people spending
some of their expensive work time doing interviews are frustrated when
candidates they deem promising are rejected at the very of end on
Shuttleworth's whim; yet as this has apparently been going for a while now,
so I doubt a ranty article on my small corner on the internet would hold any sway.
So if I didn't write this article to complain, nor to make things change, why
bother? I wrote it because I would have loved to have read a post like this 
one while considering applying at Canonical, as it would have saved everyone
involved a tremendous amount of time.</p>
<p>As a side note, it's completely ludicrous that I had to use the GDPR to get
some feedback on what went wrong on a job interview: the hiring lead could
simply have replied to my email with some high-level explanation, which would
have saved them from being GDPR'ed almost 300 pages of unredacted PDF.</p>
<p>This article was apparently posted on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44149549">hacker
news</a>,
the thread has some interesting testimonies as well.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>Why is DeepSeek-V3 supposedly fast and cheap to serve at scale, but too slow and expensive to run locally? Why are some AI models slow to respond but fast once they get going?</p>
<p>AI inference providers often talk about a fundamental tradeoff between <em>throughput</em> and <em>latency</em>: for any given model, you can either serve it at high-throughput high-latency, or low-throughput low-latency. In fact, some models are so naturally GPU-inefficient that in practice they must be served at high-latency to have any workable throughput at all (for instance, DeepSeek-V3).</p>
<p>This tradeoff comes from the <strong>batch size</strong> the inference provider chooses for the model: not batching inference inside an individual request<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, but batching inference across tens or hundreds of concurrent user requests. It’s a peculiar feature of transformer-based LLMs that computing a batch of completions at the same time is almost as fast as computing a single completion. Why is that?</p>
<h3>What is batch inference?</h3>
<p>GPUs are good at doing big matrix multiplications (GEMMs, or “general matrix multiplications”). Say you have a single token that you want to pass through a model (i.e. by multiplying against all its weights - other architecture details aren’t relevant). You express that as a vector that matches the dimension (or hidden size) of the model (i.e. 1 x the width of its big weights matrices) and multiply it through. That’s 1 GEMM. But if you want to pass ten tokens through in a batch, that’s still only one GEMM, because you can stack the tokens into one matrix (10 x the model dimension). That’s a <em>lot</em> faster than doing ten slightly smaller GEMMs. So an inference server implementation might look something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A request comes in with a prompt</li>
<li>That prompt is pre-filled (passed through attention - we’ll see later how that can be batched as well<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>), forming a KV cache and a token-sized matrix (1 x model-size) that will eventually become the predicted token<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li>That token-sized matrix goes into a queue</li>
<li>A GPU server pulls batches (e.g. of 128) off that queue, stacks them up into a 128 x model-size matrix, and multiplies them through the feed-forward model weights</li>
<li>The end result is then split into 128 separate tokens</li>
<li>The one for the original request is streamed back to the user</li>
<li>Assuming that token isn’t an end-of-sequence token, return to step 2 to continue generating the next token in the response</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that <em>the server decides</em> how big a batch size to pull. It’s a tradeoff between throughput and latency. If you do no batching and just process tokens one by one, no user ever waits in a queue (step 3 above), so latency is low (assuming you have enough GPUs). However, if you do a lot of batching, latency is high because users will be waiting until the batch size fills up, but throughput will be much higher because the GPUs are being used more efficiently.</p>
<p>Why are GPUs faster at multiplying large matrices once than small matrices many times? Two reasons. First, there’s some overhead involved in issuing each command to the GPU, and one big multiplication can be launched with a single command. Second, each new GPU command involves fetching weights from memory, which can be expensive for large weights. If you run lots of small GEMMs, you can end up spending most of your time shipping weights in and out of memory instead of computing.</p>
<h3>Why are some models tuned for high batch sizes?</h3>
<p>Typically an inference server will have a “collection window” where user requests come in and are queued. Chat servers typically aim for 5-10ms, but very high-batch backends might go as wide as 200ms. If a new request comes in at the start of the window, it might wait the entire window duration before being processed<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>. When the window closes, all the queued requests are batched up (i.e. all the 1xmodel-size matrices are concatenated into a single 128xmodel-size matrix) and that batch is sent through the pipeline. Running a batch like this is sometimes called a “tick”.</p>
<p>As the explanation above suggests, you can run any model at any batch size. There’s nothing inherently about the batching process that would rule out some types of model. However, it is possible to build a model so GPU-inefficiently that it effectively <em>needs</em> batching in order to be practical.</p>
<h4>Why mixture of experts requires higher batch sizes</h4>
<p>For instance, take a mixture-of-experts model (like DeepSeek-V3 or supposedly the original GPT-4). You can get a strong model by training it to have hundreds and hundreds of “experts”: separate blocks of feed-forward weights, from which a routing layer picks a subset that’s used on each token. But a model like this is really GPU-inefficient. We can see why: GPUs want to do a small number of really big matrix multiplications, but if you have many experts you’re forced into many small multiplications. Unless you do your inference in batches, that’s going to mean low throughput.</p>
<p>Let’s think through how a “collection window” of 5ms and 200ms would perform for a large mixture-of-experts model. Suppose you pick up ten user requests in that 5ms window. If you have many experts, some experts might end up only running against one or two tokens (i.e. the batch size <em>for each expert</em> will be much lower than the total set of requests you’ve picked up in your window). If, however, you wait for 200ms and pick up 4000 user requests, you are much more likely to saturate all your experts. At the cost of some latency, you’re making sure that your GEMMs are large and your GPUs are constantly utilized at their maximum capacity.</p>
<h4>Why large pipelines require high batch sizes to avoid pipeline bubbles</h4>
<p>For large models, it can be a challenge to keep the GPUs active at all. Large models typically have many transformer layers: i.e. hundreds of matrices of weights that make up the feed-forward network. The only way to do fast inference here is to <em>pipeline</em> those layers by having one GPU handle the first ten layers, another handle the next ten, and so on. Otherwise you just won’t be able to fit all the weights in a single GPU’s memory, so you’ll spend a ton of time swapping weights in and out of memory and it’ll end up being really slow. During inference, each token (typically in a “micro batch” of a few tens of tokens each) passes sequentially through that pipeline of GPUs.</p>
<p>How efficient your pipeline is depends on the number of layers you have and the size of your collection window. When you’re processing the tokens in a window during a “tick”, you’ll get some idle GPUs at the start (because GPUs in later layers won’t have anything to work on yet) and some more idle GPUs at the end (when there’s no more tokens in the queue, GPUs in early layers will have to wait for the next “tick”). These periods of idleness are sometimes called “warmup” and “drain”. If you have many small windows, you’re going to spend more GPU time in warmup and drain than if you have fewer large windows. By picking your window size, you’re thus directly trading off between throughput and latency.</p>
<p>If you have a ton of layers and your collection window is really short, you might sometimes end up with fewer tokens to process than layers. This is called a “pipeline bubble” - in effect the “drain” stage starts earlier than usual. You can’t eliminate warmup and drain (for reasons discussed below, inference has to operate in sequential “ticks”), but you can eliminate pipeline bubbles by making your collection window long enough. Pipeline bubbles can be absolutely brutal for model throughput, so inference providers always set their windows wide enough to avoid them. That adds noticeable latency for models with many layers.</p>
<h4>Can’t you just keep the queue full?</h4>
<p>Why couldn’t inference providers eliminate warmup and drain entirely by keeping the GPU queue full of tokens? In other words, couldn’t you do away with ticks altogether and just keep the token micro-batches flowing? Of course each user’s inference has to be sequential (since you can’t start generating the next token until the current token is done), but large inference providers should have enough concurrent traffic to keep the queue full of separate user requests.</p>
<p>I’ll confess I struggle to see why this shouldn’t be possible in theory. As far as I can tell the practical barrier is how the <em>attention</em> step is batched: if you want to batch up attention GEMMs, they need to all be the same shape (i.e. the same number of prior tokens in the sequence). So you have to run groups of the same shape at the same time, instead of being able to just maintain a single queue. There’s at least <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02310">some public research</a> on this front, but I wouldn’t be surprised if there were more clever tricks for doing this that I haven’t seen.</p>
<p>Another idea: if you need ticks for the attention step, why not just have a tick-based attention inference system and a more efficient continuous system for the FFN? As I understand it, the reason is <em>memory overhead</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Since the attention output is needed for the FFN, you’d need to have some place in-memory to park it while it waits for its slot in the FFN queue, which would quickly become too expensive.</li>
<li>Modern inference stacks are able to combine the attention and FFN step into a couple of large GEMMs in a single “operation”. If you’re doing these on different GPUs, you have to run different operations and shuttle the weights in and out of memory.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>GPUs are most efficient on <em>large</em> GEMMs, so stacking many tokens into a single matrix multiply gives far higher token throughput than processing them one-by-one</li>
<li>
<p>During decoding, attention can only be batched for tokens at the <strong>same step</strong>, forcing schedulers to run in short “ticks”. How many tokens you pack into a single “tick” (i.e. how long you wait to collect tokens) is your batch size</p>
<ul>
<li>These are tokens <em>from different users</em>. You can’t batch tokens from the same user because you need previous tokens to generate the next one, so batching requires a high volume of traffic from different users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bigger batches raise latency because user tokens might be waiting up to 200ms before the batch is full enough to run, but they boost throughput by allowing larger (and thus more efficient) GEMMs in the feed-forward step</li>
<li>Models with many layers (e.g. long pipelines) need larger batches to avoid <strong>pipeline bubbles</strong> (by ensuring each tick contains more batches than pipeline steps) </li>
<li>Mixture-of-Experts models need to be served with high-latency to be efficient: each expert sees only the tokens routed to it, so you need larger global batches to keep every expert busy.  </li>
<li>Inference providers pick a batch size/window that clears pipeline bubbles and saturates experts. High batch sizes buy you more throughput at the cost of higher latency as tokens wait to fill up the tick</li>
<li>Some models (like DeepSeek’s) that are mixture-of-experts with many layers thus <em>require</em> large batch sizes and high latency, otherwise throughput drops off a cliff. That’s why it’s commonly said that you can’t easily run DeepSeek for personal use: because with a single user running one inference at a time, it runs at very low efficiency/throughput</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that OpenAI and Anthropic’s models are quick to respond suggests that either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their models have a more efficient architecture (non-MoE, fewer layers), or</li>
<li>OpenAI/Anthropic have some very clever tricks for serving inference, or</li>
<li>they’re paying through the nose for way more GPUs than they strictly need</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> One commonly-observed strength of transformers is that they can batch <em>prefill</em> within a single user request. When you pass them a long prompt, they can process that prompt all at once because of how the attention mechanism works. Previous recurrent models had to go token-by-token, which was much slower (because it involved many more GEMMs). <strong>This has nothing to do with the kind of batching I’m talking about in this post</strong>. I’m talking about how you can efficiently batch <em>inference</em> across many different user requests once the prefilling is complete.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> This can also be batched, so long as you’re only batching attention operations with the same number of tokens in the sequence (i.e. every sequence predicting the fourth token can be batched together). Otherwise the size of the KV cache matrices are different, so you can’t easily combine them into a single batch. More on that later.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> Technically it’s not a token being generated, but the “logits” (a probability distribution across all possible tokens). I’ll say “token” here and later on to keep it simpler.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> Note that in practice modern inference stacks will use “continuous batching”, where a batch is sent off as soon as it’s full instead of waiting for the entire length of the fixed time window. However, the inference is still done in batches, to the core tradeoff between throughput and latency is the same.</p></section><p>If you liked this post, consider <a href="https://buttondown.com/seangoedecke" target="_blank">subscribing</a> to email updates about my new posts.</p><p>June 1, 2025<!-- -->&nbsp;│ Tags: <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/tags/ai/">ai</a>, <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/tags/explainers/">explainers</a>, <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/tags/deepseek/">deepseek</a></p><hr></article></div>]]></description>

  <p>For one of my <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2023-10-25-my-all-flash-zfs-network-storage-build/#previously-coreos">network storage PC
builds</a>,
I was looking for an alternative to <a href="https://www.flatcar.org/">Flatcar Container
Linux</a> and tried out <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a> again
(after an almost 10 year break). There are many ways to install NixOS, and in
this article I will outline how I like to install NixOS on physical hardware or
virtual machines: over the network and fully declaratively.</p>
<h2 id="declarative">Introduction: Declarative?</h2>
<p>The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming">declarative</a>
means that you describe <em>what</em> should be accomplished, not how. For NixOS, that
means you declare what software you want your system to include (add to config
option
<a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?show=environment.systemPackages"><code>environment.systemPackages</code></a>,
or enable a module) instead of, say, running <code>apt install</code>.</p>
<p>A nice property of the declarative approach is that your system follows your
configuration, so by reverting a configuration change, you can cleanly revert
the change to the system as well.</p>
<p>I like to manage declarative configuration files under version control,
typically with Git.</p>
<p>When I originally set up my current network storage build, I chose CoreOS (later
Flatcar Container Linux) because it was an auto-updating base system with a
declarative <a href="https://cloud-init.io/">cloud-init</a> config.</p>
<h2 id="ways">Ways of installing NixOS</h2>
<h3 id="graphical-install">Graphical Installer: Only for Desktops</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#ch-installation">NixOS manual’s “Installation”
section</a> describes a
graphical installer (“for desktop users”, based on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calamares_(software)">Calamares</a> system installer
and added in 2022) and a manual installer.</p>
<p>With the graphical installer, it’s easy to install NixOS to disk: just confirm
the defaults often enough and you’ll end up with a working system. But there are
some downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to manually enable SSH after the installation — locally, not via the
network.</li>
<li>The graphical installer generates an initial NixOS configuration for you, but
there is no way to inject your own initial NixOS configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>The graphical installer is clearly not meant for remote installation or
automated installation.</p>
<h3 id="manual-install">Manual Installation</h3>
<p>The manual installer on the other hand is too manual for my taste: expand
“Example 2” and “Example 3” in <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-installation-manual-summary">the NixOS manual’s Installation
summary</a>
section to get an impression. To be clear, the steps are very doable, but I
don’t want to install a system this way in a hurry. For one, manual procedures
are prone to mistakes under stress. And also, copy &amp; pasting commands
interactively is literally the opposite of writing declarative configuration
files.</p>
<h3 id="nixos-anywhere">Network Installation: nixos-anywhere</h3>
<p>Ideally, I would want to perform most of the installation from the comfort of my
own PC, meaning the installer must be usable over the network. Also, I want the
machine to come up with a working initial NixOS configuration immediately after
installation (no manual steps!).</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a (community-provided) solution:
<a href="https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-anywhere">nixos-anywhere</a>. You take care
of booting a NixOS installer, then run a single command and nixos-anywhere will
SSH into that installer, partition your disk(s) and install NixOS to
disk. Notably, nixos-anywhere is configured declaratively, so you can repeat
this step any time.</p>
<p>(I know that nixos-anywhere can even SSH into arbitrary systems and kexec-reboot
them into a NixOS installer, which is certainly a cool party trick, but I like
the approach of explicitly booting an installer better as it seems less risky
and more generally applicable/repeatable to me.)</p>
<h2 id="setup-nix">Setup: Installing Nix</h2>
<p>I want to use NixOS for one of my machines, but not (currently) on my main desktop PC.</p>
<p>Hence, I installed only the <code>nix</code> tool (for building, even without running
NixOS) on Arch Linux:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% sudo pacman -S nix
% sudo groupadd -r nixbld
% for n in $(seq 1 24); do sudo useradd -c "Nix build user $n" \
    -d /var/empty -g nixbld -G nixbld -M -N -r -s "$(which nologin)" \
    nixbld$n; done
</code></pre><p>Now, running <code>nix-shell -p hello</code> should drop you in a new shell in which the
GNU hello package is installed:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% nix-shell -p hello
hello

[nix-shell:/tmp]$ hello
Hello, world!
</code></pre><p>By the way, the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Nix">Nix page on the Arch Linux
wiki</a> explains how to use nix to install
packages, but that’s not what I am interested in: I only want to remotely manage
NixOS systems.</p>
<h2 id="own-installer">Building your own installer</h2>
<p>Previously, I said “you take care of booting a NixOS installer”, and that’s easy
enough: write the ISO image to a USB stick and boot your machine from it (or
select the ISO and boot your VM).</p>
<p>But before we can log in remotely via SSH, we need to manually set a password. I
also need to SSH with the <code>TERM=xterm</code> environment variable because the termcap
file of rxvt-unicode (my preferred terminal) is not included in the default
NixOS installer environment. Similarly, my configured locales do not work and my
preferred shell (Zsh) is not available.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be much nicer if the installer was pre-configured with a convenient
environment?</p>
<p>With other Linux distributions, like Debian, Fedora or Arch Linux, I wouldn’t
attempt to re-build an official installer ISO image. I’m sure their processes
and tooling work well, but I am also sure it’s one extra thing I would need to
learn, debug and maintain.</p>
<p>But building a NixOS installer is <em>very similar</em> to configuring a regular NixOS
system: same configuration, same build tool. The procedure is documented in the
<a href="https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Creating_a_NixOS_live_CD">official NixOS wiki</a>.</p>
<p>I copied the customizations I would typically put into <code>configuration.nix</code>,
imported the <code>installation-cd-minimal.nix</code> module from <code>nixpkgs</code> and put the
result in the <code>iso.nix</code> file:</p>

<p>To build the ISO image, I set the <code>NIX_PATH</code> environment variable to point <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/nix-build.1"><code>nix-build(1)</code></a>
 to the <code>iso.nix</code> file and to select the
upstream channel for NixOS 25.05:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% export NIX_PATH=nixos-config=$PWD/iso.nix:nixpkgs=channel:nixos-25.05
% nix-build '&lt;nixpkgs/nixos&gt;' -A config.system.build.isoImage
</code></pre><p>After about 1.5 minutes on my <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-05-15-my-2025-high-end-linux-pc/">2025 high-end Linux
PC</a>, the installer ISO can be
found in <code>result/iso/nixos-minimal-25.05.802216.55d1f923c480-x86_64-linux.iso</code>
(1.46 GB in size in my case).</p>
<h2 id="enabling-flakes">Enabling Nix Flakes</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the nix project has not yet managed to enable the “experimental”
new command-line interface (CLI) by default yet, despite 5+ years of being
available, so we need to create a config file and enable the modern
<code>nix-command</code> interface:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% mkdir -p ~/.config/nix
% echo 'experimental-features = nix-command flakes' &gt;&gt; ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
</code></pre><p>How can you tell old from new? The old commands are hyphenated (<code>nix-build</code>),
the new ones are separated by a blank space (<code>nix build</code>).</p>
<p>You’ll notice I also enabled <a href="https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes">Nix flakes</a>,
which I use so that my nix builds are hermetic and pinned to a certain revision
of nixpkgs and any other nix modules I want to include in my build. I like to
compare flakes to version lock file in other programming environments: the idea
is that building the system in 5 months will yield the same result as it does
today.</p>
<p>To verify that flakes work, run <code>nix shell</code> (not <code>nix-shell</code>):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% nix shell nixpkgs#hello
/tmp 2 % hello
Hello, world!
</code></pre><h2 id="reinstall-steps">(Re-)Installation Steps</h2>
<p>For reference, here is the configuration I use to create a new VM for NixOS in
Proxmox. The most important setting is <code>bios=ovmf</code> (= UEFI boot, which is not
the default), so that I can use the same boot loader configuration on physical
machines as in VMs:</p>

disable Secure Boot. Note that Proxmox enables Secure Boot by default, for
example.</p>
<p>Then, boot the custom installer ISO on the target system, and ensure <code>ssh michael@nixos.lan</code> works without prompting for a password.</p>

<h2 id="post-installation-steps">Post-Installation Steps</h2>
<p>Now that the declarative part of the system is in place, we need to take care of
the stateful part.</p>
<p>In my case, the only stateful part that needs setting up is the Tailscale mesh VPN.</p>
<p>To set up Tailscale, I log in via SSH and run <code>sudo tailscale up</code>. Then, I add
the new node to my network by following the link. Afterwards, in the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines">Tailscale
Machines console</a>, I disable key
expiration and add ACL tags.</p>
<h2 id="making-changes">Making Changes</h2>
<p>Now, after I changed something in my configuration file, I use <code>nixos-rebuild</code>
remotely to roll out the change to my NixOS system:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>% nix run nixpkgs#nixos-rebuild -- \
  --target-host michael@zammadn \
  --use-remote-sudo \
  switch \
  --flake .#zammadn
</code></pre><p>Note that not all changes are fully applied as part of <code>nixos-rebuild switch</code>:
while systemd services are generally restarted, newly required kernel modules
are not automatically loaded (e.g. after enabling the <code>edgetpu</code> coral hardware
accelerator in Frigate).</p>
<p>So, to be sure everything took effect, <code>reboot</code> your system after deploying
changes.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of NixOS is that in the boot menu, you can select which
generation of the system you want to run. If the latest change broke something,
you can quickly reboot into the previous generation to undo that change. Of
course, you can also undo the configuration change and deploy a new generation —
whichever is more convenient in the situation.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With this article, I hope I could convey what I wish someone would have told me
when I started using Nix and NixOS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable flakes and the new CLI.</li>
<li>Use nixos-anywhere to install remotely.
<ul>
<li>Build a custom installer if you want, it’s easy!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use <code>nixos-rebuild</code>’s builtin <code>--target-host</code> flag for remote deployment.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://allenpike.com/2025/figma-slides-beautiful-disaster">https://allenpike.com/2025/figma-slides-beautiful-disaster</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44148933">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Some highlights and lowlights.</p><div>
<p>I think of presentation slides as having 3 main jobs:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Emphasize key points</strong>, so people remember</li>
  <li><strong>Break up complex concepts</strong>, so people learn</li>
  <li><strong>Entertain</strong>, so people pay attention</li>
</ol>

<p>This calls for slides that are mostly images or very short phrases. A minority of slides justify designing something to match the vibe or illustrate a point – a diagram, for example. This can mean going back and forth between Keynote and, say, Figma, but it’s worth the effort.</p>

<p>This year I’ve been spending a lot of time in Figma, so when I was recently asked to speak at an event I thought, “Why not try <a href="https://www.figma.com/slides/">Figma Slides</a>?” Figma Slides launched a year back, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/paigecostello_figma-slides-came-out-of-beta-today-30-activity-7308211241049591811-Z_-U/">graduated from beta in March</a>. I’ve used Keynote for almost 20 years now – it seemed like time for me to finally upgrade my presentation tool.</p>

<p>So I gave it a whirl.</p>

<p>Pretty quickly, I liked building slides right in Figma. The Grid view made it easy for me to structure my ideas. Features like Auto Layout and Components made building slides that adapt to different text and images a snap.</p>

<p>For example, a key point in my talk was that selecting a JavaScript framework can be overwhelming. It was easy to build a quick visual of this right in the deck.</p>

<p><img src="https://allenpike.com/images/2025/figma-smash.jpg" alt="A Choose Your Fighter screen of JS frameworks.">
Components and Auto Layout made this 10x faster to build in Figma than Keynote.
</p>

<p>Admittedly, Figma Slides is missing some Keynote features that I think of as pretty essential.</p>

<p>For example, Keynote has long had a toggle to “Autosize Text”, which will set an object’s font size to just big enough to fill its container. There’s no way to do this in Figma’s auto layout because Figma only wants to support layouts that CSS Grid can implement. That constraint makes sense when designing for the web, but shows how hard it is to expand a design tool to other domains.</p>

<p>Another odd omission is that you can’t easily create a slide where items (e.g. bullets, sections of a diagram) appear with each click. The closest you can do is to split them into different layers, add a “Fade” animation of 1 millisecond on each, then <em>reorder the animation order to match the order they appear on the slide</em> since it will default to the order the layers were created. 🥴</p>

<p>I’m not a fan of bullet-laden decks, but sometimes you just want to make 4 words appear one by one, okay?</p>

<p>Whining aside, building in Figma Slides got me excited. It was powerful, it was fun, and it gave me hope that Figma would successfully make the transition from single-product company about to be acquired by Adobe, to multi-product company <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/15/figma-confidentially-files-for-ipo-a-year-after-ditching-adobe-deal.html">ready to IPO</a>.</p>

<p>Then I made a fatal mistake: I tried to actually give the presentation.</p>

<p><img src="https://allenpike.com/images/2025/figma-offline.jpg" alt="Figma error -106">
</p>

<p>I’ve given enough talks that I know to do at least one rehearsal with representative conditions: on an external display, clicker in hand, cued by the presenter view. I know to make sure it works offline, save a backup copy of the deck, and so on.</p>

<p>It was during this dry run I noticed some bad omens:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You can “Save Local Copy” of the presentation, but that doesn’t allow you to present it locally.</li>
  <li>Just because you have a presentation open and loaded, doesn’t mean you can present it. If you are offline when you actually click Present, it will barf.</li>
  <li>Once you are presenting, you can click to “download” the presentation to be available offline – but be careful not to close the tab or it will undownload!</li>
  <li>When you do click Present, you will not get a full-screen audience view, nor a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/keynote/tanfde4a3e6d/mac">keyboard shortcut to swap which display the audience can see</a>. You just get a pop-up window you need to manually drag to the projector – hope it’s somewhere intuitive! – then maximize it. At a pro event you can do this with the AV crew, but at a meetup this is just visible to the audience.</li>
  <li>Make sure you then move your mouse to the edge of the screen. Otherwise, it will stay there on top of your slides like it’s 1999.</li>
  <li>Even beyond this, the functionality around managing Present and the Audience view is just a little… flaky?</li>
</ol>

<div>
<video src="https://allenpike.com/images/2025/figma-x.mp4" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
  Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.
</video><p>
Figma will decide when your presentation is over.
</p></div>

<p>This all made me uneasy, so I practiced the flow more often than usual. I made sure I clicked the right things to make it work offline. Then, I went to go present.</p>

<p>At the venue, I immediatley noticed something once the slides were up on their giant 40 foot display: I needed to click twice to advance each slide. Odd, but I’m an adult. I can click twice for each slide.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, halfway into my talk I noticed a much bigger problem.</p>

<p>The animations – which I had used only on my most complex slides, which needed to be explained in parts – weren’t advancing at all. Even if I clicked twice, the audience display would continue to show a blank slide.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_o-YiwGwo">
<img src="https://allenpike.com/images/2025/clicker-fail.jpg" alt="A man looks in confusion at his own clicker.">
</a>
Looking at my clicker in desperation: the exact moment I realized that I’d been hoisted on my own petard.
</p>

<p>After some exploratory clicking, I found that once all the builds on a blank slide had been triggered, it would then jump to the next slide. At that point, you could click back to show the fully built skipped slide.</p>

<p>So that’s what I did: on a slide with 7 builds, I would dutifully click 14 times to get Figma through to the next slide, then then click back, and attempt to explain all seven parts at once.</p>

<p>I stumbled through. The audience was gracious – thankfully it was only 100 people and they were friendly. But it stung a little.</p>

<p>A silver lining was that the core point of my talk was that <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">boring technology is underrated</a>. Watching me struggle with Figma Slides helped prove the point. <strong>Here lies Allen, murdered by not-boring technology</strong>.</p>

<p>While I was able to reproduce the animation bug the next day, I haven’t been able to since restarting Figma. Their forums have stories of <a href="https://forum.figma.com/ask-the-community-7/fixed-figma-slides-show-smart-animate-transition-only-in-presenter-view-and-not-in-audience-view-39081?utm_source=chatgpt.com">other</a> <a href="https://forum.figma.com/ask-the-community-7/fixed-figma-slides-show-smart-animate-transition-only-in-presenter-view-and-not-in-audience-view-39081?utm_source=chatgpt.com">similar</a> <a href="https://forum.figma.com/ask-the-community-7/figma-slides-with-multiple-videos-in-present-mode-have-to-click-arrow-key-loads-before-next-slide-28477?utm_source=chatgpt.com">bugs</a>, none quite the same. So maybe it’s fixed.</p>

<p>Even if this specific bug is fixed, though, I get the strong impression that Figma doesn’t treat presenting Slides as mission-critical. A team that uses Figma Slides at meetups or conferences wouldn’t let clicking Present offline just vomit “Error -106”.</p>

<p>While Keynote is old, and pasting things in from other design tools feels janky, the OG still benefits from Apple institutionally <a href="https://allenpike.com/2022/giving-a-shit">giving a shit</a> about giving a presentation to an audience. You can tell they feel it should be bulletproof.</p>

<p>So, in the end, I learned the lesson I was trying to teach. Boring technology is good, actually.</p>

<p>Here’s to Keynote: it works. 🍻</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://stephencoyle.net/kilnettle">https://stephencoyle.net/kilnettle</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44148853">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><meta property="og:image" content="/media/kilnettle1.jpg">
<img src="https://stephencoyle.net/media/kilnettle1.jpg"></p>

<p>A couple of years ago I wrote <a href="https://stephencoyle.net/father-ted-tape-dispenser">this</a> post, wherein I detail how I built a working version of the tape dispenser from Father Ted (<a href="https://youtu.be/c_ojhPi7lH4">the one that says</a> <em>you have used two inches of sticky tape, god bless you</em>). While it worked surprisingly well, that version had a number of flaws. It used unnecessarily overpowered hardware, was fragile, and didn’t sound very good.</p>

<p>Since making that one, I’d toyed with the idea of creating a better, more repeatable design. So, in very procrastinate-y fits and starts over the last few months, I’ve been doing just that.</p>

<p>This new one is much smaller, sounds better, and I daresay looks a touch more <em>professional</em> than its predecessor. Read on to find out how to get one of your own!</p>

<p>
        <iframe width="420pt" height="315pt" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zKlZgHTyWA4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
            </iframe>
        </p>

<p><img src="https://stephencoyle.net/media/kilnettle3.jpg"></p>

<p>More importantly, it’s also much easier to make and I’ve got actual documentation for doing so. The case is 3D-printable, and all the parts print with no supports. Instead of a rotary encoder to measure the tape rotation, it now uses an IR led and sensor. The logic runs on an ESP8266 microcontroller instead of a Raspberry Pi Zero, all of which means the electronics inside can be purchased for less than €10.</p>

<p>It was a lot of fun improving on my 3D modelling, electronics, design and general planning skills in the process of making it. The initial body design was more complex, as was the circuitry, and I enjoyed iterating on and simplifying those significantly by the final product.</p>

<p>I did nurture the idea of actually selling these, but ultimately I think I’ve decided against it for now, for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Making one is fun, and a nice evening or weekend project. Making lots is more effort than I have time for at the moment.</li>
<li>I’ve got several earmarked for people already, and when I subtract those from the dozen I’ve made, I’m left with only a tiny batch to sell.</li>
<li>Factoring in the cost of components, time to assemble, and shipping, I don’t think there’s a compelling price point that doesn’t run at a loss. In which case I’d rather just give them away on my own terms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How can you get one?</h2>

<p><img src="https://stephencoyle.net/media/kilnettle4.jpg"></p>

<p>The good news, though, is that you can build one yourself! I’ve made the software, 3D-printable models, and instructions public on <a href="https://github.com/stephenjdc/TapeDispenser">GitHub</a>. You can also view the print files on <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/935093-kilnettle-shrine-commemorative-talking-tape-dispen">Printables</a>. It’s not a super complex build, so if you can manage basic soldering and have a 3D printer it’s probably a one-day project. I could potentially make kits, which contain all the required parts, that folks could assemble by themselves. If that's something you'd be interested in, do let me know. And if you do make one, or make some kind of remix, please send me pics!</p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, if you do make one for yourself I'd appreciate if you made a donation to a charity that supports trans people. It's an awful shame that the creator of Father Ted is doing so much damage to an already vulnerable group, so anything that can help offset that is appreciated.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><time>written<!-- --> <!-- -->almost 3 years ago</time></p><hr></div><p>This post documents a catalogue of experiments on the topic of error management in medium-sized Go programs, specifically HTTP APIs, with certain end goals in mind around ergonomics, syntactic salt and making the lives of everyone involved easier. The final result is a simple approach and a new library that I've been using in production for a couple of months now.</p>
<p>Error handling (or, more accurately, error <em>management</em>) has always ended up being a hot topic with Go. Most likely because of two things. Firstly, Go's early ideas about error handling – as with a lot of Go's design – chose to steer away from commonly found implementations such as exception handling and opted for a vastly simpler (at least from an implementation perspective) approach: return values. Secondly, the smallest, simplest form of an error in Go is a string of text. This leaves a lot of room for building on top of the simple concept of a string of text.</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>error</span> <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>string</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Every Go programmer is familiar with this interface. The beauty in simplicity here is that any type that satisfies this interface is an error. This allows us to construct domain-specific types that satisfy our needs if those needs stretch beyond a simple string of text.</p>
<p>Okay, so you know that. I did the one thing I hate in articles about some topic and described the absolute basics of said topic despite the fact that whoever is reading this already knows all of that before getting to the <em>actual</em> content.</p>
<h2>Structured logging</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>(unrelated to lumberjack unions)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I won't do that here, promise. You all know what structured logging is. It's basically a standard concept in most medium and larger systems. As <a target="_blank" href="https://www.willett.io/posts/precepts/">Brandon Willett writes</a>, <strong>Structured logs are non-negotiable</strong>.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with error handling? Well, first of all, let's define <em>error handling</em> by showing what it's not:</p>
<pre><code>data<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> service<span>.</span><span>GetAccount</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> err
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This is not error handling. Nothing about this code is handling anything. This is I-don't-know-what-to-do-with-this-error-so-you-deal-with-it.</p>
<p>And this is fine and this is still one part of what I call error <em>management</em> because there are a few different key events during the lifecycle of an error.</p>
<pre><code>data<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> service<span>.</span><span>GetAccount</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> errors<span>.</span><span>Wrap</span><span>(</span>err<span>,</span> <span>"failed to get account"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This is somewhat more involved, and arguably, more useful error management. We're now annotating the error with a bit more context. So when we finally <em>handle</em> the error, we will see the original error that <code>GetAccount</code> produced as well as some <em>context</em> relevant to the caller of <code>GetAccount</code>.</p>
<p>And this is <em>error management</em> for a lot of Go code. Glueing strings together is – a lot of the time – <em>all you need</em>.</p>
<pre><code>data<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> service<span>.</span><span>GetThing</span><span>(</span>id<span>)</span>
<span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> errors<span>.</span><span>Wrapf</span><span>(</span>err<span>,</span> <span>"failed to get account: %v"</span><span>,</span> id<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>So now, let's say the implementation of <code>GetAccount</code> accesses a database and the database is offline, we would see something like:</p>
<pre><code>failed to get account: 59: database connection refused
</code></pre>
<p>The actual <em>handling</em> of this error occurs elsewhere. I'm willing to bet that within the majority of cases, where the service is some form of HTTP based API, the error handling happens near the service boundary.</p>
<p>The service boundary for a HTTP server is a route handler. The typical approach is:</p>
<ol>
<li>there's an error! oh no</li>
<li>log.Error</li>
<li>http.StatusInternalServerError</li>
<li>the user tweets the error screen to your company account and everyone is slightly less happy</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 2 is what we're interested in here. <em>Handling</em> an error in this example means we tell someone about it. That someone is, again, in the majority of cases, probably a log aggregator and an alerting system and, eventually, a human.</p>
<p>Now, log aggregators are incredibly powerful. You can filter based on the service, the account that made the request, the trace ID, the filename that the log entry originated from, the region the service is running in, and infinitely more options. This is extremely useful for diagnosing issues at scale.</p>
<p>But you can only do all of that stuff if you <em>actually</em> structure your log entries. And this is not very structured:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"message"</span><span>:</span> <span>"failed to get account: 59: database connection refused"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"level"</span><span>:</span> <span>"error"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"file"</span><span>:</span> <span>"api/get_user.go:56"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>I can't filter all logs by account "59". Well, I can, I can search for the string of text "account: 59" but that won't help when developers use slightly different wording in their messages. Strings of text are for humans to read after all.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, it would be nice to do this:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"message"</span><span>:</span> <span>"failed to get account: 59: database connection refused"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"level"</span><span>:</span> <span>"error"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"file"</span><span>:</span> <span>"api/get_user.go:56"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"account_id"</span><span>:</span> <span>"59"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Which you can do with any structured logging library, but there's a wide gap between your error value and your <code>log.Info</code> call. You can solve this by creating a custom type that satisfies the <code>error</code> interface:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> AccountError <span>{</span>
  message   <span>string</span>
  AccountID <span>int</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span>a <span>*</span>AccountError<span>)</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> a<span>.</span>message
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Then, when you handle the error, you can check if the error is of this type and pull out the account ID for logging.</p>
<pre><code><span>var</span> ae <span>*</span>AccountError
<span>if</span> errors<span>.</span><span>As</span><span>(</span>err<span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span>ae<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// add ae.AccountID to the structured logging call</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>That's a lot of work, imagine doing that on a large system with many different kinds of resources, many different kinds of metadata you want to include with logs. It would be easier if you could just store a <code>map[string]string</code> of metadata and log that, right?</p>
<h2>The importance of being ergonomic</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>(not a yoga ad)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing I've noticed throughout my career in myself, coworkers and open source collaborators I've worked with is that if you make good things hard to do, people won't do them.</p>
<p>Take testing as an example. I wrote a bunch of C++ early on in my software authorship and writing tests for C++ is a whole ordeal. You need a completely separate independent tool to handle the dance of compiling and linking your code as a separate binary with a bunch of extra tooling, macros and functions to facilitate telling the test system where your test functions are.</p>
<p>Compare that to Go where 1. it's built into the toolchain and 2. you literally just add "_test" to your filename. This is so simple that it removes all barriers to writing tests. Easy to write means developers actually do it early instead of ending every PR with a commit titled "add tests".</p>
<p>I've still never written a single C++ test, I couldn't get the tooling to work with my CMake setup and my compiler configuration so I gave up. Not ergonomic.</p>
<h2>The ergonomics of errors</h2>
<p>When it comes to errors, Go does have a fairly ergonomic mechanism. You write a message, maybe add another message, you read it later in the logs and figure out what went wrong. It's easy to create errors and it's easy to add context to error chains.</p>
<p>With custom error structs however, it's a lot of writing to create your own error type and thus it becomes more of a burden to encourage your team members to do this. I've worked in codebases where there are a couple of custom errors for special cases but most of the time it ends up just being <code>errors.Wrap(err, "thing failed to do stuff")</code> which, the majority of the time, I do not find that it adds value to the diagnostic process when things go wrong.</p>
<p>The key is to build this concept into your entire codebase so it doesn't get forgotten. If every single instance of error handling does X, Y and Z then when new developers join your team, they will notice that and follow convention.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>So we want ergonomics? Let's start from the top. Forget implementation details, we care about the <code>user experience</code> of our error management solution. Treat your libraries like products and your team as end-users and you'll have a happy team.</p>
<p>What we want is:</p>
<ol>
<li>to decorate errors with metadata</li>
<li>to easily access that metadata when it comes to logging the problem or sending a response to the client.</li>
<li>make it stupid simple</li>
</ol>
<p>So I'm going to copy the popular Go structured logging library, Logrus, for this example. It's widely used so it's probably doing something right when it comes to ease-of-use.</p>
<pre><code>log<span>.</span><span>WithFields</span><span>(</span>log<span>.</span>Fields<span>{</span>
  <span>"event"</span><span>:</span> event<span>,</span>
  <span>"topic"</span><span>:</span> topic<span>,</span>
  <span>"key"</span><span>:</span> key<span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Fatal</span><span>(</span><span>"Failed to send event"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>What we want is something similar to this. Let's sketch it out:</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>Wrap</span><span>(</span>err<span>,</span> Fields<span>{</span>
    <span>"event"</span><span>:</span> event<span>,</span>
    <span>"topic"</span><span>:</span> topic<span>,</span>
    <span>"key"</span><span>:</span> key<span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Looks good! We're wrapping the error and the wrapper function takes a second argument that a developer <em>must</em> fill with a <code>Fields</code> object.</p>
<p>And at the other end, we just need to easily pull out the data in a form that's simple to pass directly to a call to our logging library:</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
  metadata <span>:=</span> <span>GetErrorFields</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span>
  log<span>.</span><span>WithFields</span><span>(</span>metadata<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>"failed to handle request"</span><span>)</span>
  w<span>.</span><span>Write</span><span>(</span>http<span>.</span>StatusInternalServerError<span>)</span>
  <span>return</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Perfect! We now have structured errors, compatible with structured logging. It's low effort to use and the benefits when diagnosing issues are huge.</p>
<p>And I actually wrote this in early 2022 for <a target="_blank" href="https://joinodin.com/">Odin's</a> codebase because problems were becoming increasingly difficult to diagnose due to poor error messages. The logging helper was added to one slice of the application to try it out. It made diagnosing bugs both at development time and in production vastly simpler since I had decorated many of our error returns with additional contextual metadata to aid searching in Datadog.</p>
<p>But the problem here is there was still an immense amount of manual work required to add all these bits of metadata to error returns. One call to <code>Wrap</code> is fine but if you have a complex piece of business logic with 10 or more <code>if err != nil</code>'s scattered around, it suddenly becomes a lot of work and that hurts the ergonomics.</p>
<h2>Bridging the context gap</h2>
<p>I've been using this word <em>context</em> quite a bit already throughout this article. This word is defined by Oxford as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Go's adequately named "context" library does exactly this for call trees. It's a tool that's widely used for cancelling or giving deadlines to long-running operations but it can also be used to store information and carry that information throughout a call tree.</p>
<p>Now this powerful functionality is not to be taken lightly. Contexts involve a few allocations when reading or writing information (many more than passing arguments or accessing receivers) and from a core software engineering standpoint, contexts can serve to hide information as it's essentially a black box. You cannot iterate contexts and print out their contents. You must <em>know</em> what you're looking for via a "context key."</p>
<p>So while I'm advocating for careful and considerate use of Go's context library, I'm also saying <a target="_blank" href="https://isburmistrov.substack.com/p/all-you-need-is-wide-events-not-metrics">stuff it full of as much metadata as you can find</a>. But seriously, as long as your actual business logic isn't dependent on the content of a context, I have found the tool quite useful for storing metadata about a call tree or an operation that can be accessed for non-business logic related operations such as logging and error management.</p>
<p>In reality, this looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>ctx <span>=</span> <span>WithMetadata</span><span>(</span>ctx<span>,</span> <span>"account_id"</span><span>,</span> accountID<span>)</span>

<span>...</span>

<span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>Wrap</span><span>(</span>err<span>,</span> ctx<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>...</span>

metadata <span>:=</span> <span>GetErrorFields</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span>
<span>// map[string]any{"account_id": 59}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Contexts only accrue information as they descend into a call tree. Once you return from a function where a context has been wrapped with any of the "With" APIs you often see in Go (<code>WithDeadline</code>, <code>WithTimeout</code> and my addition above, <code>WithMetadata</code>) that information is freed. So you can't do this:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>Y</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  ctx <span>=</span> context<span>.</span><span>WithValue</span><span>(</span>ctx<span>,</span> <span>"key"</span><span>,</span> <span>"value"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>X</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Y</span><span>(</span>ctx<span>)</span>

  ctx<span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>(</span><span>"key"</span><span>)</span> <span>// nothing, nil, zilch, it's gone</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This is because when you "wrap" a context, you're creating a copy which is only sticking around for the duration of that stack frame. Once you return from a function you lose your modified context. There's no two-way state manipulation (a good thing) so you can't decorate a call tree on the way down and then read that information back at the top.</p>
<h2>Errors are context in reverse</h2>
<p>Hot take. But if you squint a bit, errors are basically contexts but they operate on the ascending side of the call tree, not the descending side.</p>
<p>Contexts accrue information as they descend the call tree and errors accrue information as they ascend the call tree.</p>
<p>This means that, if you want to store structured metadata in a context, that information is only useful if you pass it to an error so that metadata can ride the call tree ascension like a rollercoaster all the way up to the top where it's actually useful.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>Okay it's about time we had some code. We need a context key, a helper to top up a context with some metadata and another helper to get it out again.</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> contextKey <span>struct</span><span>{</span><span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>WithMeta</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> kv <span>...</span><span>string</span><span>)</span> context<span>.</span>Context <span>{</span>
	<span>var</span> data <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>string</span>

	<span>// overwrite any existing context metadata</span>
	<span>if</span> meta<span>,</span> ok <span>:=</span> ctx<span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>(</span>contextKey<span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> ok <span>{</span>
		data <span>=</span> meta
	<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
		data <span>=</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>)</span>
	<span>}</span>

	l <span>:=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span>kv<span>)</span>
	<span>for</span> i <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> l<span>;</span> i <span>+=</span> <span>2</span> <span>{</span>
		k <span>:=</span> kv<span>[</span>i<span>]</span>
		v <span>:=</span> kv<span>[</span>i<span>+</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>

		data<span>[</span>k<span>]</span> <span>=</span> v
	<span>}</span>

	<span>return</span> context<span>.</span><span>WithValue</span><span>(</span>ctx<span>,</span> contextKey<span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span> data<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Because we intend to call this multiple times during a call tree, any successive calls to wrapped contexts will already contain metadata. Now I've opted for an extremely simple approach of essentially copying all the fields, if there are any, into the newly wrapped context. This could be an opportunity for memory usage optimisation but that's for another day.</p>
<p>Now we need to wrap errors and store the context's metadata hash table into the error, simple stuff.</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> withContext <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
	cause <span>error</span>
	meta  <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>string</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Omitted: the error implementation that actually makes this an error.</span>

<span>func</span> <span>Wrap</span><span>(</span>err <span>error</span><span>,</span> ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>
	meta<span>,</span> ok <span>:=</span> ctx<span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>(</span>contextKey<span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>)</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>!</span>ok <span>{</span>
		<span>return</span> err
	<span>}</span>

	<span>return</span> <span>&amp;</span>withContext<span>{</span>err<span>,</span> meta<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, a way to get the metadata information (or a zero-value) out of any error value.</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>Unwrap</span><span>(</span>err <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>string</span> <span>{</span>
	values <span>:=</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>{</span><span>}</span>

	<span>for</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>if</span> f<span>,</span> ok <span>:=</span> err<span>.</span><span>(</span><span>*</span>withContext<span>)</span><span>;</span> ok <span>{</span>
			<span>if</span> m <span>:=</span> f<span>.</span>meta<span>;</span> m <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
				<span>for</span> k<span>,</span> v <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> m <span>{</span>
					values<span>[</span>k<span>]</span> <span>=</span> v
				<span>}</span>
			<span>}</span>
		<span>}</span>

		err <span>=</span> errors<span>.</span><span>Unwrap</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span>
	<span>}</span>

	<span>if</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span>values<span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
	<span>}</span>

	<span>return</span> values
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Because errors in Go are essentially nested within each other like Russian dolls, we need to iterate the tree of errors by repeatedly calling <code>errors.Unwrap(err)</code> which is pretty much how many error management code works. We're basically searching through the chain for an instance of the type we're interested in.</p>
<p>Lots of error code does this repeated unwrapping, which sounds like it could be a performance concern in larger applications but there's an argument to be made that if your error handling code is your biggest performance concern then you need to either 1. stop causing so many errors or 2. use a different language!</p>
<h2>Things to watch out for</h2>
<p>Great power, great responsibility and all that. As with any kind of logging system that's moving information from your application to a third party you must <em>must</em> <strong>must</strong> avoid including any sort of PII (personally identifiable information) in your context, errors and logs unless you want to fail your SOC2 certification.</p>
<p>When decorating errors, the same rules as using logging applies. There are many great articles on this topic, but in summary, avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email addresses</li>
<li>Names, even if just first name</li>
<li>Any form of institutional identifier such as social security, financial, healthcare numbers.</li>
<li>Any kind of public social media handle</li>
<li>(hopefully extremely obvious) bank information like credit card numbers or routing+account numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>Some tips for what metadata can be included and will help you when diagnosing issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anonymous internal unique identifiers of any kind (user IDs, account IDs, company IDs...) any of them you have available, stick them in your context. You'll thank yourself later.</li>
<li>Relevant timestamps. Obviously you have the timestamp of the log entry already but if you have any other timestamps available that are relevant to your business domain, include them so you can perform time-range queries.</li>
<li>Slugs are often useful if you have non-technical/QA looking at your logs. Slugs are human-readable URL friendly names often used for things like blog posts or public resources (like a GitHub repository or a customer's subdomain)</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, you'll still run the risk of some developers using different naming conventions to other developers in key names, <code>user_id</code> vs <code>userID</code> for example. So establish a convention and stick to it. Use a centralised package of const strings and custom types to cause compiler errors if you need to. Make mistakes difficult.</p>
<h2>Here's one I made earlier</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>(brits older than 25 who used to watch cbbc, iykyk)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a technical article if I wasn't going to shill something I made. All of the above was essentially the experimental journey I went through to improve how errors work in a number of codebases I maintain and operate in production settings.</p>
<p>I've used those learnings to write (and rewrite about 3 times, based on feedback from many a Go engineer) a fairly simple but also pluggable error management library which includes the structured errors functionality discussed in this post as well as some other useful tools.</p>

<p>Now, because of the way this library is architected, you can just use the error context utility called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Southclaws/fault/blob/master/README.md#fctx">fctx</a> on its own as it satisfies the Fault wrapper interface as well as the commonly used <code>Wrap(error, stuff...)</code> pattern used in many libraries.</p>
<p>There will also be a future post diving deeper into some of the technical bits and rationale behind Fault and how I use it in production systems. So keep an eye out for that!</p>
<p>If you made it this far, thank you for reading! I hope this helps you navigate Go errors in larger applications. Feedback on the concepts and writing is greatly appreciated so <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Southclaws">feel free to tweet me</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Both stages are based on the transformer architecture and are learned with minimal prior constraints. <strong>No rasterization, no ray tracing.</strong></p><p><img src="https://microsoft.github.io/renderformer/imgs/model-arch.jpg" alt="Model architecture"></p></div><div id="gallery"><h2>Rendering Gallery</h2><p>Examples of scenes rendered with RenderFormer demonstrating various lighting conditions, materials, and geometric complexity, without any per-scene training or fine-tuning.
