                        <p>A new Washington’s Lottery AI mobile site turned a user’s photo into softcore pornography, forcing them to take the website down “out of an abundance of caution.”</p>
<p>When Megan, a 50-year-old mother based in Tumwater, visited the new AI-powered mobile site from <a href="https://www.walottery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington’s Lottery</a> on March 30, she thought she was in for some frivolous fun. <a href="https://testdriveawin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Test Drive A Win</a> allows users to digitally throw a dart at a dartboard featuring dream vacations you can pay for with the money you win in the lottery. Depending on where the dart lands, you can either upload a headshot or take one on your phone to upload, and the AI superimposes your image into the vacation spot.</p>
<p>Megan landed on a “swim with the sharks” dream vacation option. She was shocked at one of the AI photos Washington’s Lottery spit out. It was softcore porn.</p>

<h2>How did the the Washington’s Lottery site push out porn?</h2>
<p>Megan says she used the in-site option to take a photo of her face to upload. The photo that was created shows a smiling AI version of Megan, but almost completely nude.</p>
<p>In the image, Megan is sitting on a bed, with a bathing suit bottom on, but no top. Her bare breasts are exposed. The background of the image appears to show the bedroom in an aquarium, with fish swimming around her. There is a Washington’s Lottery logo in the bottom right corner.</p>
<p>“Our tax dollars are paying for that! I was completely shocked. It’s disturbing to say the least,” Megan explained to the Jason Rantz Show on KTTH.</p>
<p>Megan feared that the image could potentially get out and that it would happen to another website visitor. She told a friend, who happens to know someone at Washington’s Lottery, what happened.</p>
<p>“I also think whoever was responsible for it should be fired,” she added.</p>

<h3>Washington’s Lottery pulled the site offline</h3>
<p>It’s unclear how or why AI created this particular image, given the rules governing the content. The Jason Rantz Show on KTTH could not, of course, authenticate the image. However, a spokesperson for Washington’s Lottery confirmed they received a report that the image was created by the AI system.</p>
<p>Approximately three hours after an inquiry by the Jason Rantz Show on KTTH, Washington’s Lottery pulled the site offline. They also provided a statement.</p>
<p>“We were made aware that a single user of the AI platform was purportedly provided an image that did not adhere to the built-in parameters set by the developers. Prior to launch, we agreed to a comprehensive set of rules to govern image creation, including that people in images be fully clothed. We have not seen the image that the AI provided to this user, but out of an abundance of caution we took the website down,” the spokesperson confirmed to the Jason Rantz Show on KTTH.</p>
<p>The spokesperson did not confirm when they first heard of the issue. He also did not explain why Washington’s Lottery waited until after my inquiry before turning the site offline.</p>
<p>Megan is pleased the site has been removed. She says she hopes any back-end settings that need to be adjusted are, in fact, adjusted.</p>
<h3>UPDATE: 4/2/24, 7:38 p.m.</h3>
<p>A spokesman for Washington’s Lottery sent the following statement to the Jason Rantz Show on KTTH Tuesday night:</p>
<blockquote><p>We heard about this earlier this week. As soon as we did, we had the developers check all the parameters for the platform and were comfortable with the settings, but after further internal discussions today, we chose to take down the site out of an abundance of caution, as we don’t want something like this purported event to happen again.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/2024/03/us-court-blocks-epa-order-to-eliminate-pfas-in-plastic-containers/">https://www.thenewlede.org/2024/03/us-court-blocks-epa-order-to-eliminate-pfas-in-plastic-containers/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39929310">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        				<p>A US appeals court has vacated an action by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) &nbsp;ordering a company to stop producing plastic containers that leach toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) into pesticides, household cleaners, condiments, and many other products.</p>
<p>The 5<sup>th</sup> US Circuit Court of Appeals on March 21 <a href="https://peer.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3_22_24-Fifth-Circuit-Opinion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled</a> that the EPA exceeded its statutory authority when it <a href="https://www.epa.gov/reviewing-new-chemicals-under-toxic-substances-control-act-tsca/epa-orders-issued-inhance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued orders</a> to Texas-based Inhance in December prohibiting the company from manufacturing or processing PFAS through its fluorination process for containers.</p>
<p>The EPA move came after the agency determined that types of PFAS created during the fluorination process “are highly toxic and present unreasonable risks that cannot be prevented other than through prohibition of manufacture.”</p>
<p>The agency issued the orders under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which authorizes the EPA to regulate and screen chemicals produced or imported into the US.</p>
<p>But Inhance challenged the EPA’s action, arguing that the EPA improperly sought to take action against the company under a section of TSCA dealing with new uses of chemicals, and that Inhance’s process did not constitute a new use.</p>
<p>The court agreed that the fluorination technique Inhance uses to prevent liquids from leaking out of its plastic containers – a process that creates PFAS chemicals – does not count as a significant new use since Inhance has been using this process since 1983.</p>
<p>The EPA’s interpretation of the law “distorts TSCA’s framework and defies common sense,” the court opinion states. The agency could pursue action against Inhance under a different section of TSCA, but would be required to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the action, the court stated.</p>
<p>When asked for comment, the EPA said it is reviewing the court’s decision.</p>
<p>Inhance in a <a href="https://www.inhancetechnologies.com/news/fifth-circuit-unanimously-rules-in-favor-of-inhance-technologies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> called the court’s decision a “decisive victory” and said that it would avert disruption to “downstream industries” and related supply chain impacts.</p>
<p>The company’s continued use of its PFAS-producing fluorination technique for high-density polyethylene (HDPE) containers is “unconscionable” given that there are safe alternatives, said Kyla Bennett, director of science policy for the watchdog group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER).</p>
<p>“I suspect there will be liability lawsuits coming,” she said. “When you have this much PFAS – especially PFOA [perfluorooctanoic acid] – leaching into products, someone is going to sue.”</p>
<p>In February, PEER and the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) <a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/2024/02/epa-is-illegally-concealing-data-about-pfas-in-millions-of-plastic-containers-lawsuit-alleges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a lawsuit against the EPA</a> claiming that the agency violated TSCA by refusing to provide health and safety data about PFAS chemicals in Inhance’s plastic containers, with the EPA citing “confidential business information.”</p>
<p>There are thousands of PFAS chemicals, which do not break down naturally and contaminate waterways across the US and most Americans’ blood. Studies in both laboratory animals and humans suggest that exposure to some PFAS chemicals can <a href="https://www.epa.gov/superfund/proposed-designation-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa-and-perfluorooctanesulfonic-acid-pfos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harm various organs and systems in the human body</a>, including the heart, liver, kidneys, and immune system, according to the EPA.</p>
<p>Previous research has demonstrated that PFAS can leach from containers, including a 2023&nbsp;<a href="https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2023/03/pfas-leaches-into-ketchup-mayo-other-common-foods-elevating-health-hazards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>&nbsp;by Notre Dame University, which found PFAS in ketchup and mayonnaise, and a 2022 <a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/2022/09/epa-confirms-pfas-leach-from-shipping-containers-into-food-other-products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> by the EPA that found eight PFAS chemicals leaching from the walls of shipping containers into their liquid contents.</p>
<p>The mosquito control company Clarke Mosquito has switched to using containers with a non-fluorinated barrier protection for its pesticide. The EPA <a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EPA-Clarke-letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed the move</a> in 2021 and determined that the company chose acceptable substitutes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>There are only a few opportunities to make a living by getting good at creating tables to facilitate high-frequency math that end-users will find entertaining but will have predictable statistical properties at scale.</p><p>One of them is designing roleplaying games. Seems like an interesting topic but someone else will have to write about it. In this column, the dragon sleeps on a hoard of interchange revenue, you slay him to get credit cards rewards points, and the card issuer running the game merrily chuckles at players’ misperception that they are dragons. No, silly, they’re much realer and much richer.</p><p>A disclaimer off the top: I used to work at, and am still an advisor of, Stripe. A major portion of the Stripe economic model is charging businesses money to take payments on credit cards. Stripe’s two largest costs are paying smart people and paying interchange, and of the two, one would feel a lot better to cut.&nbsp;</p><p>Another disclaimer: Due to long-standing practice, I am (homeopathically) exposed to the common equity of financial services companies that my family uses, so that I can call up Investor Relations if I ever need to escalate a routine banking issue. My family’s main U.S. bank happens to be Chase, which is mentioned below.</p><p>Almost everybody writing about credit cards on the Internet receives some sort of spiff if you sign up after clicking through tagged links in their material. That is not my business model (people <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/memberships/">pay me to write</a> about financial infrastructure), but is probably one you want to be cognizant of every time you read about credit cards online.</p><p>As we have <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/how-credit-cards-make-money/">discussed previously</a>, credit cards have multiple different ways of earning money, but the most important one to this discussion is interchange. It is a fee, ultimately paid by the card-accepting business, which gets sliced up between various parties in the credit card ecosystem to incentivize them to put their logos in the wallets and on the phones of well-heeled customers and increase the amount they spend and the frequency with which they spend it. (In industry, we sometimes distinguish interchange—which mostly goes to the issuing bank—and scheme fees—which mostly go to the credit card brand itself—but as interchange is much larger, let’s just call them both interchange for simplicity.)</p><p>Interchange is generally a percentage fee based on the final transaction size plus optionally a per-transaction fee. You can just <a href="https://usa.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/download/merchants/visa-usa-interchange-reimbursement-fees.pdf">look up</a> the <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/us/en/documents/merchant-rates-2023-2024.pdf">rates</a>, but I strongly recommend you don’t, as you will be reduced to gibbering madness. (It took many smart people many years of work before Stripe could deterministically predict almost all interchange it was charged in advance of actually getting billed for it.)</p><p>To highlight something which is routinely surprising for non-specialists: interchange fees are not constant and fixed. They are set based on quite a few factors (<em>gibbering madness intensifies</em>) but, most prominently, based on the rank of card product you use. The more a card product is pitched to socioeconomically well-off people, the more expensive interchange is. Credit card issuers <em>explicitly and directly</em> charge the rest of the economy for the work involved in recruiting the most desirable customers.</p><p>The basic intuition underlying rewards cards as a product is that highly desirable customers have options in how they spend their money. You can directly influence them to use your rails by making those rails more lucrative, more fun, or both for the customer. And so card issuers (and the networks) compete with each other for so-called “share of wallet” by bidding with interchange.</p><p>This is not quite as sophisticated as the system of dueling robots which bids for your attention every time you open a page on the Internet with an ad on it. The bids are generally speaking pretty static and made years in advance, at or before the time a user signs up for a card product, with relatively minor adjustments made over time. Program managers at card issuers are extremely, extremely sensitive to upsetting the apple cart and churning loyal users, and so they attempt to avoid doing this except when circumstances make it unavoidable.</p><h2 id="why-isn%E2%80%99t-every-card-a-rewards-card">Why isn’t every card a rewards card?</h2><p>Different regions have ended up with different equilibria in the rewards game. In the United States, card acceptance is expensive and the rewards economy is <em>robust</em>. In Japan, card acceptance is expensive and the rewards economy is fairly muted due to—ahem—effective collusion by issuers. In Europe, card acceptance is cheap by regulatory fiat and so rewards are far less common (or commonly lucrative) than in the U.S.</p><p>Similarly, debit card rewards used to be fairly common in the United States until the Dodd-Frank Act <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/debit-cards-are-hidden-financial-infrastructure/">capped debit card interchange</a> (with a very important carveout for small banks in the Durbin amendment). When interchange is regulated, the size of the pie isn’t large enough to give the end-user of the card a tasty slice, and so they get nothing.</p><p>But we can see that, even scoping to credit cards in the United States, not every card is a rewards card. What explains why CapitalOne, for example, offers rewards for its Quicksilver card but not the Platinum Mastercard? Is <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/quicksilver">mercury</a> attempting to burnish its image after that horrible toxicity thing?</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/kjmVEJNeGC6Ndngtsm1xQVAhBv2NIrlRxdYO54jeQMZE_kCZBJLxHhZsVWj8V_V6ZBtiHz4E2c9mDKOANWjEbUobYcJsKsy8NNAR2hwxmtIf6QTU7ZCLljy8ZCyAAFAUjsCeAZqUXXIXPI8QTTpOnzU" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="574"><figcaption><span>Three of Capital One's many offerings.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Partly, this is that different users have different jobs-to-be-done for credit cards. (Many users of credit cards, potentially including some readers of this column, believe that they are the typical users of credit cards. No users of credit cards are typical.)</p><p>Credit cards are both a payment instrument and an access point for a revolving credit line. That they are an expensive way to borrow money is one of the first things said in any personal finance text. They are also one of the most accessible ways to borrow money, and that is their primary value proposition for many users, typically ones lower on the socioeconomic ladder. These users spend relatively little in a month compared to their revolving balance, which they continuously pay interest on. It trivially follows that most money on their accounts is earned via net interest margin and not from interchange.</p><p>To the extent these users notice numerically defined features of their credit cards, which is somewhat dubious, it is the headline APR (cost of credit) and their credit limits. “Starter” cards and other products aimed at this user group typically have no rewards; they instead use interchange income to “bid down” the headline APR. Interchange functions as a subsidization of the cost of credit throughout the economy by businesses which want to sell things to people who would use credit to buy things. The limit case of this is Buy Now, Pay Later, where the cost of credit is <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/buy-now-pay-later/">subsidized straight to free</a>.</p><p>The heaviest credit card <em>spenders</em>, and this fact is both uncontroversial and flies in the face of what many personal finance columnists believe, are wealthy and sophisticated. They use credit cards primarily as payment instruments. Issuers compete aggressively for their business, which is quite lucrative. This is not because they pay much in interest, because while they have higher headline APRs they only rarely revolve balances. It is because “clipping the ticket” via interchange on a high volume of transactions is an excellent business to be in.</p><p>How dramatic is this? Allow me to reproduce a graph from <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2330942">Regulating Consumer Financial Products: Evidence from Credit Cards</a>. (This paper is something of the Rosetta stone for credit card issuance as a field, both in that it is a single source for understanding a huge range of human endeavor and in that it stands in for a very large literature that nobody else reaches for to be the first citation when the Rosetta Stone already exists. If you see an unlabeled graph on Twitter about credit cards, it was probably lifted from this paper.)<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qS9_ADww9fJP_bRDLuovsaHR-yhqnHLSBlE_a2o9hri4Mc-LUX0gjHhRVabD7dAimzd7JUQGYey-GsaQghWATfLlJGDROmOAJyvFAIF_J37Qylgs0U6e2sCk6JHTWy46lsNSsFn4DaQpSdraD8H1Pjg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="626" height="488"><figcaption><span>Interchange income net of rewards expenses heavily favors high FICO users.</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, as a percentage of Average Daily Balance (ADB), even after rewards expense, interchange gets very sharply more lucrative at the top of the credit score distribution (740+, which is roughly 10% of accounts). The difference is <em>actually larger than you see here</em>, since credit lines and ADB also increase with credit score, for predictable reasons. (Rich people consume more than poor people on an absolute basis, film at eleven.)</p><h2 id="the-complexity-spectrum-of-rewards-products">The complexity spectrum of rewards products</h2><p>The simplest reward products are straight “cashback”. The issuer totals up all of one’s net purchases (all purchases less refunds) in a statement period. It then credits the user with a particular percentage of that for each statement. Either automatically or periodically at the user’s request, it transforms some of that notional banked credit into a statement credit, decreasing the amount the user needs to pay to cover their purchases in the current month.</p><p>This is as simple as it gets and we’re already necessarily handwaving away libraries worth of complexity. (For example, calculation of net purchases needs to be fairly robust against adversarial collaboration of users and merchants or the issuer gets turned into a money pump within a matter of days and will not likely be able to detect or reverse this condition for at least several weeks. This has happened many, many times. Credit card issuers, when they screw this up, lose millions of dollars and dry their tears on money.)</p><p>Anyhow, in the mists of history, that percentage started flat; typically, 1%. The math supporting this is typically fairly simple: take in 140bps as revenue, pay the user 100 bps as effectively a cost of customer acquisition, keep some portion of 40 bps as one’s margin.</p><p>In nations other than ones with effective cartel-like behavior by issuers, this equilibrium was not stable, because competing issuers would bid e.g. 1.25% cash back on the same underlying economics and compete for share of wallet. This happened extremely robustly, for decades.</p><p>One iteration of this game was cash back “categories”. Particularly post-Internet, certain cohorts of customers were most interested in the headline cashback percentage rate. Issuers began to design products which were more complicated, such as “1% cash back in principle, however, 1.5% cash back at gas stations.”</p><h2 id="a-fun-rabbit-hole-about-credit-card-acceptance">A fun rabbit hole about credit card acceptance</h2><p>A huge percentage of all credit cards are “co-branded”; they are issued by a financial institution but bear the name of some other institution which inspires a lot of loyalty. A teeny, tiny percentage of co-branded cards name e.g. tertiary educational institutions. Most name a business that a customer has an intense, ongoing relationship with: Costco, their airline of choice, etc.</p><p>Co-branded cards are <em>extremely</em> big business. One subtlety about them: a co-branded card will often have a special rewards tier for the business named on the card. This is partially that business choosing, as a marketing expense, to split some of their core margin with their most loyal customers (<em>overwhelmingly</em> the target audience for the co-branded card). But, surprisingly to many non-specialists, that is not the sole source of margin to reward cardholders with.</p><p>This is because, at the scale of the largest businesses in the world, financial services are cross-sold and structurally interconnected. There is one team in a bank (it happens to be Chase, for what it is worth) attempting to capture Starbuck’s card processing business. There is another team that wants to convince Starbucks to co-brand Chase card products. These two teams <em>can talk to each other</em> prior to making proposals to Starbucks.</p><p>And so, without knowing anything about the payments industry, you can speculate with a very high degree of confidence that Starbucks has received a complicated spreadsheet saying what Chase will charge it for every conceivable type of credit and debit card that wants a latte. A prominent negotiated line on that spreadsheet includes, effectively, a major discount for “on us” transactions: when Chase’s left hand needs to move money from Chase’s right hand because someone wants to pay Starbucks money for their Starbucks using their Starbucks-branded money. (This is easy to conflate with, and is separate from, Starbucks’ extremely impressive stored-value product. <em>That</em> probably mostly <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/chase-to-sunset-starbucks-credit-card-convert-users-to-freedom-cards">cannibalized</a> their credit product, which… alright, we have to stop the levels of digression somewhere or we’ll be here all day.)</p><p>Because “on us” is structurally cheaper (the transaction literally travels over fewer rails and therefore there are fewer “mouths to feed”) and because it is incentive compatible for all parties to subsidize these transactions, as a card program designer, you have a relatively easy time being generous with regards to this particular cell of your spreadsheet.</p><h2 id="back-to-more-complicated-cases">Back to more complicated cases</h2><p>So imagine you’re the card program designer for a card that, like most cards, does not have a particular named business happily subsidizing your users. You desire to quote a headline cashback number much higher than 1%. But you’d still like to keep some margin from interchange. What could you do?</p><p>One is you make the headline number larger but contingent on something. Say, for example, the card rebates 1.5%, but only for… bookstores. Any bookstore. For all other transactions, it is 1%.</p><p>The thing you would love with this offering is to preferentially attract people who are <em>very emotionally invested in being readers</em> and who spends <em>very little of her on-this-card wallet on books</em>. The emotional investment in the story the card offers brings the customer in; the <em>blended</em> cost to acquire the customer is closer to 1% industry standard and not to the 1.5% headline number.</p><p>Money is fungible, money is fungible, money is fungible, but many people don’t actually orient their lives as if this were true, and so the financial industry meets them where they are and then charges them for the privilege. This user values a dollar more when it is a books-dollar than when it is a food-dollar. You, a credit card program manager, can math out a way to get her as many books-dollars as she is interested in. (This is similar, in spirit, to how Bryrne Hobart <a href="https://marker.medium.com/why-the-survival-of-the-airlines-depends-on-frequent-flyer-programs-2509bd3f25d0">describes</a> airline frequent flyer programs as working. One key difference that credit card program managers have to understand: a source of advantage for frequent flyer miles as a pseudocurrency is that they can turn very-low-marginal-cost inputs, unsold seats, into very-high-perceived-marginal-benefit outputs, “free vacations”. Books-dollars may very well be worth more than a dollar to our target user here, but books-dollars are very difficult to manufacture in quantity for less than about 98ish cents.)</p><p>In principle, you could even offer <em>more</em> than your direct interchange revenue as the headline number, if you were very, very sure that your typical user would not preferentially use your card only to buy books and use a competitor’s card to buy groceries, gasoline, medicine, and similar.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, unfortunately, remember what we said about typical credit card users? That’s <em>right</em>. They don’t exist. Very many of your users will do what you want them to, and use the card in a perfectly-acceptable-but-not-exactly-optimal fashion, and you will have a blended cost very near 1% for them. And very many of your users will do exactly what you most don’t want, and use the card <em>only</em> to buy books.</p><p>This is… far less incentive compatible for you, particularly if you decided that the business of manufacturing books-dollars was so lucrative that you could rebate more than the direct interchange revenue given mix effects. These users will have blended costs very close to your headline number, not to your modeled blended costs.</p><p>These users will even band into tribes, find each other on the Internet, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/">swap tips</a> for exploiting poor, defenseless credit card program managers like yourself. The tribal elders will eventually run businesses, with names like <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/">The Points Guy</a>, which eventually get quietly acquired by very sophisticated private equity firms. Those PE firms are betting that you continue paying generous per-signup affiliate commissions to Internet properties which send you new card users. You bet you will also paying tens of millions of dollars annually to Frequently Adversely Selected New Accounts Dot Com. And Redditors bet they will continue chortling that they have pulled one over on you, because haha, you’re not nearly as good as they are at fourth grade math or keeping spreadsheets.</p><p>The biggest difference between you and a Redditor is not ability to do fourth grade math or ability to do spreadsheets. Redditors are frequently <em>sophisticated</em> with their spreadsheets; many of them could clearly earn three orders of magnitude more from the financial industry if they stopped thinking that the right way to monetize spreadsheet skill was in gaming credit card signup bonuses.</p><p>The biggest difference is that you’re optimizing <em>over portfolios, over time</em> and Redditors are largely playing in single player mode (and frequently over short horizons). You only care about single or dual player mode to the extent that you avoid obviously degenerate offerings where adverse selecting single players quickly dominate your entire book of business. Which is <em>very much a risk</em>, which is why the bank has smart people like you keeping spreadsheets.</p><p>The Redditors think failure modes for the bank sound like <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/david-philipps-pudding-guy-travel-deals_n_577c9397e4b0a629c1ab35a7">pudding guy</a>. Pudding guy, was, of course, one of the highest-ROI ad buys in the history of capitalism.</p><h2 id="further-refinements-in-cat-and-mouse-games">Further refinements in cat and mouse games</h2><p>But, just like lotteries have to keep reskinning the random number generators or the games get stale and ticket sales go down, credit card program managers have to periodically shake things up for something to cut through their adversaries’ built-in distribution networks and massive, massive marketing budgets.</p><p>One innovation, now 20+ years old, was a <em>rotating</em> favored category for cash-back. So instead of being 1.5% for bookstores 1% all else, it would be 1.5% for groceries in Q1, for gas in Q2, etc etc.</p><p>The theory behind this was pretty simple: many customers attracted by the headline number could be brought in the door by it but would be fairly inattentive after a card was their new “top of wallet” (the default card for spending). Over time, a combination of inattentiveness, changing willingness to spend time playing the game, and rewards caps would bring the portfolio’s cost of rewards close to the baseline and not to the headline reward number.</p><p>If for some reason playing this game interests you, one prominent product is called the Chase Freedom card. It should not be an attractive product for you, given plausible assumptions about the readership of this column, but it is an attractive <em>enough</em> product that probably millions of Americans use it.</p><h2 id="giving-the-customer-more-choices-more-frequently">Giving the customer more choices more frequently</h2><p>If you were hypothetically to have spent the last few years dining with relatively well-off people in SFBA, when it came time to pay for dinner you’d see two credit card products with a combined 90%+ share: Chase Sapphire Reserve (CSR) and an interchangeable American Express card. This, ahem, includes many diners who are professionally connected to upstart payment methods.</p><p>American Express, for a very long time, had an almost mortal lock on the top end of the credit card market. Chase attempted to disrupt that in 2016 by <em>very overtly</em> attempting to buy away their core customer. You can read lots in other places about the original promotion, generally tsk-tsking about how absurdly lucrative it was for customers and how it caused Chase to have a (temporary) loss associated with their cards business. Personally, I think it was one of the most interesting strategic moves in the last 20 years of retail banking, but a full essay on that would require some other-than-public knowledge as to the size of the tsunami that happened after it.</p><p>One thing that is public but not well appreciated: Chase didn’t just <em>decide</em> to create an extremely lucrative-for-the-customer offering out of the goodness of their hearts and out of their own P&amp;L. No, they <em>pitched Visa on this idea</em>. For too long, Visa, you have watched your competitor American Express outcompete every issuer in the Visa system for the best wallets in the world. They can do that because they can afford to, because American Express charges systematically higher interchange rates than Visa does even at its topmost tier. Visa, you should <em>create a new tier </em>where your not-exactly-chosen champions can try to spend those interchange dollars to give American Express a run for their money.</p><p>And, lo, Visa <em>did</em> create a new tier. You can expose yourself to gibbering madness if you want to know what the name for it is. But Chase got Visa to authorize Chase charging almost the entire economy more for credit card acceptance with the specific goal of outcompeting American Express for the most lucrative highest-monthly-spend virtually-never-revolve-a-balance credit card users.</p><p>That was <em>part</em> of what made the numbers work.</p><p>Another part is that the CSR offers a fairly complicated rewards scheme, with a lot of opportunities for people to pick things which feel great but are not optimal. For example, Chase will let you cash out CSR points on a 1:1 basis at either Amazon or Apple, integrated directly into the checkout flows. Those <em>feel great</em>.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/riPQOFhy7wsVEZKEXS-UpuK1fy3wAavV5l0PQKeo7Jq0gr7rBvL-ILrpQNRAonyXBBTi9fCTN_QMGOOzBeP8TMr0J9Dug9mKN59V9qmndT627LMxumoFQQ7TQFoIAtKz8goBElpBM8f-hkuh_p7oTvk" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1206" height="846"><figcaption><span>This image has been edited to remove private information and to highlight, in red, the offering.</span></figcaption></figure><p>People <em>love</em> Amazon and Apple and they love free Amazon and free Apple even more. This is true even among a portion of very sophisticated, wealthy, numerate CSR users, who love this idea so much they click a button designed for suckers.</p><p>Why is that a sucker’s checkout button? Because CSR also includes a feature called Pay Yourself Back which in the past prominently, and today a bit… less prominently, lets you cash out rewards at better than 1:1. You get a 25% bonus if you Pay Yourself Back by nominating past transactions at grocery stores: 10,000 points gets you $125 in statement credits if you are willing to do a trivial amount of clicking to show Chase $125+ in spend at grocery stores.</p><p>Stating the obvious: Chase knows what a computer is and does not require you to actually identify your purchases at grocery stores. This is a product decision to both a) force you to use your card at grocery stores and b) force yourself to say “Chase is getting me free groceries! How nice of them!” on a transaction-by-transaction level once a month to use your card optimally.</p><p>There are many, many other sucker buttons.</p><p>But, because the card is fundamentally targeted at rich, sophisticated people, Chase really does pay out a shedload of rewards. The 3% headline rate for travel and dining plus the 25% Pay Yourself Back kicker means there is a sustained and trivial pathway to get 375 bps out, which is one of the very, very, very few places in the industry where there is a sustained, trivial, uncapped way to get out more than the direct cost of interchange.</p><p>Why does this persist? Partly it is due to the standard credit card portfolio strategy: every time someone uses a CSR on Amazon (and not e.g. the Amazon rewards card, also from Chase) or uses CSR points to buy <a href="https://www.apple.com/">high-margin white plastic</a>, Chase’s contribution margin for the portfolio goes up, and at scale <em>quite a large percentage </em>of customers do this.</p><p>Partly it is due to Chase thinking that they’ll just <em>be so good</em> for their target customer that their target customer <em>will not bother playing the game optimally. </em>That would require the customer carefully maintaining a portfolio of credit relationships and having seven cards saved on their iPhone and not, simply, the CSR.</p><p>Partly it is due to the really interesting strategic reasons for having CSR available: to a much larger degree than American Express, Chase is a diversified financial services empire. The CSR was effectively designed as a wedge product to get something Chase branded into the hands of affluent up-and-coming young urban professionals, with the goal of eventually getting them to not move just their wallet but their entire financial existence (and potentially their current-or-future <em>entities’</em> financial existences) onto Chase.</p><p>The Sapphire mini-brand was so loved that they reused it for a bog-standard premium checking account. (It was named the Chase Sapphire Premium Checking Account, in a decision which probably consumed several tens of millions of dollars of professional effort, and I mean that absolutely descriptively and not as a criticism. I was not in <em>that</em> meeting… but I’ve been in that <em>kind</em> of meeting. Those that have been in it know that it is not in any way a single-meeting single-decisionmaker sort of call.)</p><h2 id="more-directions-to-go-in">More directions to go in</h2><p>The blessing and curse of essays is that they have to end somewhere, and then pick up anew somewhere else. Hopefully the above gives you a bit more context on what is in your wallet.</p><div><p>In the future, we'll likely discuss the complicated iterated game played by the credit card networks and the rest of society regarding interchange rates, how there are high-interchange-high-reward equilibria and low-interchange-low-reward equilibria, the recent settlement where the networks agreed to temporarily decrease interchange, and other topics. </p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/">https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39928558">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Anyone who has had to deal with HTML emails on a technical level has probably reached the point where they wanted to quit their job or just set fire to all the mail clients due to their inconsistent implementations. But HTML emails are not just a source of frustration, they can also be a serious security risk.</p><p>Imagine you receive an email forwarded by your manager asking you to wire a large sum of money to a bank account. Of course, you have heard of CEO fraud, so you double-check that the email really comes from your manager. It does, and it may even be cryptographically signed – if you do that in your company. However, you are still not convinced, so you call your manager to ensure that the email is legit. He confirms, so you transfer the money.</p><p>Yet this would be the end of the article if this wasn’t a <em>scam</em>. So what went wrong?</p><h2 id="kobold-letters">Kobold letters</h2><img src="https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/kobold_letter.png" alt="Kobold holding a letter by oira.art"><p>The email your manager received and forwarded to you was something completely innocent, such as a potential customer asking a few questions. All that email was supposed to achieve was being forwarded to you. However, the moment the email appeared in your inbox, it changed. The innocent pretext disappeared and the real phishing email became visible. A phishing email you <em>had</em> to trust because you knew the sender and they even confirmed that they had forwarded it to you.</p><p>This attack is possible because most email clients allow CSS to be used to style HTML emails. When an email is forwarded, the position of the original email in the DOM usually changes, allowing for CSS rules to be selectively applied only when an email has been forwarded.</p><p>An attacker can use this to include elements in the email that appear or disappear depending on the context in which the email is viewed. Because they are usually invisible, only appear in certain circumstances, and can be used for all sorts of mischief, I’ll refer to these elements as <em>kobold letters</em>, after the elusive sprites of mythology.</p><p>This affects all types of email clients and webmailers that support HTML email. So pretty much all of them. For the moment, however, I’ll focus on selected clients to demonstrate the problem, and leave it to others (or future me) to extend the principle to other clients.</p><h2 id="thunderbird">Thunderbird</h2><hr><p>This issue was reported to Mozilla on 05.03.2024.<br>The planned release date and a draft of the following section were communicated to Mozilla on 20.03.2024.<br>Possible mitigations have been discussed but will not be implemented until a later date.</p><hr><p>Exploiting this in Thunderbird is fairly straightforward. Thunderbird wraps emails in <code>&lt;div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-unicode"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> and leaves them otherwise unchanged, making it a good example to demonstrate the principle. When forwarding an email, the quoted email will be enclosed in another <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>, moving it down one level in the DOM.</p><p>Taking this into account leads to the following proof of concept:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>

</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>html</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The email contains two paragraphs, one that has no styling and should always be visible, and one that is hidden with <code>display: none;</code>. This is how it looks when the email is displayed in Thunderbird:</p><figure><img src="https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/kobold-moz-1.png" alt="A simple email containing the sentence &quot;This text is always visible.&quot;"><figcaption><h4>This email may look harmless...</h4></figcaption></figure><p>As expected, only the paragraph “<em>This text is always visible.</em>” is shown. However, when we forward the email, the second paragraph becomes suddenly visible. Albeit only to the new recipient – the original recipient who forwarded the email remains unaware.</p><figure><img src="https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/kobold-moz-2.png" alt="The sentence &quot;This text will only appear after forwarding.&quot; is now visible."><figcaption><h4>...until it has been forwarded.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Because we know exactly where each element will be in the DOM relative to <code>.moz-text-html</code>, and because we control the CSS, we can easily hide and show any part of the email, changing the content completely. If we style the kobold letter as an overlay, we can not only affect the forwarded email, but also (for example) replace any comments your manager might have had on the original mail, opening up even more opportunities for phishing.</p><h2 id="outlook-on-the-web">Outlook on the web</h2><hr><p>This issue was reported to Microsoft on 05.03.2024.<br>The planned release date and a draft of the following section were communicated to Microsoft on 20.03.2024.<br>The report was marked as closed by Microsoft on 26.03.204 after deciding not to take any immediate action.</p><hr><p>In <em>Outlook on the web</em> (OWA) the situation is slightly more complicated, as it is a webmailer. Emails are contained in <code>&lt;div class="rps_78fa"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>, but the exact class name will change. To prevent the CSS of emails to affect the style of the webmailer, Outlook modifies the email by prefixing all ids and classes with <code>x_</code> and adjust the CSS accordingly.</p><p>Considering all this, we get the following proof of concept:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>

As we don’t have an easily recognizable anchor point, this can become a nuisance when trying to create a kobold letter that works for multiple clients at the same time.</p><h2 id="gmail">Gmail</h2><hr><p>This issue was reported to Google on 05.03.2024.<br>The planned release date and a draft of the following section were communicated to Google on 20.03.2024.</p><hr><p>So far, we could define kobold letters as elements that use CSS selectors to be shown or hidden depending on the context in which the email is displayed. By this definition, Gmail is technically not vulnerable to kobold letters because it strips all styling from the email when forwarding it.</p><p>This allows for an even simpler – albeit more limited – attack: It is now sufficient to hide the kobold letter with CSS, and it will automatically appear when forwarded. However, this does not allow the opposite behaviour, where the kobold letter is visible in the original email and invisible in the forwarded email.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>

This would at least allow the sender to detect the attack before forwarding the email.</p><h2 id="prior-work">Prior work</h2><p>The fact that this is possible in one way or another is neither surprising nor new.

This hopefully will help raise awareness of the risks associated with HTML emails and contribute to the discussion of what trade-offs are acceptable to mitigate these risks.</p><h2 id="outlook-not-the-software">Outlook (not the software)</h2><p>Users can mitigate kobold letters by disabling HTML email altogether or viewing it in a restricted mode (e.g. “plain HTML” in Thunderbird). For email clients, it is more difficult to implement a mitigation, as preventing the use of <code>&lt;style&gt;</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> would fix this, but would also break a lot of existing solutions in the email ecosystem. An implementation like the one Google already uses for Gmail could be a compromise that allows for stylized corporate newsletters while limiting the risks of HTML email.</p><p>Unfortunately, for the foreseeable future, it is sadly not realistic to expect email clients to implement robust mitigation.

<p>Following a successful pilot project, the northern German federal state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleswig-Holstein">Schleswig-Holstein</a> has decided to move from Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office to Linux and LibreOffice (and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">free and open source software</a>) on the 30,000 PCs used in the local government. As reported on the homepage of the Minister-President:</p>
<blockquote><p>Independent, sustainable, secure: Schleswig-Holstein will be a digital pioneer region and the first German state to introduce a digitally sovereign IT workplace in its state administration. With a cabinet decision to introduce the open-source software LibreOffice as the standard office solution across the board, the government has given the go-ahead for the first step towards complete digital sovereignty in the state, with further steps to follow.</p></blockquote>
<p>The term <strong>digital sovereignty</strong> is very important here. If a public administration uses proprietary, closed software that can’t be studied or modified, it is very difficult to know what happens to users’ data:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have no influence on the operating processes of such [proprietary] solutions and the handling of data, including a possible outflow of data to third countries. As a state, we have a great responsibility towards our citizens and companies to ensure that their data is kept safe with us and we must ensure that we are always in control of the IT solutions we use and that we can act independently as a state.</p></blockquote>
<p>This follows on from the finding by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) that the <a hrefe="https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2024/03/29/use-of-microsoft-365-breaches-data-protection-law-in-eu/">European Commission’s use of Microsoft 365 breaches data protection law</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, there is this question: <strong>Why should local governments use taxpayers’ money to buy proprietary, closed software from a single vendor?</strong> With LibreOffice and free software, administrations have much more choice <a href="https://www.documentfoundation.org/certified-developers/">where to get the software and support</a>, and can fund local developers to make improvements. In addition, local governments can maintain full control of the software, study its source code, make changes they require and deploy it entirely on their own infrastructure. <a href="https://publiccode.eu/en/">Learn more about “Public Money, Public Code”.</a></p>
<p>So we welcome the decision in Schleswig-Holstein to move its IT administration to free and open source software, for all the benefits it brings, both for the local government and the almost three million citizens of the state.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/keeping-your-data-from-apple-is-harder-than-expected">https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/keeping-your-data-from-apple-is-harder-than-expected</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39927657">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><strong>Participants weren’t able to stop data sharing in any of the apps</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">In practice, protecting privacy on an Apple device requires persistent and expert clicking on each app individually. Apple's help falls short.</p>
<p dir="ltr">‘The online instructions for restricting data access are very complex and confusing, and the steps required are scattered in different places. There’s no clear direction on whether to go to the app settings, the central settings – or even both,’ says&nbsp;<strong>Amel Bourdoucen</strong>, a doctoral researcher at Aalto.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition, the instructions didn’t list all the necessary steps or explain how collected data is processed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The researchers also demonstrated these problems experimentally. They interviewed users and asked them to try changing the settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">‘It turned out that the participants weren’t able to prevent any of the apps from sharing their data with other applications or the service provider,’ Bourdoucen says.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finding and adjusting privacy settings also took a lot of time. ‘When making adjustments, users don't get feedback on whether they’ve succeeded. They then get lost along the way, go backwards in the process and scroll randomly, not knowing if they've done enough,’ Bourdoucen says.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the end, Bourdoucen explains, the participants were able to take one or two steps in the right direction, but none succeeded in following the whole procedure to protect their privacy.</p>
<h2><strong>Running out of options</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">If preventing data sharing is difficult, what does Apple do with all that data?&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s not possible to be sure based on public documents, but Lindqvist says it’s possible to conclude that the data will be used to train the artificial intelligence system behind Siri and to provide personalised user experiences, among other things.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many users are used to seamless multi-device interaction, which makes it difficult to move back to a time of more limited data sharing. However, Apple could inform users much more clearly than it does today, says Lindqvist. The study lists a number of detailed suggestions to clarify privacy settings and improve guidelines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For individual apps, Lindqvist says that the problem can be solved to some extent by opting for a third-party service. For example, some participants in the study had switched from Safari to Firefox.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lindqvist can’t comment directly on how Google's Android works in similar respects, as no one has yet done a similar mapping of its apps. But past research on third-party apps does not suggest that Google is any more privacy-conscious than Apple.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So what can be learned from all this – are users ultimately facing an almost impossible task?</p>
<p dir="ltr">‘Unfortunately, that's one lesson,’ says Lindqvist.</p></div></div>]]></description>

I found a solution that works surprisingly well using GPT4ALL.<p>I found GPT4ALL (<a href="https://gpt4all.io/" rel="nofollow">https://gpt4all.io</a>) to have a nice-enough GUI, and it runs reasonably quickly on my M1 MacBook Air with 8Gb of ram, and it can be setup to be a completely local solution - not sending your data to the Goliaths.</p><p>GPT4ALL has an option to access local documents, via the Sbert text embedding model (RAG).</p><p>My specific results have been as follows; using the Nous Hermes 2 Mistral DPO and Sbert - I indexed 153 days of my daily writing (most days I write between 2 and 3 thousand words).</p><p>Asking a simple question like "what are the challenges faced by the author?" provides remarkable, almost spooky results (which I won't share here) - which in my opinion are spot-on regarding my own challenges over that the period - and Sbert provides references to which documents it used to generate the answer. Options are available to reference an arbitrary number of documents, however the default is 10. Ideally I'd like to have it reference all 153 documents in the query - I'm not sure if it's a ram or a token issue, however increasing the value of documents referenced has resulted in machine lock-ups.</p><p>Anyhow - that's my experience - hope it's helpful to someone.

<p>My younger child’s MacBook Pro was unsalvageably full. Only a complete wipe would suffice—and then Time Machine failed us.</p>
<p>I love my children, but they do sometimes forget what I do for a living: answer questions and write books about the most troubling problems people have with their Macs, iPhones, and iPads. But when something goes truly wrong, they suddenly remember, “Hey, Dad might know how to fix it!”</p>
<p>So it happened that my younger asked for my help when their M2 MacBook Pro’s storage filled  up while they were downloading a (legitimate, purchased) game using Steam. No problem! I could just empty the trash. Nope, they tried that. Well, what about finding some caches and…nope. I could just go into the Terminal and…ok, that didn’t work either.</p>
<p>Turned out, my kid had managed a neat trick, though they were not alone: they had filled macOS’s startup volume storage so full that the operating system was incapable of deleting files in any fashion. Instead of halting the massive Steam download when the drive became disastrously full, macOS  continued to write files until there was just 41K free on the drive.</p>
<p>I don’t know quite what happened. They didn’t realize their terabyte SSD was quite so filled, as they keep most of their useful files in the cloud. It was likely…er, perfectly legitimate video files. Yeah, I’m sure there was <em>no problem</em> with the copyright there. But they weren’t concerned about retaining them. They just wanted their computer to work again!</p>
<p>I have a theory about what happened. Due to our gigabit Internet connection and the size of the Steam file, macOS outstripped its ability to throttle filling storage because it was also <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102154.">making a local Time Machine snapshot</a>. The Steam file appeared monolithic to me—one giant file—but clearly not to Time Machine. macOS keeps these snapshots to provide local backups for the last 24 hours even while it’s copying files to an external or networked Time Machine destination. I don’t think macOS tracks these snapshots well, and I suspect a collision of live files on disk with the specially created snapshots.</p>
<p>I went through a succession of file deletion attempts, relying on my own knowledge and searching for similar situations in online forums:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Empty Trash:</strong> Emptying the Trash via the Finder a big “no” (File &gt; Empty Trash). “The operation can’t be completed because the disk is full.” Yes, macOS, I’m already aware of this.</li>
<li><strong>Terminal:</strong> While Terminal would launch, using the standard Unix <code>rm</code> command resulted in a similar error: “No space left on device.” All <code>rm</code> alternatives, like using the <code>find</code> command to search for very large unneeded files and adding the <code>-exec</code> option to run the <code>rm</code> command, failed too. Terminal was a bust.</li>
<li><strong>Disk Utility:</strong> Disk Utility shows Time Machine snapshots on APFS startup volumes, and you can typically select and delete these snapshots, which occupy only the amount of storage space required to contain the differences from the previous snapshot. That failed with a “no space left” error as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was time to restart to see if it would clear caches. Unfortunately, restarting left the Mac unable to start up at all. No matter what I tried, it would reach about halfway through the progress bar before failing.</p>
<p>I shifted to recoveryOS, Apple’s somewhat new name for the special disk partition in macOS that lets you run operations on the main startup volume while it’s not mounted, including Disk Utility repairs and reinstallation. From there, I hit the wall as well, as Terminal commands continued to fail with the same error.</p>
<p>I restarted again to access the Apple silicon <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/transfer-files-a-mac-apple-silicon-mchlb37e8ca7/mac">Share Disk</a> option to mount my kid’s drive on one of my Macs, hoping that over Samba (the disk-sharing protocol), I’d be able to force a deletion. No dice.</p>
<p>At this point, I shifted to stronger medicine. I had a series of Time Machine backups of their drive, including one from the previous evening, and they weren’t terribly concerned about losing data, as they have most things they care about in some kind of cloud storage. Here’s where things went pear-shaped in an entirely different direction.</p>
<p>First, I erased the drive and used macOS Recovery to reinstall Ventura, the native system with which the MacBook Pro had shipped. I then used Migration Assistant at macOS startup to access the networked Time Machine backup. In choosing what files to restore, I unchecked a number to ensure there would be plenty of storage. My kid had a lot of things they could delete, too, they said, and I could give them the Time Machine backup as a mountable drive if they needed access to files that weren’t restored later.</p>
<p>Halfway through, Ventura stalled and wouldn’t resume. I decided to upgrade to Sonoma, the version of macOS that was running at the time the Mac filled its drive. That worked fine—but the upgrade took the Mac to version 14.4, and my kid had had 14.3.1 installed. When I attempted to restore directly at startup, I was told the version different wouldn’t allow it. Now what?</p>
<p>I completed a basic Sonoma user account setup and then ran Migration Assistant. It found the networked Mac on which I manage Time Machine backups and recognized it. However, it refused to mount my child’s backup volume. No matter what I did, “Mount failed” appeared. Digging around in forums, I found that Sonoma has broken the SMB/Samba-based networking mount procedure for Time Machine restores, and no one had found a solution. This appears to still be the case in 14.4.</p>

<p>Because my younger only needed their apps and certain files, we both gave up at that point. I copied their Time Machine backup onto an external 1 TB SSD through this straightforward method:</p>
<ol>
<li>On my Mac, which handles networked backups, I double-clicked the disk image for their computer and then entered their Time Machine volume password. (I always set a networked password for Time Machine volumes.)</li>
<li>I found the disk icon with the latest timestamp and copied this to an empty 1 TB drive.</li>
<li>Ejecting it from my Mac, I connected it to their stub account on their MacBook Pro and copied over the necessary files, including the contents of most of their home directory folders, excluding some large downloads and unneeded (ahem) video files.</li>
</ol>
<p>I gave them the drive so that they could restore anything else they needed if it were missing, and we’ll probably keep it on hand for a while to make sure nothing is missing.</p>
<p>This put them back in business, but I missed two tricks that I could have tried to make things easier:</p>
<ul>
<li>I could have unmounted the Time Machine backup drive from my computer I use for other computers on the network. (I have a separate drive I use for local Time Machine backups from that computer’s startup volume.) Then I could have connected that directly to my kid’s computer and it likely would have become available as a Migration Assistant starting point.</li>
<li>Failing that, I could have copied the virtual disk from the Time Machine disk image I mounted on my Mac of their backup so that the external 1 TB drive I was transferring “looked” like a Mac source volume. I’m not sure if this would have worked, but I didn’t try it. Then, I could have potentially restored directly from it using Migration Assistant.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m sorry I didn’t try the above, but I had already invested a cumulative couple of hours of my time and over a day of effort while my kid was unconcerned about a perfect directory-to-directory recovery.</p>
<p>I hate to think what people without decades of Mac experience do when confronted with systemic, cascading failures like this when I felt helpless despite what I thought I knew and all the answers I searched for and found on forums.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container" itemprop="articleBody"><p>By replacing <code>pip</code> with <code>uv</code> in our production images, our build pipeline (and therefore releasing a new version) is a lot faster.
<code>Uv</code> is an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver written in Rust. It is developed by <a href="https://astral.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astral</a> and it's open source. Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p><p>In the following table, you can see that we can save around 5 hours of execution time on each build.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Arch</th><th>Pip</th><th>UV</th><th>Savings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>aarch64</td><td>1h 24m 53s</td><td>5m 18s</td><td>~1h 20m</td></tr><tr><td>armhf</td><td>1h 52m 20s</td><td>6m 2s</td><td>~1h 46m</td></tr><tr><td>armv7</td><td>1h 26m 43s</td><td>5m 28s</td><td>~1h 21m</td></tr><tr><td>amd64</td><td>22m 10s</td><td>3m 20s</td><td>~19m</td></tr><tr><td>i386</td><td>17m 37s</td><td>3m 11s</td><td>~14m</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On average, we run the build pipeline 43 times as we create</p><ul><li>31 nightlies (one nightly per day)</li><li>7 beta releases</li><li>5 stable releases (including patch ones)</li></ul><p>In total, we save around 215 hours per month.
With this massive improvement, we can now ship hotfixes even faster, as the pipeline to ship a new version now takes around 20 minutes instead of 2.5 hours.</p><p>The 215 monthly saved execution hours can be used by other jobs and make the CI experience for all developers and our community better.
By replacing <code>pip</code> with <code>uv</code>, we improve our sustainability by using fewer resources to build our images.</p><p><strong>A big thank you to Astral for developing this amazing tool.</strong>
Please check out their <a href="https://astral.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> and products as they offer, for example, a "lightning" fast linter/formatter for Python too.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Logik is an open source FPGA toolchain that fully automates converting RTL to bits, including synthesis, placement, routing, bitstream generation, and analysis. Users enter design sources, constraints, and compile options through a simple <a href="https://github.com/siliconcompiler/siliconcompiler/">SiliconCompiler</a> Python API. Once setup is complete, automated compilation can be initiated with a single line run command.</p>

<p dir="auto">Logik supports most of the features you would expect in a commercial proprietary FPGA tool chain.</p>

<p>We did it! After two years of hard work we hold in our hands hard proof that the incredible team at Terraform can make synthetic natural gas from sunlight and air, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/01/terraform-industries-converted-electricity-and-air-into-synthetic-natural-gas/">reported in TechCrunch</a>.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday March 27, 2024, we commissioned our integrated power-to-gas demonstrator. The system converts electricity and air into affordable fossil-free natural gas using proprietary subsystems, developed in-house, for hydrogen electrolysis, direct air capture, and methanation. This marks a major milestone in the technical and commercial development of our technology and another step on the path to our positive vision for the future where everyone has access to plentiful cheap, reliable energy, harvested from renewable carbon and power, with lower ecological and climate impact.</p>

<p>Our core innovation is the utilization of proven and well-understood industrial processes implemented within innovatively simple and cost-effective proprietary technology systems adapted to the daily variations of renewable power for producing cheap sustainable natural gas from sunlight and air. These design and process innovations are responsible for driving production costs down for both their green hydrogen and atmospheric CO2 capture to levels previously thought unattainable. Combining super-cheap solar power with low-cost green hydrogen and CO2 capture are the key to producing commodity-grade electro-fuel alternatives at competitive commodity prices.</p>



<p>Our elite team of engineers have made significant progress towards our <a href="https://terraformindustries.wordpress.com/2022/07/24/terraform-industries-whitepaper/">stated goals</a> of <a href="https://terraformindustries.wordpress.com/2023/08/16/how-to-produce-green-hydrogen-for-1-kg/">radically cheaper green hydrogen</a> and direct air capture CO2. We follow a simple playbook. Adapt a known industrial process to ultra-cheap solar power by a) radically reducing capex to compensate for lowered utilization and b) developing processes that are robust to variations in power due to weather, as well as diurnal and seasonal power shifts. </p>



<p>First, our innovative electrolyzer converts cheap solar power into hydrogen with current production costs at less than $2.50 per kg of H2. How? To first order, our electrolyzer capex costs &lt;$100/kW, and we’re currently baselining solar PV DC electricity at $20/MWh. There is no hand waving about economies of scale or subsidies here, though we are eligible for the full IRA 45V green hydrogen tax credit, worth $3/kg-H2.</p>

<p>Second, the proprietary direct air capture (DAC) system concentrates CO2 in the atmosphere today for less than $250 per ton. How? Our DAC capex costs &lt;$600/T-year-CO2. Like the electrolyzer, this represents a substantial improvement on the state of the art. </p>

<p>Finally, our in-house multistage Sabatier chemical reactor ingests hydrogen and CO2, producing pipeline grade natural gas, which is &gt;97% methane (CH4). Our reactor uses no rare or expensive catalysts nor cherry-picked data – it handily operates for hours in steady state. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://terraformindustries.wordpress.com/2023/06/26/the-terraformer-mark-one/">Terraformer combines these three subsystems into one modular chemical plant</a>, skid-mounted for deployment alongside a solar PV array.</p>



<p><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/02lIRpIYWSiyqD9_Y0Qmp6NCgH4EON-JADudHwRvHC3GCnWb6shToLkUM74ahZHA0uKRkbXsRL_IqxsNIZ8HCmYoHOBBFf-LF-6cmE19bd1mP_6rjqGJThH9jDt6O1LochHxs1arX3zYrgxyOqBQzLQ" width="624" height="391"></p>



<p>It is particularly cool to develop and build all three of our sub-systems in our castle in Burbank, CA, right across from the long-time home of the fabled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works">Lockheed Skunk Works</a>. In-house production &amp; manufacturing enables faster iteration, lowered supply chain risk, and the successful demonstration of the complete techno-economic model for producing cost-effective fossil-free natural gas.</p>



<p>While I generally prefer understatement, it is hard to overstate the significance of this achievement, which has been two years in the making. Humanity today depends on traditional oil and gas to provide them with a cheap and easily transportable source of energy-dense hydrocarbons, to the tune of 100 million barrels per day, which unfortunately also generates ~50 gigatons per year of CO2 emissions. </p>



<p>The Terraformer unlocks an industrial-scale source of renewable hydrocarbons that breaks our dependence on fossil fuels and lays the foundation for another century of spectacular growth, broad-based wealth creation, and global environmental restoration.</p>



<p>What’s next? We’re taking reservations for our first production Terraformers, and ramping production to meet demand. </p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h4>Sixty-Five-Oh-What?</h4><p>

The 6502 is the famous processor found at the core of such influential computer systems as the Apple ][, the Commodore PET, the Atari 400 and 800 home video game consoles, the BBC Micro, and the Tamagotchi digital pet. Slight variations of it were found in the Commodore 64, the Atari 2600, and the original Nintendo Entertainment System.

<h4>What's with the name and capitalization?</h4><p>

MOnSter 6502 is a play on the original manufacturer and device name (MOS 6502) as well as acknowledging its large size.


</p><h4>How big is it?</h4><p>
It's a four layer circuit board, 12 × 15 inches, 0.1 inches thick, with surface mount components on both sides.


</p><h4>How many components are there on the board?</h4><p>

In total, there are 4769 components on the board. There are 3218 transistors and 1019 resistors that comprise the "functional" part of the 6502. 
In addition to these, there are also LEDs sprinkled throughout that indicate the values of various control lines, registers, and status bits, as well as additional transistors and resistors (not counted in those "functional" totals) that are necessary to drive those LEDs.
</p><p>

As of the second revision of the board, the design statistics are as follows:
</p><ul>
<li>Components that correspond 1:1 with transistors in the original 6502:
<ul>
<li>Total active transistors: 4237</li>
<ul><li>3218 enhancement mode n-channel MOSFETs
<ul><li>2588 discrete</li>
<li>630 located on 164 quad transistor array chips (26 of these 656 transistors are not used)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>1019 resistors (the original 6502 used depletion mode MOSFETs in place of resistors)</li>
</ul></ul></li>

<li>998 Additional parts present only in the MOnSter 6502:
<ul>
<li>313 LEDs (The first revision board, shown in the video, has only 167 LEDs)</li>
<li>270 extra MOSFETs for driving the LEDs</li>
<li>20 filter capacitors</li>
<li>32 bus capacitors</li>
<li>2 zero-ohm jumpers for net tie reasons</li>
<li>8 current limit resistors</li>
<li>314 resistors for the LEDs</li>
<li>36 diodes for ESD protection</li>
<li>2 jacks for 5 V power: main and alternate location</li>
<li>1 rectangular connector for the 40-pin "ICR" ribbon cable</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Total parts: 4769</li>
</ul>

The first full-scale prototype was publicly demonstrated at the <a href="http://makerfaire.com/maker/entry/55149/">2016 Bay Area Maker Faire</a>. We brought it up to the stages of successfully running various programs in assembly,  <a href="https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/739639901826605056">BASIC</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/828098079962210304">Forth</a>. Our second prototype, a year later, fixed a few issues that we encountered when bringing up the first version (removing all of the patch wires) but also added over 100 additional LEDs, including one for every instruction decode line on the 6502's decode ROM.

</p><p>
Since the 6502 is just a microprocessor (CPU), about half of our work on the project (and most of our work since the first prototype) has actually been building up the capabilities around this processor — adding interfaces for a keyboard, <a href="https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/771131509784719361">monitor</a>, and programming — so that you can actually use it. In the process of doing so, we have built up a single-board computer (a tiny motherboard) that uses the 6502 as its CPU, such that you can either use a socketed (vintage) 6502 IC, or the MOnSter 6502 through a cable. 
</p><p>
More, we have been working towards a public launch, currently planned for mid-2023, building the MOnSter into <a href="https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2019/monster-in-a-box/">a shadowbox 
enclosure</a> complete with a tiny hidden "motherboard" that the CPU sits in, so that it can run demonstration programs even without being plugged into a separate computer.


</p><h4>Does it run at the full speed of an original 6502 chip?</h4><p>
No; it's relatively slow. The MOnSter 6502 runs at about 1/20th the speed of the original, thanks to the much larger capacitance of the design. The maximum reliable clock rate is around 50 kHz. The primary limit to the clock speed is the gate capacitance of the MOSFETs that we are using, which is much larger than the capacitance of the MOSFETs on an original 6502 die.


</p><h4>Can you hook it up inside an Apple ][ and run Oregon Trail?</h4><p>
No, not directly. It's neat to think of plugging the MOnSter 6502's <del>in-circuit emulator (ICE)</del> in-circuit replica (ICR) cable directly into a socket inside an Apple ][, but that wouldn't actually work. The Apple ][ design relies on a number of clever tricks that derive timing for video generation and peripheral control from the main clock signal — all of which will fail if you need to run at a slower speed.
</p><p>
There are some ways to get around limitations like these. For example, the <a href="http://www.brielcomputers.com/wordpress/?cat=17">Replica I</a> computer (an Apple I clone) uses a Parallax Propeller chip to emulate a system clock and some of the timing-dependent external processing. The <a href="http://www.8bitforce.com/projects/retroshield/">RetroShield</a> 6502 is another example of a software-implemented Apple I compatible that can use a hardware 6502 processor. We are most excited about the new <a href="http://apple1.smartykit.org/">SmartyKit Apple I replica</a>, which is specifically designed to run at a slower clock speed. You should also be able to put a slower clock into <a href="https://eater.net/6502">Ben Eater's 6502 computer</a> in order to "plug in" the MOnSter.


</p><h4>So what can it do?</h4><p>
It can act as an in-circuit hardware emulator for a 6502 integrated circuit, in any circuit that can run at a relatively low clock rate. We're currently running it on a custom 6502 development board (the single-board computer that we mentioned earlier) and doing things like running running BASIC, much as you would on an Apple ][. We have also plugged it into the CPU sockets of a few people's homebrew 6502 computers (including the <a href="http://commodorez.com/cactus.html">Cactus</a> and <a href="http://www.8bitforce.com/projects/retroshield/">RetroShield 6502</a>) that could run at variable clock speed. We are interested in finding other applications where it could be substituted for an original 6502.


</p><h4>How long did it take?</h4><p>
This has been a ~8 year project, thus far. The primary design work was done over six months, from <a href="https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/617108015091548160">July 3</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/671934447168557056">December 1</a>, 2015. There have been several stages of reviews and revisions since then, and a few generations of the "motherboards" that we have run the MOnSter in.



</p><h4>Is it truly a "discrete 6502?"</h4><p>
Not in the strictest sense. However, it really depends upon how picky you would like to be. 
</p><p>
The MOnSter 6502 uses the original dynamic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMOS_logic">NMOS logic</a> design, implemented at the individual transistor level. 
</p><p>
Dynamic NMOS requires a large number of "transmission gate" transistors that are used to switch currents. For various technical reasons, only a 4-terminal MOSFET can make an effective NMOS transmission gate. Unfortunately, individually packaged 4-terminal MOSFETs are no longer commercially available. However, they do still make arrays of 2 or 4 MOSFETs on a single chip with a separate substrate pin. We used the 4-pack version — These are the quad transistor array chips that we mentioned earlier. 
</p><p>
Because these transistors do share a pin, there are (strictly speaking) integrated circuits in the MOnSter 6502. However, one might credibly argue that it is a discrete transistor design since there are not (for example) any logic gate chips in the circuit.


</p><h4>What are those little gold squares around the border?</h4><p>

The 40 square pads around the edge of the circuit board correspond to the 40 pins of the original 6502 integrated circuit. They're also designed to look like the wire-bond contact pads on an IC die — where the IC would be physically connected inside (for example) a 40-pin DIP package. These pads are functional contact points on the MOnSter 6502; you can hook up to them with alligator clips to probe or communicate with any pin.


</p><h4>How much power does it draw?</h4><p>

It draws up to roughly 2 A at 5 V, or 10 W total. The LEDs are a significant part of the power consumption.

</p>

<h4>Can I see it in person?</h4><p>

Due to the ongoing pandemic we haven't been taking the MOnSter to shows lately, but you can come visit us <i>by appointment</i> at Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories in Sunnyvale California for a demonstration. Please <a href="https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/contact">use our contact form</a> to ask about available demonstration times.

</p><h4>How big is the MOnSter 6502 compared to the original 6502 die?</h4><p>
The original device was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502#Technical_description">153 × 168 mils (3.9 × 4.3 mm) or an area of 16.6 square mm</a>. Given that ours is 12 × 15 inches, that makes it about 7000 times actual size. 

</p><h4>How big would the MOnSter 6502 be if it were made with through-hole parts instead of surface mount parts?</h4><p>
About 19 square feet (1.7 square meters).


</p><h4>How big would a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000">68000 microprocessor</a> be at the scale of the MOnSter 6502?</h4><p>
Also about 19 square feet (1.7 square meters).

</p><h4>Are you going to make a 68000 next?</h4><p>
No.


</p><h4>How big would a modern CPU be at this scale?</h4><p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A8X">Apple A8X</a>, found in the iPad Air 2, contains about 3 billion transistors. (This is comparable to the number of transistors in modern desktop computer CPUs as well.) At the scale of the MOnSter 6502, that would take about 885,000 square feet (over 20 acres or 8 hectares) — an area about 940 ft (286 m) square.


</p><h4>Are you going to make a dis-integrated modern CPU next?</h4><p>
No.

</p><h4>Are you going to make one out of vacuum tubes next?</h4><p>
No. 

</p><h4>Are you going to make one out of relays next?</h4><p>
No. (Aren't we already doing enough to fight Moore's law?)


</p><h4>Can I buy one?</h4><p>
Hopefully in the near future! We are working towards a public launch, currently planned for Mid 2023; please <a href="http://eepurl.com/b1EhyX">Sign up for our mailing list</a> if you would like to receive updates as we get further along.



</p><h4>Is it expensive?</h4><p>
It is definitely not cheap to make one of these. We are currently estimating the cost at between $2k - $4k.
While the circuit board itself is large and a little bit expensive, the cost is actually dominated by the
component and assembly costs of an extremely large number of tiny components, most of which are individually
not that expensive. Add to that the setup and test costs of building complex things like these in small batches,
and you can immediately see how it adds up.


</p><h4>Is there going to be a soldering kit version of this?</h4><p>
No. (But on the other hand, "Anything is a soldering kit if you're brave enough!")

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>It honestly breaks my heart to write this article, but I want to be as transparent as possible with our readers because you are the ones that have quite literally kept our lights on over the past five years, and you deserve to know the truth about what’s happening behind the scenes, so here it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retro Dodo is on the brink of collapse… <strong>because of Google</strong>.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, I took the big risk of leaving my comfortable, full-time job and pursuing my own goal of creating a content brand that informs and educates retro gamers. I had very little money back then, just enough to sustain myself for a few months, and because I built up a small fan base on YouTube before leaving my job, I could start to earn a little bit of income through that platform while freelance video editing for large media companies.</p>
<p>I grafted solo for a long time and created the website that you are reading today to share my opinions on retro handhelds and old video games. It took 12 months or so before my blog started to make money through the installation of display advertising. Combined with my YouTube revenue, I could finally drop all of my freelancing gigs and go all in.</p>
<figure><img fetchpriority="high" width="1160" height="653" src="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/retrododo-2019-1160x653.webp" alt="retro dodo's website in 2019" srcset="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/retrododo-2019-1160x653.webp 1160w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/retrododo-2019-800x450.webp 800w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/retrododo-2019-50x28.webp 50w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/retrododo-2019-320x180.webp 320w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/retrododo-2019-560x315.webp 560w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/retrododo-2019.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px"><figcaption>our website in 2019</figcaption></figure>
<p>I needed support creating content so I employed one of my good friends <a href="https://retrododo.com/author/seb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seb Santabarbara who is our Editor in Chief</a> and has produced hundreds of articles over the last few years.</p>
<p>With Seb on board, Retro Dodo finally became a business, earning enough to sustain us both and to allow us to enjoy our time testing and reviewing retro gaming products.</p>
<p>The main source of our traffic was through Google Search. Whenever you searched for something retro gaming-related, our hope was that you would stumble across our website for advice, as we have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into expert journalists to provide you with answers to your retro gaming queries. It worked incredibly well; Google’s search engine did what it entailed, showing users informative content <strong>created by human experts</strong>.</p>
<p>Small websites like ours had a chance to compete with larger websites because Google’s guidelines were fair, and if users were happy, then Google was happy. And to reward giving users a great and informative experience, Google would place websites higher or lower in the search results depending on how great your content was without much bias.</p>
<figure><img width="1160" height="653" src="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/retro-dodo-team-1160x653.webp" alt="retro dodo team" srcset="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/retro-dodo-team-1160x653.webp 1160w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/retro-dodo-team-800x450.webp 800w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/retro-dodo-team-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/retro-dodo-team-50x28.webp 50w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/retro-dodo-team-320x180.webp 320w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/retro-dodo-team-560x315.webp 560w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/retro-dodo-team.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px"><figcaption>our current team</figcaption></figure>
<p>After two years of this and seeing steady revenue growth, we decided to increase our team, expanding into covering Retro Gaming news and features with <a href="https://retrododo.com/author/jasonbrown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Brown</a> and <a href="https://retrododo.com/author/theolitston/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Theo Litston</a>, and also bringing on our new video producer Rob Page to help with video output. I was incredibly busy keeping an eye on industry trends, working on our <a href="https://retrododo.com/a-handheld-history-book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new book series</a> that took two years to make, managing the team to produce the best possible content, and heck, even collaborating with <a href="https://youtu.be/Iu09mAN4f2U?si=5ORhJFqzS37hT8T_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casey Neistat in New York</a>, and this period was incredibly fun.</p>
<p>Well, that all came to an abrupt end in September 2023 when Google decided to release an algorithm update that completely obliterated thousands of independent content businesses overnight, and we are one of them.</p>
<p>Since September 2023, Google has hidden our site from millions of retro gamers, reducing our organic traffic and revenue by 85% and causing our business to be on the edge of going under.</p>

<h2>Google Is Now Playing Unfairly &amp; Unlawfully</h2>
<p><em>Before I go in on Google, I would like to mention that I have always been an advocate of Google before this. They have allowed me and many other creatives to earn a living and feed our families through their platform, and for that,</em> I will always be grateful (even if their platform wasn’t perfect). But this recent update is a direct attack on<em> content website owners, and it’s happening while Google makes some incredibly unlawful and disgusting changes behind closed doors.</em></p>
<p>Google’s search results are no longer fair and no longer abide by their own guidelines, which they repeatedly share with website owners when they speak up, alongside Google’s spokespersons replying with cover-up quotes such as “make better content for your readers”.</p>
<p><strong>So what’s changed?</strong> Google continuously states (and very publicly) that their goal is to show helpful content, to reduce spam, and make the search results fairer to all sized websites. But the opposite is happening, and aggressively.</p>
<p>Google’s algorithms now favor a handful of results BEFORE “normal” websites, results that rarely show independent websites. And when I mention them, it’s likely that you’ve seen these changes yourself:</p>
<p>Firstly, Google wants to completely eradicate users leaving their search results and will now show you their own “From Sources” answers to search terms. These answers are taken without consent from the publisher’s content and are stolen from creators’ work so that Google can give you “their” answer instead, lowering the chances of readers exploring websites… the websites that are paying to create the exact content that Google now shows for themself. It’s straight-up intellectual property theft.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you manage to scroll past Google’s stolen answer, you will undoubtedly be bombarded with sponsored ads, and lots of them. These results are purposely designed to look like normal results and can bend Google’s guidelines when it comes to content quality. This is straight-up pay-to-play, again lowering the need for creators’ articles. </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1160" height="653" src="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-serps-screeny-1-1160x653.webp" alt="" srcset="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-serps-screeny-1-1160x653.webp 1160w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-serps-screeny-1-800x450.webp 800w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-serps-screeny-1-50x28.webp 50w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-serps-screeny-1-320x180.webp 320w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-serps-screeny-1-560x315.webp 560w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-serps-screeny-1.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px"><figcaption>sponsored ads and “from sources” example</figcaption></figure>
<p>Type in “best home arcade cabinets” into Google, and you’ll see a prime example of a response filled with sponsored slots. And, if you look closely, you will notice the articles ranking highest are likely from websites also paying for Google for clicks. There are barely any professional reviews in sight. I understand that this is a query with a buyer’s intent, but there are many terms like this where it’s straight-up pay-to-win.</p>
<p>This is after Google’s spokespersons saying that ‘creatives who have seen a loss in traffic should lower their ad density’… one rule for us, another for them, hey?</p>
<p>Thirdly, and this is the biggest change I have ever seen in the search results over the last 5 years, is the fact that you will likely now see Reddit results upon searching for something. Reddit has its place on the internet, but certainly not for search terms where you seek expert and professional advice (what Google’s guidelines state).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reddit is the single biggest winner in recent algorithm changes, seeing millions of more clicks every single day thanks to recent updates. But my understanding of the guidelines was that Google said they want to show results written by experts. </p>
<p>That’s what they say publicly, but in actual reality, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/reddit-ai-content-licensing-deal-with-google-sources-say-2024-02-22/">Google has recently partnered with Reddit to pay them $60M a year to crawl their website so that they can train Google’s AI</a>. This news became public just days before the update that catapulted Reddit’s traffic to the moon and weeks away from Reddit launching their IPO, which hockey-sticked their share price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of May 27th, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/03/27/reddit-shares-slump-after-ceo-steve-huffman-sells-500000-shares.html">Reddit’s CEO sold a bunch of his shares at the peak too</a>, making him and likely many other investors incredibly rich. I am no detective, but it all smells very fishy, and as a creator seeing this all happen just makes me lose all trust in Google. They have replaced many creative’s incomes with Reddit results just so they can have more data for their AI. And maybe there’s a behind-the-scenes deal happening that might match up to the launch of their IPO? </p>
<p>But that’s just me speculating, and I’m no detective.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1160" height="653" src="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-screenie-2-1160x653.webp" alt="" srcset="https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-screenie-2-1160x653.webp 1160w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-screenie-2-800x450.webp 800w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-screenie-2-50x28.webp 50w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-screenie-2-320x180.webp 320w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-screenie-2-560x315.webp 560w, https://retrododo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/google-screenie-2.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px"></figure>
<p>Don’t you worry, the list doesn’t stop there!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the websites that have not seen a decline in traffic are owned and operated by huge media companies. Just 16 media companies who own over 400+ websites receive over 3.8 billion clicks a month from Google (thanks for the data <a href="https://detailed.com/google-control/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Detailed</a>), leaving little to no space for smaller websites to have a voice, even if these smaller websites make far better content (according to Google’s guidelines).</p>
<p>These goliath websites can bend the rules and get away with things that smaller websites are punished for. For example, we have spent years of testing handheld devices for our “<a href="https://retrododo.com/best-retro-handhelds/">best retro handhelds</a>” article; you can see we have tested every single one, have dedicated images showing you the product, highly produced video reviews for many of the devices that took weeks to make, and our written content proves our opinions and comparisons. Large media companies, however, can get away with simply not testing the products, adding stock images, adding a bit of text, and directing you to their affiliate links as you can see here by an <a href="https://gamerant.com/best-retro-handheld-gaming-consoles/">article that outranks us by GameRant</a>.</p>
<p>These large websites can also get away with taking original content from small publishers, rewording it in their own way, and then outranking the website that wrote it originally in the first place. This leads to there being no financial incentive for small publishers to create unique content because it costs them a fortune to do so, and competition is on their tail copying what they are doing for a fraction of the cost/time.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t live in a world where only a few major companies dominate the entire search online ecosystem; Google needs to become a fairer search engine without bias.</p>
<p>And to rub salt into the wound, it was discovered that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084687/google-is-paying-small-news-outlets-to-use-an-ai-article-writing-tool">Google is paying some media companies “five figures” to use their AI to automatically scrape content from other publishers’ work</a> (who have paid expert humans to produce) and publish it as news twice a day on their websites. Even though excessive use of AI is against their guidelines for the rest of their creators.</p>
<p>There are many other factors that are destroying the livelihoods of content creators that I could go into, but I don’t want to bore you. There’s the fact that <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-search/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Search Generative Experience</a> is coming to fruition giving users 100% AI-generated answers with very little credit to the creators that Google has scraped the answers from. We can also take into account the fact that Google is stopping third-party cookies soon, likely lowering ad revenue because display advertisers will lack data from users and won’t know what to show them. And then there’s the fact that AI websites are outranking us on a continuous basis and media companies are starting websites almost identical to ours, even going as far as replicating our content and physical product strategy.</p>
<p>My real issue is that Google isn’t telling us and other creators what we are doing wrong; they are replying with vague answers or sharing advice that goes completely against what’s showing up in the search results. There is no way for us to know how to recover from this because Google is lying to the faces of the people that make their search results great without giving them any help at all.</p>
<p>It’s likely that our website structure isn’t perfect or that our content may likely be “over-optimised” for Google, but at least tell me. I am no SEO expert;l I have a million plates to spin as a content website operator, and I cannot get everything right. If Google were to inform me what I was doing incorrectly then I could change that, but they don’t. They just keep hiding our work, month after month after month.</p>
<p>Instead of helping us, they are pushing small independent publishers lower and lower down their search results so that our work cannot be seen, while at the same time supporting the use of AI, using our content for their own gain without permission, and increasing the visibility of content that goes completely against their guidelines.</p>
<p>There has never been a worse time for independent publishers who rely on Google. Mass intellectual theft is happening; it’s pay to win, and Google is so openly crushing the livelihoods of many of their creators that have supported them over the last 5+ years.</p>
<p>I honestly hope that Google can eventually create a search engine that’s fair, one that supports small independent publishers who actually follow their guidelines instead of punishing them for “writing for search engines and not readers” and treating them differently to websites that have a higher “domain authority” than them.</p>
<h2>What’s Next For Retro Dodo?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s not looking good for us, and in all honesty we’re all out of cash. I have tried my hardest for it not to affect the team, but we’re now losing money, which is devastating because I have worked endlessly for the past 5 years to create a brand that supports its staff as best as it possibly can. I find myself drained mentally and financially at a time when I am trying to support my family and my 12-week-old son.</p>
<p>This means I will have to reduce our staff, postpone our upcoming RDX Expo, postpone series 2 of our podcast, likely stop our A Handheld History book series after Book 2, and reduce our content output drastically this year.</p>
<p>All of this will hurt us even more in the short term, but it’s the only route we can take if we want to survive in the long run.</p>
<p>As a founder, I now need to create a plan for Retro Dodo to find traffic away from Google and new revenue streams away from direct advertising. That is how I stop us from going under.</p>
<p>It is no longer smart for me to rely upon or trust Google as a creator after they have rug pulled not only my family’s income, but the families of my team within the space of a few months.</p>
<p>In no other industry would you not know why this has happened nor be able to find a plan for how to recover, but as a Google Creator, they’re giving us incorrect information, vague responses, and doing business deals that go against everything they are telling the creators that no longer have any income.</p>
<p>It’s anxiety-inducing for us all, especially without help. All we can do is adapt and move away from Google as a reliable source of traffic.</p>

<p>I am not writing this to ask for help, but rather to simply be transparent regarding the state of Retro Dodo. But, if you <em>do</em> want to support us as an independent publication, the most helpful thing you can do is become a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/retrododo">Patreon Member</a>.</p>
<p>This gives us the ability to create content without having to please algorithms; it allows us to create content <strong>freely</strong>. Our Patreon comes with a bunch of benefits, including a physical welcome kit, early access to content, and an invite to a yearly meet-up in the UK.</p>
<p>We also have our book <a href="https://retrododo.com/a-handheld-history-book/">A Handheld History for sale on Amazon</a>, and our <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/ahandheldhistory?ss_source=twads&amp;ss_campaign_name=Retrododo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second book which is available to pre-order at Lost In Cult</a> which launches in a few months. Admittedly we don’t earn a lot from it, but it still helps.</p>
<p>I will continue to put all my efforts into building Retro Dodo back into what it once was and hopefully evolve it into something even better. It’s going to be a rough year for us as a publication, but we’re not going down without a fight.</p>

<p>I want to personally thank every single one of you that has read, watched, or shared our work. You have given me and my team an incredibly enjoyable few years creating content about retro games, and I hope we can recover from this so that we can continue giving you a place that you deserve, a place that truly champions retro gaming and the people that make this community so special.</p>
<p>Google is making the future of independent publishing incredibly difficult, and small publishers’ work is becoming harder to find thanks to their algorithms and their use of AI-generated answers. But we will adapt, even if it takes us some time.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.</strong></p>

            <i>New media platform delivers customers cash back while helping brands drive sales and business growth</i>
            
        </p><div>
    <p><b>NEW YORK, April 3, 2024</b> – Today, Chase launched <a href="https://www.chase.com/mediasolutions/home?jp_cmp=cc/launchpressrelease/ext/na/na" target="_self" data-pt-name="lnk_website" title="Chase Media Website">Chase Media Solutions</a>, its new digital media business, providing brands with the ability to connect directly with the financial institution’s 80 million customers. Chase Media Solutions serves as a key conduit for brands, connecting them with consumers’ personal passions and interests. In turn, Chase customers benefit from personalized offers and the ability to earn cash back with brands they love or are discovering for the first time.</p> 
<p>As the only bank-led media platform of its kind, Chase Media Solutions combines the scale and audience of a retail media network with the exclusive advantages of Chase’s first-party financial data, institutional credibility and precise targeting capabilities. Today, the bank’s large consumer base and 6 million small business customers benefit from Chase’s wide range of travel, dining and shopping offerings — generating unparalleled insights across consumer categories.</p> 
<p>The launch of Chase Media Solutions follows the integration of Figg, a leading card-linked marketing platform. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. acquired Figg in 2022 as a natural step in Chase’s effort to build out its owned, two-sided commerce platform, and as part of the firm's vision to bring win-win value to both business clients and banking customers.</p> 
<p>“Our deep understanding of consumer spending across categories has driven us to reimagine what retail media networks can offer,” said Rich Muhlstock, President of Chase Media Solutions. “Like retailers, we have first-party data and a dedicated audience. But what sets us apart is the unrivaled scale and insights from our customers – having long-served as a trusted guide for their financial decisions. Chase reaches across brands, merchants and shopping verticals, providing a comprehensive view of purchase behavior; this strengthens the degree of personalization, helping brands deliver offers that stoke consumer interests.”</p> 
<p><b>Chase Media Solutions platform advantages</b></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><b>First-party data: </b>With Chase’s owned transaction data, brands and agencies can precisely target customers at scale based on purchase history (such as targeting new, lapsed or loyal customers)</li> 
 <li><b>Better ROI and attribution: </b>Brands capture incremental spend on everyday purchases both in-store and online with clear attribution for every media dollar spent</li> 
 <li><b>Trust and brand safety:</b> The platform is built on the foundational trust and institutional credibility of Chase, including a verified audience and brand-safe owned channels</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Among initial pilot partners, Chase Media Solutions designed 30-day campaigns for Air Canada, Solo Stove, Blue Bottle and Whataburger, seeing significant traction for those brands in driving incremental sales and new customers growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Regarding the success of their initial campaign, Scott O’Leary, Vice President of Loyalty and Product for Air Canada said, “The Chase team succeeded in creating a thoughtful, targeted offer that exceeded our expectations. Two distinct offer constructs drove incremental revenue and awareness for Air Canada amongst Chase’s cardmember base. These tests clearly demonstrated the potential of the Chase Media Solutions channel, and we look forward to working together more in the future.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm following with somewhat vague interest the various legal battles Apple is currently involved in. Reading their response to the EU's DMA makes me sad. Not for the company itself. I honestly could not care less about the company. Nor for the people who run that company. I'm sad because the pursuit of endless growth is such a mind cancer. It consumes and distracts everyone. If you're an artisan, creating amazing objects is your end goal. Ideally, you want those objects to last forever. And if they don't, you want to do such an amazing job that once something is broken beyond repair, people will come to you again and ask you to make something new, rather than buying from someone else.</p>
<p>Apple makes amazing products. I bought the laptop I'm typing this 9 years ago. It still works fine. Sure, it's slow compared to my new machine but I can use it to do calls and write blog posts. And that's great. I love it. I was happy to give Apple my money back in 2015. But you know who's not happy? Apple. Apple is not happy that I bought a laptop in 2015 that was so good that it is still working fine 9 years later. And it's also not happy that I bought a phone more than 4 years ago that still does all the things I need it to do. Because they need to make money. More money. There's no end state here. <em>"More"</em> has no end state. At some point, a company like Apple will inevitably run out of people willing to buy their stuff. Because it's unreasonable to expect people to upgrade phones, laptops, screens, watches, tablets, virtual-ski-goggles every damn year. And so what do they do? They move into services. Music, movies, games, fitness, storage. You name it. But those also can't grow forever. Because guess what? There are other companies out there doing the same.</p>
<p>But they can't stop. They're a public company. If they're not growing enough it means they're failing. Forget that they make amazing products that can last decades with no issues. Forget that they're an almost 3-fucking-trillions dollar company. If they're not growing enough, stock goes down and that's no good. Because remember, there's no finish line here. They can't just be happy with their size. They can't be happy with the idea of employing thousands of smart people and creating amazing products. No, they have to keep growing. And sooner or later, this mind cancer becomes malignant.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, this is not just an Apple issue. It's an issue with any big company. It's an issue with everyone who can't accept that they reached their end state.</p>
<p>Cory Doctorow famously coined the enshittification term to describe the sad trend of online services going to shit over time. I don't think that's just an online services issue. It's a societal issue related to the pursuit of endless growth. And if you think about it, it's a deeply human issue. It's what happens when you can't say stop. No matter what you're doing, it can be something positive or negative, if you can't say stop, bad things will happen. Try to go for a run, and don't stop. Ever. Or try to drink water, and don't stop. Ever.</p>
<p>But it's our fault. Our as a society. We celebrate when Apple becomes the first trillion-dollar company but we don't celebrate when someone says <em>"You know what? I think I have enough"</em>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

However, it can turn into a source of frustration when pages load slowly. At the heart of this issue lies the encoding of images. To improve on this, we are introducing <a href="https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/tree/main/lib/jpegli" target="_blank">Jpegli</a>, an advanced JPEG coding library that maintains high backward compatibility while offering enhanced capabilities and a 35% compression ratio improvement at high quality compression settings.</p>
  
<p><b>Jpegli is a new JPEG coding library</b> that is designed to be faster, more efficient, and more visually pleasing than traditional JPEG. It uses a number of new techniques to achieve these goals, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>It provides both a fully interoperable <b>encoder and decoder</b> complying with the original JPEG standard and its most conventional 8-bit formalism, and API/ABI compatibility with libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG.</li></ul><ul>

<li><b>High quality results</b>. When images are compressed or decompressed through Jpegli, more precise and psychovisually effective computations are performed and images will look clearer and have fewer observable artifacts.</li></ul><ul>
  
<li><b>Fast</b>. While improving on image quality/compression density ratio, Jpegli's coding speed is comparable to traditional approaches, such as libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG. This means that web developers can effortlessly integrate Jpegli into their existing workflows without sacrificing coding speed performance or memory use.</li></ul><ul>
 
<li><b>10+ bits</b>. Jpegli can be encoded with 10+ bits per component. Traditional JPEG coding solutions offer only 8 bit per component dynamics causing visible banding artifacts in slow gradients. Jpegli's 10+ bits coding happens in the original 8-bit formalism and the resulting images are fully interoperable with 8-bit viewers. 10+ bit dynamics are available as an API extension and application code changes are needed to benefit from it.</li></ul><ul>
  
<li><b>More dense:</b> Jpegli compresses images more efficiently than traditional JPEG codecs, which can save bandwidth and storage space, and <b>speed up web pages</b>.</li>
  
</ul><br>

<h2><b>How Jpegli works</b></h2>
  
<p>Jpegli works by using a number of new techniques to reduce noise and improve image quality; mainly adaptive quantization heuristics from the <a href="https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl" target="_blank">JPEG XL</a> reference implementation, improved quantization matrix selection, calculating intermediate results precisely, and having the possibility to use a more advanced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile" target="_blank">colorspace</a>. All the new methods have been carefully crafted to use the traditional 8-bit JPEG formalism, so newly compressed images are compatible with existing JPEG viewers such as browsers, image processing software, and others.</p>

<h4><span><b>Adaptive quantization heuristics</b></span></h4> 
<p>Jpegli uses adaptive quantization to reduce noise and improve image quality. This is done by spatially modulating the dead zone in quantization based on <a href="https://github.com/google/butteraugli" target="_blank">psychovisual modeling</a>. Using adaptive quantization heuristics that we originally developed for JPEG XL, the result is improved image quality and reduced file size. These heuristics are much faster than a similar approach originally used in <a href="https://github.com/google/guetzli" target="_blank">guetzli</a>.<br>
  
  
</p><h4><span><b>Improved quantization matrix selection</b></span></h4>
<p>Jpegli also uses a set of quantization matrices that were selected by optimizing for a mix of psychovisual quality metrics. Precise intermediate results in Jpegli improve image quality, and both encoding and decoding produce higher quality results. Jpegli can use JPEG XL's XYB colorspace for further quality and density improvements.</p><br>

<h2><b>Testing Jpegli</b></h2>
  
<p>In order to quantify Jpegli's image quality improvement we enlisted the help of crowdsourcing raters to compare pairs of images from <a href="https://cloudinary.com/labs/cid22" target="_blank">Cloudinary Image Dataset '22</a>, encoded using three codecs: Jpegli, libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG, at several bitrates.</p>
  
<p>In this comparison we limited ourselves to comparing the encoding only, decoding was always performed using libjpeg-turbo. We conducted the study with the XYB ICC color profile disabled since that is how we anticipate most users would initially use Jpegli. To simplify comparing the <a href="https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mucped23" target="_blank">results</a> across the codecs and settings, we aggregated all the rater decisions using chess rankings inspired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" target="_blank">ELO scoring</a>.</p>

<div><table><tbody><tr><td><center><img alt="A bar graph of ELO scores on the left and plot graph of ELO scores on the right" data-original-height="1504" data-original-width="720" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgM2XmnDYP6bArTS8fmfeRWh4LDysiBMEITg0NYKH9whR1SACvuFl2JDUsoBXbm0oLSbXSzLH6e9urikKWM0rOIMuZshenEDEFB7nou4QZlXi85c-hml81ET1j6_6z2pqcAYWTj2elYi6j90YScxPZ4cib9dxob9Z-bf4rBtP-y-LbOrry9U5TcjnRJ7IU/s1600/Image1%20%284%29.png" td=""></center></td></tr><tr><td><i>A higher ELO score indicates a better aggregate performance in the rater study. We can observe that jpegli at 2.8 BPP received a higher ELO rating than libjpeg-turbo at 3.7 BPP, a bitrate 32 % higher than Jpegli's.</i></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br>


<h2><b>Results</b></h2>
  
<p>Our results show that <b>Jpegli can compress high quality images 35% more than traditional JPEG codecs.</b> </p>
  
<p><a href="https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/tree/main/lib/jpegli" target="_blank">Jpegli</a> is a promising new technology that has the potential to make the internet faster and more beautiful.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For investigative journalists, the search for the actual owners of shell companies and trusts can sometimes seem as elusive and “fuzzy” as popular searches for UFOs. But there are powerful tools out there that can help newcomers to this complex field track breadcrumbs to people who go to great lengths to hide assets that the public should know about.</p>

<p>Shell corporations are companies that don’t actually do any business, but which are often incorporated for strategic reasons, such as legal tax avoidance for legitimate corporations — and <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/the-pandora-papers/is-your-neighbor-a-shell-company">also to hide the identity and assets</a> of the individuals who truly control illegitimate or sanctioned enterprises.</p>
<p>Digging into shell companies and their ultimate benefit owners (UBOs) is a specialized investigative area, represented by networks such as the <a href="https://www.icij.org/">International Consortium of Investigative Journalists</a> (ICIJ) and the <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/component/tags/tag/icij">Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project</a> (OCCRP). The advanced techniques they use, from tracking bank transfer routes to deferred corporate prosecution agreements, could fill several books.</p>
<p>However, in a solo presentation at the recent 2024 <a href="https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/nicar-2024/">NICAR data journalism summit</a> in the US, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karrie-kehoe-99304936/?originalSubdomain=ie">Karrie Kehoe</a>, deputy head of data and research at ICIJ, shared several tips, tools, and places to start that almost any reporter can try to track the person at the top of a shady empire — and their overseas assets. Kehoe invited attendees to first ask themselves: What words might appear in paperwork that must be filed for these front companies? And to then experiment with possible variations of those words that could be used in corporate registries and databases. For instance, might the name of a director or owner, like Ian, appear as “Iain”?</p>
<div id="attachment_1417393"><p><a href="https://www.icij.org/journalists/karrie-kehoe/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1417393" src="https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.19.17-336x389.png" alt="" width="250" height="289" srcset="https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.19.17-336x389.png 336w, https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.19.17.png 586w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-1417393">Karrie Kehoe, deputy head of data and research at ICIJ.

<p>While often partly obscured by secrecy jurisdictions — such as the British Virgin Islands, Panama, Cyprus, or Cayman Islands — shell companies always need paperwork in order to be incorporated. Kehoe also invited reporters to think carefully about the people typically paid to fill out these forms, also known as “<a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/29leaks/what-is-a-company-formation-agent">formation agents</a>.” It’s their job to create companies for wealthy clients in friendly legal jurisdictions, which can offer country registration fees as low as US$14. For extra fees, formation agents can also provide clients with bank accounts, “straw man” director names, and secretarial services. But they can’t get around the basics on those forms: an official business address, real names of at least some directors, and documents about the nature of the business.</p>
<p>Searching for foreign assets of a Middle East king in 2021, Kehoe and her colleagues found that the monarch secretly owned 14 luxury homes in the UK and the US via a network of front companies in tax havens. They then got dramatic confirmation <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/jordan-king-abdullah-luxury-property/">when the secret client’s home address was listed by formation agents</a> in registration documents as the kingdom’s “royal palace.”</p>
<p>Remember, she stressed, that you are always seeking the ultimate beneficial owner, rather than the director or owner names you may find early in your search.</p>
<p>“You could be sitting in the Netherlands, and you get your order off to a formation agent in, say, Hong Kong, and he starts setting up shells for you in the Cook Islands, Singapore, and other places,” said Kehoe, explaining one possible scenario. “From there, they will provide secretarial services, an address for you, and straw men — in other words, figureheads. One could be listed as the director of 100 companies, and that person could be a taxi driver in Azerbaijan. He has nothing to do with this — they may get a small bit of money; sometimes they are relatives or just people they know; sometimes they are strong-armed. But he is a body the formation agent needs.”</p>
<p>Shell companies represent one of several kinds of “proxy” methods that people use to disguise their wealth, <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/asset-tracker/faq-whats-a-proxy-using-relatives-shell-companies-and-other-stand-ins-to-hide-illicit-wealth">as investigative journalist Will Neal recently explained at OCCRP</a>. For more on this, see GIJN’s detailed resource for <a href="https://gijn.org/resource/researching-corporations-and-their-owners/">Researching Corporations and their Owners</a>, which includes access portals for annual reports, and links to country-specific registries, from Germany to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Here are some of the places-to-start tips Kehoe shared at NICAR24.</p>
<p><b>Start with a quick company or person name search in </b><a href="https://opencorporates.com/"><b>OpenCorporates</b></a><b>.</b> Drawing on company records from more than 140 government registries, OpenCorporates is a vast, open database that reporters love. “The first thing I do is go to this wonderful, searchable database – it has over 220 million companies listed there,” explained Kehoe. “It is wonderful for some jurisdictions; it struggles for others. For instance, you’d need to go somewhere else for Irish shell companies. If you want to look up a whole lot of companies, they do have API access too.”</p>
<div id="attachment_1417344"><p><a href="https://opencorporates.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1417344" src="https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.08.46-771x405.png" alt="" width="771" height="405" srcset="https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.08.46-771x405.png 771w, https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.08.46-336x176.png 336w, https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.08.46-768x403.png 768w, https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.08.46-1536x806.png 1536w, https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.08.46-2048x1075.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-1417344">OpenCorporates is a vast, open database drawing on company records from more than 140 government registries. Image: Screenshot, OpenCorporates</p></div>
<p><b>Consider a subscription to a corporate risk database if you hit a wall with open source tools.</b> Kehoe showed one major shell company name that got no hits on the excellent OpenCorporates database, but which got a detailed profile from a simple name search in the paid-for <a href="https://sayari.com/financial-crime/"><b>Sayari</b></a> corporate risk platform– including helpful red flag icons to show sanctions listings, and national flags to show countries associated with listed directors. “This is a database I use all the time — it’s subscription-based, but they also have some free trials,” she said. “There are also other great paid-for corporate databases like <a href="https://login.bvdinfo.com/R0/Orbis"><b>Orbis</b></a> and <a href="https://www.dowjones.com/professional/factiva/?LS=Search&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=AMER-US[EN]_GGL-Brand[GEN]-FA-Factiva_MT-Exact&amp;CID=7015Y000004FylCQAS&amp;utm_term=factiva_(e)&amp;utm_content=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwwYSwBhDcARIsAOyL0fgmrbfqHGsRhTB984bRyKqKWwdwTOH8U7-c0br0U8gHvRNeG311DH4aAsXEEALw_wcB"><b>Factiva</b></a>.”</p>
<p><b>Put yourself in the shoes of billionaires and oligarchs.</b> Kehoe said it helps to refine database and registry searches for places and interests that appeal to the egos of oligarchs and UBOs. “The thing about super wealthy people is that they’re very predictable, and, if you’re a billionaire, there is only so much stuff you can buy,” Kehoe noted. “They often want luxury properties in London and the South of France; they want mega-yachts and jets and art and sports teams.” Simply identifying and searching for the wealthiest neighborhoods in certain jurisdictions, she said, can help narrow searches for hidden assets.</p>

<p><b>Use vetted investigative data in the </b><a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/"><b>ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database</b></a><b>.&nbsp;</b>Many reporters don’t realize that the vast, searchable Offshore Leaks database — with vetted information on 810,000 offshore companies, foundations, and trusts in 200 countries — is freely available for any reporter, anywhere, to use, and to explore for new stories in their regions. “Please use it,” she said. “We know there are more stories in all that data, and we want reporters to find them.” Compiled by ICIJ, the database has been built from previous leaks and collaborative investigations into secret offshore assets and their hidden owners, such as the Panama Papers, the Pandora Papers, the Bahamas Leaks, and the Paradise Papers projects. “You can just put addresses into the search box, or the names of people or companies,” she explained. Reporters can also filter their search by the major leak investigations, which focus on different regions and jurisdictions — so a filter for Pandora Papers, for instance, will highlight more Asia data than Panama Papers.</p>
<p>Kehoe added one note of caution: “Just because someone’s name appears in this database does not mean they are guilty or associated with any wrongdoing at all. It just means they’re listed in an offshore jurisdiction.” (See ICIJ’s <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/how-to-take-your-offshore-leaks-database-searches-to-the-next-level/">video tutorial series</a> for advanced search techniques for this database.)</p>
<p><b>Flag potential criminal links in OCCRP’s follow-the-money archive. </b>OCCRP’s <a href="https://aleph.occrp.org/"><b>Aleph database</b></a> has information on 439 million public entities in 141 countries. “It also has persons of interest datasets and gazettes,” said Kehoe. “Gazettes are huge in Europe — if a company is struck off [from company registers], it has to be listed in a gazette.” (Limited companies are typically struck off, or removed, from official registers for regulatory non-compliance, and are prohibited from further trading.) She added: “(Aleph) also has lots of court records, which is important for many countries, because most countries don’t have a court records tool like <a href="https://pacer.uscourts.gov/">Pacer</a> in the US.”</p>
<div id="attachment_1417369"><p><a href="https://aleph.occrp.org/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1417369" src="https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.12.58-771x396.png" alt="" width="771" height="396" srcset="https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.12.58-771x396.png 771w, https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.12.58-336x172.png 336w, https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.12.58-768x394.png 768w, https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.12.58-1536x788.png 1536w, https://gijn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-17.12.58.png 1902w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-1417369">OCCRP’s Aleph database has information on 439 million public entities in 141 countries.&nbsp;Image: Screenshot, OCCRP Aleph</p></div>
<p><b>Experiment with different spellings — and check against Google Maps.&nbsp;</b>Using the name of her own hometown in Ireland as an example, she said reporters searching for people or assets in Dún Laoghaire should also try spellings such as “Dún Laoire” and “Dunleary.” “If you try different spellings for places, you’d be surprised what you come up with,” she said. “Leaks data comes from many different languages, so if you want to find an address in Russia, there’s no point entering the word “street.” I recommend going to Google Maps, and, in this case, taking the Cyrillic phrase, and putting the English translation of that phrase into the search field of databases.” Even more important: use alternate spellings for the names of directors listed in corporate registries. This can be as simple as trying traditional alternatives, such as “Ann” and “Anne.” “But remember that when looking at Russian names, in particular, the spellings often change – “i”s become “y”s, “x”s become “ks”s etc,” Kehoe explained.</p>
<p><b><i>Tip:</i></b> Enter addresses you find on <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84"><b>OpenStreetMap</b></a>, and check to see whether the director’s listed address is the mansion you’d expect, or a tiny office or apartment that could signal another false front.</p>
<p><b>Cross-search the “nuggets” you find in other free portals.</b> Kehoe suggested the following sites as other&nbsp; useful, free resources to search for hidden cross-border business connections: <a href="https://www.openownership.org/en/"><b>Open Ownership</b></a>, the UK-based <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/register-of-overseas-entities#:~:text=Overseas%20entities%20who%20want%20to,owners%20or%20managing%20officers%20are."><b>Register of Overseas Entities</b></a>, and <a href="https://ted.europa.eu/en/news/welcome-to-the-new-ted"><b>Tenders Electronic Daily</b></a> (TED). “TED is amazing — it involves public contracts for 27 EU member states, and it goes back a long time,” said Kehoe. “But it can be a little tricky as it has many different languages together.”</p>
<p><b><i>Tip:</i></b> Image search for society photos of the oligarch or UBO you’re investigating with the names listed in datasets and corporate registries as company directors.</p>
<p><b>Try a family connections tool to track oligarch assets. </b>“Russian oligarchs are the world masters of shell companies — they’ve been doing this since the 1990s, and reporters are always playing catch up,” said Kehoe. “The first thing to do is to <a href="https://www.opensanctions.org/">check if they are sanctioned</a>.”</p>
<p>She suggested a website called <a href="https://rupep.org/en/"><b>RuPEP</b></a>, which profiles thousands of “politically exposed persons” and sanctioned individuals in Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, as well as their relatives, and their association with legal entities. She added: “These kinds of databases often give you nuggets of new information, but it’s a great place to start. This has profiles for a lot of oligarchs, and the research is amazing,” said Kehoe. “It gives you family members, which is important because a lot of the assets are in family members’ names.”</p>
<p><b>Paperwork tends to poke holes in secrecy — so keep digging.</b> “Be persistent,” Kehoe advised. “Ultimate beneficial owners really do trust their formation agents to keep them safe from scrutiny, and share a lot of stuff with them. And so, somewhere down the line, they send in a scan of their passport or their utility bill, and their home addresses often pop up in leaks and databases that way.”</p>

<div>
<p>In partnership with</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.mekomit.co.il/"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726im_/https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2022/11/LC-LOGO-ENG.png" alt=""></a>
</p>
</div> <p><span>In 2021, a </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://books.google.co.il/books/about/The_Human_Machine_Team_How_to_Create_Syn.html?id=hjl1zgEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"><span>book</span></a><span> titled “The Human-Machine Team: How to Create Synergy Between Human and Artificial Intelligence That Will Revolutionize Our World” was released in English under the pen name “Brigadier General Y.S.” In it, the author — a man who we confirmed to be the current commander of the elite Israeli intelligence unit 8200 — makes the case for designing a special machine that could rapidly process massive amounts of data to generate thousands of potential “targets” for military strikes in the heat of a war. Such technology, he writes, would resolve what he described as a “human bottleneck for both locating the new targets and decision-making to approve the targets.”</span></p>
<p><span>Such a machine, it turns out, actually exists. A new investigation by +972 Magazine and Local Call reveals that the Israeli army has developed an artificial intelligence-based program known as “Lavender,” unveiled here for the first time. According to six Israeli intelligence officers, who have all served in the army during the current war on the Gaza Strip and had first-hand involvement with the use of AI to generate targets for assassination, Lavender has played a central role in the unprecedented bombing of Palestinians, especially during the early stages of the war. In fact, according to the sources, its influence on the military’s operations was such that they essentially treated the outputs of the AI machine “as if it were a human decision.”</span></p>
<p><span>Formally, the Lavender system is designed to mark all suspected operatives in the military wings of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), including low-ranking ones, as potential bombing targets. The sources told +972 and Local Call that, during the first weeks of the war, the army almost completely relied on Lavender, which clocked as many as 37,000 Palestinians as suspected militants — and their homes — for possible air strikes.</span></p>
<p><span>During the early stages of the war, the army gave sweeping approval for officers to adopt Lavender’s kill lists, with no requirement to thoroughly check why the machine made those choices or to examine the raw intelligence data on which they were based. One source stated that human personnel often served only as a “rubber stamp” for the machine’s decisions, adding that, normally, they would personally devote only about “20 seconds” to each target before authorizing a bombing — just to make sure the Lavender-marked target is male. This was despite knowing that the system makes what are regarded as “errors” in approximately 10 percent of cases, and is known to occasionally mark individuals who have merely a loose connection to militant groups, or no connection at all.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, the Israeli army systematically attacked the targeted individuals while they were in their homes — usually at night while their whole families were present — rather than during the course of military activity. According to the sources, this was because, from what they regarded as an intelligence standpoint, it was easier to locate the individuals in their private houses. Additional automated systems, including one called “Where’s Daddy?” also revealed here for the first time, were used specifically to track the targeted individuals and carry out bombings when they had entered their family’s residences.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>The result, as the sources testified, is that thousands of Palestinians — most of them women and children or people who were not involved in the fighting — were wiped out by Israeli airstrikes, especially during the first weeks of the war, because of the AI program’s decisions.</span></p>
<p><span>“We were not interested in killing [Hamas] operatives only when they were in a military building or engaged in a military activity,” A., an intelligence officer, told +972 and Local Call. “On the contrary, the IDF bombed them in homes without hesitation, as a first option. It’s much easier to bomb a family’s home. The system is built to look for them in these situations.”</span></p>
<p><span>The Lavender machine joins another AI system, “The Gospel,” about which information was revealed in a </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.972mag.com/mass-assassination-factory-israel-calculated-bombing-gaza/"><span>previous investigation</span></a><span> by +972 and Local Call in November 2023, as well as in the Israeli military’s own </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.israeldefense.co.il/node/57256#google_vignette"><span>publications</span></a><span>. A fundamental difference between the two systems is in the definition of the target: whereas The Gospel marks buildings and structures that the army claims militants operate from, Lavender marks people — and puts them on a kill list.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, according to the sources, when it came to targeting alleged junior militants marked by Lavender, the army preferred to only use unguided missiles, commonly known as “dumb” bombs (in contrast to “smart” precision bombs), which can destroy entire buildings on top of their occupants and cause significant casualties. “You don’t want to waste expensive bombs on unimportant people — it’s very expensive for the country and there’s a shortage [of those bombs],” said C., one of the intelligence officers. Another source said that they had personally authorized the bombing of “hundreds” of private homes of alleged junior operatives marked by Lavender, with many of these attacks killing civilians and entire families as “collateral damage.”</span></p>
<p><span>In an unprecedented move, according to two of the sources, the army also decided during the first weeks of the war that, for every junior Hamas operative that Lavender marked, it was permissible to kill up to 15 or 20 civilians; in the past, the military did not authorize any “collateral damage” during assassinations of low-ranking militants. The sources added that, in the event that the target was a senior Hamas official with the rank of battalion or brigade commander, the army on several occasions authorized the killing of more than 100 civilians in the assassination of a single commander.</span></p>

<p><span>The following investigation is organized according to the six chronological stages of the Israeli army’s highly automated target production in the early weeks of the Gaza war. First, we explain the Lavender machine itself, which marked tens of thousands of Palestinians using AI. Second, we reveal the “Where’s Daddy?” system, which tracked these targets and signaled to the army when they entered their family homes. Third, we describe how “dumb” bombs were chosen to strike these homes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Fourth, we explain how the army loosened the permitted number of civilians who could be killed during the bombing of a target. Fifth, we note how automated software inaccurately calculated the amount of non-combatants in each household. And sixth, we show how on several occasions, when a home was struck, usually at night, the individual target was sometimes not inside at all, because military officers did not verify the information in real time.</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 1: GENERATING TARGETS</span></h3>
<h3>‘Once you go automatic, target generation goes crazy’</h3>
<p><span>In the Israeli army, the term “human target” referred in the past to a senior military operative who, according to the rules of the military’s International Law Department, can be killed in their private home even if there are civilians around. Intelligence sources told +972 and Local Call that during Israel’s previous wars, since this was an “especially brutal” way to kill someone — often by killing an entire family alongside the target — such human targets were marked very carefully and only senior military commanders were bombed in their homes, to maintain the principle of proportionality under international law.</span></p>
<p><span>But after October 7 — when Hamas-led militants launched a deadly assault on southern Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 240 — the army, the sources said, took a dramatically different approach. Under “Operation Iron Swords,” the army decided to designate all operatives of Hamas’ military wing as human targets, regardless of their rank or military importance. And that changed everything.</span></p>
<p><span>The new policy also posed a technical problem for Israeli intelligence. In previous wars, in order to authorize the assassination of a single human target, an officer had to go through a complex and lengthy “incrimination” process: cross-check evidence that the person was indeed a senior member of Hamas’ military wing, find out where he lived, his contact information, and finally know when he was home in real time. When the list of targets numbered only a few dozen senior operatives, intelligence personnel could individually handle the work involved in incriminating and locating them.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>However, once the list was expanded to include tens of thousands of lower-ranking operatives, the Israeli army figured it had to rely on automated software and artificial intelligence. The result, the sources testify, was that the role of human personnel in incriminating Palestinians as military operatives was pushed aside, and AI did most of the work instead. According to four of the sources who spoke to +972 and Local Call, Lavender — which was developed to create human targets in the current war — has marked some 37,000 Palestinians as suspected “Hamas militants,” most of them junior, for assassination (the IDF Spokesperson denied the existence of such a kill list in a statement to +972 and Local Call).</span></p>
<p><span>“We didn’t know who the junior operatives were, because Israel didn’t track them routinely [before the war],” explained senior officer B. to +972 and Local Call, illuminating the reason behind the development of this particular target machine for the current war. “They wanted to allow us to attack [the junior operatives] automatically. That’s the Holy Grail. Once you go automatic, target generation goes crazy.”</span></p>
<p><span>The sources said that the approval to automatically adopt Lavender’s kill lists, which had previously been used only as an auxiliary tool, was granted about two weeks into the war, after intelligence personnel “manually” checked the accuracy of a random sample of several hundred targets selected by the AI system. When that sample found that Lavender’s results had reached 90 percent accuracy in identifying an individual’s affiliation with Hamas, the army authorized the sweeping use of the system. From that moment, sources said that if Lavender decided an individual was a militant in Hamas, they were essentially asked to treat that as an order, with no requirement to independently check why the machine made that choice or to examine the raw intelligence data on which it is based.</span></p>
<p><span>“At 5 a.m., </span><span>[the air force]</span><span> would come and bomb all the houses that we had marked,” B. said. “We took out thousands of people. We didn’t go through them one by one — we put everything into automated systems, and as soon as one of [the marked individuals] was at home, he immediately became a target. We bombed him and his house.”</span></p>
<p><span>The deadly results of this loosening of restrictions in the early stage of the war were staggering. According to data from the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, on which the Israeli army has </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.mekomit.co.il/%d7%94%d7%a6%d7%91%d7%90-%d7%91%d7%93%d7%a7-%d7%95%d7%9e%d7%a6%d7%90-%d7%a9%d7%93%d7%99%d7%95%d7%95%d7%97%d7%99-%d7%94%d7%94%d7%a8%d7%95%d7%92%d7%99%d7%9d-%d7%91%d7%9e%d7%a9%d7%a8%d7%93-%d7%94%d7%91/"><span>relied almost exclusively</span></a><span> since the beginning of the war, Israel killed some 15,000 Palestinians — almost half of the death toll so far — in the </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-50"><span>first six weeks</span></a><span> of the war, up until a week-long ceasefire was agreed on Nov. 24.</span></p>

<h3>‘The more information and variety, the better’</h3>
<p><span>The Lavender software analyzes information collected on most of the 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip through a system of mass surveillance, then assesses and ranks the likelihood that each particular person is active in the military wing of Hamas or PIJ. According to sources, the machine gives almost every single person in Gaza a rating from 1 to 100, expressing how likely it is that they are a militant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Lavender learns to identify characteristics of known Hamas and PIJ operatives, whose information was fed to the machine as training data, and then to locate these same characteristics — also called “features” — among the general population, the sources explained. An individual found to have several different incriminating features will reach a high rating, and thus automatically becomes a potential target for assassination.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In “The Human-Machine Team,” the book referenced at the beginning of this article, the current commander of Unit 8200 advocates for such a system without referencing Lavender by name. (The commander himself also isn’t named, but five sources in 8200 confirmed that the commander is the author, as </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2021-10-01/ty-article/.highlight/top-israeli-intel-officer-goes-where-no-ones-gone-before-and-its-all-on-amazon/0000017f-e1fb-df7c-a5ff-e3fb21210000"><span>reported</span></a><span> also by Haaretz.) Describing human personnel as a “bottleneck” that limits the army’s capacity during a military operation, The commander laments: “We [humans] cannot process so much information. It doesn’t matter how many people you have tasked to produce targets during the war — you still cannot produce enough targets per day.”</span></p>
<p><span>The solution to this problem, he says, is artificial intelligence. The book offers a short guide to building a “target machine,” similar in description to Lavender, based on AI and machine-learning algorithms. Included in this guide are several examples of the “hundreds and thousands” of features that can increase an individual’s rating, such as being in a Whatsapp group with a known militant, changing cell phone every few months, and changing addresses frequently.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The more information, and the more variety, the better,” the commander writes. “Visual information, cellular information, social media connections, battlefield information, phone contacts, photos.” While humans select these features at first, the commander continues, over time the machine will come to identify features on its own. This, he says, can enable militaries to create “tens of thousands of targets,” while the actual decision as to whether or not to attack them will remain a human one.</span></p>
<p><span>The book isn’t the only time a senior Israeli commander hinted at the existence of human target machines like Lavender. +972 and Local Call have obtained footage of a private lecture given by the commander of Unit 8200’s secretive Data Science and AI center, “Col. Yoav,” at Tel Aviv University’s AI week in 2023, which was </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.geektime.co.il/idf-fights-hamas-with-ai-and-data-science/"><span>reported on</span></a><span> at the time in the Israeli media.</span></p>
<p><span>In the lecture, the commander speaks about a new, sophisticated target machine used by the Israeli army that detects “dangerous people” based on their likeness to existing lists of known militants on which it was trained. “Using the system, we managed to identify Hamas missile squad commanders,” Col. Yoav said in the lecture, referring to Israel’s May 2021 military operation in Gaza, when the machine was used for the first time.&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>The lecture presentation slides, also obtained by +972 and Local Call, contain illustrations of how the machine works: it is fed data about existing Hamas operatives, it learns to notice their features, and then it rates other Palestinians based on how similar they are to the militants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We rank the results and determine the threshold [at which to attack a target],” Col. Yoav said in the lecture, emphasizing that “eventually, people of flesh and blood take the decisions. In the defense realm, ethically speaking, we put a lot of emphasis on this. These tools are meant to help [intelligence officers] break their barriers.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In practice, however, sources who have used Lavender in recent months say human agency and precision were substituted for mass target creation and lethality.</span></p>
<h3>‘There was no “zero-error” policy’</h3>
<p><span>B., a senior officer who used Lavender, echoed to +972 and Local Call that in the current war, officers were not required to independently review the AI system’s assessments, in order to save time and enable the mass production of human targets without hindrances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Everything was statistical, everything was neat — it was very dry,” B. said. He noted that this lack of supervision was permitted despite internal checks showing that Lavender’s calculations were considered accurate only 90 percent of the time; in other words, it was known in advance that 10 percent of the human targets slated for assassination were not members of the Hamas military wing at all.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, sources explained that the Lavender machine sometimes mistakenly flagged individuals who had communication patterns similar to known Hamas or PIJ operatives — including police and civil defense workers, militants’ relatives, residents who happened to have a name and nickname identical to that of an operative, and Gazans who used a device that once belonged to a Hamas operative.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“How close does a person have to be to Hamas to be [considered by an AI machine to be] affiliated with the organization?” said one source critical of Lavender’s inaccuracy. “It’s a vague boundary. Is a person who doesn’t receive a salary from Hamas, but helps them with all sorts of things, a Hamas operative? Is someone who was in Hamas in the past, but is no longer there today, a Hamas operative? Each of these features — characteristics that a machine would flag as suspicious — is inaccurate.”</span></p>
<div id="attachment_177451"><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2024/03/F240224ARK09.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians at the site of an Israeli airstrike in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, February 24, 2024.

</div>
<p><span>Similar problems exist with the ability of target machines to assess the phone used by an individual marked for assassination. “In war, Palestinians change phones all the time,” said the source. “People lose contact with their families, give their phone to a friend or a wife, maybe lose it. There is no way to rely 100 percent on the automatic mechanism that determines which [phone] number belongs to whom.”</span></p>
<p><span>According to the sources, the army knew that the minimal human supervision in place would not discover these faults. “There was no ‘zero-error’ policy. Mistakes were treated statistically,” said a source who used Lavender. “Because of the scope and magnitude, the protocol was that even if you don’t know for sure that the machine is right, you know that statistically it’s fine. So you go for it.”</span></p>
<p><span>“It has proven itself,” said B., the senior source. “There’s something about the statistical approach that sets you to a certain norm and standard. There has been an illogical amount of [bombings] in this operation. This is unparalleled, in my memory. And I have much more trust in a statistical mechanism than a soldier who lost a friend two days ago. Everyone there, including me, lost people on October 7. The machine did it coldly. And that made it easier.”</span></p>
<p><span>Another intelligence source, who defended the reliance on the Lavender-generated kill lists of Palestinian suspects, argued that it was worth investing an intelligence officer’s time only to verify the information if the target was a senior commander in Hamas. “But when it comes to a junior militant, you don’t want to invest manpower and time in it,” he said. “In war, there is no time to incriminate every target. So you’re willing to take the margin of error of using artificial intelligence, risking collateral damage and civilians dying, and risking attacking by mistake, and to live with it.”</span></p>
<p>B. said that the reason for this automation was a constant push to generate more targets for assassination. “In a day without targets [whose feature rating was sufficient to authorize a strike], we attacked at a lower threshold. We were constantly being pressured: ‘Bring us more targets.’ They really shouted at us. We finished [killing] our targets very quickly.”</p>
<p><span>He explained that when lowering the rating threshold of Lavender, it would mark more people as targets for strikes. “At its peak, the system managed to generate 37,000 people as potential human targets,” said B. “But the numbers changed all the time, because it depends on where you set the bar of what a Hamas operative is. There were times when a Hamas operative was defined more broadly, and then the machine started bringing us all kinds of civil defense personnel, police officers, on whom it would be a shame to waste bombs. They help the Hamas government, but they don’t really endanger soldiers.”</span></p>

</div>
<h3>‘We only checked that the target was a man’</h3>
<p><span>The Israeli military flatly rejects these claims. In a statement to +972 and Local Call, the IDF Spokesperson denied using artificial intelligence to incriminate targets, saying these are merely “auxiliary tools that assist officers in the process of incrimination.” The statement went on: “In any case, an independent examination by an [intelligence] analyst is required, which verifies that the identified targets are legitimate targets for attack, in accordance with the conditions set forth in IDF directives and international law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, sources said that the only human supervision protocol in place before bombing the houses of suspected “junior” militants marked by Lavender was to conduct a single check: ensuring that the AI-selected target is male rather than female. The assumption in the army was that if it were a woman, the machine had likely made a mistake, because there are no women among the ranks of the military wings of Hamas and PIJ.</span></p>
<p><span>“A human being had to [verify the target] for just a few seconds,” B. said, explaining that this became the protocol after realizing the Lavender system was “getting it right” most of the time. “At first, we did checks to ensure that the machine didn’t get confused. But at some point we relied on the automatic system, and we only checked that [the target] was a man — that was enough. It doesn’t take a long time to tell if someone has a male or a female voice.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To conduct the male/female check, B. claimed that in the current war, “I would invest 20 seconds for each target at this stage, and do dozens of them every day. I had zero added value as a human, apart from being a stamp of approval. It saved a lot of time. If [the operative] came up in the automated mechanism, and I checked that he was a man, there would be permission to bomb him, subject to an examination of collateral damage.”</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>In practice, sources said this meant that for civilian men marked in error by Lavender, there was no supervising mechanism in place to detect the mistake.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 2: LINKING TARGETS TO FAMILY HOMES</span></h3>
<h3>‘Most of the people you killed were women and children’</h3>
<p><span>The next stage in the Israeli army’s assassination procedure is identifying where to attack the targets that Lavender generates.</span></p>
<p><span>In a statement to +972 and Local Call, the IDF Spokesperson claimed in response to this article that “Hamas places its operatives and military assets in the heart of the civilian population, systematically uses the civilian population as human shields, and conducts fighting from within civilian structures, including sensitive sites such as hospitals, mosques, schools and UN facilities. The IDF is bound by and acts according to international law, directing its attacks only at military targets and military operatives.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The six sources we spoke to echoed this to some degree, saying that Hamas’ extensive </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/02/12/world/middleeast/gaza-tunnel-israel-hamas.html"><span>tunnel system</span></a><span> deliberately passes under hospitals and schools; that Hamas militants use ambulances to get around; and that countless military assets have been situated near civilian buildings. The sources argued that many Israeli strikes kill civilians as a result of these tactics by Hamas — a characterization that human rights groups <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/03/19/israeli-forces-conduct-gaza">warn</a> evades Israel’s onus for inflicting the casualties.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, in contrast to the Israeli army’s official statements, the sources explained that a major reason for the unprecedented death toll from Israel’s current bombardment is the fact that the army has systematically attacked targets in their private homes, alongside their families — in part because it was easier from an intelligence standpoint to mark family houses using automated systems.</span></p>
<p><span>Indeed, several sources emphasized that, as opposed to numerous cases of Hamas operatives engaging in military activity from civilian areas, in the case of systematic assassination strikes, the army routinely made the active choice to bomb suspected militants when inside civilian households from which no military activity took place. This choice, they said, was a reflection of the way Israel’s system of mass surveillance in Gaza is designed.</span></p>

<p><span>The sources told +972 and Local Call that since everyone in Gaza had a private house with which they could be associated, the army’s surveillance systems could easily and automatically “link” individuals to family houses. In order to identify the moment operatives enter their houses in real time, various additional automatic softwares have been developed. These programs track thousands of individuals simultaneously, identify when they are at home, and send an automatic alert to the targeting officer, who then marks the house for bombing. One of several of these tracking softwares, revealed here for the first time, is called “Where’s Daddy?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“You put hundreds [of targets] into the system and wait to see who you can kill,” said one source with knowledge of the system. “It’s called broad hunting: you copy-paste from the lists that the target system produces.”</span></p>
<p><span>Evidence of this policy is also clear from the data: during the first month of the war, more than half of the fatalities — 6,120 people — belonged to 1,340 families, many of which were completely wiped out while inside their homes, according to </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-day-45"><span>UN figures</span></a><span>. The proportion of entire </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.972mag.com/gaza-families-bombing-humanitarian-crisis/"><span>families</span></a><span> bombed in their houses in the current war is much higher </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.btselem.org/download/201501_black_flag_eng.pdf"><span>than in the 2014 Israeli operation</span></a><span> in Gaza, further suggesting the prominence of this policy.</span></p>
<p><span>Another source said that each time the pace of assassinations waned, more targets were added to systems like Where’s Daddy? to locate individuals that entered their homes and could therefore be bombed. He said that the decision of who to put into the tracking systems could be made by relatively low-ranking officers in the military hierarchy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“One day, totally of my own accord, I added something like 1,200 new targets to the [tracking] system, because the number of attacks [we were conducting] decreased,” the source said. “That made sense to me. In retrospect, it seems like a serious decision I made. And such decisions were not made at high levels.”</span></p>
<p><span>The sources said that in the first two weeks of the war, “several thousand” targets were initially inputted into locating programs like Where’s Daddy?. These included all the members of Hamas’ elite special forces unit the Nukhba, all of Hamas’ anti-tank operatives, and anyone who entered Israel on October 7. But before long, the kill list was drastically expanded.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“In the end it was everyone [marked by Lavender],” one source explained. “Tens of thousands. This happened a few weeks later, when the [Israeli] brigades entered Gaza, and there were already fewer uninvolved people [i.e. civilians] in the northern areas.” According to this source, even some minors were marked by Lavender as targets for bombing. “Normally, operatives are over the age of 17, but that was not a condition.”</span></p>

<p><span>Lavender and systems like Where’s Daddy? were thus combined with deadly effect, killing entire families, sources said. By adding a name from the Lavender-generated lists to the Where’s Daddy? home tracking system, A. explained, the marked person would be placed under ongoing surveillance, and could be attacked as soon as they set foot in their home, collapsing the house on everyone inside.</span></p>
<p><span>“Let’s say you calculate [that there is one] Hamas [operative] plus 10 [civilians in the house],” A. said. “Usually, these 10 will be women and children. So absurdly, it turns out that most of the people you killed were women and children.”</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 3: CHOOSING A WEAPON</span></h3>
<h3>‘We usually carried out the attacks with “dumb bombs”’</h3>
<p><span>Once Lavender has marked a target for assassination, army personnel have verified that they are male, and tracking software has located the target in their home, the next stage is picking the munition with which to bomb them.</span></p>
<p><span>In December 2023, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/13/politics/intelligence-assessment-dumb-bombs-israel-gaza/index.html"><span>CNN reported</span></a> <span>that according to U.S. intelligence estimates, about 45 percent of the munitions used by the Israeli air force in Gaza were “dumb” bombs, which are known to cause more collateral damage than guided bombs. In response to the CNN report, an army spokesperson quoted in the article said: “A</span><span>s a military committed to international law and a moral code of conduct, we are devoting vast resources to minimizing harm to the civilians that Hamas has forced into the role of human shields. Our war is against Hamas, not against the people of Gaza.”</span></p>
<p><span>Three intelligence sources, however, told +972 and Local Call that junior operatives marked by Lavender were assassinated only with dumb bombs, in the interest of saving more expensive armaments. The implication, one source explained, was that the army would not strike a junior target if they lived in a high-rise building, because the army did not want to spend a more precise and expensive “floor bomb” (with more limited collateral effect) to kill him. But if a junior target lived in a building with only a few floors, the army was authorized to kill him and everyone in the building with a dumb bomb.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>“It was like that with all the junior targets,” testified C., who used various automated programs in the current war. “The only question was, is it possible to attack the building in terms of collateral damage? Because we usually carried out the attacks with dumb bombs, and that meant literally destroying the whole house on top of its occupants. But even if an attack is averted, you don’t care — you immediately move on to the next target. Because of the system, the targets never end. You have another 36,000 waiting.”</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 4: AUTHORIZING CIVILIAN CASUALTIES</span></h3>
<h3>‘We attacked almost without considering collateral damage’</h3>
<p><span>One source said that when attacking junior operatives, including those marked by AI systems like Lavender, the number of civilians they were allowed to kill alongside each target was fixed during the initial weeks of the war at up to 20. Another source claimed the fixed number was up to 15. These “collateral damage degrees,” as the military calls them, were applied broadly to all suspected junior militants, the sources said, regardless of their rank, military importance, and age, and with no specific case-by-case examination to weigh the military advantage of assassinating them against the expected harm to civilians.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to A., who was an officer in a target operation room in the current war, the army’s international law department has never before given such “sweeping approval” for such a high collateral damage degree. “It’s not just that you can kill any person who is a Hamas soldier, which is clearly permitted and legitimate in terms of international law,” A. said. “But they directly tell you: ‘You are allowed to kill them along with many civilians.’&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Every person who wore a Hamas uniform in the past year or two could be bombed with 20 [civilians killed as] collateral damage, even without special permission,” A. continued. “In practice, the principle of proportionality did not exist.”</span></p>
<p><span>According to A., this was the policy for most of the time that he served. Only later did the military lower the collateral damage degree. “In this calculation, it could also be 20 children for a junior operative … It really wasn’t like that in the past,” A. explained. Asked about the security rationale behind this policy, A. replied: “Lethality.”</span></p>
<div id="attachment_177453"><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2024/03/F231107ARK20.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians wait to receive the bodies of their relatives who were killed in Israeli airstrikes, at Al-Najjar Hospital in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, November 7, 2023.

</div>
<p><span>The predetermined and fixed collateral damage degree helped accelerate the mass creation of targets using the Lavender machine, sources said, because it saved time. B. claimed that the number of civilians they were permitted to kill per suspected junior militant marked by AI in the first week of the war, was fifteen, but that this number “went up and down” over time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“At first we attacked almost without considering collateral damage,” B. said of the first week after October 7. “In practice, you didn’t really count people [in each house that is bombed], because you couldn’t really tell if they’re at home or not. After a week, restrictions on collateral damage began. The number dropped [from 15] to five, which made it really difficult for us to attack, because if the whole family was home, we couldn’t bomb it. Then they raised the number again.”</span></p>
<h3>‘We knew we would kill over 100 civilians’</h3>
<p><span>Sources told +972 and Local Call that now, partly due to American pressure, the Israeli army is no longer mass-generating junior human targets for bombing in civilian homes. The fact that most homes in the Gaza Strip were already destroyed or damaged, and almost the entire population has been displaced, also impaired the army’s ability to rely on intelligence databases and automated house-locating programs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>E. claimed that the massive bombardment of junior militants took place only in the first week or two of the war, and then was stopped mainly so as not to waste bombs. “There is a munitions economy,” E. said. “They were always afraid that there would be [a war] in the northern arena [with Hezbollah in Lebanon]. They don’t attack these kinds of [junior] people at all anymore.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, airstrikes against senior ranking Hamas commanders are still ongoing, and sources said that for these attacks, the military is authorizing the killing of “hundreds” of civilians per target — an official policy for which there is no historical precedent in Israel, or even in recent U.S. military operations.</span></p>
<p><span>“In the bombing of the commander of the Shuja’iya Battalion, we knew that we would kill over 100 civilians,” B. recalled of a Dec. 2 bombing that the IDF Spokesperson </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-strike-kills-gazan-terrorist-responsible-for-attack-that-killed-oron-shaul-in-2014/"><span>said</span></a><span> was aimed at assassinating Wisam Farhat. “For me, psychologically, it was unusual. Over 100 civilians — it crosses some red line.”</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>Amjad Al-Sheikh, a young Palestinian from Gaza, said many of his family members were killed in that bombing. A resident of Shuja’iya, east of Gaza City, he was at a local supermarket that day when he heard five blasts that shattered the glass windows.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I ran to my family’s house, but there were no buildings there anymore,” Al-Sheikh told +972 and Local Call. “The street was filled with screams and smoke. Entire residential blocks turned to mountains of rubble and deep pits. People began to search in the cement, using their hands, and so did I, looking for signs of my family’s house.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Al-Sheikh’s wife and baby daughter survived — protected from the rubble by a closet that fell on top of them — but he found 11 other members of his family, among them his sisters, brothers, and their young children, dead under the rubble. </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.btselem.org/hebrew/gaza_strip/20231205_israel_is_not_fighting_against_hamas_but_against_civilians_implementing_a_criminal_policy_of_bombings"><span>According to</span></a><span> the human rights group B’Tselem, the bombing that day destroyed dozens of buildings, killed dozens of people, and buried hundreds under the ruins of their homes.</span></p>
<h3>‘Entire families were killed’</h3>
<p><span>Intelligence sources told +972 and Local Call they took part in even deadlier strikes. In order to assassinate Ayman Nofal, the commander of Hamas’ Central Gaza Brigade, a source said the army authorized the killing of approximately 300 civilians, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/ryxl6b2116"><span>destroying several buildings</span></a><span> in airstrikes on Al-Bureij refugee camp on Oct. 17 based on an imprecise pinpointing of Nofal. Satellite footage and </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://twitter.com/Roaastudies/status/1714253580792643820"><span>videos</span></a><span> from the scene show the destruction of several large multi-storey apartment buildings.</span></p>
<p><span>“Between 16 to 18 houses were wiped out in the attack,” Amro Al-Khatib, a resident of the camp, told +972 and Local Call. “We couldn’t tell one apartment from the other — they all got mixed up in the rubble, and we found human body parts everywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span>In the aftermath, Al-Khatib recalled around 50 dead bodies being pulled out of the rubble, and around 200 people wounded, many of them gravely. But that was just the first day. The camp’s residents spent five days pulling the dead and injured out, he said.</span></p>

<p><span>Nael Al-Bahisi, a paramedic, was one of the first on the scene. He counted between 50-70 casualties on that first day. “At a certain moment, we understood the target of the strike was Hamas commander Ayman Nofal,” he told +972 and Local Call. “They killed him, and also many people who didn’t know he was there. Entire families with children were killed.”</span></p>
<p><span>Another intelligence source told +972 and Local Call that the army </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/defense/article/14992654"><span>destroyed a high-rise building</span></a><span> in Rafah in mid-December, killing “dozens of civilians,” in order </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/defense/article/14992654"><span>to try to kill</span></a><span> Mohammed Shabaneh, the commander of Hamas’ Rafah Brigade (it is not clear whether or not he was killed in the attack). Often, the source said, the senior commanders hide in tunnels that pass under civilian buildings, and therefore the choice to assassinate them with an airstrike necessarily kills civilians.</span></p>
<p><span>“Most of those injured were children,” said Wael Al-Sir, 55, who witnessed the large-scale strike believed by some Gazans to have been the assassination attempt. He told +972 and Local Call that the bombing on Dec. 20 destroyed an “entire residential block” and killed at least 10 children.</span></p>
<p><span>“There was a completely permissive policy regarding the casualties of [bombing] operations — so permissive that in my opinion it had an element of revenge,” D., an intelligence source, claimed. “The core of this was the assassinations of senior [Hamas and PIJ commanders] for whom they were willing to kill hundreds of civilians. We had a calculation: how many for a brigade commander, how many for a battalion commander, and so on.”</span></p>
<p><span>“There were regulations, but they were just very lenient,” said E., another intelligence source. “We’ve killed people with collateral damage in the high double digits, if not low triple digits. These are things that haven’t happened before.”</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>Such a high rate of “collateral damage” is exceptional not only compared to what the Israeli army previously deemed acceptable, but also compared to the wars waged by the United States in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>General Peter Gersten, </span><span>Deputy Commander for Operations and Intelligence </span><span>in the operation to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.defensedaily.com/pentagon-removed-non-combatant-casualty-cut-off-value-doctrine-2018/pentagon/"><span>told</span></a><span> a U.S. defense magazine in 2021 that an attack with collateral damage of 15 civilians deviated from procedure; to carry it out, he had to obtain special permission from the head of the U.S. Central Command, General Lloyd Austin, who is now Secretary of Defense.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“With Osama Bin Laden, you’d have an NCV [Non-combatant Casualty Value] of 30, but if you had a low-level commander, his NCV was typically zero,” Gersten said. “We ran zero for the longest time.”</span></p>
<h3>‘We were told: “Whatever you can, bomb”’</h3>
<p><span>All the sources interviewed for this investigation said that Hamas’ massacres on October 7 and kidnapping of hostages greatly influenced the army’s fire policy and collateral damage degrees. “At first, the atmosphere was painful and vindictive,” said B., who was drafted into the army immediately after October 7, and served in a target operation room. “The rules were very lenient. They took down four buildings when they knew the target was in one of them. It was crazy.</span></p>
<p><span>“There was a dissonance: on the one hand, people here were frustrated that we were not attacking enough,” B. continued. “On the other hand, you see at the end of the day that another thousand Gazans have died, most of them civilians.”</span></p>
<p><span>“There was hysteria in the professional ranks,” said D., who was also drafted immediately after October 7. “They had no idea how to react at all. The only thing they knew to do was to just start bombing like madmen to try to dismantle Hamas’ capabilities.”</span></p>

<p>D. stressed that they were not explicitly told that the army’s goal was “revenge,” but expressed that “as soon as every target connected to Hamas becomes legitimate, and with almost any collateral damage being approved, it is clear to you that thousands of people are going to be killed. Even if officially every target is connected to Hamas, when the policy is so permissive, it loses all meaning.”</p>
<p><span>A. also used the word “revenge” to describe the atmosphere inside the army after October 7. “No one thought about what to do afterward, when the war is over, or how it will be possible to live in Gaza and what they will do with it,” A. said. “We were told: now we have to fuck up Hamas, no matter what the cost. Whatever you can, you bomb.”</span></p>
<p><span>B., the senior intelligence source, said that in retrospect, he believes this “disproportionate” policy of killing Palestinians in Gaza also endangers Israelis, and that this was one of the reasons he decided to be interviewed.</span></p>
<p><span>“In the short term, we are safer, because we hurt Hamas. But I think we’re less secure in the long run. I see how all the bereaved families in Gaza — which is nearly everyone — will raise the motivation for [people to join] Hamas 10 years down the line. And it will be much easier for [Hamas] to recruit them.”</span></p>
<p><span>In a statement to +972 and Local Call, the Israeli army denied much of what the sources told us, claiming that “each target is examined individually, while an individual assessment is made of the military advantage and collateral damage expected from the attack … The IDF does not carry out attacks when the collateral damage expected from the attack is excessive in relation to the military advantage.”</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 5: CALCULATING COLLATERAL DAMAGE</span></h3>
<h3>‘The model was not connected to reality’</h3>
<p><span>According to the intelligence sources, the Israeli army’s calculation of the number of civilians expected to be killed in each house alongside a target — a procedure examined in a </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.972mag.com/mass-assassination-factory-israel-calculated-bombing-gaza/"><span>previous investigation</span></a><span> by +972 and Local Call — was conducted with the help of automatic and inaccurate tools. In previous wars, intelligence personnel would spend a lot of time verifying how many people were in a house that was set to be bombed, with the number of civilians liable to be killed listed as part of a “target file.” After October 7, however, this thorough verification was largely abandoned in favor of automation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In October, The New York Times </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/world/middleeast/gaza-invasion-israel-cellphone-data.html"><span>reported</span></a><span> on a system operated from a special base in southern Israel, which collects information from mobile phones in the Gaza Strip and provided the military with a live estimate of the number of Palestinians who fled the northern Gaza Strip southward. Brig. General Udi Ben Muha told the Times that “It’s not a 100 percent perfect system — but it gives you the information you need to make a decision.” The system operates according to colors: red marks areas where there are many people, and green and yellow mark areas that have been relatively cleared of residents.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>The sources who spoke to +972 and Local Call described a similar system for calculating collateral damage, which was used to decide whether to bomb a building in Gaza. They said that the software calculated the number of civilians residing in each home before the war — by assessing the size of the building and reviewing its list of residents — and then reduced those numbers by the proportion of residents who supposedly evacuated the neighborhood.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To illustrate, if the army estimated that half of a neighborhood’s residents had left, the program would count a house that usually had 10 residents as a house containing five people. To save time, the sources said, the army did not surveil the homes to check how many people were actually living there, as it did in previous operations, to find out if the program’s estimate was indeed accurate.</span></p>
<p><span>“This model was not connected to reality,” claimed one source. “There was no connection between those who were in the home now, during the war, and those who were listed as living there prior to the war. [On one occasion] we bombed a house without knowing that there were several families inside, hiding together.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The source said that although the army knew that such errors could occur, this imprecise model was adopted nonetheless, because it was faster. As such, the source said, “the collateral damage calculation was completely automatic and statistical” — even producing figures that were not whole numbers.</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 6: BOMBING A FAMILY HOME</span></h3>
<h3>‘You killed a family for no reason’</h3>
<p><span>The sources who spoke to +972 and Local Call explained that there was sometimes a substantial gap between the moment that tracking systems like Where’s Daddy? alerted an officer that a target had entered their house, and the bombing itself — leading to the killing of whole families even without hitting the army’s target. “It happened to me many times that we attacked a house, but the person wasn’t even home,” one source said. “The result is that you killed a family for no reason.”</span></p>
<p><span>Three intelligence sources told +972 and Local Call that they had witnessed an incident in which the Israeli army bombed a family’s private home, and it later turned out that the intended target of the assassination was not even inside the house, since no further verification was conducted in real time.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_174976"><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2023/11/F231106ARK01.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians receive the bodies of relatives who were killed in Israeli airstrikes, Al-Najjar Hospital, southern Gaza Strip, November 6, 2023.

<p><span>“Sometimes [the target] was at home earlier, and then at night he went to sleep somewhere else, say underground, and you didn’t know about it,” one of the sources said. “There are times when you double-check the location, and there are times when you just say, ‘Okay, he was in the house in the last few hours, so you can just bomb.’”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another source described a similar incident that affected him and made him want to be interviewed for this investigation. “We understood that the target was home at 8 p.m. In the end, the air force bombed the house at 3 a.m. Then we found out [in that span of time] he had managed to move himself to another house with his family. There were two other families with children in the building we bombed.”</span></p>
<p><span>In previous wars in Gaza, after the assassination of human targets, Israeli intelligence would carry out bomb damage assessment (BDA) procedures — a routine post-strike check to see if the senior commander was killed and how many civilians were killed along with him. As revealed in a </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://www.972mag.com/gaza-soldiers-civilians-intelligence/"><span>previous +972 and Local Call investigation</span></a><span>, this involved listening in to phone calls of relatives who lost their loved ones. In the current war, however, at least in relation to junior militants marked using AI, sources say this procedure was abolished in order to save time. The sources said they did not know how many civilians were actually killed in each strike, and for the low-ranking suspected Hamas and PIJ operatives marked by AI, they did not even know whether the target himself was killed.</span></p>
<div>
<h3>Most read on +972</h3>

</div>
<p><span>“You don’t know exactly how many you killed, and who you killed,” an intelligence source </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240403151726/https://twitter.com/yuval_abraham/status/1750123648533324158?lang=en"><span>told Local Call</span></a><span> for a previous investigation published in January. “Only when it’s senior Hamas operatives do you follow the BDA procedure. In the rest of the cases, you don’t care. You get a report from the air force about whether the building was blown up, and that’s it. You have no idea how much collateral damage there was; you immediately move on to the next target. The emphasis was to create as many targets as possible, as quickly as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span>But while the Israeli military may move on from each strike without dwelling on the number of casualties, Amjad Al-Sheikh, the Shuja’iya resident who lost 11 of his family members in the Dec. 2 bombardment, said that he and his neighbors are still searching for corpses.</span></p>
<p><span>“Until now, there are bodies under the rubble,” he said. “Fourteen residential buildings were bombed with their residents inside. Some of my relatives and neighbors are still buried.”</span></p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Plandex can provide a significant boost to your productivity, but as with any other AI tool, you shouldn't expect perfect results. Always review a plan carefully before applying changes, especially if security is involved. Plandex is designed to get you 80-90% of the way there rather than 100%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Due to the reasoning limitations of LLMs, automatically applied file updates also aren't perfect. While these can be improved over time with better prompting strategies (contributions welcome) and better models, be prepared for occasional updates that aren't quite right. Use the <code>plandex changes</code> command to review pending updates in a TUI. If a file update has mistakes, make those changes yourself with copy-and-paste and reject the file in the changes TUI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The more direction and detail you provide, the better the results will be. Working with Plandex often involves giving it a prompt, seeing that the results are a bit off, then using <code>plandex rewind</code> to go back and iterate on the prompt or add context before trying again. Branches are also useful for trying different approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">While it can be tempting to just dump your entire project into context if it fits under the token limit, with current models you will tend to see better results (and pay less) by being more selective about what's loaded into context.</p>

<p dir="auto">Hi, I'm Dane. I've been building and launching software products for 17 years. I went through YCombinator in winter 2018 with my devops security company, <a href="https://envkey.com/" rel="nofollow">EnvKey</a>, which I continue to run today. I'm fascinated by LLMs and their potential to transform the practice of software development.</p>
<p dir="auto">I live with my wife and 4 year old daughter on the SF peninsula in California. I grew up in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York. I like reading fiction, listening to podcasts, fitness, and surfing.</p>
