                         <p>
            September 11th, 2023</p><!-- .entry-meta -->
        <p>There was a spike in Explorer crashes that resulted in the instruction pointer out in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<pre>0:000&gt; r
eax=00000001 ebx=008bf8aa ecx=77231cf3 edx=00000000 esi=008bf680 edi=008bf8a8
eip=7077c100 esp=008bf664 ebp=008bf678 iopl=0         nv up ei pl zr na pe nc
cs=0023  ss=002b  ds=002b  es=002b  fs=0053  gs=002b             efl=00010246
7077c100 ??              ???
</pre>
<p>Maybe the return address tells us something.</p>
<pre>0:000&gt; u poi esp
008bf6d4 test    eax,eax
008bf6d6 je      008bf6b9
008bf6d8 xor     edi,edi
008bf6da cmp     dword ptr [esi+430h],edi
</pre>
<p>It’s strange that we’re executing from someplace that has no name. If you look closely, you’ll see that we are executing code <i>from the stack</i>: <code>esp</code> is <code>008bf664</code>, so the code that went haywire is on the stack.</p>
<p>Who executes code from the stack?</p>
<p>Malware, that’s who.</p>
<p>Let’s see what this malware is trying to do.</p>
<p>Disassembling around the last known good code address gives us this:</p>
<pre>008bf6c4 call    dword ptr [esi+214h]
008bf6ca inc     dword ptr [ebp+8]
008bf6cd push    edi
008bf6ce call    dword ptr [esi+210h]   ; this called into space
008bf6d4 test    eax,eax
008bf6d6 je      008bf6b9
008bf6d8 xor     edi,edi
008bf6da cmp     dword ptr [esi+430h],edi
008bf6e0 je      008bf70d
</pre>
<p>It looks like the payload stored function pointers at <code>esi+210</code> and <code>esi+214</code>. Let’s see what’s there. This is probably where the payload stashed all its call targets.</p>
<pre>0:000&gt; dps @esi+200
008bf880  1475ff71
008bf884  00000004
008bf888  76daecf0 kernel32!WaitForSingleObject
008bf88c  76daeb00 kernel32!CloseHandle
<span>008bf890  7077c100</span>
<span>008bf894  76dada90</span> kernel32!SleepStub
008bf898  76db6a40 kernel32!ExitProcessImplementation
008bf89c  76daf140 kernel32!RemoveDirectoryW
008bf8a0  76da6e30 kernel32!GetLastErrorStub
008bf8a4  770d53f0 user32!ExitWindowsEx
008bf8a8  003a0043
008bf8ac  0050005c
008bf8b0  006f0072
008bf8b4  00720067
008bf8b8  006d0061
</pre>
<p>Yup, there’s a payload of function pointers here. It looks like this malware is going to wait for something, and then exit the process, or remove a directory, or exit Windows. Those bytes after <code>user32!ExitWindowsEx</code> look like a Unicode string, so let’s dump them as a string:</p>
<pre>0:000&gt; du 008bf8a8  
008bf8a8  "C:\Program Files\Contoso\contoso_update.exe"
</pre>
<p>Wait, what? It is trying to mess around with Contoso’s auto-updater?</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at more of the malware payload. Maybe we can figure out what it’s doing. It looks like it’s using <code>esi</code> as its base of operations, so let’s disassemble from <code>esi</code>.</p>
<pre>008bf684 push    ebp                        ; build stack frame

<p>Aha, this isn’t malware. This is an uninstaller!</p>
<p>The mystery function is almost certainly <code>DeleteFileW</code>. It’s waiting for the main uninstaller to exit, so it can delete the binary.</p>
<p>There is a page on CodeProject that shows how to write a self-deleting file, and it seems that multiple companies have decided to use that code to implement their own uninstallers. (Whether they follow the licensing terms for that code I do not know.)</p>
<p>Okay, so why did we crash? What went wrong with <code>DeleteFileW</code>?</p>
<p>According to the dump file, the spot where <code>DeleteFileW</code> was supposed to be instead holds <code>7077c100</code>. This is a function pointer into some mystery DLL that isn’t loaded. How did that happen?</p>
<p>My guess is that the <code>DeleteFileW</code> function was detoured in the Contoso uninstaller. When the uninstaller tried to built its table of useful functions, it ended up getting not the address of <code>DeleteFileW</code> but the address of a detour. It then tried to call that detour from its payload, but since the detour is not installed in Explorer (or if it is, the detour is in some other location), it ended up calling into space.</p>
<p>Neither code injection nor detouring is officially supported. I can’t tell who did the detouring. Maybe somebody added a detour to the uninstaller, unaware that the uninstaller is going to inject a call to the detour into Explorer. Or maybe the detour was injected by anti-malware software. Or maybe the detour was injected by Windows’ own application compatibility layer. Whatever the reason, the result was a crash in Explorer.</p>
<p>Which means that people like me spend a lot of time studying these crashes to figure out what is going on, only to conclude that they were caused by other people abusing the system.</p>
<p>If you want to create a self-deleting binary, please don’t use code injection into somebody else’s process. Here’s a way to delete a binary and leave no trace:</p>
<p>Create a temporary file called <code>cleanup.js</code> that goes like this:</p>
<pre>var fso = new ActiveXObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject");
fso.DeleteFile("C:\\Users\\Name\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\cleanup.js");

var path = "C:\\Program Files\\Contoso\\contoso_update.exe";
for (var count = 0; fso.FileExists(path) &amp;&amp; count &lt; 40; count++) {
    try { fso.DeleteFile(path); break; } catch (e) { }
    WSH.Sleep(500);
}
</pre>
<p>This script deletes itself and then tries to delete <code>contoso_update.exe</code> for 20 seconds. Run it with <code>wscript cleanup.js</code> and let it do its thing. No code injection, no detours, all documented.</p>

No such guide exists. Nor will one ever exist. Finding PMF is too squishy.

Though there’s no formula for finding PMF, you can significantly increase your odds, and save yourself a lot of time and heartache, by studying the lessons of those who’ve made it.

The group that you haven’t achieved product-market fit with is the one you really want to target.</strong></p><p>It always surprises people to hear that, at YouTube, we never thought we had a product-market fit. We had 100 million DAUs and almost a billion monthly actives, and yet we did not have our desired audience. We had teenagers but not adults. We were envious of the satisfaction those folks were finding on Netflix, Facebook, or wherever. In my experience, you’re always stretching product-market fit. I don’t think there’s a moment where you’re done with product-market fit.”</p></blockquote><p>You may not feel like you have PMF even when you reach 100 customers:</p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>I remember with the first 100 or so customers, every customer kind of felt like the last customer we would get, to be honest. </strong><span>We were like, I can’t believe DoorDash is using this product. That’s incredible! We were so proud. Unlike on the B2C side, there was no sort of viral loop that got going that made us think, ‘Okay, we found it.’ Instead, it really was kind of just pushing the boulder at a pretty steep trajectory uphill, over and over.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dvdhsu/" rel="">David Hsu</a><span>, founder and CEO of </span><strong>Retool</strong></p></blockquote><p>Or at $100M/year in revenue:</p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>The fear of hitting a wall and collapsing was always there. Even when we were at 100 million in revenue, there was always this fear that we were suddenly going to crash into a wall and everything would stop.</strong></p><p><span>There are all these horror stories in Silicon Valley of these companies who got to 150 or 200 million revenue and then didn’t grow. So there was always this fear that it was going to happen to us as well. </span><strong>Your product-market fit is always with respect to a particular market. </strong><span>It might be small companies, or medium-size companies, or enterprises. The small companies don’t want your stuff, or the U.S. market doesn’t want your stuff, or the Asian market, and so on. Eventually, at some point you become a multi-product company, so then the whole game repeats itself again and again and again. You have to revamp and change things significantly, which is its own challenge.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alighodsi/" rel="">Ali Ghodsi</a><span>, co-founder and CEO of </span><strong>Databricks</strong></p></blockquote><p>In fact, you might never fully feel PMF:</p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>I never felt at any point of time like, ah, now I have product-market fit.</strong><span> I always felt like there was always something for us to improve on—whether it was growth or product or customer care. I’m always seeing what more we can do to solve problems on behalf of our customers.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomerlondon/" rel="">Tomer London</a><span>, co-founder and CPO of </span><strong>Gusto</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>“I’ve spent most of the history of Hex paranoid that we’re not at PMF, or there’s more to do. I think our vision is big enough and that, at any point, even when I have thousands of people telling us this thing is awesome, I still feel like, ‘Yeah, but there’s this bigger thing we want to do.’ </span><strong>I don’t feel like we have product-market fit for the ultimate vision we have yet.</strong><span> And so that’ll take time, obviously.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrymccardel/" rel="">Barry McCardel</a><span>, co-founder and CEO of </span><strong>Hex</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>I don’t even know if today we have true product-market fit.</strong><span> If you’re going down the venture path, what I tell other founders is that anytime you raise, your product-market fit is gone, because whatever you raised, the next raise effectively demolished it. </span><strong>You now have to hit the next bar of product-market fit.</strong><span> What we have today at the series A and series B, I consider it strong product-market fit. But that’s because we were able to grow into the valuation and what the stature of the company should have been at those respective stages.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-song-25198b24/" rel="">Rick Song</a><span>, founder and CEO of </span><strong>Persona</strong></p></blockquote><p><span>PMF is never a binary yes-or-no moment. It’s instead a gradual process of finding fit with larger and larger segments, as </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorilallo/" rel="">Jori Lallo</a><span>, co-founder of </span><strong>Linear</strong><span>, describes:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“PMF has been so gradual; I might even say . . . linear. There’s not just one hump that we got over and thought, ‘Okay, now it’s clicking.’ </span><strong>It’s more like we’re chipping away at these obstacles and getting more and more people interested.</strong><span> It’s more like, ‘Oh, this is really working for certain segments.’”</span></p></blockquote><p>Though you may never feel everlasting product-market fit, you need to start somewhere. I asked every founder when they first felt product-market fit, and their answers fell along a spectrum that provides a useful guide to finding ever-increasing PMF:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong><span> Get one company to love your product</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong><span> Get one company to pay (a meaningful amount of money) for your product</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong><span>: Get more than one company to love and pay for your product</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4:</strong><span> Start noticing a shift from push to pull, and organic growth</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5:</strong><span> Keep growing consistently</span></p></li></ul><p>Below, I’ll explore each step in-depth, and share stories from founders of the moment they finally felt PMF.</p><p>Start your PMF journey by becoming obsessed with getting one company to love, use, and continue to use your product. Do whatever it takes to make them successful.</p><p><span>In the case of </span><strong>Figma</strong><span>, co-founder Dylan Field became obsessed with the success of their first real user, Coda (originally called Krypton):</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“There was a weekend when we had a bug and the product wasn’t working very well because it hadn’t been released yet; it was an alpha. And Dylan was freaking out. He’s like, ‘There’s a bug.’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah, we’ll fix it, but we’ve got other stuff going on.’ He’s like, ‘We have to call a red alert.’ I’m like, ‘Dude, what are you talking about? We haven’t shipped this thing yet. There’s no such thing as a red alert because it’s not shipped.’ </span><strong>And he’s like, ‘You don’t understand. There are customers depending on us.</strong><span> There’s this company called Krypton.’ So I was like, ‘Okay, they haven’t paid us any money, nobody even knows we exist, but I guess we’ll deal with it.’</span></p><p><span>I actually came to appreciate Dylan’s mindset, because a lot of founders don’t give a shit about their customers. They want to understand the customers, but just enough to figure out what features they would be willing to pay for. </span><strong>But at the end of the day, Dylan was thinking about it in terms of trust. He was like, ‘Look, I convinced this guy to use our product. They’re actually trying to use it for work, and if we fuck it up for them, I don’t want that on my conscience. I want to do whatever I can to make sure that we’re holding up our end of the bargain. Because they believed in me.’</strong></p><p>They’re still customers; they were our first customer.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shokuwamoto/" rel="">Sho Kuwamoto</a><span>, VP of Product</span></p></blockquote><p><strong>Coda</strong><span> itself went through this same journey with their first customer, Springful:</span></p><blockquote><p>“My former colleague Noam Lovinsky [now CPO at Grammarly] was starting a company called Springful. I said to him, ‘Hey, would you use Krypton [our name at the time]?’ They started using it, and for a while, it went well. They were getting a lot of use out of it. We had a chart of what the DAUs looked like, and because they had six employees, the chart basically sat at 6 every day, except for on the weekends.</p><p><strong>Then one day, it dropped to zero on a weekday, and the following day, it stayed at zero. And so I texted Noam and said, ‘Hey, what happened? Are you at an offsite?’ I was trying to find some other excuse. He said, ‘Oh man, I’ve been putting off calling you, but I have good news and bad news. The bad news is we had a team meeting and I asked the team how things were going, and they said that if we made them keep using Krypton, they were all going to quit.’ And I was like, ‘Well, that’s pretty terrible news.’ He said, ‘The good news is they all completely believe in the vision. They’ve made a list [in Krypton] saying, ‘If you do these things, we’ll come right back.’ The list was like 25 things, all completely reasonable.</strong></p><p>This led to a big internal debate. The team was basically divided in half. Half the folks had a mindset like, ‘What a gift. We have a customer and they have given us a clear list of requirements.’ The other half said, ‘He’s reacting to the wrong product—it’s not actually the shape of the thing we want. And if we do that, we’re going to dig a hole deeper and deeper into this part of the product.’</p><p>We decided not to finish his list. Instead, we built the doc that we originally envisioned. I thought it would take three or four months, but it took over a year to get back to his list.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shishirmehrotra/" rel="">Shishir Mehrotra</a><span>, co-founder and CEO</span></p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dvdhsu/" rel="">David Hsu</a><span> at </span><strong>Retool </strong><span>built a tool to catch anyone running into issues with their early product so that they could fix the issues immediately:</span></p><blockquote><p>“At the beginning of any startup, no one knows about your product, nor does anyone use it. We came to a point where we’re like, given that no one’s using the product, every time somebody’s using the product, we should go see what they’re doing. So we built this custom analytics server along with FullStory, and anytime anyone was in the app and using the app, we got notified immediately on Slack.</p><p>Invariably, they’d run into a bunch of issues. And anytime they ran into any issue, we’d immediately reach out. We’d just call them. With sales, oftentimes when you call a customer, they don’t reply or they don’t want to talk to you. But in this case, they were literally using the product and they’re running into issues, and so they were super-likely to pick up.</p><p>With DoorDash, for example, the product went through multiple iterations over three weeks, where they’d uncover an issue and we’d respond, ‘No problem, we’re on it.’ We’d ship the feature, they’d come back the next day, it would work. They wanted an on-prem option, which is at that point a pretty big feature, as you can probably imagine, putting a cloud product on-prem. We’re like, ‘No problem.’ And we shipped it&nbsp;in just 36 hours. So we were iterating very rapidly, even if the core idea was the same.”</p></blockquote><p><span>The founders of </span><strong>Gong</strong><span> did exactly the same thing:</span></p><blockquote><p>“During the beta process, we had a bunch of systems that recorded the users’ screens using Gong. And we were watching these like maniacs, every day. I would probably spend two hours watching people interact with the system, reverse engineering them based on their role or what they were trying to do, and then go on thinking, ‘So this is what this person is doing?’ And if needed, I would give them a call. This approach is an underutilized product management tool, because in some areas it gives you more information than a quantitative survey or a discussion, because this is what the person actually does versus what they tell you and what they think they’re doing.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eilonreshef/" rel="">Eilon Reshef</a><span>, co-founder and CPO</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The founders of </span><strong>Gusto </strong><span>literally sat next to their early customers watching them send payroll day after day:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>For the first 30 customers, I was with them in their offices seeing them do payroll, or I was on the phone with them, watching them and then seeing them send payroll, and their reactions and seeing feedback. </strong><span>What’s working, what’s not working, what’s intuitive, what’s not intuitive. Every time they added an employee, I was there on the phone with them or in their office.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomerlondon/" rel="">Tomer London</a><span>, co-founder and CPO</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The founders of </span><strong>Looker</strong><span> are famous for going even further and “forward deploying” their engineers to sit in the customer’s offices and work alongside their team to make sure they’re set up for success:</span></p><blockquote><p>“The best way to show a prospect or customer the real value of Looker was to show them on their own data. Its power came from being designed as both a language and a development platform, but that also came with a lot of overhead to learn how to be powerful with it. It wasn’t rocket science; it just took time. </p><p><span>Therefore, </span><strong>we created a team of data analysts to serve as our technical customer-facing teams (sales engineers, customer support, and implementation analysts) to quickly deploy and develop instances of Looker for our customer.</strong><span> Early on, this enabled us to see and know everything that our customers and prospects wanted to achieve with analytics. Having that insight, we were able to both develop features and ways to use Looker, almost daily, to ensure we would be the best choice for a powerful analytics platform. This also helped us ensure that our customers would find value from Looker on day 1 after purchasing.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keenanrice/" rel="">Keenan Rice</a><span>, founding team</span></p></blockquote><p><span>“You won’t be great for anyone.

Here’s </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spenserskates/" rel="">Spenser Skates</a><span>’s</span><em> </em><span>(co-founder and CEO of Amplitude) hard-won lesson:</span></p><blockquote><p>“We spent about a year building, when in retrospect, we should have spent half that time talking to customers. And if we had, we would’ve wasted a lot less time on customers who were never going to buy.</p><p><strong>The biggest thing I will tell founders is, you have to spend half your time talking to your customers. If you’re a B2B company, that means becoming a salesperson. Figure out how to spend the collective time of your founding team: 50% needs to be talking to customers. If you’re a consumer company, that just means talking to them and meeting them. Airbnb was very famous for doing this. And spend the other 50% of your time building.</strong></p><p>I’m an engineer. My two co-founders, Curtis [Liu] and Jeffrey [Wang], are engineers. And so our instinct is to always build the product because we know how to solve those problems. But we wasted a lot of time solving problems that didn’t really exist or didn’t have money or traction behind them. And so that was a huge lesson for us.”</p></blockquote><p><span>At this stage, you may not even have true “product”-market fit, if your product is early. Instead, you can look for “message”-market fit, as in the case of </span><strong>Ramp</strong><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>“When we launched, in mid-2020, I think we had ‘message-market fit.’ We were able to differentiate and have people be interested in our unique messaging, but we didn’t have the product there yet.</p><p>I think it’s hard to have true product-market fit when you’re public. When you’re operating just on friends and founders you meet and VC introductions. You need to have people out in the world who you don’t know you but are using you, and the product is what’s doing the selling.</p><p>And in terms of the product itself, where suddenly it was spreading, that came later, probably fall of 2020, when it was finally delivering on the messaging we had.</p><p>In terms of feeling market-message fit, there’s a few ways you can test it. One, based on launch press coverage, e.g. who wants to talk about it. You send an email using cold outbound and look at response rates. SDRs can do that all the time, and we were testing that all the time, even in an elevator pitch. Would people get it or would they be turned off? You can be very technical about it. You measure it or you can just sort of go by feel.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eglyman/" rel="">Eric Glyman</a><span>, co-founder and CEO</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Or “product-user fit,” as in the case of </span><strong>Snyk</strong><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>“I separate the ‘product-user fit’ from ‘product-buyer fit.’ We got the former pretty quickly, I’d say within a year after we launched our Git integration. The latter— getting people to pay for it and aligning with their commercial needs—took a full extra year to happen.”</p><p><em><strong>—</strong></em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guypo/" rel="">Guy Podjarny</a><span>, co-founder and CEO</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Remember, </span><a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/i/115245373/important-takeaway-trust-is-your-secret-weapon" rel="">trust is your secret weapon</a><span> early on.</span></p><p>The next PMF milestone is to get one company to pay a meaningful amount of money for your product. This should be five to six figures per year. I’ll share pricing advice below.</p><p><span>For</span><strong> Vanta</strong><span>, getting the first five-figure verbal agreement, and then a $500k deal, convinced </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ccacioppo/" rel="">Christina Cacioppo</a><span> that she had found PMF:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“During the pricing research, when </span><strong>folks overwhelmingly said they’d pay five figures</strong><span> for the Wizard of Oz prototype of a real-time security report. They thought it was generated by code, but I definitely wrote them by hand.</span></p><p><span>Then, when I was able to </span><strong>sell the first $500k</strong><span> of Vanta by myself, when I didn’t really know how to sell. I joke that prior to Vanta, the last thing I sold was Girl Scout cookies. I knew it wasn’t my sales skill that was getting these deals closed; it was a testament to the problem we were solving and the product we were building.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>For</span><strong> Stytch</strong><span>, it was getting their first six-figure deal:</span></p><blockquote><p>“For me, it was probably our first six-figure deal when it was like, ‘Oh crap, a company will actually pay us for this.’ I just remember being consistently surprised that they didn’t say no to the prices that we were putting in front of them.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliannaelamb/" rel="">Julianna Lamb</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reed-mcginley-stempel-17362245/" rel="">Reed McGinley-Stempel</a><span>, co-founders</span></p></blockquote><p><span>If you have early users telling you that you need to take their money, like with </span><strong>Figma </strong><span>and</span><strong> GitHub</strong><span>, you’re in a good spot:</span></p><blockquote><p>“I think I didn’t admit it to ourselves until we had a customer, Microsoft, that told us, ‘Hey, you have to start charging for this thing.’ I thought we might have product-market fit. In reality we’d had it for like a year, and I wish that I had recognized that sooner, because I think I would have acted differently.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylanfield" rel="">Dylan Field</a><span>, co-founder and CEO of </span><strong>Figma</strong><span>, via </span><a href="https://blog.eladgil.com/p/transcript-and-video-fireside-w-dylan?publication_id=1119759&amp;post_id=103105470&amp;isFreemail=true" rel="">fireside chat with Elad Gil</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>“</strong><span>When we launched our private beta, we were offering it for free.</span><strong> </strong><span>To our surprise, </span><strong>users started writing to us asking, ‘Can we pay for this?’ They liked it so much, they wanted to pay for it.

I went through the demo and the whole pitch, and we got to the end of it, and they asked me a question I’d never been asked. They’re like, ‘This is great, how much does it cost?’ And I’m like, holy shit, someone wants to pay money for the software I built. I am blown away. And the first thought that popped into my head was like, okay, what’s SaaS supposed to cost? I’m thinking $50 a month. </p><p><span>But then I remember </span><a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2006/08/14/you-can-probably-stand-to-charge-more/" rel="">Patrick McKenzie’s advice</a><span>, which is, ‘Charge more.’ So I’m like, all right, what’s the biggest number I can think of? Well, let me double that number. So maybe $100 a month? Then I thought, wait, no, no, no, no, no. Let me try adding another zero to it. I said ‘$1,000 a month.’ And the guy who we were pitching, the CTO of Super Lucky Casino, was like, ‘Holy smokes, wow, that’s so cheap, amazing.’ And I’m like, oh my god, all my dreams have been fulfilled. Someone wants to buy the software that I wrote for $1,000 a month.

Then it was The Hunt for $3,000 a month. And then we sold to HERE Maps, which is a division of Nokia, for $4,000 a month. And then we did a few more deals. Rdio and QuizUp were the two big deals; those were $10,000 a month. We were really cranking. We got from zero to a million in ARR in less than nine months. And so that was really where we started taking off.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>Gong </strong><span>felt like they had product-market fit when 11 out of 12 of their design partners chose to buy the product:</span></p><blockquote><p>“We had 12 design partners.

So that’s a pretty big signal.</p><p>By the way, the reason why we decided to charge money is that during beta, the product wasn’t always working very well. It wasn’t robust in any way or form, and people were complaining left and right when it wasn’t working. So we were like, well, if they are complaining that it doesn’t work, that means they care. If my iPhone doesn’t work, I freak out. But if home speakers don’t work, I don’t give a shit, just like whatever. So that gave us the confidence that at least they use it.</p><p>Then we went to charge money for it. With 11 out of the 12 buying, it should have been obvious. But it wasn’t obvious to us. It was like, how come the 12th didn’t buy it?</p><p>We later learned that the 12th one’s CRO left while we were doing the beta, and they bought Gong a year later and are still a customer.</p><p>One of 11: the salespeople at one point decided they didn’t need it, and turned it off. A day later, we got a call from the CEO saying, who the fuck told you to turn it off?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>One interesting lens for understanding how industries work is looking at their <em>waste streams</em>. Every industry will by nature have both a stock and a flow of byproducts from their core processes. This waste has to be dealt with (or it will, figuratively or literally, clog the pipes of the industry) and frequently has substantial residual value.</p><p>Most industries develop ecosystems in miniature to collect, sift through, recycle, and dispose of their waste. These are often cobbled together from lower-scale businesses than the industry themselves, involve a lot of dirty work, and are considered low status. Few people grow up wanting to specialize in e.g. sales of used manufacturing equipment.</p><p>One core waste stream of the finance industry is charged-off consumer debt. Debt collection is a fascinating (and frequently depressing) underbelly of finance. It shines a bit of light on credit card issuance itself, and richly earns the wading-through-a-river-of-effluvia metaphor.</p><p>A disclaimer: I have had substantially more at-bats with debt collectors than most people, as a result of an old hobby of writing letters on behalf of debtors to their lenders and non-affiliated debt collectors. I did this over the Internet, on my own volition, because it seemed pro-social and I was extremely underused by my actual job at the time. This experience leaves me with <em>strong opinions </em>on the debt collection industry; a frequent archetypical person in need of a letter was a Kansan grandmother in diminished financial circumstances who had been harassed for months. I’m going to try to keep these views to a dull roar here, in the spirit of spending more mental energy on discussing <em>why</em> the system presents as so broken.</p><h2 id="the-lifecycle-of-a-defaulted-debt">The lifecycle of a defaulted debt</h2><p>The majority of debt which defaults in the United States is revolving credit card debt. (Without addressing the politics of it, the impression among many informed people that most defaulted debt is medically-related is the result of successful advocacy work rather than being substantially based in reality. <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/HHDC_2023Q1.pdf?sc_lang=en">Trustworthy numbers</a> are not hard to <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_medical-debt-burden-in-the-united-states_report_2022-03.pdf">come by</a>, due to a combination of regulatory supervision and the U.S.’s almost unique degree of population-wide debt surveillance via credit reporting agencies. We’ll return to credit reporting some other day.) Assume I’m talking about credit card debt below, though the mechanics for medical debt bear overwhelming similarity. (I’d address it specifically except that healthcare economics is a fractally complex topic once you bring e.g. insurers, public programs, and the like into the mix.)</p><p>Credit card issues bucket users into various archetypes, personas, and predicted lifecycles, because behavior is extremely heterogeneous and this is important from both a marketing and risk management perspective. Most users of credit cards, probably including readers of this column, believe they are the typical user of credit cards; <em>no bucket is typical</em>. If I were to make some informed guesses, relative to the population-wide distribution, you, reader, use credit cards in preference to debit cards as a payment instrument, do not routinely revolve balances, and hold some combination of student loan, auto, and mortgage debt which dwarfs your credit card debt. And so it is critical to understand that most defaulting credit card debt <em>is not held by people who act like you</em>.</p><p>Most credit card debt which defaults <em>non-fraudulently</em> was incurred in the relatively distant past. Credit cards are revolving accounts; one’s balance can increase (even as one successfully makes payments) for years as one pays off a portion of prior balances but continues purchasing with the card. This is normal and expected use of the card, planned for thoroughly, much like never carrying a balance is also normal and expected use of the card, planned for thoroughly.</p><p>A small percentage of borrowers, carefully tracked and generally oscillating between 2.5% and 5% depending on the overall health of the economy, will go delinquent on credit card debt. (Some issuers specialize in certain parts of the credit spectrum and, as a result, will have sharply lower or sharply higher delinquency rates. American Express, for example, specializes at the high end and typically has delinquency close to 1%. Capital One made its name in so-called subprime credit cards, though it has diversified since, and typically tends towards the high end among banks whose names you know. There is a largely hidden ecosystem of banks you don’t know that issue very expensive products to poor people; you can accurately predict their default rates exceed anything mentioned above.)</p><p>Default typically begins by missing (or underpaying) a scheduled payment. That in itself is a theoretical breach of contract but not very outside the ordinary for a card issuer; they will generally automatically assess a fee but take very little action. Most borrowers will recover before they are 30 days late, which is the point at which most issuers start to treat an account as being a credit risk rather than a minor operational issue.</p><p>After 30 days, issuers will typically work the account internally, using a combination of communication methods to nudge the user into payment, until one of a few things happens. The happiest is the customer gets current on their account. An outright refusal to pay is substantially less likely, and can result in an issuer moving up timelines. But the most common is that the borrower ghosts the issuer for a few months.</p><p>Consumer debt issuance is generally, by law, an exclusive privilege of regulated financial institutions. (The other big one is taking deposits.) Society wants many things from regulated financial institutions; one of those things is having accurate books, because stealth losses cause financial institutions to fail and frequently leave society holding the bag. As a result, the Federal Reserve has a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/06/12/00-14704/uniform-retail-credit-classification-and-account-management-policy">Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy</a>.</p><p>This tail wags the dog. Many decisions about account servicing, which a naive conception of debt might assume are between borrower and lender, are done with the goal of aligning servicing to accounting standards. In this way, the books impose their will on reality, and where the books and reality differ, reality frequently adjusts itself to accommodate the books. (As my buddy <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinriggle">Kevin</a> frequently muses, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153">states are gonna see</a>. Organizations which are tightly tied to the state, like regulated financial institutions, will develop a vocabulary and processes for seeing like the state sees, and that edifice tends to capture non-state methods of seeing that they run in parallel.)</p><p>In particular, credit classification requires that financial institutions “charge off” delinquent debt. Mechanically, they have previously accumulated an allowance for delinquency on their books as a liability; they move a bit of that allowance to a bad debt expense. In principle, nothing has to happen to the actual debt. In practice, financial regulators encourage institutions to seek <em>certainty and finality</em> around this.</p><p>Financial institutions achieve certainty and finality by packaging portfolios of bad debt together and selling them to non-financial institutions. This durably moves them off of the books and realizes a very, very small residual value.</p><h2 id="the-debt-collection-industry">The debt collection industry<br></h2><p>There are essentially two halves of the debt collection industry. A portion of it works on an agency model: a lender can have e.g. a law firm or similar work a debt on its behalf during the several month period where the delinquent debt lingers on their books, in return for a performance fee (often 15-30% of face value) should the borrower make good on the debt.</p><p>But debts, much like people, only age in one direction. Unlike people, debts universally decline in value as they age. We’ll return to that topic in a moment. Most debt which is not being serviced successfully by the first party lenders will not long be worked by their agents. It is instead sold to debt buyers, who will then attempt to collect the contracted amount (plus fees provided for in the contract, which are legally legitimate, and not infrequently fees which were not provided in the contract, which are frequently <em>extremely questionable</em>). Subtract the original cost of buying the portfolio and their substantial operational costs and the remainder is profit.</p><p>Most defaults are <em>small</em>. This fact drives everything about debt collection; it has to be done scalably, by the cheapest labor available, with a minimum of customization or thoughtful weighing of competing interests. The average defaulted credit card debt is on the order of $2,000, the median is between $500 and $1,000. These are processed like McDonalds burgers, not like grant proposals.</p><p>Debts are sold as part of a portfolio, where (typically) thousands of relatively similarly situated debts in a cohort are sold as a packet. The value of portfolios is a huge discount to the face value of the debts; at the point where a lender has only worked it themselves and the debt is a few months delinquent, portfolios generally fetch about <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/structure-and-practices-debt-buying-industry/debtbuyingreport.pdf">5 cents on the dollar</a>. That value will continue to decay over time. There is an entire ecosystem of brokers supporting contractual infrastructure to convey these debts to buyers and insulate the issuing financial institutions from the actions of the debt buyers.</p><p>Partly, that is due to regulatory risk. (Particularly in recent years, regulators have begun using prudential regulation of financial institutions to <em>strongly suggest</em> that financial institutions adopt their social goals. There is a tortured argument by which a debt collector being unsavory in the process of debt collection would damage the reputation of the bank, which could damage an item on its balance sheet, which could damage its financial stability, which fact a regulator actually has jurisdiction over, and therefore regulators can discourage debt sales.)</p><p>Probably more surprisingly, financial institutions care acutely about brand damage, particularly to their own partners that can contractually obligate that. Many credit cards are co-branded; you, as an unsophisticated consumer, might think you have a credit card from Amazon, Best Buy, or Apple. You don’t, but those three firms are acutely aware of your miscomprehension, and they want to continue earning your business for the next 40 years. And so they might have hypothetically contractually bound Chase, Citibank, and Goldman Sachs (respectively) to never mention their co-branding partner in connection with debt collection and to bind subsequent debt buyers to the same.</p><p>This is a frequent cause of debtors mistakenly believing that debt collectors are confabulating debts against them. “But I haven’t ever done business with Citibank!” I’m slightly-more-than-unsympathetic to that, because of the relative sophistication of borrowers versus Best Buy’s marketing department. On the topic of true confabulation, oh yes, that happens minimally hundreds of thousands of times a year; debt collectors adopt business processes which simply <em>make debts up </em>because accuracy requires competence and costs money.</p><p>The debt collection industry is, and I say this as someone who is capitalist as the day is long and attempts to be non-political in public, among the most odious hives of scum and villainy as exists in the United States. The business is sordid and virtually immune to reform, despite decades of trying. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was passed <em>in 1978</em>! It is older than me! I learned to cite it in 2004 against the same abuses it was designed to prevent! The situation did not markedly improve in the last 20 years!</p><p>This is not because of a lack of virtue or a lack of laws; the <em>structure</em> of the industry colliding with the socioeconomic reality of defaulting debtors basically ensures that it will be a miserable place populated by miserable people who will project leveraged amounts of misery into the outside world in the hopes of collecting a tiny sliver of defaulted debts.</p><p>Debts are conveyed to the debt buyers as large CSV files with minimal supporting documentation. The legal reality of a credit card debt begins with a contractualized promise to pay. You might assume that the owner of the debt necessarily has read that contract. Reader, if the debt has been sold, they have not merely not read that contract, they have likely not received a copy of that contract. They <em>might</em> have the contractual right to ask the seller of the portfolio to ask the entity it bought the portfolio from to follow a few more links in the chain to eventually ask the financial institution for a copy of the contract. In principle, financial institutions always have the contract… somewhere. In practice, they will frequently not organize themselves to actually locate it; this business is off their books and Operations has better things to do than hunting in the archives for a paper copy of a low-value contract signed several years ago.</p><p>Again, we’re talking about promises frequently denominated in the hundreds of dollars. It is a consensual social fiction that there is actually a legal process operating here. That consensual social fiction has real consequences, and sometimes bubbles up uncomfortably in actual courts of law, which we will return to in a moment.</p><p>The rights of debtors are observed by both primary lenders and eventual debt buyers mostly in the breach. One of those rights is to a written “debt verification”, with specified information in it, and (surprisingly, if you haven’t worked in this field) despite that being the law many debts are sold in such a fashion that the buyer couldn’t produce a responsive verification even if they wanted to. That isn’t even a political claim; it’s just the engineering reality of which columns are in their CSV file.</p><p>The former advocate in me will observe that the single most effective method for resolving debts is carefully sending a series of letters invoking one’s rights under the FDCPA (and other legislation) to a debt collector who is <em>operationally incapable</em> of respecting those rights, then threatening them with legal or regulatory action when they inevitably infringe upon them in writing, leading to them abandoning further attempts at collection.</p><p>This effectively makes paying consumer debts basically optional in the United States, contingent on one being sufficiently organized and informed. That is likely a surprising result to many people. Is the financial industry unaware of this? Oh no. Issuing consumer debt is an enormously profitable business. The vast majority of consumers, including those with the socioeconomic wherewithal to walk away from their debts, feel themselves morally bound and pay as agreed.</p><p>Why are debt collectors <em>so bad at debt collection</em>? Partially it is because credit card issuers are large national institutions with large, automated processes sitting atop a legacy of corporate acquisitions, IT migrations, and similar that makes availability of non-critical information extremely fragmentary. They then want to dump that complexity through a very small pipe (CSV files) onto the debt collection industry.</p><p><em>That</em> industry is largely not characterized by large, nationally scaled, hypercompetent operators who happen to have decades of institutional inertia. Instead, it is heavily fragmented into strata of mid-market and smallest-of-small-business firms, governed by a patchwork of regulations on the national, state, and local levels, and runs (in large part) on faxes and post-it notes.</p><h2 id="the-operations-of-a-debt-collection-firm">The operations of a debt collection firm<br></h2><p>Roughly three quarters of debt is bought by ten large firms and one quarter is bought by so-called mom-and-pops, but this is complicated by the resale of portfolios which were worked by the majors. Mom-and-pops then buy them at a deep discount with the goal of getting the residual value which the majors did not successfully capture.</p><p>Suppose a debt collection firm has bought a portfolio. They will first "scrub" it, which means using automated or semi-automated processes to enhance the fragmentary data they have and prioritize the portfolio for collection efforts.</p><p>For example, one stage of the scrub will be associating a credit profile with as many debts as possible. Credit scores are extremely good predictors of who pays their debts; that is what they are designed to measure. You will get sharply better results on a per-call basis calling people with a 750 FICO versus a 450 FICO, accordingly, you should call all the 750s first and more frequently.</p><p>A second scrub will typically remove dead debtors, because they infrequently answer their phones. (Debts are not inherited in the United States, a fact which the debt collection industry frequently demonstrates strategic ignorance of.)</p><p>While reading government reports, I chanced across a mention that a novel form of scrub uses third party databases of so-called litigious debtors. This was surprising to me (as far as I know, it was Not A Thing when I was doing advocacy), but makes a lot of operational sense. You can trivially Google providers with [litigious debtor scrub] as a keyword.</p><p>The FDCPA and state legislation provides for automatic damages for illegal behavior from collectors, the incidence of illegal behavior is extremely high, and a debt collector with a high school education and three months of experience will frequently commit three federal torts in a few minutes of talking to a debtor then follow up with a confirmation of the same in writing. (You think I am exaggerating. Reader, I am not. “If you don’t pay me I will sue you and then Immigration will take notice of that and yank your green card” contains three separate causes of action: (frequently) a false threat to file a suit where that is not actually a business practice of the firm, a false alleged affiliation with a government agency, and a false alleged consequence for debt nonpayment not provided for in law.)</p><p>As a result, private companies compiled databases of (public in the U.S.) court filings and organized them by Social Security number, address, and similar to allow debt collectors to identify which debtors are aware of their legal rights. In principle, a debt collector could do anything they wanted with that fact, like being extra careful to follow the law in contacting them. But the economics of debt collection do not counsel careful, individualized consideration of credit card debt.</p><p>I will bet you that, in practice, they simply avoid collecting against anyone who demonstrates ability and financial resources to enforce their rights. This is one for the history books of borked equilibriums. We devoted substantial efforts to pro-consumer legislation to address abuse of (mostly) poor people. We gated redress behind labor that is abundantly available in the professional managerial class and scarce outside of it, like writing letters and counting to 30 days. (People telling me they were incapable of doing these two things is why I started ghostwriting letters for debtors.) We now have literal computer programs exempting heuristically identified professional managerial class members from debt collection,<em> inclusive of their legitimate debts</em>, so that debt collectors can more profitably conserve their time to do abusive and frequently illegal shakedowns of the people the legislation was meant to benefit.</p><p>After scrubbing their lists, debt collectors will attempt to locate contact information for the debtors. You would think this would be fairly straightforward, given that they were given that information in the CSV file they purchased. But information is fragmentary and outdated, and people likely to default on debts also have complicated and frequently changing relationships with their addresses and phone numbers. So there exists an ecosystem of “skip tracing” providers, delightfully (ugh) borrowing the jargon from the business of bounty hunters, to match up fragmentary information with current contact information.</p><p>Operational and IT issues at this stage create a lot of the harm in the debt collection industry. For example, to use an example ripped from my own experience (which was part of over $100,000 of confabulated debt that caused me to fall down the credit advocacy rabbit hole), consider a fragmentary piece of information identifies a P.J. MacKenzie at an unspecified town in Illinois as owning a debt in the few hundred dollar range. That name is a fuzzy match to one Patrick Johnathan McKenzie of Chicago, Illinois. Here you are welcome to your moral intuitions as to whether simply asserting that I owe you a few hundred dollars is legitimate. The debt collection industry frequently assumes, as a matter of business practice, “I mean, probably you do factually owe me, and if you don’t, oh well, then you won’t be one of the ~8% of people who we successfully collect from.” No individualized application of human labor is required to reach this conclusion. No one is accountable for the mistake; no one <em>made</em> it, not in the usual sense of people making mistakes. People architected a system which generates this outcome by default.</p><p>And then begin the calls. To you, if the above processes have successfully found you. To your friends and relatives, if they have not. (The FDCPA provides that debt collectors are only allowed to contact a debtor’s family to find current contact information. They do this with gusto, including when they have current contact information. It is used coercively, because many debtors will make sacrifices to find $250 so <em>their mother</em> stops getting calls.)</p><p>Debt collectors typically work in call center environments, assisted by technological improvements to greatly increase the number of calls per hour each collector can do. These include so-called predictive dialers, which (as a sketch) dial several debtors in parallel for each collector, since most calls will not be answered or will go to voicemail, then connect only those that pick up to a debt collector waiting in the queue. Maximizing the efficiency of callers is key to the economics of debt collection; labor frequently costs more than than underlying debt does, even when one is paying four cents on the dollar and hiring collectors straight out of high school. An unhappy consequence of this is that debt collection firms build extremely scaled systems to project externalities into the phone network and the people attached to it, including very many people who never owed them a dime. But for the (dubious) cover of law, this is what technologists would call a volumetric denial of service attack: a relatively small expenditure of resources allows a collector to disable a relatively large number of phones.</p><p>If there is one thing that unites debtors, it is <em>the cacophony</em>. The phones ring and ring and ring. They ring at all times legally permissible and many times not. They ring from the same collector calling you twice a day. They ring from the same debt being collected by multiple different agencies, several of which sold the debt on but neglected to update their internal systems to stop collecting on the debt they no longer own. They ring from dozens of different firms, because the circumstances which caused you to go delinquent on one debt caused you to go delinquent on several debts. Each of those is collected in parallel by a process which considers every other debt collector a competitor for your scarce dollars and must outcompete them by ringing you harder, faster, and more persistently.</p><h2 id="what-does-a-debt-collector-hope-to-get-from-a-call">What does a debt collector hope to get from a call?<br></h2><p>The goal of calls is to get a verbal promise to pay and payment credentials. The most useful payment credential, from the perspective of a debt collector, is a checking account number, but in a pinch they will also usually take debit cards or credit cards. (Many people who have defaulted on debts still have access to credit, because in deteriorating financial circumstances one could default on some but not all credit lines. There is also an extremely efficient financial industry capable of extending credit profitably at a wide variety of predicted repayment likelihoods.)</p><p>Many promises to pay are not promises to pay in full, but rather “a plan” to pay the face value of the debt plus accumulated (and accumulating) interest over time. Most debtors who agree to payment plans will not successfully complete those plans. This is, from the perspective of a debt collector, <em>not a problem</em>. If they paid five cents on the dollar for your loan, and successfully convince you to pay twenty cents today and the balance over monthly payments over a year, you know what they’re left with in month three when you default? Ability to collect from you again, or to sell your debt for more than they paid for it, because you are a better credit risk than most people in the portfolio. You proved that, by paying.</p><p>Many less sophisticated customers assume that they have substantial control over sending payments via check. All checks have the account number, printed on the face of them, and collectors will push aggressively to get that number over the phone versus waiting for a check to arrive. The goal of having the number is to present the bank holding the checking account with an electronic ACH debit or a “demand draft”, in both cases representing that the account holder has pre-authorized the debit. How many debits did a debtor agreeing to the above sketched plan pre-authorize? Not less than thirteen.</p><p>They will frequently be very surprised to learn that, and they will be frequently surprised when their financial institution backs the debt collector, who often has a sudden fit of competence and manages to record this part of the conversation.</p><p>The amount of gamesmanship that debt collectors get up to regarding payments could use its own column. The verbal authorization to debit your account (“payment plan”) was probably silent on timing, so they will use their substantial experience in dealing with people in poor economic circumstances to target the dates and times of day when benefits payments or paychecks have posted to your account. They’ll surge collection attempts at 3 AM on the 1st of the month, learn the differences between various banks as to when Social Security payments post, etc. They’ll also do things like e.g. splitting the agreed upon payment into smaller payments, with the goal of getting at least one rather than having the payment declined for insufficient funds (NSF, in financial industry parlance). This has frequently magnified fees assessed by banks to debtors, because NSF fees are frequently assessed per-occurrence.</p><h2 id="why-does-this-continue-being-so-broken">Why does this continue being so broken?<br></h2><p>Incentives rule everything around us. The structure of the industry, technical issues, and similar alluded to above cause most of this, and they have continued causing it despite decades of effort to correct.</p><p>There are also human capital issues at play. Discussing them is a bit difficult, because the people who physically make phone calls for debt collectors share many of the life challenges of debtors as a class. They are poorly educated, poorly paid, poorly managed, and churned through viciously. The work is <em>soul crushing</em>; turnover at the large firms is 75-100% annually. Call centers are <em>already</em> generally a high-stress, terrible working environment even when one is doing routine customer service or order entry work; a debt collector is the type of call center worker that <em>no one wants to talk to</em>. Successful debt collectors need to both harden their hearts against tales of woe (and personal abuse) from debtors and also successfully execute on some combination of moral suasion and threats to eke out a few percentage points at the margin in collections. Success in the field is the difference between e.g. 7% and 8% collection.</p><p>Few competent people remain in this field over an extended period of time; an effective, morally upright debt collector would be a better telephone sales rep at a tenth the stress and two to five times the total compensation. As a result, most calls being made today are not by effective, morally upright debt collectors. Illegal threats may be more effective than diligent suasion and management frequently, through incompetence or careful refusal to watch the sausage being made, ignores that collectors are making threats but tracks per-collector productivity very carefully. Solve for the equilibrium.</p><p>As a former advocate, I’d report that it is never in a debtor’s interest to verbally speak to a debt collector under any circumstances. One’s likelihood of being abused or lied to, including in financially consequential fashions, is high, and one’s ability to counter that is minimal. Instead, force them to do all correspondence on paper, where lies are self-documenting, illegal threats are immediately admissible to regulatory processes or court, etc.</p><p>The incentives and hiring pool available to debt collection firms cause them to put most of their limited competence into scaling phone teams and very little competence into individualized written correspondence. That would require them to successfully keep a folder about a debtor for a month and route communications to the desk with that folder; this is an edge case for them and uneconomical to do at the hundreds of dollar range. This means they will, through a combination of incompetence and strategic decisions by management, frequently simply abandon collection activity where that would require them to read and write.<br></p><h2 id="suing-people-with-robots">Suing people with robots</h2><p>Most debts are not litigated, but various debt collection firms have various strategies here. Almost no consumer debts are worth serious amounts of professional attention, but above about $1,000 or so (depending heavily on jurisdiction), they can be worth doing high-frequency lawyering on.</p><p>Basically, the debt collector will either itself or, through use of a law firm, file hundreds or thousands of lawsuits in a single court against its roster of uncollected debtors. Those lawsuits will be entirely templated. A frequent detail that emerges in news reporting is that they’ll often be physically robosigned, so that the relevant lawyers don’t give themselves repetitive stress injuries by needing to affix their name to all of the things they are swearing to under penalty of perjury.</p><p>You might have a view of the judicial system where two highly educated advocates joust in front of a neutral finder of fact like a judge or jury. This ain’t that.</p><p>The goal of this business process is generating so-called <em>default judgements</em>. They’re both judgment that a default happened and also the judgment that happens by default; the overwhelming case for issuance is when one party is summoned to court and does not show up. Many debtors will ignore correspondence about court cases believing that ignoring them will make the problem go away; this is the opposite of the truth. Many will lack transportation, not be able to take off work, etc. In any event, filling 100 court cases means that, in <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-bureau-consumer-protection-staff-report-repairing-broken-system-protecting/debtcollectionreport.pdf">expectation</a>, your lawyer will collect 60-95 default judgements or more. Not a bad day’s work.</p><p>Default judgements turn a debt that hasn’t been collected voluntarily into a financial asset with value. They can be used to garnish the contents of bank accounts or wages paid to debtors, in many jurisdictions. For debtors who own property, which is a fact pattern that occurs much more commonly than you probably would guess, a default judgment can frequently be turned into a lien against the property. This swaps an unsecured consumer debt for a senior claim against the debtor’s home equity. That claim is itself salable into an ecosystem of lien investors, and the debt collector will frequently sell it for (say) 80 cents on the dollar, realizing a profit over their low basis in the debt and collection costs.</p><p>Should a debtor actually show up to the courthouse, the lawyer will almost invariably offer an on-the-spot settlement. Fifty cents on the dollar seems to be popular, anecdotally. Avoid the expense and stress of a legal proceeding, etc etc, this is obviously incentive compatible.</p><p>When debtors actually contest their debts, or have competent legal representation, the debt collectors frequently get beaten like drums. Many judges take an unsurprisingly dim view of lawyers who profess to have personal knowledge of the facts of the case then can’t locate the contract they are suing over. (Again: they do not and never did possess a copy of the contract. The lawyer does not actually know any facts of the debt other than that the firm purchased a name, address, and perhaps a Social Security number in a CSV file. They don’t have the contents of any previous correspondence about the debt, owing to some combination of incompetence and unwillingness to present evidence of crimes in court.) Then comes some gamesmanship, where the debt collector will attempt to ask for an extension to get their paperwork in order and the debtor’s attorney will push for dismissal, claims under the FDCPA and similar, and costs.</p><p>This makes for good human interest pieces occasionally, but the economics make the lawsuit machine very profitable to run even accounting for losses, and accordingly it continues robosigning cases by the tens and hundreds of thousands.</p><h2 id="what-can-be-done-about-this">What can be done about this?<br></h2><p>Many people have suggestions for obvious improvements here, which might rhyme with the Federal Trade Commission’s suggestions <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-bureau-consumer-protection-staff-report-repairing-broken-system-protecting/debtcollectionreport.pdf">from 2010</a> or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/final-rules/">spate of rulemaking</a> from 2021 through 2023 or the FDCPA from 1978.</p><p>I’ll leave rulemaking to the rulemakers, as this essay has gone on long enough. The state of reality is very bad, not because any single person woke up this morning attempting to maximize evil, but because a complex interaction of structural factors over multiple different parts of society got us to where we are.</p><div><p>Untangling that Gordian knot is hard and has empirically eluded us.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>We’re once again at the end of our internship season, and it’s my task
to provide a few highlights of what the dev interns accomplished while
they were here.</p>

<p>The program was big! We had 152 software engineering interns, drawn
from 58 schools across 19 different countries.  And that’s not even
counting the 31 tech interns in areas like production engineering, IT
engineering, network engineering, and more.</p>

<p>The intern program is so big and diverse that it’s impossible to
faithfully summarize it with just a few projects. But, something is
better than nothing, so here are the projects I’ll discuss this time
around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Rajeev Godse wrote a query language based on Linear Temporal Logic
for querying complex events out of system logs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Semyon Savkin worked on our AI Assistants team, building an
efficient tokenizer in OCaml.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sasha Hydrie added concurrency support to our tracing syntax, making
it suitable for use with our asynchronous programming frameworks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now let’s dive into the details!</p>

<h2 id="a-temporal-query-language">A temporal query language</h2>

<p>Concord (which we’ve
<a href="https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/building-an-exchange/">talked</a>
<a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/state-machine-replication-and-why-you-should-care/">about</a>
before) is a platform for building systems that let counterparties
connect to us to trade directly with or through us.</p>

<p>Concord’s architecture is built around a single, totally-ordered
stream of transactions.  One nice thing about this approach is that
the transaction stream is a great debugging aid: an incredibly
detailed source-of-truth that you can dive into when you’re trying to
figure out why the system is misbehaving.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the tooling we had for digging into this treasure trove
was a bit limited.  All we really had was the ability to find and grab
individual messages.  But sometimes you want more than that! You want
to search for sequences of events that match some specified criteria.</p>

<p>We did have <em>some</em> tooling for this. In particular, one of our
engineers had built a stream query system based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic">linear temporal
logic</a>, or, LTL
for short.  LTL is a well-studied logic that takes basic propositional
logic and adds to it two key operators: <code>next</code> and <code>until</code>.</p>

<p>Roughly, <code>p next q</code> means that predicate <code>p</code> holds currently, and that
predicate <code>q</code> holds thereafter.  And <code>p until q</code> means that <code>p</code> holds
currently, and will continue to hold until <code>q</code> starts holding.</p>

<p>If it’s not obvious to you how to use these two operators to build
meaningful queries, well, join the club.  It can be a bit of a puzzle
to figure out how to convert meaningful queries into the fairly
low-level logical statements that LTL is built on.  To make matters
worse, the only syntax we had for writing these queries was a fairly
awkward s-expression based format.  As a result, almost no one used
the LTL query engine.</p>

<p>That’s where Rajeev’s project came in. Rajeev’s goal was to build an
easier-to-use, SQL-like query language to act as a frontend to the
LTL query engine.  The language wouldn’t be quite as expressive as
LTL, but it would be a lot easier to use.</p>

<p>We don’t really have space to go into detail on how the language
works, but here’s an example of a query for retrieving and printing
out retail orders paired with the first execution received by each
order:</p>

<div><pre><code>FIND wholesaling.retail_order.new Retail_order
THEN FIRST wholesaling.route.fill.external Fill
  WHERE .retail_order_id = Retail_order.retail_order_id;
PRINT
, Fill.time - Retail_order.time AS order_to_fill_time
, Retail_order.retail_order_id AS retail_order_id
, Retail_order.time AS arrival_time
;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>He built the parser for this new language on top of
<a href="https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom">Angstrom</a>, a
parser-combinator library for OCaml.  It wasn’t too hard to get a
working parser; the biggest challenge was getting good error
messages.  But after some careful wrestling with the system, Rajeev
was able to get it to track enough context to generate good error
messages in the cases that mattered.</p>

<p>In addition to getting the basic system in place, Rajeev had time to
add a few interesting temporal operators to the language, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>LAST p BEFORE q</code>, which matches messages <code>M1</code> and <code>M2</code> such that
<code>M2</code> satisfies <code>q</code> and <code>M1</code> is the last message satisfying <code>p</code>
before <code>M2</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>NO MESSAGE p BEFORE q</code>, which matches <code>M</code> satisfying <code>q</code> such that
no messages before <code>M</code> satisfy <code>p</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All in, the project was a real success. The new temporal query
language has become the go-to tool on the team for debugging
performance problems, and there have been requests from other teams to
generalize the language so it can be used against other systems as
well. This feels like an exciting new part of our toolkit for
supporting production systems.</p>

<h2 id="efficient-token-counting-in-ocaml">Efficient token-counting in OCaml</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever used an AI chatbot you’ll appreciate the importance of
keeping track of your token usage—both as a way to keep costs in
order and to mind rate limits. Surfacing these token counts in real
time to users helps them understand and moderate their own usage.</p>

<p>The project we needed tokenization for is our own web front-end to the
various AI chatbots out there.  We started off using OpenAI’s
tokenization library, <a href="https://github.com/openai/tiktoken">tiktoken</a>, which we set up by
starting a Python server that we could hit over HTTP.</p>

<p>But, this was a bit of a grungy setup, and we only had access to the
token counter from the server, not the client. A pure OCaml
implementation would solve both problems at once, since our client is
an OCaml program too.</p>

<p>Semyon Savkin’s intern project was to write such an
implementation. Token counting is not trivial—it’s not like you just
split your input string on spaces—and an early challenge was finding
an OCaml regex library that supported all the features used by the
regex in tiktoken. Nothing that we found was suitable, especially
given the constraint that it had to work in the browser. Fortunately,
the regex was simple enough that it was not too difficult for Semyon
to handcraft the code for the automaton.</p>

<p>The goal at first was to check that the program’s behavior conformed
100% with the reference implementation, so Semyon wrote a stress test
program to spot any differences.  But it soon became clear that this
was too strict of a requirement, since even a slight difference in the
unicode version can cause (very rare) tokenization differences. So
Semyon needed to find a way to relax the tests enough to allow for
small deviations, without losing too much bug-finding power.</p>

<p>Our initial implementation used a very functional style, with lists
and maps. The code was nice and simple, but just not fast enough. So,
Semyon spent some time profiling and experimenting, and ended up with
a more imperative implementation leveraging hash-tables and arrays,
which, along with algorithmic improvements, made a big difference.</p>

<p>By the end of the internship, Semyon had produced two fully
functioning tokenizers. We compared the results against both the
Python server and also the reference implementations as accessed
through the Python API, which were written in Rust. When measured in
bytes per microsecond, we blew the Python server out of the water for
short messages, due to network latency. But even doing an
apples-to-apples comparison with the Rust implementations, we found
that our implementation was marginally faster on average for OpenAI
tokenization, and a bit less than twice as fast on average for
Anthropic tokenization:</p>

<p><img alt="Tokenizer performance" src="https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2023/tokenizer-perf.png">
</p>

<p>One thing to note about the above graph is that, despite being faster,
our variance was worse, which is probably due to GC pauses.  This
could probably be brought down by being more careful about allocation,
but the variance just wasn’t a problem for this application.</p>

<p>We didn’t really expect to beat the performance of OpenAI’s
implementation, so that was a pleasant surprise!</p>

<h2 id="async-tracing">Async tracing</h2>

<p><code>ppx_tracing</code> is an OCaml syntax extension that provides
high-performance introspection capabilities for OCaml programs. To use
it, all you have to do is add a small <code>@trace</code> annotation to an
existing function:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span><span>[@</span><span>trace</span> <span>"demo"</span> <span>"compute"</span> <span>~</span><span>n</span><span>:(</span><span>n</span> <span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)]</span> <span>compute</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>(* ... *)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then, you just have to call <code>Tracing_probes.start</code> somewhere in your
executable, and at runtime you’ll get a UI for viewing traces, built
on top of Perfetto:</p>

<p><img alt="ppx_tracing UI" src="https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2023/perfetto.png">
</p>

<p>When we released ppx_tracing internally, there was one main issue that
kept people from really wanting to use it: it didn’t work with
asynchronous code.  In particular, it couldn’t represent suspending
execution in one function and resuming in another.</p>

<p>This was a significant limitation, since most real-world programs do
<em>something</em> asynchronous, say writing to a file or fetching data over
the network.  These operations are provided by the <code>Async</code> library,
which lets us wrap asynchronous computations in “deferreds”—the
OCaml equivalent of a Promise in Javascript.  Let’s consider the
following <code>Async</code> program for checking disk space usage:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span><span>[@</span><span>trace</span> <span>"demo"</span> <span>"process"</span><span>]</span> <span>rec</span> <span>process_directory</span> <span>path</span> <span>=</span>

  <span>|</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>return</span> <span>0</span>
<span>;;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Running the program with tracing enabled produces a confusing
result. Here, spans representing calls to <code>process_directory</code> only
capture the time taken to allocate a new deferred.  Further, since the
trace only keeps track of one pending function call, we can’t know
which invocation of <code>process_directory</code> generated each instant event.</p>

<p><img alt="Confusing asynchronous trace" src="https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2023/async-1.png">
</p>

<p>The crux of Sasha Hydrie’s intern project was to figure out how to
integrate with the Async scheduler to keep track of multiple
concurrent execution contexts.  This required associating a unique ID
with each async function call.</p>

<p>Luckily, the <code>Async</code> scheduler can store metadata along with each
deferred computation.  When switching to a new task, the scheduler
makes its data (known as the “execution context”) globally accessible.
Therefore, upon entering an async function, we can store a unique
“correlation ID” in the context.  This gives us the ability to
distinguish between multiple invocations of <code>process_directory</code>.
Later on, when the task actually executes, we can query the current ID
to see which function we’re in.</p>

<p>Sasha extended the PPX with a new annotation (<code>@trace.async</code>)
implementing this behavior.  The resulting IDs must end up in the
final trace file, so he also updated our Fuchsia trace format tooling
to support the relevant event types.  Now, updating our example with
<code>@trace.async</code> gives a much more sensible result—we can see how long
each call is actually in flight, and how many are executing in
parallel.  Further, instant events are able to query the active
correlation ID to determine which call they are a part of.</p>

<p><img alt="Better asynchronous trace" src="https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2023/async-2.png">
</p>

<p>However, not all functions are asynchronous. We don’t want every
synchronous function to create a new track, but we also don’t want to
mix them all together.  Therefore, Sasha added a new async mode to the
PPX, where synchronous function calls will also query the current
correlation ID and dynamically attach to a parent async call.</p>

<p>Already Sasha’s work has enabled wider adoption of ppx_tracing; the
tool should now work in most real-world programs. The team behind
<a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/code-review-that-isnt-boring/">Iron</a>, our in-house code review system, used it to improve
their server’s startup time by about 50%, within days of the final
project being released.</p>

<p>Given the success of the project, there is, of course, more work yet
to do: we’re hoping to integrate ppx_tracing with a new distributed
tracing system we’ve built, as well as perform more detailed tracing
of the Async scheduler itself.</p>

An intellectual crackle filled the air as we watched demos of new libraries and products. Many of us had been independently playing around with local-first development ideas for a while — in my case, over a decade — and the in-person meetup gave us the chance to trade notes late into the night.</p>

<h2 id="whats-happening"><a href="#whats-happening" aria-label="whats happening permalink"></a>What’s Happening?</h2>
<p>The web feels ready for a major upgrade. We had tightly coupled web frameworks in the Rails/Django years and lost them with the shift to API-powered SPAs. The developing database-grade sync technology will tightly recouple our application stacks allowing for a new era of framework innovation.</p>
<p>I see “local-first” as shifting reads and writes to an embedded database in each client via“sync engines” that facilitate data exchange between clients and servers. Applications like Figma and Linear pioneered this approach, but it’s becoming increasingly easy to do. The benefits are multiple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplified state management for developers</li>
<li>Built-in support for real-time sync, offline usage, and multiplayer collaborative features</li>
<li>Faster (60 FPS) CRUD</li>
<li>More robust applications for end-users</li>
</ul>
<p>(Some good reading material: this local-first case study on <a href="https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude/">building reactive, data-centric apps</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxuXGeMJsBU&amp;t=1s">Johannes’ talk in Berlin</a>; I will include some more links later.)</p>
<p>Like the shift to componentized JavaScript UI over the last decade, I believe local-first will be the next large paradigm shift for rich client apps and work its way through the application world over the next decade</p>
<h2 id="why-is-local-first-happening-now"><a href="#why-is-local-first-happening-now" aria-label="why is local first happening now permalink"></a>Why is Local-First Happening Now?</h2>
<p>I’ve read about and played with local-first type ideas for a decade or so but only now does it seem to be gaining steam with many young startups rushing to productize its ideas.</p>
<p>Figma, Superhuman, and Linear are good examples of pioneering startups in the local-first paradigm and all rely on local-first ideas and bespoke sync engines to support their speed and multiplayer UX.</p>
<p>Many builders now see local-first as a key way to differentiate their applications.</p>
<p>Why is this happening now?</p>
<p>My general model for change in technology is that a given community of practice (like application developers) can only adopt one large paradigm shift at a time. While local-first ideas have been floating around for decades, practitioners have so far been focused on more fundamental changes.</p>
<p>What we’ve seen over the last decade is that application speed and collaboration features are powerful vectors to shake up an incumbent industry. Figma used local-first to displace Sketch and InVision; Linear is using local-first to displace Jira.</p>
<p>We’ve shifted from Rails-type server-rendered apps, to single-page-apps powered by APIs. A core lesson from this transition is that while standard REST and GraphQL APIs are very easy to get started with for solving client/server sync, they require significant effort and skill to scale and refine and they struggle with use-cases like multiplayer and offline support.</p>
<p>Sync engines are a robust database-grade syncing technology to ensure that data is consistent and up-to-date. It’s an ecosystem-wide refactor that many talented groups are exploring to attempt to simplify the application stack.</p>
<p>Assuming they succeed, they’ll provide a solid substrate for new types of framework that can rely on local data and rock solid sync.</p>
<h2 id="will-most-rich-client-apps-use-local-first"><a href="#will-most-rich-client-apps-use-local-first" aria-label="will most rich client apps use local first permalink"></a>Will Most Rich Client Apps Use Local-First?</h2>
<p>I’ve chatted with a number of developers who — frustrated at maintaining the homegrown bespoke sync systems they wrote — are replacing it with new local-first tooling. The tooling feels a lot better and having standard primitives make it easier to build great experiences.</p>
<p>Local-first is developing into an ecosystem similar to authentication services but for handling data and features that need to be real-time, collaborative, or offline.</p>
<p>The key question for us technologists is whether local-first will remain a niche technology or if it’ll gradually replace the current API-based approach.</p>
<p>It’s still early but I’m confident that at a minimum, we’ll see multiple breakout startups along with a few healthy open-source ecosystems around the different approaches. And if local-first becomes the new default paradigm for handling data,, it will be much larger and reshape many parts of the cloud ecosystem.</p>
<p>But: there are many issues to solve first! Let’s look in detail at one of the first issues that people encounter: handling CRUD operations.</p>
<h3 id="crud-with-crdt-based-sync-engines"><a href="#crud-with-crdt-based-sync-engines" aria-label="crud with crdt based sync engines permalink"></a>CRUD with CRDT-based Sync Engines</h3>
<p>To fully replace client-server APIs, sync engines need robust support for fine-grained access control and complex write validation.</p>
<p>The most basic use case for an API is <em>state transfer</em> from the server to the client. The client wants to show information about an object so reads the necessary data through the API.</p>
<p>Local-first tools all handle this perfectly. They ensure the latest object data is synced correctly to the client db for querying from the UI.</p>
<p>But while reads are generally easy, support for complex writes is still immature in local-first tooling. Clients tend to have unrestricted write access and updates are immediately synced to other clients. While this is generally fine for text collaboration or multiplayer drawing, this wouldn’t work for a typical ecommerce or SaaS application.</p>
<p>Local-first tools need somewhere to put arbitrary business logic written in code, because real-world systems start out elegant and simple and, over time, accumulate lots of messy, important chunks of logic.</p>
<p>A data property might normally be limited to 20 but Acme Corp paid $50k to get a limit of 100. Or write access needs to be restricted for sensitive information like account balances. Or writes need validation by third party APIs, like a calendar booking system that needs to ask an external calendar API if a time slot is open.</p>
<p>Normally, these inevitable chunks of code and logic live on the server behind an API. And we still need somewhere to put them in a local-first world.</p>
<p>Put differently: local-first CRDT-based sync engines can drive consistency within a system but real-world systems also need an authoritative server which can enforce consistency within external constraints and systems.</p>
<p>Or as Aaron Boodman, a <a href="https://replicache.dev/">Replicache</a> co-founder, put it: “CRDTs converge, but to where?”</p>
<h3 id="using-a-distributed-state-machine-to-handle-complex-writes"><a href="#using-a-distributed-state-machine-to-handle-complex-writes" aria-label="using a distributed state machine to handle complex writes permalink"></a>Using a Distributed State Machine to Handle Complex Writes</h3>
<p>I asked Anselm Eickhoff and James Arthur (founders of <a href="https://jazz.tools/">Jazz</a> and <a href="https://electric-sql.com/">ElectricSQL</a> respectively, both CRDT-based tools) about how they suggest handling writes that need an authoritative server.</p>
<p>They both suggested emulating API request/response patterns through a distributed state machine running on a replicated object.</p>
<p>So let’s say a client wants to update the user name. It creates the following object:</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"machine"</span><span>:</span> <span>"updateUserName"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"state"</span><span>:</span> <span>"requestedUpdate"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"request"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Fred"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"id"</span><span>:</span> <span>123</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"timestamp"</span><span>:</span> <span>1694122496</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"response"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// User 123</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Bob"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"id"</span><span>:</span> <span>123</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The server listens for writes and upon receiving this one, validates the request and updates the state machine object along with the name on the user object (which again are synced back to clients as the “server” is just another client):</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"machine"</span><span>:</span> <span>"updateUserName"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"state"</span><span>:</span> <span>"finished"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"request"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Fred"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"id"</span><span>:</span> <span>123</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"timestamp"</span><span>:</span> <span>1694122496</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>"response"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"error"</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"timestamp"</span><span>:</span> <span>1694122996</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// User 123</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Fred"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"id"</span><span>:</span> <span>123</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This has the interesting and useful implication that in-flight requests are synced to other clients and it’s trivial for the server to emit progress updates. E.g. an app that supports a team of users uploading images for some nifty AI enhancements. The client can emit progress updates on the upload and the server as it works through enhancements.</p>
<p>In other words, requests/responses have the same multiplayer, offline, real-time sync properties as the rest of the app.</p>
<p>This pattern can be wrapped up in a standard mutation function e.g. <code>const {res, error} = await updateName({ name: "fred" })</code></p>
<p>Jazz also lets you restrict writes to certain object fields to a specific role. Sensitive information would be marked read-only for clients who would need to request the server to update them.</p>

<p>Beyond the question of <em>can</em> you build any application with local-first tools, there’s still the question of whether devs will <em>want</em> to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do advantages make it worth learning a new stack and migrating applications?</li>
<li>There’s a lot of missing components still — what will a full production DX for a local-first toolchain look like?</li>
<li>How complex will it feel to build a simple app?</li>
<li>Is there enough demand to fund all the new libraries and products that’ll need to be built?</li>
</ul>
<p>The success of Figma, Superhuman, and Linear suggest these issues will get solved in time.</p>
<h2 id="what-approaches-are-people-exploring-now"><a href="#what-approaches-are-people-exploring-now" aria-label="what approaches are people exploring now permalink"></a>What Approaches are People Exploring Now?</h2>
<p>I’m grouping approaches I see into three broad categories.</p>
<h3 id="1-replicated-data-structures"><a href="#1-replicated-data-structures" aria-label="1 replicated data structures permalink"></a>1. Replicated Data Structures</h3>
<p>These projects provide support for replicated data structures. They are convenient building blocks for any sort of real-time or multiplayer project. They typically give you APIs similar to native Javascript maps and arrays but which guarantee state updates are replicated to other clients and to the server.</p>
<p>It feels like magic when you can build a simple application and and see changes instantly replicate between devices with no additional work.</p>
<p>Most replicated data structures rely on CRDT algorithms to merge concurrent and offline edits from multiple clients.</p>
<p>There’s a number of open source and hosted projects offering replicated data structures, including the granddaddy in this space, Firebase, plus many newer ones.</p>
<p>These services are great for making parts of an app real-time / multiplayer. E.g. a drawing surface, a chat room, a notification system, presence, etc. They’re very simple to get started with and the shared data structures approach offers a much better DX than manually passing events through with websockets or push messaging services.</p>

<h3 id="2-replicated-database-tables"><a href="#2-replicated-database-tables" aria-label="2 replicated database tables permalink"></a>2. Replicated Database Tables</h3>
<p>An approach several projects are taking is to sync from Postgres to a client db (generally SQLite). You pick tables (or materialized views) to sync to the client and then they get loaded along with real-time updates as writes land in Postgres.</p>
<p>SQLite in the browser is one big advantage of this approach as it gives you the rich, familiar querying power of SQL in the client.</p>
<p>Given Postgres’ widespread usage and central position in most application architectures, this is a great way to start with local-first. Instead of syncing data in and out of replicated data structures, you can read and write directly to Postgres as normal, confident that clients will be in sync.</p>
<p>I’ve built a number of job queues and notification systems over the years and they’ve all struggled with their version of the Byzantine Generals problem. Clients would miss an update (usually due to being offline), and then users would complain about zombie jobs that never finished. In contrast, replicated database tables mean the background process can simply write updates to Postgres, confident all connected clients will get the update.</p>

<h3 id="3-replication-as-a-protocol"><a href="#3-replication-as-a-protocol" aria-label="3 replication as a protocol permalink"></a>3. Replication as a Protocol</h3>
<p>The startup <a href="https://replicache.dev/">Replicache</a> has a unique “replication as a protocol” approach. Replicache is a client JS library along with a replication protocol — which lets you integrate arbitrary backends, provided you follow the spec. It’s more upfront work, as the sync engine is “some assembly required”, but as Replicache is mostly your own code, it gives the most flexibility and power of any local-first tool I’ve seen to date. The startup behind Replicache is also building Reflect, a hosted backend for Replicache.</p>
<h2 id="soshould-you-go-local-first"><a href="#soshould-you-go-local-first" aria-label="soshould you go local first permalink"></a>So…Should You Go Local-First?</h2>
<p>I think it depends on your use case and risk tolerance.</p>
<p>For the right people and teams, it’s an exciting time to jump in. Realtime, multiplayer, and offline features will significantly improve much of our day-to-day software.</p>
<p>For almost any <strong>real-time use case</strong>, I’d choose <em>replicated data structures</em> over raw web sockets as they give you a much simpler DX and robust guarantees that clients will get updates.</p>
<p>For <strong>multiplayer and offline</strong>, again you’ll almost certainly want to pick an open source <em>replicated data structure</em> or hosted service. There’s a lot of difficult problems that they help solve.</p>
<p>The <em>Replicated Database</em> approach also works for the real-time, multiplayer, offline use cases. It should be especially useful for data-heavy applications and ones with many background processing writing into Postgres.</p>
<p>But in general, I’d still be wary of using local-first outside real-time / multiplayer / offline use cases. Local-first is definitely still bleeding-edge. You will hit unexpected problems. A good community has rapidly developed, but there’ll still be some stretches on the road where you’ll have to solve novel problems.</p>
<p>So: if you need local-first, see if it makes sense to isolate the local-first parts and architect the rest of the app (for now) in a more conventional fashion.</p>
<p>I’ve found that most of the major tools have plenty of examples and demos to play with and active Discord channels. There’s also a general local-first community over at <a href="https://localfirstweb.dev/">https://localfirstweb.dev/</a> and they hold regular meetups.</p>
<p>Following along, I’m getting a lot of the same vibes that I got in the then-nascent React community circa 2014 or 2015.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of interesting implications of local-first development in the realm of privacy, decentralization, data control and so on, but I’ll leave it to others more well-versed in these topics to flesh them out.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://securelist.com/backdoored-free-download-manager-linux-malware/110465/">https://securelist.com/backdoored-free-download-manager-linux-malware/110465/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37486946">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
													<p>Over the last few years, Linux machines have become a more and more prominent target for all sorts of threat actors. According to our telemetry, 260,000 unique Linux samples appeared in the first half of 2023. As we will demonstrate in this article, campaigns targeting Linux can operate for years without being noticed by the cybersecurity community.</p>
<p>We discovered one such long-lasting attack when we decided to investigate a set of suspicious domains, among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>2c9bf1811ff428ef9ec999cc7544b43950947b0f.u.fdmpkg[.]org</li>
<li>c6d76b1748b67fbc21ab493281dd1c7a558e3047.u.fdmpkg[.]org</li>
<li>0727bedf5c1f85f58337798a63812aa986448473.u.fdmpkg[.]org</li>
<li>c3a05f0dac05669765800471abc1fdaba15e3360.u.fdmpkg[.]org</li>
</ul>
<p>To a security researcher’s eye, these domains look alarming, as they can be a sight of malware using domain-generation algorithms for C2 communications. We thus decided to take a close look at the <span>fdmpkg[.]org</span> domain.</p>
<h2 id="a-malicious-debian-repository">A malicious Debian repository</h2>
<p>We identified that the domain in question has a <span>deb.fdmpkg[.]org</span> subdomain. Going there in the browser shows the following web page:</p>
<p><a href="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143412/FDM_story_01.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143412/FDM_story_01.png" alt="" width="654" height="153" srcset="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143412/FDM_story_01.png 654w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143412/FDM_story_01-300x70.png 300w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143412/FDM_story_01-370x87.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px"></a></p>
<p>As suggested by the page, this subdomain claims to host a Debian repository of a piece of software called ‘Free Download Manager’. We further discovered a Debian package of this software available for download from the <span>https://deb.fdmpkg[.]org/freedownloadmanager.deb</span> URL. This package turned out to contain an infected <span>postinst</span> script that is executed upon installation. This script drops two ELF files to the paths <span>/var/tmp/crond</span> and <span>/var/tmp/bs</span>. It then establishes persistence by creating a cron task (stored in the file <span>/etc/cron.d/collect</span>) that launches the /var/tmp/crond file every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>The version of Free Download Manager installed by the infected package was released on January 24, 2020. Meanwhile, the postinst script contains comments in Russian and Ukrainian, including information about improvements made to the malware, as well as activist statements. They mention the dates 20200126 (January 26, 2020) and 20200127 (January 27, 2020).</p>
<p><a href="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/09/06153905/FDM-malware-story-02.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/09/06153905/FDM-malware-story-02.png" alt="" width="860" height="122"></a></p>
<h2 id="a-dns-based-backdoor">A DNS-based backdoor</h2>
<p>Once the malicious package is installed, the executable <span>/var/tmp/crond</span> gets launched on every startup through cron. This executable is a backdoor, and it does not import any functions from external libraries. To access the Linux API, it invokes syscalls with the help of the statically linked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietlibc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dietlibc</a> library.</p>
<p>Upon startup, this backdoor makes a type A DNS request for the <span>&lt;hex-encoded 20-byte string&gt;.u.fdmpkg[.]org</span> domain. In response to this request, the backdoor receives two IP addresses that encode the address and port of a secondary C2 server. The following addresses were returned at the time of our research:</p>
<ul>
<li>172.111.48[.]101</li>
<li>172.1.0[.]80</li>
</ul>
<p>The first IP address in the list above is the address of the secondary C2 server, while the second address contains the connection port (encoded in the third and fourth octets) and the connection type (encoded in the second octet).</p>
<p>After parsing the response of the DNS request, the backdoor launches a reverse shell, using the secondary C2 server for communications. The communication protocol is, depending on the connection type, either SSL or TCP. In the case of SSL, the crond backdoor launches the <span>/var/tmp/bs</span> executable and delegates all further communications to it. Otherwise, the reverse shell is created by the <span>crond backdoor</span> itself.</p>
<h2 id="a-bash-stealer">A Bash stealer</h2>
<p>Having found out that the crond backdoor creates a reverse shell, we decided to check how this shell is used by attackers. To do that, we installed the infected Free Download Manager package in a malware analysis sandbox. Having analyzed the traffic generated by crond, we determined that the attackers deployed a Bash stealer to the sandbox. This stealer collects data such as system information, browsing history, saved passwords, cryptocurrency wallet files, as well as credentials for cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Azure).</p>

<p>After collecting information from the infected machine, the stealer downloads an uploader binary from the C2 server, saving it to <span>/var/tmp/atd</span>. It then uses this binary to upload stealer execution results to the attackers’ infrastructure.</p>
<p>We did not observe any other activity performed via the reverse shell, and thus the whole infection chain can be described with the graph below:</p>
<p><a href="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/09/05134135/FDM-malware-scheme-01.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/09/05134135/FDM-malware-scheme-01.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576"></a></p>
<h2 id="mystery-of-the-infection-vector">Mystery of the infection vector</h2>
<p>After analyzing all components in the chain, we wanted to find out how the infected Debian package was distributed to victims. We checked the official website of Free Download Manager (<span>freedownloadmanager[.]org</span>). Packages available for download from this website turned out to be hosted on the <span>files2.freedownloadmanager[.]org</span> domain, and they were not backdoored.</p>
<p>We then decided to conduct an open-source check on the <span>fdmpkg[.]org</span> domain. This check revealed a dozen posts on websites such as StackOverflow and Reddit, where users have been discussing problems caused by the infected Free Download Manager distribution, not realizing they actually became victims of malware. These posts were made over the course of three years – from 2020 to 2022.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/590510/kubuntu-20-04-shutdown-reboot-hangs-at-waiting-for-process-crond" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one such post</a> on Unix Stack Exchange, the author complains about the message ‘Waiting for process: crond’ that prevents the computer from shutting down:</p>

<p>The responses to this post, which came from users dealing with the same problem, suggest that this issue is caused by the Free Download Manager software. They advise to remove the files <span>/etc/cron.d/collect, /var/tmp/crond</span> and <span>/var/tmp/bs</span>. However, none mention that these three files are malicious.</p>
<p><a href="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143905/FDM_story_06.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143905/FDM_story_06.png" alt="" width="866" height="552" srcset="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143905/FDM_story_06.png 866w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143905/FDM_story_06-300x191.png 300w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143905/FDM_story_06-768x490.png 768w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143905/FDM_story_06-275x175.png 275w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143905/FDM_story_06-370x236.png 370w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143905/FDM_story_06-439x280.png 439w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143905/FDM_story_06-800x510.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px"></a></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SolusProject/comments/hqxuxo/free_download_manager_installation_help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another post</a> created in 2020, a Reddit user asked whether it is OK to install Free Download Manager without running the postinst script, which, unbeknownst to the user, contained malware.</p>
<p><a href="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/09/11085422/FDM-malware-story-071.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/09/11085422/FDM-malware-story-071.png" alt="" width="1024" height="973"></a></p>
<p>Moreover, the post author pasted the contents of the script, and another Reddit user pointed out in the comments that it may be malicious. However, these users did not identify the website distributing the infected package or find out what this script does.</p>
<p>We additionally found a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/2zmqzz/free_download_manager_serving_up_malware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> on Reddit mentioning that the official website of this software was distributing malware in 2015. However, the malware described in this post turned out to be unrelated to the campaign that we discovered.</p>

<p>All these posts on social networks made us think that the malicious Debian package could have been distributed via a supply chain attack, through the <span>freedownloadmanager[.]org</span> website. So, we decided to look for further facts that could prove or disprove this claim.</p>
<h3 id="an-unexpected-redirection">An unexpected redirection</h3>
<p>While checking videos on Free Download Manager that are hosted on YouTube, we identified <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtJPC8dscy4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several tutorials</a> demonstrating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVZdxYfn95s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to install</a> this software on Linux machines. We observed the following actions that happen in all these videos:</p>
<ul>
<li>The video makers opened the <strong>legitimate</strong> website of Free Download Manager (<span>freedownloadmanager[.]org</span>) in the browser;</li>
<li>They afterwards clicked on the Download button for the Linux version of the software;</li>
<li>They were redirected to the <strong>malicious</strong> <span>https://deb.fdmpkg[.]org/freedownloadmanager.deb</span> URL that hosts the infected version of Free Download Manager.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-1024x856.png" alt="" width="1024" height="856" srcset="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-1024x856.png 1024w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-300x251.png 300w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-768x642.png 768w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-209x175.png 209w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-370x309.png 370w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-335x280.png 335w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-800x669.png 800w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09.png 1097w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>We also noted that the redirection to the malicious <span>deb.fdmpkg[.]org</span> domain was not occuring in all cases. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqW6cNZY9DA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another video</a> posted within the same timeframe, , a user clicked on the ‘Download’ button hosted on the software website and ended up downloading Free Download Manager from the legitimate website.</p>
<p>Thus, it is possible that the malware developers scripted the malicious redirection to appear with some degree of probability or based on digital fingerprint of the potential victim.</p>
<p>We further inspected the legitimate Free Download Manager website, wanting to find out if the software developers were aware their website was potentially compromised. In one of the comments made on the software’s <a href="https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/blog/?p=131#comment-311040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a> in 2021, a user complains about observing access to the <span>5d6167ef729c91662badef0950f795bf362cbb99.u.fdmpkg[.]org</span> domain. A reply to this comment from the user ‘blogadmin’ says that Free Download Manager is not related to this domain and advises to make use only of official versions of the software:</p>

<p>However, nobody bothered to discover how this user ended up installing this suspicious version of Free Download Manager. As such, the official website of this software continued distributing the malicious Debian package until at least 2022.</p>
<h2 id="origins-of-the-backdoor">Origins of the backdoor</h2>
<p>Having established how the infected Free Download Manager package was distributed, we decided to check whether the implants discovered over the course of our research have code overlaps with other malware samples. It turned out that the crond backdoor represents a modified version of a backdoor called Bew. <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/small-to-medium-business-security/endpoint-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaspersky security solutions</a> for Linux have been detecting its variants since 2013.</p>

According to CERN, Bew infections were carried out through drive-by downloads.</p>
<p>As for the stealer, its early version was <a href="https://yoroi.company/research/the-return-of-the-wizard-vulnerability-crooks-start-hitting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> by Yoroi in 2019. It was used after exploitation of a vulnerability in the Exim mail server.</p>

<h2 id="why-wasnt-the-malicious-package-discovered-earlier">Why wasn’t the malicious package discovered earlier?</h2>
<p>The malware observed in this campaign has been known since 2013. In addition, the implants turned out to be quite noisy, as demonstrated by multiple posts on social networks. According to our telemetry, victims of this campaign are located all over the world, including Brazil, China, Saudi Arabia and Russia. Given these facts, it may seem paradoxical that the malicious Free Download Manager package remained undetected for more than three years.</p>
<p>We assess that this is due to the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>As opposed to Windows, Linux malware is much more rarely observed;</li>
<li>Infections with the malicious Debian package occurred with a degree of probability: some users received the infected package, while others ended up downloading the benign one;</li>
<li>Social network users discussing Free Download Manager issues did not suspect that they were caused by malware.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the campaign is currently inactive, this case of Free Download Manager demonstrates that it can be quite difficult to detect ongoing cyberattacks on Linux machines with the naked eye. Thus, it is essential that Linux machines, both desktop and server, are equipped with reliable and efficient security solutions.</p>
<p><em>We additionally contacted the developers of Free Download Manager and notified them about this campaign. At the time of publishing this article, we had not received a response from them.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unity was once heralded as the savior of the video game industry. It was relatively easy to use, and provided an engine/framework for multiple games rather than just one. Even as late as the early 2000s, some game companies, especially in Japan, weren't even sharing similar engines within their own teams! Before the popularity of commercial game engines, each game was built bespoke, which had some advantages, but took a lot of time, and made each port a chore. One of the greatest things Unity provided was a relatively easy pipeline to console releases, making ports more about platform quirks than full recoding.</p>
<p>I remember countless interviews I did as a journalist in 2005 where the interviewee said "now that there's engines like Unity, things are getting easier." My game company Necrosoft has used Unity for every commercial project it has ever made.</p>
<p>But now I can say, unequivocally, if you're starting a new game project, do not use Unity. If you started a project 4 months ago, it's worth switching to something else. Unity is quite simply not a company to be trusted.</p>
<p>What has happened? Across the last few years, as John Riccitiello has taken over the company, the engine has made a steady decline into bizarre business models surrounding an engine with unmaintained features and erratic stability.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>This did not age well.</figcaption></figure>
<p>I'll talk about eroding features first. Unity has internal champions for its features. Once those champions leave the company, that feature languishes and falls apart. Unity buys competing products, and then if the owner of that product leaves the company, it is no longer supported. Unity has a "stable" version of its product called the "LTS" version. More experimental features are pushed to a beta which developers can use if they're curious. Currently we are on an LTS version that requires us to open a blank page before doing anything else, otherwise the engine simply crashes. This is because of an error Unity introduced recently which they have not fixed. It adds a couple minutes every time we open the project, and is anything but stable.</p>
<p>The latest and final straw is <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates?ref=insertcredit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this announcement</a>, which you may have seen some developer friends talking about.</p>
<p>I'll break down some of the most important factors in this discussion:</p><ul><li>Unity personal, which is free, now cannot be used offline.</li><li>all tiers of unity now require developers to pay a flat fee of a few cents for every game that's installed</li><li>Unity plus (which is going away), and pro, and enterprise levels all cost a subscription, and most professional developers have to use it.</li><li>different tiers of downloads and income determine how much you pay.</li><li>Unity has never made money off subscriptions, it has always made money off its ads platform (which you see in f2p mobile games, etc)</li><li>There's a discount if you use Unity Services.</li><li>This money is meant to help with runtime issues when they can't even get their base stable version to run without crashing.</li></ul>
<p>So the problem becomes this: they are already charging a subscription, and now a per install cost on top of that. What's the point of the subscription if we're also paying another charge on top of that? Why wouldn't it be free at that point?
</p><div><p>Also, it's on developers to sort through these two types of costs, meaning Unity has added a bunch of admin work for us, while making it extremely costly for games like Vampire Survivor to sell their game at the price they do. Vampire Survivor's edge was their price, now doing something like that is completely unfeasible. Imagine releasing a game for 99 cents under the personal plan, where Steam takes 30% off the top for their platform fee, and then unity takes 20 cents per install, and now you're making a maximum of 46 cents on the dollar. As a developer who starts a game under the personal plan, because you're not sure how well it'll do, you're punished, astoundingly so, for being a breakout success. Not to mention that sales will now be more costly for developers since Unity is not asking for a percentage, but a flat fee. If I reduce the price of my game, the price unity asks for doesn't decrease.</p><p>This all comes out of the developer's pocket, but publishers won't want to be on the hook for it either - expect fewer games to be pitched with Unity going forward.</p></div>
<p>And NOW consider bundles. Each install or activation counts as something that must be paid. We did the itch.io bundle for ukraine. That was approximately a million games given out per developer. If all those were installed, developers would owe $200,000 just for having given their game to charity. It makes charity bundles completely unfeasible.</p>
<p>On top of this there is no minimum cooldown period after they change their fee, so they can raise it as they like, whenever they like. Effectively we're all locked into an upward-only, per-install pricing model that can change whenever Unity decides they need extra revenue to make their stock look healthy. No developer would have decided to use Unity if this was the business model from the start.<br>It proves that they're willing to completely change things up with no notice. January is barely 4 months away, and this decision will affect titles that have been in development for years, and haven't factored this into their budgets. If we had the option, we'd change now, but we're too far into development. Unreal Engine, to their credit, only holds you to the EULA you signed up for, not whatever they've decided most recently.</p>
<p>I want to double down on this point - we did not sign up for this. Frankly the Unity Plus tier, which we currently use, which is going away presently, wasn't even around when we signed up. Oh, and did I mention we're automatically being switched to the more expensive Pro from Plus if we don't cancel our subscription? If the agreement changes underneath you as you're making the game, you can't budget for it, and trust is completely lost. We did not plan for this, and it screws us massively on Demonschool, which is tracking to be our most successful game. You might say poor you, but again, <em>we did not sign up for this</em> and have no option to say no, since we're close to release and this change is 4 months out. You can't simply remake an entire game in another engine when you've been working on it for 4+ years.</p>

        <figcaption>It is clear that Riccitiello never considered that people might make games for reasons other than money. At least the attitude is consistent.</figcaption></figure>
<p>There is one other critical element here - developers are being offered a reduced price if they use Unity Services. This is basically monopolistic and anti-competitive, and they will likely get sued over it. At the very least it certainly won't encourage any technology companies to make services for Unity. What's the point when Unity will undercut you and still force devs into licensing their own product? Expect far less offerings from third parties in the future.</p>
<div><p>Ultimately, it screws over indies and smaller devs the most. If you can afford to pay for higher tiers, you don't pay as much of this nickle and dime fee, but indies can't afford to on the front end, or often it doesn't make sense in terms of the volume of games you'll sell, but then you wind up paying more in the long term. It'll squash innovation and art-oriented games that aren't designed around profit, especially. It's a rotten deal that only makes sense if you're looking at numbers, and assume everyone will keep using your product. Well, I don't think people will keep using their product unless they're stuck. I know one such developer who is stuck, who's estimating this new scheme will cost them $100,000/month on a free to play game, where their revenue isn't guaranteed.</p><p>Unity is desperately digging its own grave in a search for gold. This is all incredibly short-sighted and adds onto a string of rash decisions and poorly thought through schemes from Unity across the last few years. It's no wonder Riccitiello sold 2,000 shares last week.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-layout="tutorial"><a id="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a><p>In CSS, adjacent margins can sometimes overlap. This is known as “margin collapse”, and it has a reputation for being quite dastardly.</p><p>Here's a typical example, involving two sibling paragraphs:</p><pre></pre><p>Instead of sitting 48px apart, their 24px margins merge together, occupying the same space!</p><p>This idea might sound simple, but if you've been writing CSS for a while, you've almost certainly been surprised when margins either don't collapse, or they collapse in weird and unexpected ways. In real-world projects, all kinds of circumstances can complicate matters.</p><p>The good news is that once we understand the rules behind this notoriously-confusing mechanism, it becomes a lot clearer, and a lot less surprising ✨.</p><p>In this tutorial, we're going to dive deep into the details and figure it out.

Consider the following code:</p><pre></pre><p>We're dropping our first paragraph into a containing <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, but the margins will still collapse!</p><p>It turns out that many of us have <strong>a misconception about how margins work.</strong></p><p>Margin is meant to increase the distance between siblings.

Giving an element a fixed height can prevent certain margins from collapsing:</p><p>The empty space between the two margins stops them from collapsing, like a moat filled with hungry piranhas.</p><p>Note that this is on a <em>per-side basis</em>. In this example, the child's <em>top</em> margin could still collapse. But because there's some empty space below the child, its bottom margin will never collapse.</p><p>The <code>overflow</code> property creates a <em>scroll container</em>, and margins can't collapse across scroll container boundaries.</p><p>Getting into scroll containers would be too large of a detour to tackle this scenario in this blog post, though it's something we cover in depth in my <a href="https://css-for-js.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSS course</a>!</p><p>Here's the takeaway from these three scenarios: <strong>Margins must be touching in order for them to collapse.</strong></p><div id="margins-can-collapse-in-the-same-direction"><h2><a name="margins-can-collapse-in-the-same-direction-8" id="margins-can-collapse-in-the-same-direction-8" href="#margins-can-collapse-in-the-same-direction-8"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Margins can collapse in the same direction</h2></div><p>So far, all the examples we've seen involve adjacent opposite margins: the bottom of one element overlaps with the top of the next element.</p><p>Surprisingly, margins can collapse even in the same direction.</p><p>Here's what this looks like in code:</p><pre></pre><p>You can think of this as an extension of the previous rule. The child margin is getting “absorbed” into the parent margin. The two are combining, and are subject to the same rules of margin-collapse we've seen so far (eg. the biggest one wins).</p><p>This can lead to big surprises. For example, check out this common frustration:</p><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header></div><p>In this scenario, you might expect the two sections to be touching, with the margin applied inside each container:</p><div><p>Paragraph One</p><p>Paragraph Two</p></div><p>This seems like a reasonable assumption, since the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>s have no margin at all! The intention seems to be to increase the space within the top of each box, to give the paragraphs a bit of breathing room.</p><p>The trouble is that <strong>0px margin is still a collapsible margin.</strong> Each section has 0px top margin, and it gets combined with the 32px top margin on the paragraph. Since 32px is the larger of the two, it wins.</p><div id="more-than-two-margins-can-collapse"><h2><a name="more-than-two-margins-can-collapse-9" id="more-than-two-margins-can-collapse-9" href="#more-than-two-margins-can-collapse-9"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>More than two margins can collapse</h2></div><p>Margin collapse isn't limited to just two margins! In this example, 4 separate margins occupy the same space:</p><p>It's hard to see what's going on, but this is essentially a combination of the previous rules:</p><ul><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>Siblings can combine adjacent margins (if the first element has margin-bottom, and the second one has margin-top)</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>A parent and child can combine margins in the same direction</p></li></ul><p>Each sibling has a child that contributes a same-direction margin.</p><p>Here it is, in code. Use the devtools to view each margin in isolation:</p><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header></div><p>The space between our <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> has 4 separate margins competing to occupy that space!</p><ul><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>The <code>header</code> wants space below itself</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>The <code>h1</code> in the <code>header</code> has bottom margin, which collapses with its parent</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>The <code>section</code> below the <code>header</code> wants space above itself</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>The <code>p</code> in the <code>section</code> has top margin, which collapses with its parent</p></li></ul><p>Ultimately, the paragraph has the largest cumulative margin, so it wins, and 40px separates the <code>header</code> and <code>section</code>.</p><div id="negative-margins"><h2><a name="negative-margins-10" id="negative-margins-10" href="#negative-margins-10"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Negative margins</h2></div><p>Finally, we have one more factor to consider: negative margins.</p><p>Negative margins allow us to reduce the space between two elements. It lets us pull a child outside its parent's bounding box, or reduce the space between siblings until they overlap.</p><p>How do negative margins collapse? Well, it's actually quite similar to positive ones! The negative margins will share a space, and the size of that space is determined by the most significant negative margin. In this example, the elements overlap by 75px, since the more-negative margin (-75px) was more significant than the other (-25px).</p><p>What about when negative and positive margins are mixed? In this case, the numbers are <spicy>added together</spicy>. In this example, the -25px negative margin and the 25px positive margin cancel each other out and have no effect, since -25px + 25px is 0.</p><p>Why would we want to apply margins that have no effect?! Well, sometimes you don't control one of the two margins. Maybe it comes from a legacy style, or it's tightly ensconced in a component. By applying an inverse negative margin to the parent, you can "cancel out" a margin.</p><p>Of course, this is not ideal. Better to remove unwanted margins than to add even more margins! But this hacky fix can be a lifesaver in certain situations.</p><div id="multiple-positive-and-negative-margins"><h2><a name="multiple-positive-and-negative-margins-11" id="multiple-positive-and-negative-margins-11" href="#multiple-positive-and-negative-margins-11"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Multiple positive and negative margins</h2></div><p>We've gotten pretty deep into the weeds here, and we have one more thing to look at. It's the "final boss" of this topic, the culmination of all the rules we've seen so far.</p><p>What if we have multiple margins competing for the same space, and some are negative?</p><p>If there are more than 2 margins involved, the algorithm looks like this:</p><ul><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>Find the largest positive margin</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>Find the largest<span></span> negative margin</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>Add those two numbers together</p></li></ul><p>Here's an example in code. Poke around in the devtools to see how it all works out:</p><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header></div><p>In this example, our most significant positive margin is 30px. Our most significant negative margin is -20px. Therefore, we wind up with 10px of realized margin, since we add the positive and negative values together.</p><p>(No 3D illustration for this one — honestly, it was too busy and chaotic-looking to offer much clarity 😅)</p><div id="flow-layout-only"><h2><a name="flow-layout-only-12" id="flow-layout-only-12" href="#flow-layout-only-12"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Flow layout only</h2></div><p>So far, all the examples we've seen have assumed that we're "in-flow"; we're not repositioning things with Grid or Flexbox.</p><p>When items are aligned with either Grid or Flexbox, or taken out-of-flow (eg. floats, absolute positioning), margins will never collapse. This can be surprising when combined with certain techniques, like my <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/full-bleed/">Full Bleed layout</a>. In these cases, you're better off using <code>gap</code> instead of margin.</p><p>In fact, there's a <a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/margin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">growing movement</a> of developers opting for layout components instead of margin.

                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> Apple today announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-15/" target="_blank">iPhone 15</a> and iPhone 15 Plus, featuring an industry-first color-infused back glass with a stunning, textured matte finish, and a new contoured edge on the aluminum enclosure. Both models feature the Dynamic Island, and an advanced camera system designed to help users take fantastic photos of everyday moments in their lives. A powerful 48MP Main camera enables super-high-resolution photos and a new 2x Telephoto option to give users a total of three optical zoom levels — like having a third camera. The iPhone 15 lineup also introduces the next generation of portraits, making it easier to capture portraits with great detail and low-light performance. Building on Apple’s innovative satellite infrastructure, Roadside Assistance via satellite can connect users to AAA if they have car trouble while off the grid. With A16 Bionic for powerful, proven performance; a USB‑C connector; Precision Finding for Find My friends; and industry-leading durability features, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus represent a huge leap forward.

The elegant experience fluidly expands and adapts so users can see the next direction in Maps; easily control music; and, with third-party app integrations, get real-time updates on food delivery, ride sharing, sports scores, travel plans, and more. The Super Retina XDR display is great for watching content, streaming Apple Fitness+ workouts, and playing games. Peak HDR brightness now reaches up to 1600 nits so HDR photos and videos look better than ever. And when it is sunny, peak outdoor<strong> </strong>brightness reaches up to 2000 nits — twice as bright as the previous generation.

        <div>Both models feature a sophisticated new look that’s built to last. For the first time in a smartphone, color is infused throughout the back glass, creating five beautiful colors. The back glass is strengthened with an optimized dual-ion exchange process before being polished with nanocrystalline particles and etched to create a luxurious, textured matte finish. A new contoured edge on the aerospace-grade aluminum enclosure feels even nicer in users’ hands, and the Ceramic Shield front cover continues to be tougher than any other smartphone glass. With a water- and dust-resistant design<sup>2</sup> and industry-leading durability features, iPhone lasts and holds its value longer than any other smartphone. Plus, the internal design provides powerful sustained performance, while improving ease and affordability of repairs.

Using the power of computational photography, the Main camera gives users a new 24MP super-high-resolution default, offering incredible image quality at a practical file size ideal for storing and sharing. By intelligently integrating hardware and software, an additional 2x Telephoto option gives users three optical-quality zoom levels — 0.5x, 1x, 2x — for the first time on an iPhone dual-camera system.

        <div>Next-generation portraits on iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature sharper detail, more vivid colors, and improved low-light performance. For the first time, users can take portraits without having to switch to Portrait mode. When there’s a person, dog, or cat in the frame, or when a user taps to focus, iPhone automatically captures depth information, so users can turn photos into stunning portraits later in the Photos app on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. For greater creative control, users can also adjust the focus point after the photo has been taken. Shooting at night gets better with improvements to Night mode, including sharper details and more vivid colors. When lighting is bright or uneven, new Smart HDR captures subjects and the background with more true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have brighter highlights, richer midtones, and deeper shadows when viewed in the Photos app. This advanced HDR rendering is also available to third-party apps, so images can look even better when shared online. These improvements benefit the 48MP Main camera, Ultra Wide camera, and TrueDepth front camera.

                 <div>The fast and efficient A16 Bionic chip brings proven performance to iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, powering the Dynamic Island, computational photography capabilities, and more. With two high-performance cores that use 20 percent less power and four high-efficiency cores, the 6-core CPU is faster than the previous generation and easily handles intensive tasks while delivering extraordinary battery life. The 5-core GPU has 50 percent more memory bandwidth for smooth graphics when streaming videos and playing games. A new 16-core Neural Engine is capable of nearly 17 trillion operations per second, enabling even faster machine learning computations for features like Live Voicemail transcriptions in iOS 17 and third-party app experiences — all while protecting critical privacy and security features using the Secure Enclave.&nbsp;

                 <div>The iPhone 15 lineup offers critical safety capabilities to provide assistance when it matters most, including Crash Detection<sup>3</sup> and Emergency SOS via satellite.<sup>4</sup> Currently available in 14 countries and regions on three continents, Emergency SOS via satellite has made a significant impact in users’ lives. This groundbreaking safety service will come to Spain and Switzerland later this month.

                 <div>Building on this innovative satellite infrastructure, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus introduce Roadside Assistance via satellite. Beginning in the U.S., when a user has car trouble and cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available, they can now connect to AAA, the country’s largest roadside assistance provider.<sup>5</sup> An intuitive interface, including a short questionnaire to capture important details, will transmit the information via satellite so AAA can message with the user directly and dispatch help to their exact location. Access to Roadside Assistance via satellite will be included for free for two years. Service is covered according to AAA membership, but is also available separately for nonmembers.<sup>6</sup>

As Apple continues to work toward its 2030 goal of making every product carbon neutral — from design to manufacturing to customer use — the company is prioritizing clean electricity across the entire supply chain and designing products with recycled and other low-carbon materials. iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus now use even more recycled content, with 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery and 100 percent recycled copper in the main logic board, copper wire in the Taptic Engine, and copper foil in the inductive charger in MagSafe — all firsts for iPhone. Both models also include 75 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled gold in the USB‑C connector as well as the gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. The iPhone 15 lineup meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and is free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium. Over 99 percent of the packaging is fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>To further reduce impact on the planet, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple products, including iPhone accessories. Apple is introducing a new FineWoven Case with MagSafe and FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe, made from a durable and elegant microtwill with a soft, suedelike feel. The material is made from 68 percent post-consumer recycled content and has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather.

                 <div>Available in 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display sizes,<sup>2</sup> iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature a strong and lightweight titanium design — a first for iPhone. This premium alloy — the same used in spacecraft — has one of the highest strength-to-weight ratios of any metal, making this Apple’s lightest Pro lineup ever. Both models feature a new refined brush texture, contoured edges, and the thinnest borders on iPhone. The Pro lineup is built to last, combining the strength of titanium with the toughest back glass in a smartphone and the industry-leading Ceramic Shield on the front. Using an industry-first thermo-mechanical process, the titanium bands encase a new substructure made from 100 percent recycled aluminum, bonding these two metals with incredible strength through solid-state diffusion. The aluminum frame helps with thermal dissipation and allows the back glass to be easily replaced. This new design highlights the Super Retina XDR display with Always-On and ProMotion technologies for an exceptional viewing experience.

                 <h2>A17 Pro: A New Generation of Apple Silicon for iPhone
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Bringing pro performance and capabilities, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are powered by A17 Pro, the industry’s first 3-nanometer chip. Continuing Apple’s leadership in smartphone silicon, A17 Pro brings improvements to the entire chip, including the biggest GPU redesign in Apple’s history. The new CPU is up to 10 percent faster with microarchitectural and design improvements, and the Neural Engine is now up to 2x faster, powering features like autocorrect and Personal Voice in iOS 17. The pro-class GPU is up to 20 percent faster and unlocks entirely new experiences, featuring a new 6-core design that increases peak performance and energy efficiency. Now with hardware-accelerated ray tracing — which is 4x faster than software-based ray tracing — iPhone 15 Pro offers smoother graphics, as well as more immersive AR applications and gaming experiences. iPhone 15 Pro brings true-to-life gaming to the palm of users’ hands with console titles never before seen on a smartphone, like Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4, Death Stranding, and Assassin’s Creed Mirage.<sup>4</sup>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>A17 Pro includes a dedicated AV1 decoder, enabling more efficient, high-quality video experiences for streaming services. Additionally, a new USB controller enables USB 3 speeds on iPhone for the first time, now supporting much higher transfer speeds and video output up to 4K at 60 fps HDR.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Through a deep integration of hardware and software, the advanced camera systems on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max both pack the equivalent of seven pro lenses — all enabled by A17 Pro. With the power of computational photography, the 48MP Main camera, built exclusively for the Pro lineup, gives users even more flexibility with a new 24MP super-high-resolution default, offering incredible image quality at a practical file size ideal for storing and sharing. The Main camera allows users to switch between three popular focal lengths — 24 mm, 28 mm, and 35 mm — and even choose one as a new default. In addition to 48MP ProRAW, the Main camera also supports 48MP HEIF images with 4x more resolution. iPhone 15 Pro features an expansive 3x Telephoto camera, and iPhone 15 Pro Max provides the longest optical zoom ever on iPhone: 5x at 120 mm. Great for close-ups, wildlife photos, and catching the action from further distances, the new Telephoto camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max has an innovative tetraprism design with a combined optical image stabilization and autofocus 3D sensor-shift module, Apple’s most advanced stabilization system yet.

        <div>Next-generation portraits on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature sharper detail, more vivid colors, and better low-light performance. For the first time, users can take portraits without having to switch to Portrait mode. When there’s a person, dog, or cat in the frame, or when a user taps to focus, iPhone automatically captures depth information, so users can turn photos into stunning portraits later in the Photos app on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. For greater creative control, users can also adjust the focus point after the photo has been taken.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>The iPhone 15 lineup offers critical safety capabilities to provide assistance when it matters most, including Crash Detection<sup>7</sup> and Emergency SOS via satellite.<sup>8</sup> Currently available in 14 countries and regions on three continents, Emergency SOS via satellite has made a significant impact in users’ lives. This groundbreaking service will come to Spain and Switzerland later this month.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Building on this innovative satellite infrastructure, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max introduce Roadside Assistance via satellite. Beginning in the U.S., when a user has car trouble and cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available, they can now connect to AAA, the country’s largest roadside assistance provider.<sup>9</sup> An intuitive interface, including a short questionnaire to capture important details, will transmit the information via satellite so AAA can message with the user directly and dispatch help to their exact location. Access to Roadside Assistance via satellite will be included for free for two years. Service is covered according to AAA membership, but is also available separately for nonmembers.<sup>10</sup>

                 <div><ul>
<li>The <strong>Phone app</strong> gets major updates, with <strong>Contact Posters</strong> that allow users to customize how they appear to their contacts, and <strong>Live Voicemail</strong>, which leverages the power of A17 Pro to see real-time on-device transcription as someone leaves a voicemail. Users can even pick up the call while the caller is leaving their message.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>

                 <div>iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are designed with the environment in mind. As Apple continues to work toward its 2030 goal of making every product carbon neutral — from design to manufacturing to customer use — the company is prioritizing clean electricity across the entire supply chain and designing products with recycled and other low-carbon materials. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now use more recycled content, with a 100 percent recycled aluminum substructure and 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery — both firsts for Apple. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max also include 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets and 100 percent recycled gold in the USB‑C connector as well as the gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. Both models meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and are free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium. Over 99 percent of the packaging is fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>To further reduce impact on the planet, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple products, including iPhone accessories. Apple is introducing a new FineWoven Case with MagSafe and FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe, made from a durable and elegant microtwill with a soft, suedelike feel. The material is made from 68 percent post-consumer recycled content and has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather.

<p>A similar phenomenon has been observed before the earthquake in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/turkey/">Turkey</a> earlier this year, which <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/turkey-earthquake/">claimed the lives of 45,000 people.</a></p>
<p>The first recorded instance of earthquake lights on camera dates back to 1965 during a Japanese earthquake, <a href="https://www.jpost.com/international/article-758370">The Jerusalem Post</a> reports.</p>
<p>The mysterious lights have also been observed in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china/">China</a> in 2008, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/italy/">Italy </a>in 2009, and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/mexico/">Mexico</a> in 2017.</p>

<p>The cause of earthquake lights, or EQLs, remains shrouded in mystery, leaving unanswered questions about whether it serves as some sort of ominous sign of impending disasters.</p>
<p>Scientists suggest that this may be the release of energy as a result of the movement of lithospheric plates, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/environment/2019/04/earthquake-lights-explained">National Geographic</a> reports.</p>
<p>Analysing 65 earthquake light incidents for patterns in a 2014 study, adjunct physics professor and and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nasa/">NASA</a> researcher Friedemann Freund described the phenomenon "as if you switched on a battery in the Earth's crust".</p>
<p>On Saturday, Morocco woke up to devastating damage following a major 7.2-magnitude earthquake - making it one of the deadliest disasters the country has seen for over 120 years.</p>
<div data-slide-count="4" data-slide-count-tablet="4" data-rail-type="section"><p><section><h2>Most read in The Sun</h2></section></p></div>
<p>More than 2,900 people are dead and 2,059 are injured after the monster tremor struck just after 11pm local time on Friday.</p>
<p>People were sent fleeing in terror from buildings, and those who could not escape were killed as houses collapsed in the quake in Morocco.</p>
<p>The shaking lasted several seconds and a 4.9-magnitude aftershock was recorded 19 minutes later.</p>
<p>The city of Marrakesh was shaken - but the villages in the country's remote High Atlas mountains bore the brute of the devastation.</p>
<p>Morroco is also popular with tourists, with the country welcoming some 700,000 Brits every year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23892372/morocco-earthquake-relief-efforts-brits/">Dozens of Brits broke off from holidays and business trips to queue for hours to give blood</a>, with others planning supply runs into areas worst hit by the shocks.</p>

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>There has been a lot of interest on HN in fine-tuning open-source LLMs recently (eg. Anyscale's post at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37090632">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37090632</a>). I've been playing around with fine-tuning models for a couple of years, and wanted to share some insights and practical code. I’ve condensed what I’ve learned into a small set of notebooks at <a href="https://github.com/OpenPipe/OpenPipe/tree/main/examples/classify-recipes">https://github.com/OpenPipe/OpenPipe/tree/main/examples/clas...</a>, covering labeling data, fine-tuning, running efficient inference, and evaluating costs/performance. The 7B model we train here matches GPT-4’s labels 95% of the time on the test set, and for the 5% of cases where they disagree it’s often because the correct answer is genuinely ambiguous.</p><p>What is fine-tuning? You can think of it as a more-powerful form of prompting, where instead of writing your instructions in text you actually encode them in the weights of the model itself. You do this by training an existing model on example input/output pairs that demonstrate the task you want your fine-tuned model to learn. Fine-tuning can work with as few as 50 examples but I usually try to get 1000+ if possible.</p><p>Prompting still has some big advantages over fine-tuning. It's way easier/faster to iterate on your instructions than label data and re-train a model. And operationally it's easier to deploy one big model and just adjust its behavior as necessary vs deploying many small fine-tuned models that will likely each get lower utilization.</p><p>Fine-tuning has one huge advantage though: it is far more effective at guiding a model's behavior than prompting, so you can often get away with a <i>much</i> smaller model. That gets you faster responses and lower inference costs. A fine-tuned Llama 7B model is 50x cheaper than GPT-3.5 on a per-token basis, and for many use cases can produce results that are as good or better!</p><p>For example, classifying the 2M recipes at <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/corbt/all-recipes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://huggingface.co/datasets/corbt/all-recipes</a> with GPT-4 would cost $23k. Even with GPT-3.5 it would cost over $1k. The model we fine-tuned performs similarly to GPT-4 and costs just $19 to run over the entire dataset.</p><p>Disclaimer: My brother David and I are working on an open-source product called OpenPipe (<a href="https://github.com/openpipe/openpipe">https://github.com/openpipe/openpipe</a>) to help engineers adopt fine-tuning as simply as possible. But none of the information above depends on our startup. The current post is just about sharing information that we’ve learned about fine-tuning. I hope it’s useful!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div><p>While it’s widely accepted heat pumps can keep homes warm in regions that don’t experience extreme cold, their performance in chilly parts of the world is frequently debated. A <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(23)00351-3">new paper</a> out of Oxford University has put much of that skepticism to rest.</p><p>Heat pumps work by absorbing heat from the air outside — the colder it gets, the harder the units have to work to keep spaces warm. That’s where the doubt comes in: if heat pumps have to work overtime to create energy, are they really better than other heating sources? </p><p>Published Monday in the scientific journal Joule, the research found heat pumps are two to three times more efficient — or, use two to three times less energy — than their oil and gas counterparts, specifically in temperatures ranging from 10 C to -20 C. </p><div id="inline-newsletter-form"><p><h4>Get daily news from <span>Canada's National Observer</span></h4></p></div><p>The research debunks misinformation often spread about heat pumps, says Duncan Gibb, senior adviser with the Regulatory Assistance Project, an international NGO focusing on energy, which published the peer-reviewed paper with Oxford.</p><p>While a heat pump will have to work harder during sub-zero temperatures, it will still be more efficient than other sources of heat, explained Gibb.</p></div><div><p>The gas industry in Europe and the fossil fuel industry in Canada try to use the efficiency drop heat pumps have in cold weather as an argument to disqualify them as a practical home heating source, Gibb said.</p><p>Not so. “Their efficiency doesn't decline to such levels where they're disqualified,” said Gibb, who is from Nova Scotia but now lives in France.</p><div> <h3>What people are reading</h3> <div> <article role="article"> <figure> <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2023/09/11/news/warmer-winters-citrus-industry-squeezes-georgia"> <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/styles/nat_teaser/public/img/2023/09/07/victoria-chen-n6nnix4c-fo-unsplash.jpg?itok=pPW3g0xz" width="740" height="500" alt="" title="Photo by Victoria Chen / Unsplash"> </a> </figure> </article> </div></div><p>The paper, which collected performance data from studies across Europe and North America, found standard heat pumps are two to three times more efficient in places that typically reach up to -10 C, while cold climate heat pumps are 1.5 to two times efficient to up to -30 C.</p></div><div><p>People who live in chilly places shouldn’t rule them out as an option, nor should federal and provincial governments when considering what forms of heating to advocate for, said Gibb.</p><div> <blockquote> Published Monday in the scientific journal Joule, the research found heat pumps are two to three times more efficient than their oil and gas counterparts, specifically in temperatures ranging from 10 C to -20 C.&nbsp; </blockquote> </div><p>The graph below shows blue dots, representing data from studies collected by the researchers. The information they pulled all used the average coefficient performance, which measured how efficient the heat pump is, and the average outside temperature from varying kinds of heat pumps. The coefficient measurement shows a spectrum of 100 per cent efficient to 600 per cent efficient. If a heat pump is 200 per cent efficient, that means it’s creating double the amount of energy it uses.</p><figure><img height="500" loading="lazy" src="https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/styles/body_img/public/img/2023/09/08/figure_2.jpg?itok=f22vuPhP" width="1000"><figcaption>Graph courtesy of authors</figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Heat pumps, which act as heaters in the winter and air conditioners in the summer, are becoming an increasingly popular swap for homes running on natural gas and oil. Heating systems that use fossil fuels can reach up to 98 per cent efficiency, while heat pumps can be <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2023/08/08/opinion/dont-let-myths-hold-back-heat-pump-policy">200 to 540 per cent efficient</a> because they transfer heat rather than generate it. Since they use much less electricity and don’t run on fossil fuels, they are a way to limit emissions, especially as Canada moves towards its goal of a <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2023/09/08/news/heat-pumps-challenge-chill#:~:text=net%2Dzero%20building%20sector">net-zero building sector</a> and net-zero emissions by 2050. </p><p>Heat pumps run on electricity, like electric heat, and depending on where you live, the energy varies in cleanliness. In <a href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles-british-columbia.html">British Columbia</a>, most of the energy produced comes from hydropower, while in <a href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles-nova-scotia.html">Nova Scotia</a>, it comes from a mix of natural gas and coal. Because heat pumps use far less energy than other forms of heating, it makes them better for the planet. </p><p>Efficiency measurements don’t measure comfort, explained Gibb, but he said there are consumer surveys showing those who use heat pumps fare well in cold temperatures. A <a href="https://www.coolproducts.eu/heating-and-cooling/heat-pumps-perform-successfully-across-europe-new-consumer-analysis/">2022 consumer analysis</a> in Europe found 81 per cent of respondents said their comfort improved after installing a heat pump. Another <a href="https://cadmusgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Residential-ccASHP-Building-Electrification-Study_Cadmus_Final_060322_Public.pdf">study</a> conducted in New York and Massachusetts, which installed monitoring equipment in heat pump users' homes, found 32 of the 42 people who participated said they were more comfortable post-heat pump.</p></div><div><p>While Gibb hopes the study might change the minds of people concerned about heat pumps operating in cold weather, he said it also stresses the need for more supports for low-income people to install heat pumps to save money and limit emissions. In P.E.I., the province offers <a href="https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/service/free-heat-pump-program">free heat pumps</a> to people with an annual household net income of $75,000 or less; Nova Scotia has <a href="https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20221213002">similar funding</a>. In June, Efficiency Canada <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2023/06/23/news/energy-efficiency-programs-leave-renters-behind-new-paper-says-there-way-forward">called for</a> a tenants' bill of rights in a paper that digs into the inequity renters face around gaining benefits from efficiency measures such as heat pumps and makes policy suggestions on how Canada could lead the way by marrying rental protections with energy-efficiency programs.</p><p>Examining the big picture of data available on heat pumps proves they can play a much greater role in Canada and beyond, Gibb said. Yannick Monschauer, an energy analyst with the International Energy Agency, agrees.</p><p>"Thanks to continuous efforts on research and development — including by collaborators within the IEA’s Technology Collaboration Program — manufacturers have developed specialized heat pumps that work very efficiently in cold climates,” said Monschauer.</p><p>“Worldwide, the share of heat pumps in heating equipment sales is set to more than double by 2030 under today’s policies, as deployment also accelerates in colder climates."</p></div>

            Students from ETH Zurich and Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts have broken the previous world record for acceleration with their hand-built electric racing car, mythen. The vehicle accelerated from zero to 100 km/h in 0.956 seconds over a distance of 12.3 metres.

            <p>The members of the Academic Motorsports Club Zurich (AMZ) are absolutely thrilled. For the better part of a year, these students from ETH Zurich and the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts have spent every spare minute working on their electric vehicle, which they named <i>mythen</i>, overcoming setbacks and going back to the drawing board time and time again for certain components. Now, Guinness World Records has confirmed that <i>mythen</i> broke the previous world acceleration record for electric vehicles. On the <span>Switzerland Innovation Park</span> in Duebendorf, Switzerland, directly opposite the students’ workshop, their racing car accelerated from zero to 100 km/h (zero to 62.15 mph) in just 0.956 seconds, accomplishing this feat over a distance of merely 12.3 metres. At the wheel was Kate Maggetti. This beats the previous world record of 1.461 seconds, set in September 2022 by a team from the University of Stuttgart by more than a third.</p>

                <p>“Working on the project in addition to my studies was very intense. But even so, it was a lot of fun working with other students to continually produce new solutions and put into practice what we learned in class. And, of course, it is an absolutely unique experience to be involved in a world record,” says Yann Bernard, head of motor at AMZ.</p> 
<h2><b>Lighter, stronger, more traction</b></h2> 
<p>All of <i>mythen’s</i> components, from the printed circuit boards (PCBs) to the chassis and the battery, were developed by the students themselves and optimised for their function. Thanks to the use of lightweight carbon and aluminium honeycomb, the race car weighs in at only around 140 kilos (309 pounds). Four-wheel hub motors that the students developed themselves and a special powertrain give the vehicle its impressive power of 240 kilowatts, or around 326 hp. <br> </p>

                <p>“But power isn’t the only thing that matters when it comes to setting an acceleration record – effectively transferring that power to the ground is also key,” says Dario Messerli, head of aerodynamics at AMZ. Conventional Formula One cars solve this through aerodynamics: a rear or front wing pushes the car to the ground. However, this effect only comes into play when the car has reached a certain speed. To ensure strong traction right from the start, the AMZ team has developed a kind of vacuum cleaner that holds the vehicle down to the ground by suction. </p> 
<h2><b>Hotly contested world record</b></h2> 
<p>The AMZ team had set the world acceleration record for electric cars twice before – in 2014 and again in 2016. In the following years, their record was broken by a team from the University of Stuttgart. Now the world record is back in Swiss hands, and the ETH Zurich students are confident they will not relinquish it again any time soon. </p>

                <p><span>AMZ was founded by ETH Zurich students in 2006. Since then, its 30, or so, members have developed a new race car each year, which they have entered into various international design competitions – known as Formula Student in Europe. After initially developing three vehicles powered by an internal-combustion engine, since 2010 AMZ has been building purely electrically powered race cars. The club offers students the opportunity to put their acquired theoretical knowledge into practice in an extraordinarily complex, technical environment.

<p>We launched the <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/blog/" rel="nofollow">Datasette Cloud blog</a> today. The Datasette Cloud site itself is a Django app - it uses Django and PostgreSQL to manage accounts, teams and soon billing and payments, then launches dedicated containers running Datasette for each customer.</p>
<p>It's been a while since I've built a new blog implementation in Django! I decided to make notes for the next time.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Here are the features I consider to be essential for a blog in 2023 (though they haven't changed much in over a decade):</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog posts have a title, summary, body and publication date. Optional: author information, tags</li>
<li>Posts can be live or draft</li>
<li>The blog index page shows the most recent entries</li>
<li>Older entries are available via some kind of archive mechanism</li>
<li>The blog has an Atom feed</li>
<li>Entries have social media card metadata, to enhance links to them on Mastodon and Twitter</li>
<li>Markdown is a nice-to-have for editing the posts</li>
</ul>
<h2>The models</h2>
<p>Here's the Django model for the blog (I generated the first version of this with ChatGPT, then iterated on it):</p>
<div><pre><span>from</span> <span>django</span>.<span>db</span> <span>import</span> <span>models</span>

<p>It's pretty self-explanatory. The most interesting features are the <code>is_draft</code> flag and the way it provides <code>.summary_rendered</code> and <code>.body_rendered</code> properties that return Markdown rendered as HTML.</p>
<p>The URL format for this blog is <code>/blog/2023/welcome/</code> - in my experience name-spacing posts by year makes the most sense, since even the most active blogs usually only have a few posts every month.</p>
<h2>The views</h2>
<p>Here are the view functions defined the <code>views.py</code> module for my <code>blog/</code> application:</p>
<div><pre><span>from</span> <span>django</span>.<span>contrib</span>.<span>syndication</span>.<span>views</span> <span>import</span> <span>Feed</span>

<h2>The Atom feed</h2>
<p>The most interesting part of the <code>views.py</code> file is this bit - defining the Atom feed:</p>
<div><pre><span>class</span> <span>BlogFeed</span>(<span>Feed</span>):
    <span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Datasette Cloud"</span>
    <span>link</span> <span>=</span> <span>"/blog/"</span>
    <span>feed_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>Atom1Feed</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>items</span>(<span>self</span>):
        <span>return</span> <span>Entry</span>.<span>objects</span>.<span>filter</span>(<span>is_draft</span><span>=</span><span>False</span>).<span>order_by</span>(<span>"-created"</span>)[:<span>5</span>]

    <span>def</span> <span>item_title</span>(<span>self</span>, <span>item</span>):
        <span>return</span> <span>item</span>.<span>title</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>item_description</span>(<span>self</span>, <span>item</span>):
        <span>return</span> <span>item</span>.<span>summary_rendered</span> <span>+</span> <span>"<span>\n</span>"</span> <span>+</span> <span>item</span>.<span>body_rendered</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>item_link</span>(<span>self</span>, <span>item</span>):
        <span>return</span> <span>"/blog/%d/%s/"</span> <span>%</span> (<span>item</span>.<span>created</span>.<span>year</span>, <span>item</span>.<span>slug</span>)

    <span>def</span> <span>item_author_name</span>(<span>self</span>, <span>item</span>):
        <span>return</span> (
            <span>", "</span>.<span>join</span>([<span>a</span>.<span>get_full_name</span>() <span>or</span> <span>str</span>(<span>a</span>) <span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>item</span>.<span>authors</span>.<span>all</span>()]) <span>or</span> <span>None</span>
        )

    <span>def</span> <span>get_feed</span>(<span>self</span>, <span>obj</span>, <span>request</span>):
        <span>feedgen</span> <span>=</span> <span>super</span>().<span>get_feed</span>(<span>obj</span>, <span>request</span>)
        <span>feedgen</span>.<span>content_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>"application/xml; charset=utf-8"</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>feedgen</span></pre></div>
<p>This is using the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/contrib/syndication/" rel="nofollow">Django syndication feed framework</a>. The resulting Atom feed can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/blog/feed/" rel="nofollow">https://www.datasette.cloud/blog/feed/</a></p>
<p>There's one extra trick here: I'm over-riding the default <code>content-type</code> header and setting it to <code>"application/xml; charset=utf-8</code>.</p>
<p>Django defaults to using <code>application/atom+xml; charset=utf-8</code> which is correct... but causes most browsers to trigger a download rather than rendering the XML in the browser directly.</p>
<p>I like to be able to click on a feed link and see the XML before I paste the URL into my feed reader software, so I prefer to use <code>application/xml</code> instead.</p>
<h2>Social media cards</h2>
<p>It's easy to forget these, but they're really important - with the right markup links to posts shared on Mastodon, Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook will look MUCH better.</p>
<p>Here's a snipet from my <code>entry.html</code> template:</p>
<div><pre><span>{%</span> <span>block</span> <span>extra_head</span> <span>%}</span>
<span>{%</span> <span>if</span> <span>entry</span>.<span>card_image</span> <span>%}</span>
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>name</span>=<span><span>"</span>twitter:card<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>summary_large_image<span>"</span></span>&gt;
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>name</span>=<span><span>"</span>twitter:image<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>{{ entry.card_image }}<span>"</span></span>&gt;
<span>{%</span> <span>else</span> <span>%}</span>
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>name</span>=<span><span>"</span>twitter:card<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>summary<span>"</span></span>&gt;
<span>{%</span> <span>endif</span> <span>%}</span>
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>name</span>=<span><span>"</span>twitter:creator<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>@datasetteproj<span>"</span></span>&gt;
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>property</span>=<span><span>"</span>og:url<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>https://www.datasette.cloud{{ request.path }}<span>"</span></span>&gt;

<span>{%</span> <span>if</span> <span>entry</span>.<span>card_image</span> <span>%}</span>&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>property</span>=<span><span>"</span>og:image<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>{{ entry.card_image }}<span>"</span></span>&gt;<span>{%</span> <span>endif</span> <span>%}</span>
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>property</span>=<span><span>"</span>og:type<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>article<span>"</span></span>&gt;
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>property</span>=<span><span>"</span>og:description<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>{{ entry.summary_text }}<span>"</span></span>&gt;
<span>{%</span> <span>if</span> <span>entry</span>.<span>is_draft</span> <span>%}</span>
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>name</span>=<span><span>"</span>robots<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>noindex<span>"</span></span>&gt;
<span>{%</span> <span>endif</span> <span>%}</span>
<span>{%</span> <span>endblock</span> <span>%}</span></pre></div>
<p>There's one other detail in there: if an entry is a draft entry I serve <code>&lt;meta name="robots" content="noindex"&gt;</code> to prevent it from being accidentally indexed by search engines.</p>
<h2>URL configuration</h2>
<p>Here's the URL configuration from <code>urls.py</code>:</p>
<div><pre>    <span># Blog</span>
    <span>path</span>(<span>"blog/"</span>, <span>blog_views</span>.<span>index</span>),
    <span>path</span>(<span>"blog/&lt;int:year&gt;/&lt;slug:slug&gt;/"</span>, <span>blog_views</span>.<span>entry</span>),
    <span>path</span>(<span>"blog/archive/"</span>, <span>blog_views</span>.<span>archive</span>),
    <span>path</span>(<span>"blog/&lt;int:year&gt;/"</span>, <span>blog_views</span>.<span>year</span>),
    <span>path</span>(<span>"blog/tag/&lt;slug:slug&gt;/"</span>, <span>blog_views</span>.<span>tag</span>),
    <span>path</span>(<span>"blog/feed/"</span>, <span>blog_views</span>.<span>BlogFeed</span>()),</pre></div>
<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>I added a quick suite of tests, mainly to check that <code>is_draft</code> was working correctly but also to ensure the Atom feed works.</p>
<p>Testing the feed was particularly important because it's at the highest risk of accidentally breaking without me noticing it - errors that affect the HTML of the blog are much more obvious.</p>

Tracking which sites users click on for those searches, or maybe which sites users with those searches click on last should give a pretty strong signal that python.org should be ranked far above the spam farms no matter what the content percentage difference is. Content percentage is a clearly gameable metric that shouldn't outweigh other factors.<p>I'm honestly surprised Google employees haven't fixed this somehow, surely they have thousands of people running into this problem daily.

You can then get the OSS community involved on GitHub to slam dunk on all the SEO spammers.</p><p>Just look at MDN or Web.dev, both have their content repos up on GitHub and people contribute metric tons of useful info.

Then into the master doc you can start adding hinting and extra material that gets rendered into the sub-pages. So it could be approached gradually.

                  <p><span>Personally, it's because the docs aren't that good unless you're looking for something very specific. People are talking about the fact that there are no ads, but I would think it's because of the bounce rate. I could see there being a lot of people learning Python who go to the docs, see a large chunk of text with OK examples, and then bouncing to go to the other sites that have more examples. This is something that's happened to me a lot when I was doing Python development. Some of the stuff is very helpful on the docs (e.g. asyncio), but for other things the actual stuff that I want to do gets lost in the details of the docs. So while ads probably play a part, I think the bounce rate is a bigger factor, especially for people who aren't necessarily developers.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I think the problem is partly on Python's end: they've got a single page where they've jammed in all of the built in types (str, dict, list, complex, ...). It's a huge list of types and a correspondingly huge page!<p>I suspect if there were separate pages for each type then it would be ranked higher... and it would actually be more useful. I don't get why they've done it like that.</p><p>The higher ranked pages admittedly have a whole page just for a single method, which is too far in the other extreme and is obviously more for SEO than use. But with the Python docs the way they are, we'll never know whether a more sensible official page would beat them or not.</p><p>As some evidence that it's not just Google allowing spammers to shine through - sometimes for a search about a built-in type I actually do get official docs at the top, but it turns out to be the tutorial page about the class (which is not a giant mish-mash).

Maybe I want a tutorial, or short how-to for a specific task. Maybe I'm looking for something deeper, with context and explanation.</p><p>I somewhat agree with another comment here: the library reference docs should be a keystroke or click away in your development environment. Are there plugins for your preferred editor or IDE to make this possible? Use those.  If you're looking for a different kind of documentation and it's not part on the official python site, maybe that's something to be addressed.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-developer-fund/">https://godotengine.org/article/godot-developer-fund/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37481872">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>We are excited to introduce a major improvement in funding the development efforts of the Godot Engine – the <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">Godot Development Fund</a>! The goal for the Development Fund is to create a direct way for everyone to help us secure stable funding and ensure the longevity of the project.</p>

<p>The Development Fund was <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/funding-breakdown-and-hiring-process/">soft-launched in July</a> and already welcomed a lot of new and old sponsors, but we need to take it to the next level to sustain the current development pace, and increase it with new hires.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-platform-fees-amplifying-impact">Reducing platform fees, amplifying impact</h2>

<p>The Development Fund will make the Godot Project more sustainable and independent. This new platform lets us significantly reduce platform fees, and as a non-profit we do not charge VAT on donations, unlike a platform like Patreon does. So your contributions go directly towards the development and improvement of the Godot Engine itself.</p>

<p>If you are currently supporting us <a href="https://www.patreon.com/godotengine">through Patreon</a>, we encourage you to switch to the <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">Godot Development Fund</a> to increase the effectiveness of your donations.</p>



<p>The support of the community is what keeps making it possible to reach <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail/">new heights</a>. With you, we can achieve even more!</p>

<p>Every donation, no matter the size, helps us immensely! With your help we can hire more developers, create high quality demos, pay for hosting services and infrastructure, and make the best possible Godot Engine. The more funds we have, the more we can give back to you and the entire gamedev community.</p>

<h2 id="future-enhancements">Future enhancements</h2>

<p>While this is a good, fully functioning starting point for the platform, we will keep improving the Developer Fund.</p>

<p>In the future, the platform will give automated rewards, like a special Discord role, and you’ll be able to showcase your contribution level next to your username on our main platforms.</p>

<h2 id="freedom-and-independence">Freedom and independence</h2>

<p>By relying more on recurring user-funded contributions and company sponsorships, we reduce our dependence on large one-time grants from corporations. This financial independence empowers us to prioritize the needs and interests of our community and the open source principles at the core of our projects. Your help ensures that we can create our own journey, uphold our core values, and continue to evolve the engine in ways that truly benefit you, the users.</p>

<h2 id="a-heartfelt-thanks">A heartfelt thanks</h2>

<p>We would like to take a moment to express our deepest gratitude for your ongoing support, dedication, and passion for Godot. It’s thanks to you and our amazing community that the Godot Engine is what it is today. Let’s continue to make it the game engine of choice for developers worldwide!</p>

<p>We absolutely understand that not everyone can donate. In that case, please share the Godot Dev Fund link! Spreading the word is an excellent way to help.</p>

<p>Join us at the <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">Godot Development Fund</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for making it all possible.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://earthly.dev/blog/shutting-down-earthly-ci/">https://earthly.dev/blog/shutting-down-earthly-ci/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37481513">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine you live in a world where no part of the build has to repeat unless the changes actually impacted it. A world in which all builds happened with automatic parallelism. A world in which you could reproduce very reliably any part of the build on your laptop. Fairy tales, right? Well, that’s what we built, and to everyone’s surprise, nobody wanted it. It’s like flying cars - they sound amazing, but in practice, things are more difficult than they might seem.</p>
<p>Back in April 2020, we at Earthly set out on this quest to improve CI/CD tooling. We dared to ask questions like “What if the CI could run on your laptop?” And “what would the fastest CI system on the planet look like?” With these questions in mind, we came to a pretty strange, but pretty interesting answer… the build system and the CI need to be the same. And it needs to be distributed.</p>
<p>Now we all know dreaming big is easy. Execution is where things get hard.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-success-look-like">What Does Success Look Like?</h2>

<p>In a startup, you don’t have the luxury of building a mature product with all the possible bells and whistles before shipping it to your customers. Mature products take many years and many engineers to build out.</p>
<p>And yet, you are going up against the incumbents - companies that have hundreds of millions in funding, (maybe even IPO’d), they have hundreds of engineers, they have a 10-year head start, and a ton of reputation. How can you even compete?</p>
<p>Well, you know what they say… “Competition is for losers”. The answer is that you don’t. At least not on the same level. You’ll never be more mature, or have more features, or more integrations. Instead, you can be 10x better in one, very specific way. And you’ll appeal to the few teams where the very specific problem you’re solving is so painful that they’re willing to make compromises on everything else.</p>
<p>You’re not going after the whole market in the beginning. You’re just going after just enough enthusiasts, mavens, early adopters - whatever you want to call them - for whom the solution that you built on a shoestring budget is dramatically better in their specific situation than any incumbent. So much better, that they’re willing to pay the cost of adoption, and they’re willing to suffer through the bugs and the missing bells and whistles.</p>
<p>Then, once you have captured that segment, you invest more, extend to a wider audience, get more feedback, then again invest more, extend again, and so on. It’s important to understand this dynamic in order to gauge what success looks like at the earliest stages.</p>
<p>So if your MVP is not getting enough validation, you can’t just slap more features on it, because, again, features are not what will make you successful. Incumbents win feature contests.</p>
<p>Successful products will show validation at a small scale, despite all their limitations, bugs, and general annoyances. If you can’t find a small group of people passionate enough about your product in its experimental stage, you’re going to have a hard time capturing an audience even with a feature-rich product. It’s a recipe for building something nobody wants.</p>
<p>What early-stage validation looks like is a small group of people who have a lot of passion for what you do. Nobody has heard about your stuff, but your users are passionately shouting from the rooftops about it. You walk into their office and everyone has stickers with your company on their laptops, and everyone wants to talk to you.</p>
<h2 id="the-master-plan-for-earthly-ci">The Master Plan for Earthly CI</h2>
<p><picture><source srcset="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4610-1000-28f43921c.webp 1000w, https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4610-1200-28f43921c.webp 1200w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4610-1000-28f43921c.png 1000w, https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4610-1200-28f43921c.png 1200w" type="image/png"><img height="400px" src="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4610-800-28f43921c.png"></picture></p>
<p>To build out the vision of Earthly CI, we devised a master plan. We knew that we didn’t want to go on a crazy complex implementation for 3 years only to emerge from a cave with a product that would not fit the needs of the real world. So we split up the end-vision into several independent products that we would validate along the way.</p>
<p>Thus, instead of building Earthly CI from day 0, we first built the syntax, and the general experience around running builds on-demand. The key value we delivered was build consistency: there is a level of guarantee that the build will execute the same, regardless of the environment it runs in. The syntax of this build tool is the same as the CI down the road, but it only ran locally initially and in other CIs. We called this <strong>first milestone</strong> Earthly.</p>
<p>Then we built remote runners that can be invoked from anywhere - again your laptop or any CI. These remote runners bring you all the key benefits of Earthly CI but without being a CI. The key value is build speed. And I’m talking 2-20X faster CI pipelines, thanks to the caching and parallelism. We called this <strong>second milestone</strong> Earthly Satellites.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>the third milestone</strong>, Earthly CI - the platform that brings everything together, the CI that is ridiculously fast and can run anywhere. This is the full CI that is meant to compete with all the other big CIs like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Jenkins and so on.</p>
<p>What was particularly appealing about this plan was that Earthly, the build system, targets one problem: <strong>build consistency</strong>, while the final version, Earthly CI, targets another problem: <strong>build speed</strong>. This meant that Earthly, which is free, would not cannibalize in any way the monetization of Earthly CI. We wouldn’t be giving away too much for free – as Jenkins did – and instead, it would serve as a sustainable and scalable business model. It made sense to use the build system as a way to then create bottom-up adoption for Earthly CI - and the fact that we were building it first allowed us to build traction that one day will magically just convert over to Earthly CI users.</p>
<p>Little did we know that this difference in value proposition – consistency vs.&nbsp;speed – actually became a problem down the road…</p>
<h3 id="milestone-1-earthly">Milestone 1: Earthly</h3>
<p>Earthly was the lowest-stakes validation. I just built the first version on my own, threw it up on GitHub, and then launched it on Reddit and HackerNews. Zero funding (apart from my wife’s patience), so close to zero risk. If it takes off, I go raise money. If it doesn’t I’ll try something else.</p>
<p>We now know that Earthly is used widely across thousands of repositories, by companies big and small, like VMware, Adobe, Namely, Roche, ExpressVPN, Bluecore, and many others. But the early signs were that people were using Earthly even when it was a one-person unfunded project riddled with bugs and limitations. That’s validation.</p>
<h3 id="milestone-2-earthly-satellites">Milestone 2: Earthly Satellites</h3>
<p>After fixing the obvious issues in Earthly, and widened support to appeal to more types of organizations, we were now building momentum. And with enough capital, we were able to now work on the next milestone: Earthly Satellites.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Satellites was that we were getting the validation even before we built them. Earthly being open-source, you could already run your own Earthly remote runner (since we use Buildkit underneath, it was essentially a remote Buildkit), connect Earthly to it, and get similar benefits to Satellites even before this was a commercial offering. And so people did this on their own, hosting it in their own environment, without us managing it for them. Once we had this packaged up in a managed offering, people were flocking to it, mainly because they did not want to manage remote runners on their own. The initial version of Satellites was buggy, inefficient, and unstable. Yet people came to it despite those inefficiencies, because there was nothing else that would give them CI/CD speed at that level. That’s validation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we didn’t really see it for what it was at the time. We were only thinking of the end vision of taking over the CI world completely, and Satellites was just an implementation milestone that we happened to publish as a product along the way. So we just shrugged and figured, “Ok, if this is how people react to this incomplete offering, imagine how they will react to the full vision of Earthly CI!”</p>
<h3 id="milestone-3-earthly-ci">Milestone 3: Earthly CI</h3>
<p>Almost everyone who was using Satellites was using them in a CI/CD use case. Meaning that they executed remote Satellite builds via CI with the main goal of speeding up their pipelines. In this configuration, the CI vendor is merely a pass-through that deals with triggering pipelines. The actual execution happens on the satellites. To us, that was validation that Earthly CI was needed. Why not just simplify the stack? Why pay both the CI vendor and us, when you can just pay us?</p>
<p>Plus, many Earthly community members were asking about the possibility of hooking up Earthly Satellites directly to GitHub. More validation.</p>
<p>Whenever we spoke to VPs of engineering, the promise of 2-20X faster builds was making their eyes light up!</p>
<p>The closer we were getting to the Earthly CI launch, the more of a slam dunk it seemed it was going to be.</p>
<p>But, as you already know what this blog post is about, making Earthly CI successful turned out to be more challenging than we thought.</p>

<p>For Earthly CI, we did a <a href="https://earthly.dev/blog/launching-earthly-ci/">solid launch</a>, landed on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/23/earthly-wants-to-reinvent-continuous-integration-to-make-it-faster-and-cheaper/">TechCrunch</a>, and lined up <a href="https://earthly.dev/blog/remote-code-execution/">a few blog articles for Reddit and HackerNews</a>.</p>
<p>From the launch we got about 50 emails signing up on the waitlist in the first week or two, outpacing the goals we had. We started setting up calls with these people, and, right off the bat, we could sense a big difference between existing Earthly users vs.&nbsp;people who were coming to us for the first time.</p>
<p>These weren’t the raving fans we were used to talking with. New people would look at Earthly CI with a skeptical eye. They were mostly thinking that “all CIs are the same - they just have different syntax,” and then they would not really look any further as to why we might actually be different. As a result, the conversation invariably turned to the <strong>cost of migration</strong>. How difficult would it be for them to rewrite and adapt a bunch of existing scripts to be able to use Earthly effectively?</p>
<p>Existing users, by contrast, were already fans, had already done the work of the migration, and already saw the benefits of Earthly. They were ready to champion us in their organizations, even if not everyone in their organization was on board yet.</p>
<p>We kept talking to as many teams as we could, to understand the apprehension toward Earthly CI, but it always came back to weighing the cost of migration vs.&nbsp;the benefit. And we could never win this up-front, mainly because these prospects had no idea whether we could deliver on the benefits we promised at scale. We don’t have a long-established reputation like our incumbents. Existing users claimed we were 10x easier to use, but how can you prove that to a new client on a quick Zoom call? So it didn’t make sense for them to jump head-first into an expensive and time-consuming migration effort just because some startup they had never heard of promised to deliver the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>We also tried getting existing Earthly Satellite customers to switch to Earthly CI – after all, they were all using Satellites <strong>in their CIs</strong>. The problem with this group was that they were already getting 95% of the value of Earthly CI through Satellites. Their builds were already really fast. Compared to a GitHub Actions + Satellite setup, Earthly CI wasn’t better, or at least, it wasn’t better enough to warrant the switch.</p>
<p>And then, after the launch traffic died down… There was silence.</p>
<h2 id="the-most-ridiculous-negative-lead-qualification-criteria-ever">The Most Ridiculous Negative Lead Qualification Criteria Ever</h2>
<p><picture><source srcset="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4880-1000-c7746413a.webp 1000w, https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4880-1200-c7746413a.webp 1200w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4880-1000-c7746413a.png 1000w, https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4880-1200-c7746413a.png 1200w" type="image/png"><img height="400px" src="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4880-800-c7746413a.png"></picture></p>
<p>The odd thing about direct calls with prospects was that we could never convince them to try out any of our products when talking to them face to face. Not Earthly CI, not Satellites, not even Earthly. At this point, we probably had over 100 calls with prospects. We were hearing over and over how they spent 2 years migrating to their current setup, how they put so much effort into it, and how throwing all that away would be so wasteful. And how annoying it is to switch CIs.</p>
<p>And yet, when users were coming on their own to our website, through a mix of product-led / word of mouth and content marketing, the adoption of Earthly was happening every single day. At a very significant and increasing rate.</p>
<p>What seemed like absolutely impossible with one approach was being proven as very much possible - perhaps even easy - with a different approach.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it’s of course obvious that there’s no way to sell developer products via traditional means. And we already knew that. We were just shocked at how stark of a difference the approach could create. It became clear that a direct GTM approach would not help us validate a product like Earthly CI.</p>
<p>We ended up with the most ridiculous negative qualification criteria I have ever heard of: if the prospect requires a demo, then they’re not worth going after. The type of prospect that <em>does</em> convert will come to us after they downloaded Earthly, read some docs, and wrote a bunch of Earthfiles. These teams never need a demo. It’s weird, but demoing is one of the strongest negative signals we have.</p>
<p>The moral of the story here is that when you introduce a developer tool that requires integration work (work outside of the development team’s commonly expected flow, work that replicates already existing work, and work that requires learning a new syntax or API), you can never force, or hurry anyone to adopt it. This can only happen on the user’s schedule. <strong>People will buy a developer tool, but you can’t sell it</strong>. We all know that engineers like to get their hands dirty and explore things on their own. This conclusion is the corollary of that well-known fact. That’s why you can’t hard sell to engineers. You can only soft-sell.</p>

<p>Our other big channel was converting existing Earthly users into Earthly CI users. This was a key segment because there is no migration concern - everyone in this segment has already converted to Earthfiles. It should be just a flip of a switch, right?… Right?…</p>
<p>Not so fast. What about the GitHub plugins ecosystem? Do you have a codecov action? Do you have manual triggers? Can I trigger based on a git tag creation? Can I select the machine size? Can I cancel stale builds? Can I trust your platform with our build secrets?</p>
<p>Our Earthly CI MVP, despite being the fastest CI ever, never met some key requirements for people. Sure, there were a few enthusiasts who did play around with Earthly CI and started using it. But there were no sizeable organizations, with budgets, willing to use it more widely than just 2-3 engineers. And even the few Earthly CI users, after a while converted into Satellites users, to get the benefit of the combination of a richer GitHub ecosystem and the speed of the Satellites.</p>
<p>But for the most part, the Earthly community came to our product mainly for the value proposition of <em>consistent builds</em>. Since we were now trying to sell the <em>fast builds</em> value prop instead, well, our audience just wasn’t qualified that way. The match was poor.</p>
<p>And the few organizations that did have both of these needs ended up becoming Satellite customers instead. Not that we minded the Satellite customers, but it wasn’t helping to validate Earthly CI as a product.</p>
<h2 id="validating-the-invalidation">Validating the Invalidation</h2>
<p>At this point, we could see that things weren’t going according to plan. Calls weren’t converting. Existing Satellite customers weren’t converting. And existing Earthly users weren’t converting.</p>
<p>We knew that we needed to change things up, but we weren’t yet thinking that Earthly CI itself was the problem.</p>
<p>At this point, the messaging on our website was saying “Earthly makes CI super simple” and most of the content on the first page was about CI, CI, CI. Gavin Johnson, our PMM, had the interesting idea to A/B-test swapping the word “CI” for the word “build” on our website: “Earthly makes builds super simple”. Inside I kinda thought that it was somewhat of a ridiculous idea… we’re trying to push for our grand vision, and we don’t want to be bucketed into the “builds” space by investors (a space with limited commercial success). CI is where it’s at. But I didn’t have any better ideas either, so we went with it.</p>
<p>And then the results came in.</p>
<p>This one-word change ended up <strong>doubling</strong> conversions to the “Get Earthly” page – the main CTA on our website. 🤯</p>
<p>Now we were starting to get really doubtful about this Earthly CI thing.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-from-another-life">Lessons From Another Life</h2>

<p>In the fall of 2016, long before Earthly, I, along with two co-founders, a really smart code analysis scientist, and an incredibly dedicated team, started ShiftLeft (nowadays called <a href="https://qwiet.ai/">Qwiet.ai</a>). Our vision was to build a security agent that you could install in production and it would protect your cloud app from attacks on vulnerabilities that you have in your source code. This was an incredibly complex system, which required that we build an entire code analyzer that would work with multiple programming languages, runtime agents for individual runtimes, and a distributed backend to integrate everything. The complexity was akin to three companies, all being built by one tiny startup.</p>
<p>And yet, we somehow got one programming language to work end-to-end after over a year of effort, even if it was incredibly buggy initially. We tried to put it on the market - after all “if you’re not embarrassed by your first version, you launched too late”. After several attempts, we realized that it wasn’t appealing to the market. ShiftLeft being a security product, our target audience was heavily regulated enterprises. These enterprises, by definition, have a lot of red tape, and it is difficult to put anything in production without extensive bureaucracy. To make matters worse, you had to put this both in CI/CD, for the code analysis, and in production, for the runtime protection, thus creating a virtually impossible insertion motion.</p>
<p>But to overcome the difficulty of insertion, we always thought that it just needed more features. With enough features, surely the customer will accept the difficulty of insertion anyway! I mean… looking at the product it was obvious that it had all these rough edges. Maybe it’s more appealing if we smooth out the rough edges. It just needs to bake in the oven for a bit longer.</p>
<p>And bake it we did. For another year and a half. And still… Nobody. Wanted. It.</p>
<p>Looking back on the experience, we made many mistakes, which, at this point, sound like startup cliche:</p>
<ul>
<li>We did not build the product incrementally, with user feedback informing every step of the execution.</li>
<li>There were some early signals that certain aspects of the product did not align with what the industry needs, but we didn’t listen. We just kept building.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily, we later realized that this complex product can be split into two other products: a security code introspector for security experts, and a standalone code analyzer that is 40 times faster than any other code analyzer on the market. Yay! But we lost over a year of work and hired too many people to execute in a direction that never materialized into anything successful. It would have been so much more efficient if we started out by building smaller components of the end vision and selling those components as independent products first. The team would have been leaner, we would have had an MVP faster, and we would have had customer feedback much sooner, to help direct the roadmap.</p>
<p>My biggest regret from the experience was that we did not stop earlier when the signs were there.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, learning from mistakes of the past, at Earthly we built everything incrementally. And we even put products on the market that initially seemed like purely engineering intermediate milestones. Each product builds on top of the previous achievements, thus allowing for incremental iteration with the customer in mind. We’re now seeing our latest incremental iteration not working in the marketplace. And, knowing what I know about early products, it’s not the missing features that are the problem.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next-for-earthly">What’s Next for Earthly?</h2>
<p><picture><source srcset="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/5430-1000-9985df375.webp 1000w, https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/5430-1200-9985df375.webp 1200w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/5430-1000-9985df375.png 1000w, https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/5430-1200-9985df375.png 1200w" type="image/png"><img height="400px" src="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/5430-800-9985df375.png"></picture></p>
<p>Here’s how I rationalize what’s happening:</p>
<ul>
<li>People want faster builds.</li>
<li>People hate switching CIs.</li>
<li>There is a stigma toward new CIs in general. Specifically that they are undifferentiated. It’s hard to shake that bias, and we scare people off as soon as they see “CI” on our website.</li>
<li>Design-partner type of engagements don’t work when we try to engage with customers directly, due to the perceived high cost of migration.</li>
<li>The Earthly CI MVP isn’t validating, failing to create a significant enough early adopter group.</li>
<li>When we tell people that they can get faster builds without switching their CI (i.e.&nbsp;through Earthly Satellites), their eyes light up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Failing to create enough meaningful initial traction with an MVP, for some the conclusion might be simple: “It just needs more features,” or “just put it back in the oven.” But I know what a promising product’s initial traction looks like, and this is not it. If this were the real deal, there would be a group of people tolerating the absence of features for the benefits. But that’s not happening here, or at least not to a meaningful enough degree.</p>
<p>So, our conclusion is that we need to shut down Earthly CI and refocus our energy on what is working: Earthly and Earthly Satellites.</p>
<p>But Vlad, you’re deprecating the thing you just launched?</p>
<p>Well, yes. We failed fast. And that is a success in my book (or at least that’s what I keep telling myself to feel better about it). Imagine if we had built only Earthly CI from the get-go. Just like with ShiftLeft, the components of the end-vision ended up being more valuable than the original end-vision itself. Only this time, we discovered that much more efficiently.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Earthly CI is shutting down on October 1st, 2023. If you are a user, you have my sincere gratitude for experimenting with Earthly CI - it’s because of people like you that there is any innovation in the world. You took a chance on us, and we appreciate it from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
<p>Migration off Earthly CI is really easy because Earthly works with any CI. And if you want to keep getting fast builds, you can plug in Earthly Satellites (there’s now a <a href="https://cloud.earthly.dev/">free tier</a> too - yay!). Despite Earthly CI having been marked as beta / experimental, we will fully support your transition off of it. We will be hands-on in the <a href="https://earthly.dev/slack">Earthly Slack community</a> to help you out every step of the way! We remain committed to serving our users with the utmost care.</p>
<p>It seems that Earthly Satellites are taking off, not just because we are delivering fast and consistent builds, but also, crucially, because we are <strong>letting users keep their own CI</strong>. Given this signal, it makes sense for us, as a company, to continue to invest in this direction. In fact, by shutting down Earthly CI, we have more time to execute on a number of things that the Earthly community have been asking us about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Satellite metrics – including CPU, memory, disk, and network I/O usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Build history – for both local and Satellites builds – in the web UI.</p></li>
<li><p>Auto-skip – the ability to skip a build instantly if the changed files don’t impact it.</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to execute Dockerfile builds remotely on Satellites, as a fast drop-in replacement for <code>docker build</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Self-hosted Satellites (a better-supported version of <a href="https://docs.earthly.dev/ci-integration/remote-buildkit">our self-hosted, remote Buildkit</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to spread a single build onto multiple Satellites for added speed.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute v2 - fully distributed, serverless Satellites (this one will take a while to get right).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re not a user and you came to this post just for the story, then boy do I have some goodies for you to check out 🙂.</p>
<p>Earthly Satellites are ridiculously fast remote build runners that work seamlessly with any CI. It is available via Earthly Cloud and free to get started. Satellites are built on top of our open source build framework, Earthly. Earthly gives you write once, run anywhere build consistency, making it super easy to reproduce CI failures on your local computer. Earthly and Satellites together are like peanut butter and jelly – fast, consistent builds that work with any CI and are easy to debug locally.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><blockquote>
<p>Effective January 1, 2024, we will introduce a new Unity Runtime Fee that’s based on game installs. We will also add cloud-based asset storage, Unity DevOps tools, and AI at runtime at no extra cost to Unity subscription plans this November.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As many of you know, the Unity Engine is in fact two substantial software components – the Unity Editor and the Unity Runtime. The Unity Runtime is code that executes on player devices and makes Made with Unity games work at scale, with billions of monthly downloads.</p>

<p>We are introducing a Unity Runtime Fee that is based upon each time a qualifying game is downloaded by an end user. We chose this because each time a game is downloaded, the Unity Runtime is also installed.&nbsp; Also we believe that an initial install-based fee allows creators to keep the ongoing financial gains from player engagement, unlike a revenue share.</p></div><div><h2><p>Thresholds for revenue and installs</p></h2></div><div><p>Games qualify for the Unity Runtime Fee after two criteria have been met: 1) the game has passed a minimum revenue threshold in the last 12 months, and 2) the game has passed a minimum lifetime install count. We set high revenue and game install thresholds to avoid impacting those who have yet to find scale, meaning they don’t need to pay the fee until they have reached significant success.</p>

<p>Only games that meet the following thresholds qualify for the Unity Runtime Fee:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Unity Personal </strong>and <strong>Unity Plus: </strong>Those<strong> </strong>that have made $200,000 USD or more in the last 12 months AND have at least 200,000 lifetime game installs.</li>
	<li><strong>Unity Pro </strong>and <strong>Unity Enterprise</strong>: Those that have made $1,000,000 USD or more in the last 12 months AND have at least 1,000,000 lifetime game installs.</li>
</ul></div><div><h2><p>Flexibility and discounts for Unity Personal, Pro, and Enterprise</p></h2></div><div><p>With this new policy, as of January 1, 2024, we will offer Unity Personal to anyone regardless of how much revenue they make to provide more flexibility in how creators manage their licenses. Once a game passes the revenue and install thresholds, the studio would pay a small flat fee for each install (see the table below).</p>

<p>To adjust for scale, Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscribers will be eligible for volume discounts that rapidly reduce the per-install cost of the Unity Runtime Fee. This means that in addition to other benefits, the cost of Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise licenses can be offset by the savings as the game grows.</p>

<p>Finally, we structured our fees so that they take into account the variability of game monetization between more established regions like North America and Europe versus emerging gaming regions such as India. A breakdown of the pricing and discount structure is below. See the <a href="http://www.unity.com/pricing-updates" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for additional details.</p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th><strong>Unity Personal and Unity Plus</strong></th><th><strong>Unity Pro</strong></th><th><strong>Unity Enterprise</strong></th></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><strong>Unity Runtime Fee thresholds to be met</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Revenue Threshold (USD)</strong></td><td>$200,000&nbsp;(last 12mo)</td><td>$1,000,000&nbsp;(last 12mo)</td><td>$1,000,000&nbsp;(last 12mo)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Install&nbsp;Threshold</strong></td><td>200,000&nbsp;(life to date)</td><td>1,000,000&nbsp;(life to date)</td><td>1,000,000&nbsp;(life to date)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Installs over the Install Threshold</strong></td><td colspan="3"><strong>Standard monthly rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1–100,000</strong></td><td rowspan="4">$0.20 per install</td><td>$0.15 per install</td><td>$0.125 per install</td></tr><tr><td><strong>100,001–500,000</strong></td><td>$0.075 per install</td><td>$0.06 per install</td></tr><tr><td><strong>500,001–1,000,000</strong></td><td>$0.03 per install</td><td>$0.02 per install</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1,000,001+</strong></td><td>$0.02 per install</td><td>$0.01 per install</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td><strong>Installs over the Install Threshold</strong></td><td colspan="3"><strong>Emerging market monthly rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1+</strong></td><td>$0.02 per install</td><td>$0.01 per install</td><td>$0.005 per install</td></tr></thead></table>
</div><div><h2><p>Fee reduction for use of Unity services</p></h2></div><div><p>Qualifying customers may be eligible for credits toward the Unity Runtime Fee based on the adoption of Unity services beyond the Editor, such as Unity Gaming Services or Unity LevelPlay mediation for mobile ad-supported games. This program enables deeper partnership with Unity to succeed across the entire game lifecycle. Please reach out to your account manager to learn more.</p></div><div><h2><p>New services and tools. No seat price changes.</p></h2></div><div><p>This November, we will update some of the Unity subscription plans to add extra value. New capabilities include better collaboration (Unity DevOps), cloud-based asset management (Unity Asset Manager), role and access controls (Team Administration), and the ability to add AI functionality at runtime (Unity Sentis). These new tools and services will come with no increase in seat prices as we continue to help creators adapt to the growing complexity of game development. Here’s a breakdown:</p>

<ul><li><strong>All Unity plans</strong> will get <a href="https://unity.com/products/sentis" target="_blank">Unity Sentis</a>, which enables you to embed a running AI model in the Unity Runtime, inside your game or application, without needing to pay additional cloud-compute costs or introducing latency.</li>
	<li><strong>Unity Personal</strong> will include the Unity Asset Manager free tier (10GB storage total), a maximum of 3 Unity DevOps seats featuring 5GB of storage and 200 Windows build minutes, and Team Administration base roles.</li>
	<li><strong>Unity Pro</strong> will include the Unity Asset Manager (50GB of storage per seat, pooled for a team to share) along with an equal number of Unity DevOps seats featuring 5GB of storage and 200 Windows build minutes. Team Administration tools to manage access will also be included.</li>
	<li><strong>Unity Enterprise </strong>will include the Unity Asset Manager (120GB of storage per seat, pooled for a team to share) along with an equal number of Unity DevOps seats with 5GB of storage and 200 Windows build minutes. Team Administration tools, including custom roles and SSO, provide a higher degree of control.</li>
</ul><p>Finally, Unity Plus is being retired for new subscribers effective today, September 12, 2023, to simplify the number of plans we offer. Existing subscribers do not need to take immediate action and will receive an email mid-October with an offer to upgrade to Unity Pro, for one year, at the current Unity Plus price.</p>

<div>
<p>I received a letter from a reader the other day. It was handwritten in crabbed penmanship so that it was very difficult to read. Nevertheless, I tried to make it out just in case it might prove to be important.</p>

<p>In the first sentence, he told me he was majoring in English Literature, but felt he needed to teach me science. (I sighed a bit, for I knew very few English Lit majors who are equipped to teach me science, but I am very aware of the vast state of my ignorance and I am prepared to learn as much as I can from anyone, however low on the social scale, so I read on.)</p>

<p>It seemed that in one of my innumerable essays, here and elsewhere, I had expressed a certain gladness at living in a century in which we finally got the basis of the Universe straight.</p>

<p>I didn't go into detail in the matter, but what I meant was that we now know the basic rules governing the Universe, together with the gravitational interrelationships of its gross components, as shown in the theory of relativity worked out between 1905 and 1916. We also know the basic rules governing the subatomic particles and their interrelationships, since these are very neatly described by the quantum theory worked out between 1900 and 1930. What's more, we have found that the galaxies and clusters of galaxies are the basic units of the physical Universe, as discovered between 1920 and 1930.</p>

<p>These are all twentieth-century discoveries, you see.</p>

<p>The young specialist in English Lit, having quoted me, went on to lecture me severely on the fact that in <em>every</em> century people have thought they understood the Universe at last, and in <em>every</em> century they were proven to be wrong. It follows that the one thing we can say about out modern "knowledge" is that it is <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>The young man then quoted with approval what Socrates had said on learning that the Delphic oracle had proclaimed him the wisest man in Greece. "If I am the wisest man," said Socrates, "it is because I alone know that I know nothing." The implication was that I was very foolish because I knew a great deal.</p>

<p>Alas, none of this was new to me. (There is very little that is new to me; I wish my corresponders would realize this.) This particular thesis was addressed to me a quarter of a century ago by John Campbell, who specialized in irritating me. He also told me that all theories are proven wrong in time.</p>

<p>My answer to him was, "John, when people thought the Earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the Earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if <em>you</em> think that thinking the Earth is spherical is <em>just as wrong</em> as thinking the Earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together."</p>

<p>The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that "right" and "wrong" are absolute; that everything that isn't perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong.</p>

<p>However, I don't think that's so. It seems to me that right and wrong are fuzzy concepts, and I will devote this essay to an explanation of why I think so.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>First, let me dispose of Socrates because I am sick and tired of this pretense that knowing you know nothing is a mark of wisdom.</p>

<p>No one knows <em>nothing</em>. In a matter of days, babies learn to recognize their mothers.</p>

<p>Socrates would agree, of course, and explain that knowledge of trivia is not what he means. He means that in the great abstractions over which human beings debate, one should start without preconceived, unexamined notions, and that he alone knew this. (What an enormously arrogant claim!)</p>

<p>In his discussions of such matters as "What is justice?" or "What is virtue?" he took the attitude that he knew nothing and had to be instructed by others. (This is called "Socratic irony," for Socrates knew very well that he knew a great deal more than the poor souls he was picking on.) By pretending ignorance, Socrates lured others into propounding their views on such abstractions. Socrates then, by a series of ignorant-sounding questions, forced the others into such a mélange of self-contradictions that they would finally break down and admit they didn't know what they were talking about.</p>

<p>It is the mark of the marvelous toleration of the Athenians that they let this continue for decades and that it wasn't till Socrates turned seventy that they broke down and forced him to drink poison.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Now where do we get the notion that "right" and "wrong" are absolutes? It seems to me that this arises in the early grades, when children who know very little are taught by teachers who know very little more.</p>

<p>Young children learn spelling and arithmetic, for instance, and here we tumble into apparent absolutes.</p>

<p>How do you spell "sugar?" Answer: s-u-g-a-r. That is <em>right</em>. Anything else is <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>How much is 2 + 2? The answer is 4. That is <em>right</em>. Anything else is <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>Having exact answers, and having absolute rights and wrongs, minimizes the necessity of thinking, and that pleases both students and teachers. For that reason, students and teachers alike prefer short-answer tests to essay tests; multiple-choice over blank short-answer tests; and true-false tests over multiple-choice.</p>

<p>But short-answer tests are, to my way of thinking, useless as a measure of the student's understanding of a subject. They are merely a test of the efficiency of his ability to memorize.</p>

<p>You can see what I mean as soon as you admit that right and wrong are relative.</p>

<p>How do you spell "sugar?" Suppose Alice spells it p-q-z-z-f and Genevieve spells it s-h-u-g-e-r. Both are wrong, but is there any doubt that Alice is wronger than Genevieve? For that matter, I think it is possible to argue that Genevieve's spelling is superior to the "right" one.</p>

<p>Or suppose you spell "sugar": s-u-c-r-o-s-e, or C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>. Strictly speaking, you are wrong each time, but you're displaying a certain knowledge of the subject beyond conventional spelling.</p>

<p>Suppose then the test question was: how many different ways can you spell "sugar?" Justify each.</p>

<p>Naturally, the student would have to do a lot of thinking and, in the end, exhibit how much or how little he knows. The teacher would also have to do a lot of thinking in the attempt to evaluate how much or how little the student knows. Both, I imagine, would be outraged.</p>

<p>Again, how much is 2 + 2? Suppose Joseph says: 2 + 2 = purple, while Maxwell says: 2 + 2 = 17. Both are wrong but isn't it fair to say that Joseph is wronger than Maxwell?</p>

<p>Suppose you said: 2 + 2 = an integer. You'd be right, wouldn't you? Or suppose you said: 2 + 2 = an even integer. You'd be righter. Or suppose you said: 2 + 2 = 3.999. Wouldn't you be <em>nearly</em> right?</p>

<p>If the teacher wants 4 for an answer and won't distinguish between the various wrongs, doesn't that set an unnecessary limit to understanding?</p>

<p>Suppose the question is, how much is 9 + 5?, and you answer 2. Will you not be excoriated and held up to ridicule, and will you not be told that 9 + 5 = 14?</p>

<p>If you were then told that 9 hours had pass since midnight and it was therefore 9 o'clock, and were asked what time it would be in 5 more hours, and you answered 14 o'clock on the grounds that 9 + 5 = 14, would you not be excoriated again, and told that it would be 2 o'clock? Apparently, in that case, 9 + 5 = 2 after all.</p>

<p>Or again suppose, Richard says: 2 + 2 = 11, and before the teacher can send him home with a note to his mother, he adds, "To the base 3, of course." He'd be right.</p>

<p>Here's another example. The teacher asks: "Who is the fortieth President of the United States?" and Barbara says, "There isn't any, teacher."</p>

<p>"Wrong!" says the teacher, "Ronald Reagan is the fortieth President of the United States."</p>

<p>"Not at all," says Barbara, "I have here a list of all the men who have served as President of the United States under the Constitution, from George Washington to Ronald Reagan, and there are only thirty-nine of them, so there is no fortieth President."</p>

<p>"Ah," says the teacher, "but Grover Cleveland served two nonconsecutive terms, one from 1885 to 1889, and the second from 1893 to 1897. He counts as both the twenty-second and twenty-fourth President. That is why Ronald Reagan is the thirty-ninth person to serve as President of the United States, and is, at the same time, the fortieth President of the United States."</p>

<p>Isn't that ridiculous? Why should a person be counted twice if his terms are nonconsecutive, and only once if he served two consecutive terms? Pure convention! Yet Barbara is marked wrong—just as wrong as if she had said that the fortieth President of the United States is Fidel Castro.</p>

<p>Therefore, when my friend the English Literature expert tells me that in every century scientists think they have worked out the Universe and are <em>always wrong</em>, what I want to know is <em>how</em> wrong are they? Are they always wrong to the same degree? Let's take an example.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>In the early days of civilization, the general feeling was that the Earth was flat.</p>

<p>This was not because people were stupid, or because they were intent on believing silly things. They felt it was flat on the basis of sound evidence. It was <em>not</em> just a matter of "That's how it looks," because the Earth does <em>not</em> look flat. It looks chaotically bumpy, with hills, valleys, ravines, cliffs, and so on.</p>

<p>Of course, there are plains where, over limited areas, the Earth's surface <em>does</em> look fairly flat. One of those plains is in the Tigris-Euphrates area where the first historical civilization (one with writing) developed, that of the Sumerians.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the appearance of the plain that may have persuaded the clever Sumerians to accept the generalization that the Earth was flat; that if you somehow evened out all the elevations and depressions, you would be left with flatness. Contributing to the notion may have been the fact that stretches of water (ponds and lakes) looked pretty flat on quiet days.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at it is to ask what is the "curvature" of Earth's surface. Over a considerable length, how much does the surface deviate (on the average) from perfect flatness. The flat-Earth theory would make it seem that the surface doesn't deviate from flatness at all, that its curvature is 0 to the mile.</p>

<p>Nowadays, of course, we are taught that the flat-Earth theory is <em>wrong</em>; that it is all wrong, terribly wrong, absolutely. But it isn't. The curvature of the Earth is <em>nearly</em> 0 per mile, so that although the flat-Earth theory is wrong, it happens to be <em>nearly</em> right. That's why the theory lasted so long.</p>

<p>There were reasons, to be sure, to find the flat-Earth theory unsatisfactory and, about 350 B.C., the Greek philosopher Aristotle summarized them. First, certain stars disappeared beyond the Southern Hemisphere as one traveled north, and beyond the Northern Hemisphere as one traveled south. Second, the Earth's shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse was always the arc of a circle. Third, here on Earth itself, ships disappeared beyond the horizon hull-first in whatever direction they were traveling.</p>

<p>All three observations could not be reasonably explained if the Earth's surface were flat, but could be explained by assuming the Earth to be a sphere.</p>

<p>What's more, Aristotle believed that all solid matter tended to move toward a common center, and if solid matter did this, it would end up as a sphere. A given volume of matter is, on the average, closer to a common center if it is a sphere than if it is any other shape whatever.</p>

<p>About a century after Aristotle, the Greek philosopher Eratosthenes noted that the Sun cast a shadow of different lengths at different latitudes (all the shadows would be the same length if the Earth's surface were flat). From the difference in shadow length, he calculated the size of the earthly sphere and it turned out to be 25,000 miles in circumference.</p>

<p>The curvature of such a sphere is about 0.000126 per mile, a quantity very close to 0 per mile as you can see, and one not easily measured by the techniques at the disposal of the ancients. The tiny difference between 0 and 0.000126 accounts for the fact that it took so long to pass from the flat Earth to the spherical Earth.</p>

<p>Mind you, even a tiny difference, such at that between 0 and 0.000126, can be extremely important. That difference mounts up. The Earth cannot be mapped over large areas with any accuracy at all if the difference isn't taken into account and if the Earth isn't considered a sphere rather than a flat surface. Long ocean voyages can't be undertaken with any reasonable way of locating one's own position in the ocean unless the Earth is considered spherical rather than flat.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the flat Earth presupposes the possibility of an infinite Earth, or of the existence of an "end" to the surface. The spherical Earth, however, postulates an Earth that is both endless and yet finite, and it is the latter postulate that is consistent with all later findings.</p>

<p>So although the flat-Earth theory is only slightly wrong and is a credit to its inventors, all things considered, it is wrong enough to be discarded in favor of the spherical-Earth theory.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>And yet is the Earth a sphere?</p>

<p>No, it is <em>not</em> a sphere; not in the strict mathematical sense. A sphere has certain mathematical properties—for instance, all diameters (that is, all straight lines that pass from one point on its surface, through the center, to another point on its surface) have the same length.</p>

<p>That, however, is not true of the Earth. Various diameters of the Earth differ in length.</p>

<p>What gave people the notion the Earth wasn't a true sphere? To begin with, the Sun and the Moon have outlines that are perfect circles within the limits of measurement in the early days of the telescope. This is consistent with the supposition that the Sun and Moon are perfectly spherical in shape.</p>

<p>However, when Jupiter and Saturn were observed by the first telescopic observers, it became quickly apparent that the outlines of those planets were not circles, but distinct ellipses. That meant that Jupiter and Saturn were not true spheres.</p>

<p>Isaac Newton, toward the end of the seventeenth century, showed that a massive body would form a sphere under the pull of gravitational forces (exactly as Aristotle had argued), but only if it were not rotating. If it were rotating, a centrifugal effect would be set up which would lift the body's substance against gravity, and the effect would be greater the closer to the equator you progressed. The effect would also be greater the more rapidly a spherical object rotated and Jupiter and Saturn rotated very rapidly indeed.</p>

<p>The Earth rotated much more slowly than Jupiter or Saturn so the effect should be smaller, but it should still be there. Actual measurements of the curvature of the Earth were carried out in the eighteenth century and Newton was proved correct.</p>

<p>The Earth has an equatorial bulge, in other words. It is flattened at the poles. It is an "oblate spheroid" rather than a sphere. This means that the various diameters of the earth differ in length. The longest diameters are any of those that stretch from one point on the equator to an opposite point on the equator. The "equatorial diameter" is 12,755 kilometers (7,927 miles). The shortest diameter is from the North Pole to the South Pole and this "polar diameter" is 12,711 kilometers (7,900 miles).</p>

<p>The difference between the longest and shortest diameters is 44 kilometers (27 miles), and that means that the "oblateness" of the Earth (its departure from true sphericity) is 44/12,755, or 0.0034. This amounts to 1/3 of 1 percent.</p>

<p>To put it another way, on a flat surface, curvature is 0 per mile everywhere. On Earth's spherical surface, curvature is 0.000126 per mile everywhere (or 8 inches per mile). On Earth's oblate spheroidical surface, the curvature varies from 7.973 inches to the mile to 8.027 inches to the mile.</p>

<p>The correction in going from spherical to oblate spheroidal is much smaller than going from flat to spherical. Therefore, although the notion of the Earth as sphere is wrong, strictly speaking, it is not <em>as</em> wrong as the notion of the Earth as flat.</p>

<p>Even the oblate-spheroidal notion of the Earth is wrong, strictly speaking. In 1958, when the satellite <em>Vanguard 1</em> was put into orbit about the Earth, it was able to measure the local gravitational pull of the Earth—and therefore its shape—with unprecedented precision. It turned out that the equatorial bulge south of the equator was slightly bulgier than the bulge north of the equator, and that the South Pole sea level was slightly nearer the center of the Earth than the North Pole sea level was.</p>

<p>There seemed no other way of describing this than by saying the Earth was pearshaped and at once many people decided that the Earth was nothing like a sphere but was shaped like a Bartlett pear dangling in space. Actually, the pearlike deviation from oblate-spheroid perfect was a matter of yards rather than miles and the adjustment of curvature was in the millionths of an inch per mile.</p>

<p>In short, my English Lit friend, living in a mental world of absolute rights and wrongs, may be imagining that because all theories are <em>wrong</em>, the Earth may be thought spherical now, but cubical next century, and a hollow icosahedron the next, and a doughnut shape the one after.</p>

<p>What actually happens is that once scientists get hold of a good concept they gradually refine and extend if with a greater and greater subtlety as their instruments of measurement improve. Theories are not so much wrong as incomplete.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>This can be pointed out in many other cases than just the shape of the Earth. Even when a new theory seems to represent a revolution, it usually arises out of small refinements. If something more than a small refinement were needed, then the old theory would never have endured.</p>

<p>Copernicus switched from an Earth-centered planetary system to a Sun-centered one. In doing so, he switched from something that was obvious to something that was apparently ridiculous. However, it was a matter of finding better ways of calculating the motion of the planets in the sky and, eventually, the geocentric theory was just left behind. It was precisely because the old theory gave results that were fairly good by the measurement standards of the time that kept it in being so long.</p>

<p>Again, it is because the geological formations of the Earth change <em>so</em> slowly and the living things upon it evolve <em>so</em> slowly that it seemed reasonable at first to suppose that there was <em>no</em> change and that Earth and life always existed as they do today. If that were so, it would make no difference whether Earth and life were billions of years old or thousands. Thousands were easier to grasp.</p>

<p>But when careful observation showed that Earth and life were changing at a rate that was very tiny but <em>not</em> zero, then it became clear that Earth and life had to be very old. Modern geology came into being, and so did the notion of biological evolution.</p>

<p>If the rate of change were more rapid, geology and evolution would have reached their modern state in ancient times. It is only because the difference between the rate of change in a static Universe and the rate of change in an evolutionary one is that between zero and very nearly zero that the creationists can continue propagating their folly.</p>

<p>Again, how about the two great theories of the twentieth century; relativity and quantum mechanics?</p><p>Newton's theories of motion and gravitation were very close to right, and they would have been absolutely right if only the speed of light were infinite. However, the speed of light is finite, and that had to be taken into account in Einstein's relativistic equations, which were an extension and refinement of Newton's equations.</p>

<p>You might say that the difference between infinite and finite is itself infinite, so why didn't Newton's equations fall to the ground at once? Let's put it another way, and ask how long it takes light to travel over a distance of a meter.</p>

<p>If light traveled at infinite speed, it would take light 0 seconds to travel a meter. At the speed at which light actually travels, however, it takes it 0.0000000033 seconds. It is that difference between 0 and 0.0000000033 that Einstein corrected for.</p>

<p>Conceptually, the correction was as important as the correction of Earth's curvature from 0 to 8 inches per mile was. Speeding subatomic particles wouldn't behave the way they do without the correction, nor would particle accelerators work the way they do, nor nuclear bombs explode, nor the stars shine. Nevertheless, it was a tiny correction and it is no wonder that Newton, in his time, could not allow for it, since he was limited in his observations to speeds and distances over which the correction was insignificant.</p>

<p>Again, where the prequantum view of physics fell short was that it didn't allow for the "graininess" of the Universe. All forms of energy had been thought to be continuous and to be capable of division into indefinitely smaller and smaller quantities.</p>

<p>This turned out to be not so. Energy comes in quanta, the size of which is dependent upon something called Planck's constant. If Planck's constant were equal to 0 erg-seconds, then energy would be continuous, and there would be no grain to the Universe. Planck's constant, however, is equal to 0.000000000000000000000000066 erg-seconds. That is indeed a tiny deviation from zero, so tiny that ordinary questions of energy in everyday life need not concern themselves with it. When, however, you deal with subatomic particles, the graininess is sufficiently large, in comparison, to make it impossible to deal with them without taking quantum considerations into account.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Since the refinements in theory grow smaller and smaller, even quite ancient theories must have been sufficiently right to allow advances to be made; advances that were not wiped out by subsequent refinements.</p>

<p>The Greeks introduced the notion of latitude and longitude, for instance, and made reasonable maps of the Mediterranean basin even without taking sphericity into account, and we still use latitude and longitude today.</p>

<p>The Sumerians were probably the first to establish the principle that planetary movements in the sky exhibit regularity and can be predicted, and they proceeded to work out ways of doing so even though they assumed the Earth to be the center of the Universe. Their measurements have been enormously refined but the principle remains.</p>

<p>Newton's theory of gravitation, while incomplete over vast distances and enormous speeds, is perfectly suitable for the Solar System. Halley's Comet appears punctually as Newton's theory of gravitation and laws of motion predict. All of rocketry is based on Newton, and <em>Voyager II</em> reached Uranus within a second of the predicted time. None of these things were outlawed by relativity.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century, before quantum theory was dreamed of, the laws of thermodynamics were established, including the conservation of energy as first law, and the inevitable increase of entropy as the second law. Certain other conservation laws such as those of momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge were also established. So were Maxwell's laws of electromagnetism. All remained firmly entrenched even after quantum theory came in.</p>

<p>Naturally, the theories we now have might be considered wrong in the simplistic sense of my English Lit correspondent, but in a much truer and subtler sense, they need only be considered incomplete.</p>

<p>For instance, quantum theory has produced something called "quantum weirdness" which brings into serious question the very nature of reality and which produces philosophical conundrums that physicists simply can't seem to agree upon. It may be that we have reached a point where the human brain can no longer grasp matters, or it may be that quantum theory is incomplete and that once it is properly extended, all the "weirdness" will disappear.</p>

<p>Again, quantum theory and relativity seem to be independent of each other, so that while quantum theory makes it seem possible that three of the four known interactions can be combined into one mathematical system, gravitation—the realm of relativity—as yet seems intransigent.</p>

<p>If quantum theory and relativity can be combined, a true "unified field theory" may become possible.</p>

<p>If all this is done, however, it would be a still finer refinement that would affect the edges of the known—the nature of the big bang and the creation of the Universe, the properties at the center of black holes, some subtle points about the evolution of galaxies and supernovas, and so on.</p>

<p>Virtually all that we know today, however, would remain untouched and when I say I am glad that I live in a century when the Universe is essentially understood, I think I am justified.</p>

The larger the </span><em>n, </em><span>the smaller the variance; the smaller the variance, the more the normal distribution is concentrated around the expected value μ.</span></p><p>This finally answers our question: how large is that ominous number in the law of large numbers? It depends on the variance of our distribution!</p><p><span>We can read from the asymptotic expansion that if the variance is 10x larger, we need roughly 10x the number of samples for the average to be as close as originally.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <article>
                  <p><span><span lang="EN-US">Atsugi, Japan — Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation (SSS) today announced that it has developed an energy harvesting<sup>*1</sup> module that uses electromagnetic wave noise energy.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The new module applies technology that SSS has cultivated in the tuner development process to generate power from electromagnetic wave noise with a high level of efficiency. For example, this technology can use the constant electromagnetic wave noise generated by robots inside factories, monitors and lighting in offices, monitors and TVs in stores and homes, and the like to provide the stable power supply needed to run low-power consumption IoT sensors and communications equipment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">With attention on the challenge of providing power to the increasing number of IoT devices as they grow in popularity and sophistication, this highly efficient energy harvesting technology shows promise for a wide range of applications. SSS aims to employ the new technology as part of its effort to build a power circulation model, thereby contributing to the development of a sustainable IoT society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>*1:&nbsp;&nbsp; Technology that harvests minute amounts of energy that exist in the environment and living things for conversion into electricity.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Usage scenarios<br></span><span lang="EN-US">Factory (Left), Office (Middle), Retail (Right)</span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Energy harvesting is a technology that is expected to contribute to both the development of IoT and the sustainability of the global environment, with research being carried out mainly in fields such as electrical waves, light, heat, and vibration. SSS’s new technology is the energy harvesting technology to generate power utilizing the electromagnetic wave noise that all electrical equipment generates.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Based on antenna technology created during tuner development at SSS, this new module uses the metal parts of electronic devices that serve as the source of electromagnetic wave noise as part of an antenna and employs a rectifier circuit<sup>*2</sup> with enhanced electricity conversion efficiency, for a highly original structure. This allows it to convert electromagnetic wave noise in a range of several Hz to 100 MHz into electrical energy and supply power to low-power consumption IoT sensors and communications equipment, or to charge batteries, despite its compact size. This is the industry’s first<sup>*3</sup> energy harvesting technology based on this method that achieves highly efficient power generation. By efficiently utilizing previously ignored electromagnetic wave noise as a new power source, it enables a stable power supply for equipment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The minimal number of constituent components used in the module yields a compact design that allows for greater freedom of installation. Also, as long as electronic devices are powered, energy can be harvested even while they are not in active use, making this technology promising in a wide variety of usage situations such as factories, offices, stores, and homes, both indoors and outdoors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>*2:&nbsp;&nbsp; An electrical circuit that converts alternating current to direct current. In general, alternating current is used to transmit electrical energy, so a rectifier circuit is used in power sources of equipment that require direct current.</span></p>
<p><span>*3:&nbsp;&nbsp; As an energy harvesting technology. According to SSS research. As of announcement on September 7, 2023.</span></p>

<p>Developed module (size: 7 mm square)</p>
</div>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-US">Main Features</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-US"><span><strong>High level of power generation<br></strong></span></span>Utilizing electronic equipment that generates a significant amount of electromagnetic wave noise such as household appliances, computers, lighting equipment, vending machines, elevators, automobiles, and industrial equipment as an energy source enables this module to harvest from several dozen μW to several dozen mW of power. Doing so makes it possible to supply power to low-power consumption IoT sensors and communications equipment</li>
<li><span lang="EN-US"><strong><span>Applicable to a wide range of use cases<br></span></strong></span><strong>-</strong> As long as electronic devices are powered, power can be harvested even when they are not in active use. This method therefore differs from other energy harvesting methods which use sunlight, electrical waves, and temperature differences, all of which are susceptible to environmental factors such as lighting brightness and indoor environments. Thus, the new module enables continuous harvesting.<br> <strong>-</strong> The minimal number of constituent components used in the module yields a compact design that allows for greater freedom of installation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN-US"><span>Device status can be identified<br></span></span></strong>Because this technology continuously harvests electromagnetic wave noise from electronic devices, it can also identify the internal status of the electronic device by detecting changes in the harvested voltage. This means, for instance, that it can be used for applications such as detecting whether lighting is functioning normally or predicting device failure, for example in robots with built-in motors.</li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-US">SSS looks forward to working with partners from various industries to develop products based on this technology, which shows promise across a wide variety of applications.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	<div>
		<p>Every release has a killer feature. Qt 6.6 features the opposite - staying alive. This blog post describes work to make Qt clients more robust and seemlessly migrate between compositors, providing resistance against compositor crashes and more.</p>
<h2>Prologue</h2>
<p>Right now if you restart pulseaudio your sound might cut out, restart NetworkManager and you lose your wifi, restart an X11 window manager and your decorations disappear.</p>
<p>But within a second it's all back to normal exactly where you left off with everything recovering fine.</p>
<p>This isn't true for display servers. If X11 restarts you're back at the login prompt. All drafts lost, games unsaved, work wasted.</p>
<h2>Past</h2>
<p>For X11 this was unfixable; clients relied on memory stored by the Xserver, they made synchronous calls that were expected to return values, and multiple clients talked to multple clients.</p>
<p>This was a real problem in my early days of Linux, X11 would lock up frequently enough that most distributions had a shortcut key to restart the server and send you back to the login prompt.</p>
<p>It's less of an issue now as X11 has been in a lengthy period of feature freeze.</p>
<h2>Present</h2>
<p>Wayland makes it possible to fix all this. Memory allocations are client side, all operations are async, all protocols are designed that the compositor always has complete control.</p>
<p>Yet the current user-facing state is <strong>considerably worse</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compositors and displays servers are now the same process, doubling the space for errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compositors are typically extensible with 3rd party plugins and scripts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wayland security model means the compositor absorbs even more functions from global shortcuts to screencasting and input-method handling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wayland ecosystem  is not in a period of feature freeze with wayland protocols constantly evolving to cover missing features and new ideas.</p>
<p>Even if there was a perfect compositor:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://bugs.kde.org/report.cgi?bug_severity=crash&amp;bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;classification=Plasma&amp;cumulate=0&amp;product=kwin&amp;resolution=FIXED&amp;resolution=UPSTREAM&amp;resolution=DOWNSTREAM&amp;saved_report_id=14&amp;x_axis_field=resolution&amp;width=1024&amp;height=600&amp;action=wrap&amp;format=pie">40% of kwin's crash bug reports are either upstream or downstream causes</a> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current compositor developer experience is limited with developers having to relogin and restart their apps and development setup just to test their latest changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plan</h2>
<p>The solution for this? Instead of exiting when the compositor closes, simply...don't!</p>
<p>If we could connect to a new compositor we just need to send the right amount of information to bring it in sync and notify the application code of any changes to bring this in sync.</p>
<p>For Qt applications all this information is handled in the backend, in the Wayland Qt Platform Abstraction (QPA).</p>
<p>Qt already has to handle screens and input devices being removed, clipboards being revoked and drag and drops cancelled. Supporting a whole reset isn't introducing any new work, we just have to trigger all of these actions at once, then reconnect to the newly restored compositor and restore our contents.</p>
<p>Applications already have to support all of these events too as well as handle callbacks to redraw buffers. There's no changes needed at an application code level, it's all done as transparently as possible. </p>
<p>Handling OpenGL is a challenge, right now we don't have a way to keep that alive. Fortunately we put in lots of effort previously in supporting GPU resets throughout the Qt stack. The QtWayland backend fakes to the applications that a GPU reset has occured through the Qt abstractions.</p>
<p>For the majority of applications including all QtQuick users this happens automatically and flawlessly, building on the work <a href="https://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/plasma-rendering-handling-nvidia-context-loss/" title="that we put in previously">that we put in previously</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst the overall concepts might sound invasive, the final merge-request to support all of this for all Qt applications was fewer lines than supporting middle-click paste.</p>
<p>Almost no work needs doing on the compositor side. For a compositor there's no difference between a new client, and a client that was running previously reconnecting. The only big change we made within Kwin is having a helper process so the whole process can be seemless and race-free.</p>
<h2>Proof</h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u4HnwqidYFo?si=zmIxcs9555Zv6gsP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Path Forward</h2>
<p>This post is about Qt, but the world is bigger than that. Not only does this technique work here, but we have pending patches for GTK, SDL and even XWayland, with key parts of SDL merged but disabled already.</p>
<p>The challenge for the other toolkits is we can't use the same OpenGL trick as Qt. They either lack GPU reset handling either at a toolkit level or within the applications. </p>
<p>Supporting OpenGL requires new infrastructure. We've tried from the start to get some infrastructure in place to allow this.It was clear that proposing library changes for client reconnection support was an uphill battle whilst being unproven in the wild.</p>
<p>After Qt6 is rolled out to a wider audience and shown to work reliably, we'll refocus efforts on pushing upstream changes to the other platforms. </p>
<h2>Potential Perks</h2>
<p>This isn't just about crashes. If support becomes mainstream there will be additional opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can easily upgrade to new features without having to log out and back. This is one of the reasons why kwin development is happening at such a rapid pace in recent months. We're not having to test in fake nested sessions or waste time logging in and setting up between changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can support multihead, running different compositors per group of outputs and move seemlessly between them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's feasible to switch between compositors at runtime. With the application handling the reconnect logic, they can easily handle the case where compositor feature sets vary.</p>

</p></li>
<li>
<p>Checkpoint restore in userspace, being able to suspend your application to disk and then pick up where you left off like nothing happened. It could never work for X applications, but with wayland reconnect support we can make it work. </p>
</li>
</ul>

I’ve been thinking about the implications of AI in teaching since I first began using GPT-2 back in 2019. I have also been following along avidly as my wife </span><a href="https://www.royapakzad.co/" rel="">Roya Pakzad </a><span>works on testing the human rights impacts of AI systems (Roya was a consultant for OpenAI in 2022, where she served on the “red team” for adversarial testing of a pre-release version of GPT-4; you can read her account of that work </span><a href="https://royapakzad.substack.com/p/old-advocacy-new-algorithms" rel="">here</a><span>).</span></p><p>What follows are some thoughts about what I believe to be a novel use of LLMs: using them to simulate interactive historical settings as part of a university assignment. The results of these early trials are why I am personally much more excited about generative AI than many of my colleagues —&nbsp;though I also concede that in the short term, cheating will be a major problem. </p><p>In the second half of this post, I go into detail about what exactly I mean by “simulating history.” I am under no illusions that these simulations are accurate: they are littered with confidently-stated falsehoods and hallucinations. Sometimes, though, hallucinations can be a feature, not a bug. </p><p><span>At the end of this post, I include links to detailed prompts which you can use to simulate different historical settings, or customize to use with </span><a href="https://claude.ai/chats" rel="">Claude</a><span> or </span><a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt" rel="">ChatGPT</a><span> (the free versions of both work about equally well, though GPT-4 works best). I invite readers to share their experiences in the comments. </span></p><p>In the long term, I suspect that LLMs will have a significant positive impact on higher education. Specifically, I believe they will elevate the importance of the humanities. </p><p><span>If this happens, it will be a shocking twist. We’ve been hearing for over a decade now that the humanities are in crisis. When faced with raw data about declining enrollments and majors like </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/the-humanities-face-a-crisisof-confidence/567565/" rel="">this</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/the-end-of-the-english-major" rel="">this</a><span>, it is difficult not to agree. From the perspective of a few years ago, then, the advent of a new wave of powerful AI tools would be expected to tip the balance of power, funding, and enrollment in higher education even further toward STEM and away from the humanities. </span></p><p><span>But the thing is: LLMs are deeply, inherently </span><em>textual</em><span>. And they are reliant on text in a way that is directly linked to the skills and methods that we emphasize in university humanities classes. </span></p><p>What do I mean by that? One of the hallmarks of training in history is learning how to think about a given text at increasingly higher levels of abstraction. We teach students how to analyze the genre, cultural context,  assumptions, and affordances of a primary source — the unspoken limits that shaped how, why, and for whom it was created, and what content it contains. </p><p><span>For example, imagine a high school student who is asked to analyze the first letter of Hernán Cortés to the Emperor Charles V. The student might dutifully paraphrase the conquistador’s account of the Aztec capital of Tenochititlan —&nbsp;including this </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/fernandocorteshi01cort/page/154/mode/2up" rel="">famously jarring description of Aztec temples as “mosques”</a><span> (</span><em>mezquitas). </em><span>A history major would be able to go further. </span><em>Why </em><span>did Cortés use this confusing term? Cortés was born during the final decade of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista" rel="">Reconquista</a><span>. For this reason, he was intimately acquainted with non-Christian religiosity — but only in the context of </span><em>Muslim </em><span>religiosity. A large religious structure that was not a Christian church was for him, almost by default, a mosque —&nbsp;even when it was actually the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Templo_Mayor" rel="">Templo Mayor</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, a history major would be able to recognize that Cortés was writing within a genre —&nbsp;an ambitious subject’s letter to a monarch —&nbsp;which tends toward self-promotion. And they would be able to fact check Cortés’ claims against those of other primary and secondary sources. Perhaps they would conduct some exploratory Google searches along the lines of “primary source conquest of Mexico” or “Aztec account of Cortés.” They might also look around for recent secondary sources by searching library catalogues and the footnotes on Cortés’ Wikipedia page and discover Matthew Restall’s </span><a href="https://notevenpast.org/when-montezuma-met-cortes-the-true-story-of-the-meeting-that-changed-history-by-matthew-restall-2018/" rel="">revisionist take</a><span> on the subject. </span></p><p><span>When history majors encounter LLMs, then, they are already trained to recognize some of the by-now-familiar pitfalls of services like ChatGPT —&nbsp;such as factual inaccuracies —&nbsp;and to address them via skills like fact-checking, analyzing genre and audience, or reading “around” a topic by searching in related sources. Importantly, too, because so many sources are out of copyright and available in multilingual editions on Wikipedia and Wikisource, language models are abundantly trained on historical primary sources in hundreds of different languages.</span></p><p><span>For these reasons, I agree with Tyler Cowen that language models are </span><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/01/chatgpt-and-the-revenge-of-history.html" rel="">specifically a good thing for historians</a><span> — but I would go further and say that they are also </span><em>specifically a good thing for history majors.</em></p><p><span>On the other hand, I foresee major problems for history teachers and other educators in the short-term. </span><a href="https://tedunderwood.com/2023/07/31/we-can-save-what-matters-about-writing-at-a-price/" rel="">Ted Underwood is right</a><span>: we professors are going to have to fundamentally rethink many of our assignments. I’ve seen many people dismiss ChatGPT as an essay writing tool because simply plugging in a prompt from an assignment results in a weak piece of writing. But LLMs are all about iterative feedback, and experimenting with well-known prompting methods dramatically improves results. </span></p><p><span>Here’s an example from one of my own past classes. When given a question from my “Early Modern Europe” survey about how Benvenuto Cellini’s </span><em>Autobiography </em><span>illustrates new ways of thinking about identity during the early modern period, GPT-4 can produce dramatically different results depending on the prompt. </span></p><p><span>Compare </span><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/82b429e2-efb1-403c-a4a8-2d8eea1b9c4a" rel="">this short and scattered effort</a><span> (which I’d likely give a D- or F) to this </span><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/65bf7af7-5672-4ecc-b553-2d3d32573483" rel="">pretty decent attempt</a><span>, which would get around a B+. The difference is the use of roleplaying. In the latter, I tell ChatGPT that it is “an advanced language model that has been trained on prize-winning graduate and undergraduate essays.” I also ask it to start with self-reflection and an outline (which is basically replicating the process a real person would take).</span></p><p>As students get better at finessing prompts in this way, cheating on take-home writing assignments will get far easier. </p><p>But this same power of asking LLMs to role-play as specialized versions of themselves also makes them hugely interesting as educational tools in the classroom — and, specifically, as history simulators. </p><p>What happens if we tell ChatGPT that it is an advanced history simulator specifically trained to reconstruct historical settings in university classrooms? </p><p>This does:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png" width="1200" height="1166.2087912087911" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1415,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:297780,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>This is a trial run for a scenario I’m developing for a world history class I’ll be teaching this fall. I’m envisioning an assignment in which my students will simulate the experience of being sold flawed copper by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint_tablet_to_Ea-n%C4%81%E1%B9%A3ir" rel="">Ea-nāṣir</a><span>, a real-life shady copper merchant in Mesopotamia circa 1750 BCE (one who, in recent years, has unexpectedly </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReallyShittyCopper/" rel="">become a meme online</a><span>). </span></p><p><span>Crucially, this is not just about role-playing as an angry customer of Ea-nāṣir — or as the man himself, which is also an option. As illuminating as the simulations can be, the real benefit of the assignment is in what follows. First, students will print out and annotate the transcript of their simulation (which runs for twenty “turns,” or conversational beats) and carefully read through it with red pens to spot potential factual errors. They will then conduct their own research to correct those errors. They’ll then write their findings up as bullet points and feed this </span><em>back</em><span> into ChatGPT in a new, individualized and hopefully improved version of the prompt that they develop themselves. This doesn’t just teach them historical research and fact-checking — it also helps them develop skills for working directly with generative AI that I suspect will be valuable in future job markets.</span></p><p>Finally, the students share their findings with groups of classmates, then write reflection papers that include an account of what they talked about in their groups (which, among other things, makes it difficult to cheat by asking ChatGPT to write the whole thing). </p><p>Back in April of 2023, I tried out a more elaborate assignment in which students in my medieval history class simulated a day in the life as characters during the height of the Bubonic Plague epidemic in 1348, living in one of three places: Damascus, Paris, or Pistoia, an Italian city-state. </p><p>Below are links to the relevant Google Docs. I invite you to try it out yourself. Just click on one of these links, then copy and paste the highlighted prompt into ChatGPT and go from there. (If ChatGPT screws something up, just click “regenerate results” until you get a better response.) Beneath each prompt, I’ve included a transcript of a “trial run” of the simulation so you can see how it works.</p><p><em>You are a traveler passing through Damascus during the height of plague, staying at a crowded caravanserai... and you wake up with a scratchy throat.</em></p><p><em><span>You are a somewhat disreputable apothecary — a seller of cures and possibly counterfeit drugs known as a “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlatan" rel="">quack</a><span>” — trying to survive and profit off the 1348 plague epidemic in Paris.</span></em></p><p><em>You are an upstanding city councilor in the medieval Italian city-state of Pistoia doing your best to navigate between the city's different interest groups, guilds, and wealthy families to negotiate a civic response to the plague.</em></p><p>Students were asked to compare their simulated experience to real historical accounts of the plague in each of those three places. They were then asked to write a paper with the following guidelines:</p><blockquote><p>This 3-4 page paper should focus on analyzing and reflecting on the accuracy of the simulation. In your paper, you should consider what the simulation got right and wrong, what it emphasized and neglected, and what you learned from fact-checking it. To get started, take notes during the simulation itself (what terms or words are used you don't recognize? What strikes you as anachronistic? What questions do you have?). Afterward, consider how the simulation represented the historical time period and how it portrayed different aspects of daily life. Think about the virtual characters and environments generated by the simulation. Then begin researching the actual setting and some of the terms you wrote down in your notes via JSTOR, Google Scholar etc.</p><p><span>When writing your reflection paper, focus on critical thinking and analysis rather than simply summarizing your experience with the simulation. Be sure to cite </span><strong>at least four scholarly secondary sources relating to your chosen scenario </strong><span>as you reflect on the what the simulation got right and wrong. </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Earlier in the same class, I had students simulate life as a medieval peasant. This was more of a trial-run, without an accompanying assignment, but you can see that prompt and </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mLIy8LVsfowbtRa5QaWs-PxUQT_E8YSxWp-nl8XoGS8/edit?usp=sharing" rel="">try it out yourself here.</a><span> This was an interesting learning experience for me because it was the first time I experimented with asking ChatGPT to randomize the location (it </span><em>really </em><span>likes dropping you in medieval England or France, surprisingly often as a peasant girl named Isabelle). </span></p><p>In both cases, I was blown away by student engagement and creativity. Here’s a brief list of what some of my students did in their medieval simulations:</p><p>•&nbsp;ran away from home to become an apprentice to a traveling spice merchant</p><p>• developed various treatments for the plague, some historically accurate (like theriac) others much less so (like vaccines)</p><p>• negotiated complex legal settlements between the warring guilds of Pistoia</p><p>•&nbsp;fled to the forest and became an itinerant hermit</p><p><span>• attempt to purchase “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_blood" rel="">dragons blood</a><span>,” a genuine medieval and early modern remedy, to cure their fast-worsening plague</span></p><p>• made heroic efforts as an Italian physician named Guilbert to stop the spread of plague with perfume</p><p>•&nbsp;became leaders of both successful and unsuccessful peasant revolts</p><p>Student engagement in the spring quarter, when I began these trials, was unlike anything I’ve seen. The first time I tested the idea out informally (asking students to simulate their home town via an up-ended general purpose simulation prompt) I realized that we had gone 5 minutes past the end of class without anyone noticing! </p><p>An unexpected positive of this assignment was that it particularly seemed to engage students who had previously been sitting in the back rows looking bored. Engaging students like this is a perennial issue for teachers, and not one I’ve found easy to solve. Randomly calling on people in the back can often make it worse by ramping up anxiety. The medieval manor and plague simulator assignments worked wonders in terms of sparking enthusiasm among previously disengaged students. </p><p>That said, there were some issues with my first iteration of the simulation. You can get a sense of them in my student feedback from that class. There was a lot of praise for the simulation idea, which I called “History Lens” because it provides a distorted perspective on the past:</p><ul><li><p>"The plague simulation History Lens assignment was a great project that allowed us to experience what life was like during the time.”</p></li><li><p>"Big big fan of the plague simulator/history lens game, I think that has a ton of potential and I hope I see it in more classes in the future."</p></li><li><p>“The instructor helped me feel engaged with the course very frequently because he used assignments and activities to allow the class to not just learn about history but to let us see through the eyes of the people during that time. An example of this was the ChatGPT History Lens assignment.”</p></li></ul><p>But also this:</p><ul><li><p>“For the plague assignment it was rather absurd to rate chatgpt on historical accuracy. Someone said their simulation contained a talking rat.”</p></li></ul><p>Not ideal!</p><p><span>Going forward, my plan is to develop my own web app which will allow users to create historical simulations on a dedicated platform using the APIs of both Anthropic’s Claude and GPT-4. Both of these options have or will have larger context windows which will allow the AI to be fed far more detailed primary sources. My hope is that this, plus better directions and rules, will help with what we might call the “talking rat problem”: when the simulation is so </span><em>blatantly </em><span>wrong that an assignment built around fact-checking and contextualizing it just becomes an exercise in absurdity. </span></p><p>I will be writing a writing a sequel to this post in October with the results of my new and improved history simulation assignment and prompts, and some further thoughts on LLMs in education (including the cheating issue). </p><p><span>In the meantime, I would be thrilled if to get a community going of other people interested in this. Please try the prompts I’ve linked above (or the others available below) and let me know in the comments how it went. If you are doing anything similar or are interested in implementing this in your classroom, please </span><a href="https://benjaminpbreen.com/about-2/contact/" rel="">let me know</a><span>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I believe the following to be true:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bad managers are the cause of a lot of employee unhappiness.</li>
<li>Bad managers are the cause of a lot of workplace failure, i.e., late projects, subpar products, and unmet goals.</li>
<li>Managers are one of the most under-supported cohorts of employees on the planet.</li>
</ol>
<p>How many managers do you know who studied to be managers of people?</p>
<p>I mean more than a couple of one-day courses; I mean someone who studied to be a manager the way someone studied to be a software engineer or doctor.</p>
<p>I personally don’t know anyone, and while those degrees definitely exist, it’s got me wondering: of the total managers in the world, how many of them have those qualifications? Is it even 1%?</p>
<p>Just imagine if other professions had that split of self-taught vs. formally taught. Plumbers, doctors, lawyers... There would be massive variability in the quality of their work and their overall success, and yet that’s the exact gamble every company around the world is taking.</p>
<p>So how are the 99% becoming managers?</p>
<p>Julie Zhuo, <a href="https://www.juliezhuo.com/" target="_blank">author of The Making of a Manager</a>, writes about the four paths to becoming a manager:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Apprentice</strong>: The team is expanding and is too large for one manager, and so you are tapped to step into a newly needed role.</li>
<li><strong>The Pioneer</strong>: You were the founding member of a new group and, by proxy, its leader.</li>
<li><strong>The New Boss</strong>: You are hired to manage an entirely new team.</li>
<li><strong>The Successor</strong>: The previous manager has left, and you are the obvious choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the exception of the ‘New Boss’, most of the ways that people become managers are through time under a pre-existing manager, and this is what drives me to believe 99% of managers aren't trained. It's always a role someone grows into.</p>
<p>We are always taking someone who is highly performant or experienced (not necessarily the same thing) in the 'doing' of a role in the tam, what I call the ‘technical’ stuff, and based off some light leadership examples such as leading projects or being a mentor, are deemed fit enough to now run an entire team.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have as much of an issue with this if it weren’t for the fact that once people become managers, they are almost certainly left to fend for themselves and self-teach themselves the job.</p>
<p>It makes absolutely no sense, and no other profession in the world works like this. We don’t promote someone to doctor after seeing some promising medical abilities and hoping they magically teach themselves how to not kill someone.</p>
<p>What flummoxes me even more is that so much risk to the company hinges on how successful managers are at their jobs, and yet companies turn such a blind eye to this problem.</p>
<p>Companies will invest millions of dollars to reduce the amount of variance in risk in finance, security, intellectual property, and other key areas, but not enough goes towards getting all of their managers up to the same level of competence and onto the same page.</p>
<p>They often leave it to the local level, hoping the manager above the new manager mentors them, which just creates a circular problem if that manager themselves isn’t a good mentor (not everyone who can do can teach) or worse, is a bad manager themselves. Not to mention they themselves have been self-taught; what bad habits have they not corrected?</p>
<p>This then leaves HR (or whatever we are calling this department this month) to try and pick up the slack. While I have found HR to be great in a one-on-one capacity, provided they themselves are good at their job, I’ve been witness to multiple roll-outs of ‘one-size-fits-all’ management training days and intranet portal content, and they never meet the mark.</p>
<p>They are often too generic and impersonal, and they are often starting at ground zero, like how to approve leave and manage expense claims. They never get into the nitty gritty or teach anything that can be truly applied in the 'field'.</p>
<p>It’s not enough, and it’s hurting everyone. I generally believe that most managers are barely managing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I generally believe that most managers are barely managing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both in the sense that I do not believe them to be doing enough as a manager for their team and the company, but also in the sense that I can often see them drowning, personally struggling to do their job. Surviving, not thriving.</p>
<p>This series will provide my personal guidance on both how to be a manager and how to do the job of managing people.</p>
<p>I care for both the people you are responsible for. I want them to not quit because of you.</p>
<p>I also care for you, the manager, who has found themselves in such a position of power and responsibility with minimal support.</p>
<p>You do not need to read this entire thing A-Z like a tome, but instead I encourage you to casually work through the core articles (they will be highlighted) and then jump around to any others that catch your interest.</p>
<p>Bookmark this blog, come back to it when a problem arises at work, and find the piece of advice that is applicable to you and figure out how to implement it. Then don't come back until the next time you need it.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2023/09/12/phoenix-1-7-for-elixir-edit-a-form-in-a-modal.html">https://blog.appsignal.com/2023/09/12/phoenix-1-7-for-elixir-edit-a-form-in-a-modal.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37479323">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In part one of this series, we introduced the <code>CoreComponents</code> that get generated when bootstrapping a new
Phoenix project. In part two, we implemented a create modal.</p>
<p>Now, we will implement
an edit modal.</p>
<p><em>You can continue following along with our <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular">companion repo</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="editing-a-form-in-a-modal">Editing a Form in a Modal</h2>
<p>You will first notice that each item will need a different changeset. We
want to edit each item, so we need to be able to build a changeset from
a different struct each time.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> do this by iterating over all of the items in <code>mount</code>
and rendering a different modal for every row, but this won't work at all. You would have to have
one changeset per assign, which doesn't work when you have a list to add to. It would
also mean a lot more HTML because you'd render the whole modal once per row. It's an all-round bad idea.</p>
<p>Instead, we need a way to build the correct changeset based on the item we click on.
We can do that by using another <code>JS</code> function — <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.JS.html#push/1"><code>push</code></a>.
This will push an event to the backend, along with any attributes that we want to send. If we add an edit button per row, the click action can push an event to the backend
with the <code>pet_id</code> as a param. Then, we can select the pet from the list of assigns and build
a changeset out of it.</p>
<p>First, add the button to the markup. It might be nice to use an icon for this, so let's take
a quick detour to icons.</p>
<h2 id="icons-in-phoenix">Icons in Phoenix</h2>
<p>Phoenix 1.7 ships with a vendored heroicons library and an <code>&lt;.icon&gt;</code> component in <code>CoreComponents</code>.
It works by supplying the name of an icon as a <code>name</code> attr, like so:</p>

<p>The names for the available icons are the filenames contained in the following
path: <code>assets/vendor/heroicons/optimized/20/solid/</code>.
Looking at the files doesn't tell us much about what they look like because we just see svg
markup.</p>
<p>What would be cool is if we could render a dev-only route that displays all icons on one page.
Then when we consider using an icon, we can go to that page and peruse them all at our leisure.</p>
<p>First, let's add the route:</p>

<p>Then, we can make the necessary <code>PetacularWeb.Pages.StoryBookLive</code> module. We'll now write a function that
generates all the icon names from the files in the assets folder, then iterate over them
and create an icon from each one. This will give us a dynamic list of icons to render.</p>
<p>Here are the <code>icon_names</code> (this assumes you will start your server from the project's route):</p>

<p>Then the markup:</p>

<p>There is one more thing to do, though. Tailwind will purge all classes it doesn't see
being used when the app is built. Usually, this is great because it means the bundle size is
smaller, with more lightweight pages. However, here, it is going to bite us. When you
refer to classes dynamically, Tailwind doesn't see those classes being used, so it purges them. <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#dynamic-class-names">Tailwind's docs warn about this</a>.</p>
<p>We need to tell Tailwind <em>not</em> to purge all the icon modules so we can render them. We do that by adding a line of config into <code>tailwind.config.js</code>, like so:</p>

<p>Now, we can head to <code>http://localhost:4000/dev/storybook</code> and see all the icons. See
<a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/commit/91a0ff0e3af688a47864dc030a83b0f705e8f021">this commit</a>
for all of the changes.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-editing-our-form">Back to Editing Our Form</h3>
<p>Okay, now we can select our edit icon and put it on the page.</p>

<p>We will put this in a button and add a <code>phx-click</code> that opens our edit modal for us. All
this can live in the <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/blob/main/lib/petacular_web/pages/home_live.ex">homepage</a> we used in parts one and two.</p>

<p>We also need to create our <code>Edit</code> modal. This will be similar to our <code>Create</code> modal, but a bit different, so we'll just create a new modal.</p>
<p>We can put this in our <code>~H</code> component just before the other modal:</p>

<p>Now we need to add a changeset to the assigns. Initially, we can put any changeset in mount because when we open the modal, we are going to seed it:</p>

<h2 id="add-the-open_edit_modal-function">Add the <code>open_edit_modal</code> Function</h2>
<p>Now let's implement the <code>open_edit_modal</code> function. This has to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the modal.</li>
<li>Trigger a message to the backend so we can seed the changeset.</li>
</ol>

<p>The handler for this event needs to select the relevant pet from the list of pets and
put that into the changeset:</p>

<p>When we open the modal, the page will re-render the form because the changeset has changed,
and the form will be seeded with the correct data. We can verify this by using
<code>|&gt; IO.inspect(limit: :infinity, label: "")</code> on the form value:</p>

<h3 id="debugging-an-issue-with-the-open_edit_modal">Debugging an Issue with the <code>open_edit_modal</code></h3>
<p>If you open the modal, you will see the correct value printed. But there is a problem — it's
not showing on the page! What on earth could be the issue? This one is a doozy, so I will
save you some hours of debugging.</p>
<p>The function that we use to <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/blob/main/lib/petacular_web/components/core_components.ex#L591">open our modal</a> has this line, which focuses the first "focussable"
element in the modal:</p>

<p>This is done for accessibility, and so is generally a good idea.</p>
<p>The input happens to be the first focussable thing in our edit form. Phoenix also ensures
that the client is the source of truth for <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/form-bindings.html#javascript-client-specifics">an input's value</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For any given input with focus, LiveView will never overwrite the input's current value, even if it deviates from the server's rendered updates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what happens in our case? We push an asynchronous message to the backend, which changes an assign (the edit
form), causing a re-render — <code>|&gt; JS.push("open_edit_modal", value: %{pet_id: pet_id})</code>. Then we
open the modal with JavaScript, but because the message to the server is async, the modal
opens <em>before</em> we get a reply. The first focussable element is the input field, so that gets
focus, then the server responds. This would normally re-render the input field, but now won't, because the input has focus!</p>
<h3 id="fixing-the-issue">Fixing the Issue</h3>
<p>We've done everything right, yet are left adrift. What are our options?</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the auto-focus capabilities of the modal.</li>
<li>Have the edit modal focus on something that is not the input first.</li>
<li>Somehow make the form opening synchronous to the server message.</li>
</ol>
<p>I honestly don't know which is better, but let's reason them out. One is easy to do — just <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/blob/main/lib/petacular_web/components/core_components.ex#L600">remove this line</a>
from the <code>show_modal</code> function — but may have accessibility implications, which makes it a non-starter.</p>
<p>The second option seems reasonable at first. We could maybe set the <code>tabindex</code> on the heading,
but <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Keyboard">mdn</a>
recommends the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If an element can be focused using the keyboard, then it should be interactive; that is, the user should be able to do something to it and produce a change of some kind (for example, activating a link or changing an option).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that's out.</p>
<p>The third option is possible, but requires some ceremony. Instead of opening the modal with JS, you could have the backend trigger a JS event that opens the modal when it's finished
seeding the changeset. That requires adding a handler in JS to listen for the event
and also means that the modal open is slower, because it requires at least one round trip to
the server. For me, that is out as well.</p>
<p>The solution? A secret fourth option — set the value of the field with JS. This means
the field will open quickly, be set to the correct value, and auto-focus.</p>
<p>To support that, we alter our <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/blob/main/lib/petacular_web/pages/home_live.ex#L74"><code>open_edit_modal</code></a>
function to accept the name, then use <code>JS.set_attribute</code> to set the field value.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-the-update-in-our-phoenix-application">Implementing the Update in Our Phoenix Application</h2>
<p>Now the only thing left to do is implement the <code>edit_pet</code> handler. This is similar to the
create version, where we flash an error and close the modal on success. We first want to
select the pet we are editing, which means we need the pet's id. How can we get that?</p>
<p>The easiest way is to use a hidden input on the form. That way, when the form is submitted, the pet id will also be sent. To do that, we need to add the hidden input:</p>

<p>And set the value when we open the modal:</p>

<p>We will see the id of the pet appear in the params, allowing us to select
the pet we are editing from the assigns:</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/commit/364bec4c35c796bcd19f63ccd42ad230c0ed4afc">this commit</a>
for all the relevant changes.</p>
<p>And with that, we are done!</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>This concludes our three-part series in which we took a fresh Phoenix 1.7 application and built a create and edit modal for
it.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this gives you some new ideas you can extend and implement for your own apps.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>

Almost nine times the mass of Earth, it is, Nasa, says: “a Hycean exoplanet, one which has the potential to possess a hydrogen-rich atmosphere and a water ocean-covered surface”.</p><p>The space agency said that its observations of the chemical make-up of the planet’s atmosphere suggested the possibility of an ocean world. “The abundance of methane and carbon dioxide, and shortage of ammonia, support the hypothesis that there may be a water ocean underneath a hydrogen-rich atmosphere in K2-18 b,” it said.</p><p>But the agency also hinted at even more remarkable possibility in the potential finding of a molecule called dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which on Earth is only produced by life.</p><p>“The bulk of the DMS in Earth’s atmosphere is emitted from phytoplankton in marine environments,” the Nasa press release said.</p><p>The presence of DMS, however, is still to be confirmed, and requires further investigation. “Upcoming Webb observations should be able to confirm if DMS is indeed present in the atmosphere of K2-18 b at significant levels,” said Nikku Madhusudhan, a University of Cambridge astronomer and lead author of the Nasa research.</p><p>It would not be the first time Nasa has found indications of water on other planets. Water vapor was previously discovered on the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/ocean-worlds/#:~:text=Are%20there%20oceans%20on%20planets,in%20a%20five%2Dday%20orbit." data-link-name="in body link">smaller exoplanet, HAT-P-11b</a>, roughly the size of Neptune in the constellation Cygnus, also 120 light years away.</p><p>But scientists are excited by the revelation, even though they caution it does not necessarily mean the planet could support life.</p><p>“Our findings underscore the importance of considering diverse habitable environments in the search for life elsewhere,” said Madhusudhan.</p><p>“Traditionally, the search for life on exoplanets has focused primarily on smaller rocky planets, but the larger Hycean worlds are significantly more conducive to atmospheric observations.”</p><p>Orbiting the cool dwarf star K2-18, the exoplanet, 2.6 times the radius of Earth, lies in what Nasa calls the <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-8c9217a9-bf37-4563-863a-4b60ff8f5576" data-link-name="in body link">habitable zone</a>, a region around a star where planets with liquid water may be present.</p><p>Its interior likely contains a large mantle of high-pressure ice, similar to Neptune, Nasa says, but likely has a thinner hydrogen-rich atmosphere and an ocean surface. Hycean worlds are predicted to have oceans of water, but on K2-18 b it is also possible the ocean is too hot to be habitable.</p><p>The planet’s existence was first discovered by <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/nasas-k2-mission-the-kepler-space-telescopes-second-chance-to-shine" data-link-name="in body link">Nasa’s K2 mission</a> in 2015, but Webb’s improved technology over the earlier telescopes allowed for a more detailed analysis, and revelation it could be an ocean world. Scientists were able to study a tiny fraction of the star’s light as it passed through the exoplanet’s atmosphere.</p><p>“This result was only possible because of the extended wavelength range and unprecedented sensitivity of Webb, which enabled robust detection of spectral features with just two transits,” Madhusudhan said.</p><p>“For comparison, one transit observation with Webb provided comparable precision to eight observations with Hubble conducted over a few years and in a relatively narrow wavelength range.”</p><p>Nasa celebrated the first anniversary of operation of the Webb space telescope in July by releasing an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jul/12/nasa-releases-image-of-star-forming-region-rho-ophiuchi-james-webb" data-link-name="in body link">“unprecedented” closeup image</a> of the nearest star-forming region to Earth.</p><p>In little more than a year, it has allowed humans to look closer towards the origins of the universe than ever before, and produced high-resolution pictures of far-distant worlds and the mysterious structures that surround them.</p><p>They include the “rare and fleeting” phase of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/mar/15/james-webb-space-telescope-dying-star-nasa" data-link-name="in body link">star on the cusp of death</a>; early galaxies formed just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/nov/18/james-webb-telescope-finds-two-of-the-oldest-and-most-distant-galaxies-ever-seen" data-link-name="in body link">350m years after the big bang</a>; and evidence of “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/feb/22/universe-breakers-james-webb-telescope-detects-six-ancient-galaxies" data-link-name="in body link">universe breaker galaxies</a>” far larger than scientists thought possible, with the potential to upend current theories of cosmology.</p></div></div>]]></description>
