																<p>AWS has notified customers of its Amazon Aurora Serverless v1 service that it will cease supporting the offering at the end of 2024. Replacing v1 in the Aurora Serverless range, which supports Postgres and MySQL databases, will be v2, which offers some advantages but also one big disadvantage: It doesn’t scale all the way down to zero.</p>
<p>Amazon Aurora is the hugely successful relational database service launched by <a href="http://www.aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> in 2014. It debuted with MySQL compatibility, and support for Postgres was added in 2017. The database, which is part of AWS’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Relational Database Service</a> (RDS), has been so widely adopted that, a couple of years ago, AWS declared Aurora <a href="https://www.datanami.com/2021/12/03/aws-working-to-scale-aurora-db-writes-globally-like-spanner/">the fastest growing service</a> ever in the history of the company. Considering the continued momentum behind Postgres, it’s likely the AWS service has continued to grow at a breakneck speed.</p>
<p>In 2018, AWS rolled out a serverless version of Aurora, which enabled the database to scale up and down in response to application demand. Many customers appreciated that Aurora could scale all the way down to zero–essentially turning itself off–when there was no demand for the database, and automatically wake itself up when called into duty.</p>
<p>That function was a feature of Aurora Serverless v1.&nbsp; Last week, AWS began notifying customers that Aurora Serverless V1 would cease being offered as of December 31, 2024.</p>
<p>“We are only announcing the end of support for Serverless v1,” the note from AWS read, according to several customers who shared the note on the Internet. “Aurora Serverless v2 continues to be supported. We recommend that you proactively upgrade your databases running Amazon Aurora Serverless v1 to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 at your convenience before December 31, 2024.”<a href="https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PostgreSQL_logo.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PostgreSQL_logo-300x193.png" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PostgreSQL_logo-300x193.png 300w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PostgreSQL_logo-200x128.png 200w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PostgreSQL_logo-100x64.png 100w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PostgreSQL_logo-120x77.png 120w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PostgreSQL_logo.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>Aurora Serverless v2, which AWS <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2022/4/aws-announces-general-availability-of-amazon-aurora-serverless-v2">unveiled in April 2022</a>, does have several features that v1 lacks, including support for replicas, logical replication, and–thanks to <a href="https://www.datanami.com/this-just-in/aws-announces-3-serverless-innovations-to-help-customers-analyze-and-manage-data-at-any-scale/">a major update</a> AWS delivered just over a month ago at re:Invent–global databases that can scale up to support million of writes per second.</p>
<p>Aurora Serverless v2 also sports <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/12/amazon-aurora-postgresql-rds-data-api/">the new RDS data API</a>, which AWS unveiled last week and which allows customers to connect to the Aurora database via REST (only Postgres is supported at the moment).</p>
<p>“You can now access these Aurora clusters via a secure HTTP endpoint and run SQL statements without the use of database drivers and without managing connections,” AWS says in its December 21, 2023 announcement.</p>
<p>However, Aurora Serverless v2 lacks one big feature that is a part of Aurora Serverless v1: The capability to scale all the way down to zero. That rubs some Aurora customers the wrong way.</p>
<p>“Goodbye to a relational database that could idle down to zero on its own,” wrote Ganesh Swaminathan, head of cloud solutions architecture at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremy_daly/status/1740475761113604451">in a tweet</a> on X (formerly Twitter). “Hello to double the bill (or more)…”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty disappointed that Aurora Serverless V2 cannot seem to scale to 0 ACU,” writes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/18sx0i6/aurora_serverless_v1_eol_december_31_2024/">a Reddit user</a> known as zmose. “Ya know, what ‘serverless’ is supposed to mean? I think it ends up being around like $50/month at minimum.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-content">
                            <p>One of Karl Marx’s most penetrating insights was that a network of mechanisms embedded in the logic of capitalism not only fuel the system’s transformative dynamism but also undermine its cohesion. These internal contradictions operate across every dimension of the socioeconomic landscape, including its ideological characteristics and political institutions. In their relentless pursuit of profits, capitalist enterprises constantly strive to reduce their labor costs through wage suppression and mechanization. But reductions in the buying power of workers erode the primary source of demand for the products those enterprises must sell in order to realize profits.</p>
<p>Capitalism gave rise to a value system that teaches us to find meaning in our work; yet millions are employed in low-paying, soul-crushing jobs. And while modern capitalism promises — and is indeed fully capable of providing — broad-based prosperity, the system, via the state, routinely promotes and enforces austerity policies aimed at compelling people to work harder for lower pay and less job security. Output per worker increases year by year because of improvements in technology, but the austerity evangelists insist that if we want capitalism to continue to bestow its blessings on humanity, workers must accept lower living standards and the social safety net needs to be dismantled.</p>
<p>In <em><a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo181707138.html">The Capital Order</a></em>, Clara Mattei brings to light the fascinating story of how austerity became a crucial weapon of class warfare. In this major contribution to the political and intellectual history of modern capitalism, Mattei traces the roots of neoliberalism to the political reaction against the militant working-class movements that emerged in Europe after World War I.</p>
<p>Modern warfare requires the mobilization of labor and capital on an enormous scale. During the Great War, national governments took control of their economies to ensure that the material requirements of the war would be met. Wages, work hours, and prices were regulated; production targets were imposed on manufacturers; strikes were criminalized, and shirking was penalized by conscription and deployment to the front; private property was requisitioned; key industries were nationalized. The aim of these policies was to ensure maximum production for the war effort without triggering a disruptive backlash from either the working class or the owners of capital.</p>
<p>But these massive wartime interventions exposed an inconvenient fact. Economic forces never operate independently of society’s political dynamics. If the state could mold the economy to serve the needs of war, in peacetime it could mold it to promote the well-being of those whose sweat, muscles, and brains are the basis of national prosperity. The war had demonstrated “the profoundly political nature of the capitalist economy.” When the war ended, workers, who had toiled and bled for their country, wanted a fairer share of the income their labor was generating; they wanted the right to unionize; and they wanted better working conditions, decent housing, and an effective social safety net.</p>
<p>In Britain and Italy, workers were organized, had suffrage rights, and, by 1919, were making demands on employers and the state for a revision of the social contract. This threat to the prerogatives of capital, Mattei argues, provoked a reaction in the form of a comprehensive set of state-imposed austerity policies aimed at pounding the working class into a state of docility. In addition to repelling the existential menace of working-class militancy, these policies would establish lasting mechanisms for channeling income and wealth upward from workers to capitalists.</p>
<p>Mattei describes these developments splendidly in the early chapters of her book. She has done an impressive amount of archival research and has skillfully mined the published literature of the interwar period. The fruit of these labors is a rich and insightful account of a pivotal moment in capitalism’s history.</p>
<p>She calls our attention to a pair of international conferences that were convened shortly after the end of the Great War to discuss the financial and economic challenges that confronted the combatant European nations. The League of Nations sponsored a conference in Brussels in 1920; another conference took place in Genoa in 1922 under the auspices of the Supreme Council of the Allies. Historians have generally regarded these conferences as failures because the participating delegates were unable to arrive at a concrete agreement for managing the problems posed by war debt and globally disordered balance of payments accounts. Mattei argues instead that the two conferences established the framework of the austerity agenda adopted throughout the capitalist world in subsequent decades: “The two conferences reunited the European establishment under the flag of technocracy to construct and implement austerity. Technocrats were rising as the new protectors of capitalism — and their sermon was heard loud and clear across the continent.”</p>
<p>The austerity gospel held that economic growth was driven not by the productive activity and spending of workers but by the virtuous abstinence of capitalists, whose savings were transformed into capital accumulation by the invisible hand of the market. National prosperity therefore required the redistribution of income away from workers and toward capitalists. Workers’ demands for higher wages and fewer hours had to be resisted. Public spending on health care, education, and social services had to be sharply curtailed because it drew financial resources away from capital accumulation. Government budgets needed to be balanced, and monetary policy needed to be tightened. The rhetoric adopted to support this agenda was at times alarmist; one of the documents issued by the Brussels conference contains this dire warning: “Any country which does not contrive as soon as possible to attain the execution of these principles is doomed beyond hope of recovery.”</p>
<p>Mattei identifies three kinds of austerity policies: fiscal austerity, monetary austerity, and industrial austerity — the “austerity trinity.” Fiscal austerity involves reducing government spending, particularly on programs aimed at providing social services and income support to working-class people; regressive taxation, aimed at buttressing the after-tax incomes of the propertied classes, is also part of the fiscal austerity mix. Monetary austerity entails restricting access to liquidity and credit when labor markets get tight and wages start to rise. Instead of letting the market adjust the price of labor in response to worker-friendly market conditions, the austerity credo requires that workers get knocked back into line by a state-generated recession.</p>
<p>Fiscal discipline and monetary restraint are what normally come to mind when we think of austerity. But Mattei reminds us that industrial austerity is an important part of the arsenal of the capitalist state. Industrial austerity is the weakening or abolition of laws and institutions that protect the interests of workers: right-to-work laws, lax enforcement of fair hiring rules, legislative impediments to the formation of labor unions, tolerance of noncompete clauses in labor contracts, and so forth. Cuts to unemployment benefits weaken the bargaining position of unemployed people relative to employers by reducing the amount of time an unemployed person can take to find a good job; such cuts would fall under the headings of both fiscal and industrial austerity. In the jargon of modern economics, industrial austerity is often characterized as enhancing “labor market flexibility.” A major aim of all austerity regimes is to break the back of organized labor, to neuter it and render it incapable of protecting workers.</p>
<p>A substantial portion of the book is devoted to detailed examinations of how austerity was implemented in Britain and Italy. Mattei shows that in both countries the enforcement of austerity was achieved by removing economic policymaking from democratic control. But the precise method by which democracy was sabotaged differed. In Britain, responsibility for economic decision-making was transferred to the Treasury and the Bank of England, institutions that were insulated from electoral accountability. The two institutions coordinated their activity closely to advance the austerity agenda.</p>
<p>In Italy, the Fascist government that came to power in 1922 imposed austerity largely by decree, and eliminated resistance through electoral fraud, disenfranchisement of the electorate, the imprisonment of political opponents, the suppression of press freedoms, and physical brutality — including political assassinations. Mattei’s point is that, notwithstanding their radical differences in approach, both countries relied upon antidemocratic strategies to execute their austerity agendas in the interwar period. She paints a vivid picture of the policies that were implemented and of the human wreckage they caused.</p>
<p>Mattei has unearthed a great deal of disturbing evidence regarding the state of mind of the advocates of austerity during the interwar period. One of the key players, the Italian economist Maffeo Pantaleoni, denounced workers as “violent, dishonest, and blackmailers of government” (in Mattei’s words) for threatening to strike; he contended that “wages were much higher than [workers’] marginal productivity”; and he endorsed the violent suppression of dissent, including the execution of communist leaders. The casualness with which British monetary economist Ralph G. Hawtrey and Treasury officials Basil Blackett and Otto Niemeyer — the three main architects of Britain’s austerity regime — discussed the suffering that austerity would inflict on working people is shocking in its callousness.</p>
<p>The Italian liberal economist and statesman Luigi Einaudi was never a Fascist and never held any position in a Fascist government; he was opposed to the political authoritarianism of Mussolini’s regime. But he was supportive of the austerity policies that the regime imposed, and he was willing to make his peace with authoritarianism for the sake of what he believed to be sound economic policy. British commentators expressed perfunctory disapproval of Mussolini’s brutality, but for the most part they were prepared to tolerate it as long as he put Italy’s economic affairs in order.</p>
<p>Austerity removes economic policymaking from democratic control and places it in the hands of technocrats or experts. A recurring theme in <em>The Capital Order</em> is the pernicious role of technocrats in the austerity project. “Austerity,” Mattei writes, “found its primary ally in technocracy — a belief in the power of economists as guardians of an indisputable science.” (She is, for example, highly critical of central bank independence, a principle that originated in Britain’s austerity initiative of the 1920s.) Her wariness appears to owe something to the liberatory philosophy of Antonio Gramsci, whose <em>Ordine Nuovo</em> movement</p>
<blockquote><p>stood fast on the idea that any approach to knowledge was inherently, deeply political, since the lens through which one looks at the world may foreclose or open spaces for imagination and thus establish if and what alternatives . . . are viable. While the predominant lens to interpret the world foreclosed imagination and nurtured acceptance of the capitalist order, the emancipatory lens opened up possibilities to envisage a different society.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mattei’s discussion of Gramsci and his circle is one of the highlights of the book. From a Gramscian perspective, technocrats and experts enforce a top-down conception of knowledge that, Mattei contends, inevitably serves the interests of the prevailing power structure.</p>
<p>There is no doubt a good deal of truth in this. Expertise is, in a certain sense, a bourgeois concept, a by-product of the ideological imperative to organize our lives and activities in a rational way. But it is difficult to see how any complex industrial society, including a socialist society, could do without technocrats. Think of the multitude of issues that the modern state must address: housing policy, trash removal, public health and sanitation, education, policing, the administration of justice, national defense, public transportation, airline safety, disaster relief. The list is endless. None of these issues can be managed effectively without experts who have reasonable latitude to exercise their judgment in the service of the common good. Admittedly, the common good is a slippery concept, but well-functioning polities manage to settle on some version of it that most of their inhabitants find acceptable. A well-functioning polity can also design institutions that ensure the democratic accountability of its technocrats.</p>
<p>In one respect, Mattei’s account could have done with a bit more nuance. Mainstream economics is not intrinsically reactionary. Some of the economists and officials discussed in her book merit scorn. Pantaleoni in particular comes across as an ideologue — and a nasty piece of work to boot. The Treasury officials Blackett and Niemeyer were middling economic thinkers at best, and they embraced their roles as “hired prizefighters of the bourgeoisie,” as Marx would put it. Others like Hawtrey, Einaudi, A. C. Pigou, and Gustav Cassel, whatever their ideological commitments (Pigou was a Fabian socialist), were trying to cope with an unprecedentedly difficult set of policy problems.</p>
<p>The Great War left the economies of Europe damaged and heavily indebted. The global financial system was one national default away from Armageddon. Austerity wasn’t the answer, but the economists can be forgiven for thinking the cataclysmic dissolution of capitalism would be disastrous for everyone. Cassel recognized the need for debt forgiveness in some cases, a view hardly consistent with a rigid commitment to austerity. Hawtrey urged the Federal Reserve to intervene aggressively to counteract the deflation that accompanied the Great Depression; a technocrat he may have been, but he was not an austerity ideologue.</p>
<p>John Maynard Keynes takes some lumps from Mattei because he paid little analytical attention to the exploitative nature of the wage relation — and perhaps also because his vision of the good society assigned a central role to technocrats. But he was no champion of austerity. Aside from mentioning it briefly in a footnote, Mattei doesn’t say anything about the famous Macmillan Committee, whose 1931 report, largely written by Keynes, was in effect an argument against full-on austerity.</p>
<p>There is more work to be done on the origins of modern austerity policy. But that work will certainly have to take as its starting point Clara Mattei’s illuminating and provocative book.</p>

<p>Does DNA have anything like IF-statements, GOTO-jumps, or WHILE loops?</p>

<p>In software development, these constructs have the following functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>IF-statements:</strong> An IF statement executes the code in a subsequent code block if some specific condition is met.</li>
<li><strong>WHILE-loops:</strong> The code in a subsequent code block is executes as many times as specified, or as long as a specific condition is met.</li>
<li><strong>Function calls:</strong> The code temporarily bypasses the subsequent code block, executing instead some other code block. After execution of the other code block the code returns (sometimes with some value) and continues the execution of the subsequent block.</li>
<li><strong>GOTO-statements:</strong> The code bypasses the subsequent code block, jumping instead directly to some other block.</li>

<p>Biological examples similar to programming statements:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>IF</code> : Transcriptional activator; when present a gene will be transcribed. In general there is no termination of events unless the signal is gone; the program ends only with the death of the cell. So the <code>IF</code> statement is always a part of a loop.</li>
<li><code>WHILE</code> : Transcriptional repressor; gene will be transcribed until repressor is not present.</li>
<li>There are no equivalents of <code>function</code> calls. All events happen is the

<li><code>GOTO</code> is always dependent on a condition. This can happen in case of certain network connections such as feedforward loops and branched pathways.

<p>Logic gates have been constructed using synthetic biological circuits. See <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v16/n3/abs/nrg3885.html" rel="noreferrer">this</a> review for more information. </p>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>Molecular biological processes cannot be directly compared to a computer code. It is the underlying logic that is important and not the statement construct itself and these examples should not be taken as absolute analogies. It is also to be noted that DNA is just a set of instructions and not really a fully functional entity (it is functional to some extent). However, even being just a code it is comparable to a HLL code that has to be compiled to execute its functions. See <a href="https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/29663/can-dna-rna-be-considered-as-natures-programming-language">this</a> post too.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that the cell, like many other physical systems, is analog in nature. Therefore, in most situations there is no 0/1 (binary) value of variables. Consider gene expression. If a transcriptional activator is present, the gene will be transcribed. However, if you keep increasing the concentration of the activator, the expression of that gene will increase until it reaches a saturation point. So there is no digital logic here. Having said that, I would add that switching behaviour is possible in biological systems (including gene expression) and is also used in many cases. Certain kinds of regulatory network structures can give rise to such dynamics. Co-operativity with or without positive feedback is one of the mechanisms that can implement switching behaviour.

<p>DNA is not analogous to computer code which renders your search for similar constructs in it meaningless. To give a couple of simple examples why this is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Computer code has a sequential order of execution; DNA acts in
parallel and out of sequence, it is not "executed".</p></li>
<li><p>Computer code has a strict and consistent meaning so the line <code>if x==4 : x=7</code> always does the same thing; coding DNA
translates to amino acids and it's the complex chemical interactions
between these acids which give proteins their function thus no piece
of coding DNA can be understood outside of its protein.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Biological systems do have some pathways that operate in a similar way to computers, but you should be looking for these at the protein level not the DNA level and, even then, you need to be extremely careful that your analogy does not impair your understanding of what is really happening.</p>

<p>There are certainly some comparisons that could be made between the way genes are expressed from DNA and logic functions, but they aren't great.</p>

<p>But synthetic Biology is really a blossoming new field that is attempting to integrate logic functions into biology, see e.g. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n5/abs/nbt.2510.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Siuti et al. 2013. Synthetic circuits integrating logic and memory in living cells. Nature Biotechnology 31, 448–452. doi:10.1038/nbt.2510">Siuti et al (2013)</a>.</p>

<p>The above paper is a brilliant example of a group using bacteria to store information and assembling into biological circuits that can then be used to process logic functions. So its being done but not exactly in the way that you propose.</p>

<p>Just to add to previous answers, but <strong>transcriptional interference</strong> (see e.g. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2941638/">Shearwin et al., 2005</a>) can be seen as a form of IF-statement (or WHILE) in the sense that:</p>

<pre><code>if(x transcribed){not y transcribed}
</code></pre>

<p>The interference does not have to be binary though, and more common are graded responses. Transcriptional interference can also take place at the RNA stage (see e.g. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v514/n7524/full/nature13671.html">Xue et al, 2014</a>), using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisense_RNA"><em>antisense RNA</em></a> and often providing a negative feedback loop, but the interference is then removed from the DNA, and does not represent a direct IF-statement analog at the DNA stage.</p>

<p>To me, GOTO mainly makes sense for sequential code execution, and this is not the case for DNA (lots of transcription is happening all the time in parallel). More generally, the parallel "execution" of DNA along with the continuous interactions and feedback loops between DNA, transcripts and proteins (among other things) also means that cellular processes are far less clear-cut and traceable than computer code, which means that computer code is a very poor metaphor for cellular processes and the functioning of DNA.</p>

<p>As WYSIWYG said there is no equivalent for function calls, as there will always be some interference. However one could argue that some modular pathways (eg. apoptosis signalling) can be seen as a "code block" where a certain input will (almost) certainly lead to a certain effect. The analogy with function calls is that, in describing many different mechanisms, it makes for shorter and more efficient "code" to consider everything between eg. caspase activation and cytochrome leakage as one block. Also, marking a protein with ubiquitin can maybe be seen as a function call for degradation.</p>

<p>Regarding function calls:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are no equivalents of function calls. All events happen is the same space and there is always a likelihood of interference. One can argue that organelles can act as a compartment that may have a function like properties but they are highly complex and are not just some kind of input-output devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As WYSIWYG said there is no equivalent for function calls, as there will always be some interference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that nuclear receptors are great examples of function calls. They hang out in the cytosol allowing normal programming to function in a normative fashion. Upon activation with their ligand, they translocate to the nucleus to activate subroutines of gene repression/activation and subsequent downstream processes. </p>

<p>In this fashion one could even argue that most initial ligand interactions that kick off cellular signaling are function calls. </p>

<p>In addition to the excellent WYSIWYG answer, there are some programming-like constructs at the lower level:</p>

<ul>
<li>FUNCTION CALL - replacing a single sub-unit inside a complex protein, assembled from multiple sub-units, each encoded by separate genes. This can also be seen as COMPOSITION, another programming concept.</li>

<p>The <b>British Post Office scandal</b> is a widespread and long-lasting series of individual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriages_of_justice" title="Miscarriages of justice">miscarriages of justice</a> which, between 1999 and 2015, involved over 700 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Ltd#Services" title="Post Office Ltd">subpostmasters</a> being wrongly convicted of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accounting" title="False accounting">false accounting</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud" title="Fraud">fraud</a> when shortfalls at their branches were in fact due to errors of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Limited" title="Post Office Limited">Post Office</a>'s Horizon accounting software. In 2019, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice" title="High Court of Justice">High Court</a> ruled that the Horizon system was faulty and in 2020 the government established a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_inquiry" title="Public inquiry">public inquiry</a>. Courts began to quash convictions from 2010. As of January 2024, some victims are still fighting to have their convictions overturned and receive compensation, the public inquiry is ongoing, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police" title="Metropolitan Police">Metropolitan Police</a> is investigating the Post Office for potential fraud offences.
</p><p>The Horizon accounting system was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Computers_Limited" title="International Computers Limited">ICL Pathway</a>, owned by the Japanese company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujitsu" title="Fujitsu">Fujitsu</a>. In 1999, the Post Office started to roll out the new software to its branch and sub-offices, the latter managed by subpostmasters on a self-employed basis under contracts with the Post Office. Almost immediately, some subpostmasters noticed the new system reporting false shortfalls, sometimes for thousands of pounds. The Post Office insisted that the system was robust and, when shortfalls occurred, prosecuted the subpostmasters or forced them to make up the amount. The impact of court cases, criminal convictions, imprisonment, loss of livelihood and homes, debt and bankruptcy took a heavy toll on victims and their families, leading to stress, illness, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce" title="Divorce">divorce</a> and, in at least four cases, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a>. In May 2009, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Weekly" title="Computer Weekly">Computer Weekly</a> broke the story about problems with Horizon software and in September 2009 subpostmaster Alan Bates set up the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA). In 2012, as a result of pressure from campaigners and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom)" title="Members of Parliament (United Kingdom)">Members of Parliament</a>, the Post Office appointed forensic accountants Second Sight to conduct an investigation into Horizon. The investigators concluded that Horizon contained faults that could result in accounting discrepancies, but the Post Office insisted that there were no system-wide problems with the software.
</p><p>In 2019 a group of 555 subpostmasters led by Bates won a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action#England_and_the_United_Kingdom" title="Class action">group action</a> brought in court against the Post Office, with the judge ruling that Horizon contained bugs, errors and defects. The Post Office agreed to settle out of court for £58 million. The subpostmasters' legal costs amounted to £47 million, leaving them with only about £20,000 each. The government later agreed to supplement the settlement, as they were excluded from the compensation scheme set up by the Post Office for other victims of the scandal. The first convictions to be quashed were those of six subpostmasters who had been convicted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrates%27_court_(England_and_Wales)" title="Magistrates' court (England and Wales)">magistrates' courts</a> and whose appeals were heard at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwark_Crown_Court" title="Southwark Crown Court">Southwark Crown Court</a> in December 2020. In allowing the appeal by 39 subpostmasters in April 2021, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_(England_and_Wales)" title="Court of Appeal (England and Wales)">Court of Appeal</a> judges ruled that in cases that relied on Horizon data a fair trial was not possible. Further appeal cases followed.
</p><p>In September 2020, the government established the <i>Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry</i>, chaired by retired judge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyn_Williams" title="Wyn Williams">Sir Wyn Williams</a>, to look into the implementation and failings of the Horizon system that led to the prosecution of subpostmasters and termination of their contracts. Evidence was due to be heard from subpostmasters, the Post Office, UK Government Investment, the Department for Business and Trade, and others.

As the mediation process broke down, the affected subpostmasters began to consult and combine their efforts into legal action. The action taken against the Post Office took the form first of the group litigation in the name of <i>Bates and others</i>, a civil action in the High Court by some 600 people, and the linked appeal cases, first of <i>R v Christoper Trousdale &amp; Others</i> in the Crown Court, and then of <i>Hamilton and Others</i> in the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). In the <i>Trousdale</i> and <i>Hamilton</i> appeals, the findings in the civil case (<i>Bates</i>) were used to support the appeals against convictions. In <i>Bates</i>, six 'lead claimants' and 23 'Common Issues' were identified and agreed to enable the court to examine the 600 cases.

</p>
<blockquote><p>The recusal application was issued the day after Mr Godeseth's cross-examination had made it clear, not only that this remote access existed, but after he was taken in careful cross-examination through specific examples of Fujitsu personnel manipulating branch accounts, and leading to discrepancies in branch accounts. I am aware that criticism of the Post Office and Fujitsu in this respect may prove to be controversial, as earlier criticism of certain aspects of the Post Office's case in Judgment (No. 3) was not well received by it. However, if criticism is justified, I consider it would be detrimental to proper resolution of the group litigation if that criticism were to be withheld simply because it might lead to a further negative reaction by the Post Office. It is also an inherent part of the judicial function in any litigation to make findings, which may include criticisms where justified, that may be contrary to a litigant's own view of the merits of their case. Some litigants are so convinced of the righteousness of their own position that they consistently refuse to accept any possible view of the litigation other than their own. Such a blinkered view is rarely helpful, and would be particularly unhelpful from a publicly owned institution.</p></blockquote>

<p>The subpostmasters and the Post Office had identified 23 issues relating to the contractual relationship between them and about which they disagreed.

</p>
<blockquote><p>I do not consider that Mr Parker was interested in accuracy in any of his evidential exercises. ...

<p>Of the evidence of one Post Office witness, the judge said, "The Post Office appears, at least at times, to conduct itself as though it is answerable only to itself. The statement that it is prepared to preserve documents – as though that were a concession – and the obdurate to accept the relevance of plainly important documents, and to refuse to produce them, is extremely worrying."<sup id="cite_ref-J3_96-3"><a href="#cite_note-J3-96">[96]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 523">: 523 </span></sup> Fraser said in the Horizon Issues trial,<sup id="cite_ref-J6_33-3"><a href="#cite_note-J6-33">[33]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 64.2">: 64.2 </span></sup>

<blockquote><p>the possibility of future (as opposed to current) criminal prosecutions, or the potentially criminal impact upon individual subpostmasters, did more than hover in the background to the Horizon Issues trial.

And I am not the only judicial figure or barrister that has looked at this with a view to reaching that conclusion. It has also been looked at by another very senior person before the decision was taken to make this application.

<p>The issuing by the Post Office of the recusal application on 21 March 2019 caused significant disruption to the Horizon Issues trial which had started on 11 March 2019, and to the Group Litigation as a whole. The subpostmasters applied for the costs of that application; the Post Office sought that the judge reserve costs, in the following terms:<sup id="cite_ref-J5_106-1"><a href="#cite_note-J5-106">[106]</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote><p>the court can't be sure that things will happen in the future that will affect and alter its view about incidence of costs. It simply cannot do so. If it does so now, in my submission as a matter of principle, that would evidence a predetermination or would go towards suggesting the court has reached a view about matters as to how things are going to pan out in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The judge was troubled by this submission. Inherent was a veiled or implied threat that the Post Office will say that the overall outcome of the litigation, or other future issues, has been decided. The Post Office was attempting to put the court <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_terrorem" title="In terrorem">in terrorem</a></i> again. After asserting no predecision he said, "I do nonetheless consider that it is appropriate that I consider whether to make a costs order now ..." After considering cases cited, the application by the Post Office to reserve costs was dismissed. "The claimants would not be on an equal footing with the Post Office, a publicly funded body, if I reserved the costs of the Common Issues trial until the very end of the litigation ... I do not however consider that the presence of litigation funding should sway this decision one way or the other. I agree with Mr Cavender that the presence of such funding should not put a claimant in a better position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the correct stage in litigation at which costs should be addressed, compared to a non-funded party. However, regardless of who is funding litigation, a funder or an individual litigant, cash flow is a relevant consideration for most litigants. It is a consideration that might weigh less heavily upon publicly funded bodies such as the Post Office, but even such entities are likely to be concerned to some extent with cash flow."<sup id="cite_ref-J5_106-2"><a href="#cite_note-J5-106">[106]</a></sup> Of the subpostmasters' submissions that their award of costs should not be reduced, the court rejected them.<sup id="cite_ref-J4_113-7"><a href="#cite_note-J4-113">[113]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-J5_106-3"><a href="#cite_note-J5-106">[106]</a></sup>

<p>This judgment concerns the operation and functionality of the Horizon system itself. The hearings took place in March, April, June and July 2019. The hearings were interrupted by the Post Office's application for the judge to recuse, to appeal his refusal to recuse (<a href="#Permission_to_appeal_Judgment_No_4_–_May_2019">judgment 4</a>), and his <a href="#Permission_to_appeal_Judgment_No_3_–_November_2019">judgment 3</a>.

Witnesses for the subpostmasters and for the Post Office submitted statements and gave oral evidence.

These included the 'Known Error Logs' and the 'PEAKs', a browser-based software incident and problem management system used by Fujitsu for the Post Office account.

</p><p>The important judgment was about whether the Horizon computer system worked and was "robust", which the Post Office said it was.  Again, the judge found overwhelmingly in favour of the subpostmasters and that the original version of Horizon was "not robust" and, as to the later version, "its robustness was questionable, and did not justify the confidence placed in it by the Post Office in terms of its accuracy."<sup id="cite_ref-116"><a href="#cite_note-116">[116]</a></sup>
</p><p>During this trial, the Post Office issued an application that the judge recuse himself.

<p>Lord Justice Coulson refused permission to appeal judgment No 3 and handed down his written reasons on 22 November.<sup id="cite_ref-coulson2_117-0"><a href="#cite_note-coulson2-117">[117]</a></sup> Before dealing with the 26 grounds that formed the basis of the application the judge set out a number of reasons that he felt militated against granting the Post Office permission to appeal. In short, the judge said:
</p>
<ul><li>The trial was long and complex – 6 weeks – 60 lever arch files – 20 witnesses of fact. The judgment is 320 pages and 1,122 paragraphs long. No judge will ever know more about this case generally, and the Common Issues specifically, than Fraser J.</li>
<li>The oral hearing of the permission-to-appeal application had demonstrated the danger that consideration of one issue opened up another, and another until the trial is re-fought. That is manifestly not in the interests of justice.</li>
<li>Many of the Post Office's challenges are challenges to the findings of fact made by Fraser J. Challenges to such findings of fact are not open to an appellant in the position of the Post Office.<sup id="cite_ref-Fage_118-0"><a href="#cite_note-Fage-118">[118]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup> Fraser J's conclusions of law were so entangled with his findings of fact that Coulson LJ considered it neither just, nor practicable to endeavour to separate them out.</li>
<li>The Post Office made sweeping statements of the judgment which were demonstrably wrong. The Post Office takes findings "either wholly out of context, misstated, or otherwise not correctly summarised".</li>
<li>Fraser J dealt comprehensively with why he refused permission to appeal in his separate judgment of 17 June 2019 which itself runs to 91 paragraphs, and Coulson LJ said that he agreed with Fraser J's detailed reasons for refusing the application to appeal.</li>
<li>The Post Office's approach in this application was, as Fraser J correctly labelled it "attritional". The most obvious example is the Post Office's anxiety to state what they do not like about a particular proposal from the subpostmasters or the consequential finding by Fraser J, without providing any practical alternative. None of this engenders any confidence in the underlying merits or prospects of success of the Post Office's application for permission to appeal.</li>
<li>There is no greater or wider right to permission to appeal just because this is group litigation; indeed, from the point of view of practical justice the opposite may well be the case. In any event, the subpostmasters' contract was no longer in use.</li>
<li>This application is founded on the premise that the nation's most trusted brand was not obliged to treat their subpostmasters with good faith, and instead entitled to treat them in capricious or arbitrary ways which would not be unfamiliar to a mid-Victorian factory-owner (the Post Office's right to terminate contracts arbitrarily and the subpostmasters alleged strict liability to the Post Office for errors made by the Post Office's own computer system, being just two of many examples). Given the unique relationship that the Post Office has with its subpostmasters, that position was a startling starting point for any consideration of these grounds of appeal.<sup id="cite_ref-coulson2_117-1"><a href="#cite_note-coulson2-117">[117]</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>The application was refused.

</p><p>The Post Office accepted Fraser's findings of the unreliability of the Horizon systems and, in some cases, of inadequate investigation, and/or of insufficient disclosure. In these cases, the Post Office did not resist the appeal on Ground 1 but it would oppose Ground 2. The Post Office divided the appellants into three groups; A, 4 cases where it asserted that both categories 1 and 2 abuse of process applied, group B, 35 cases where category 1 applied, but not category 2, and group C, where neither category applied. The Post Office would not seek a retrial of any appellant whose appeal is allowed.

That hearing led to further hearings in November, December, and January. The court addressed three issues:
</p>
<ul><li>information from Brian Altman QC, counsel for Post Office, alleging potential contempt of court by Ms Page, junior counsel for three appellants (all in group B), by improper disclosure of the 'Clarke advice';</li>
<li>"the issue of whether an appellant whose appeal was not resisted by POL on Ground 1 was entitled to argue Ground 2;"<sup id="cite_ref-EWCA_Crim_577_63-6"><a href="#cite_note-EWCA_Crim_577-63">[63]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 79">: 79 </span></sup></li>
<li>an application by journalist Nick Wallis for the release of the 'Clarke advice'. Mr Wallis' application failed.</li></ul>
<p>Mr Altman's information to the court on 19 November led to hearings on 3 December 10 December and 15 January before the present court, and to Marshall and Page resigning from the case. On 3 December, Altman said, "I am confident that the court understands why we brought these matters to the court's attention. ... For the avoidance of any doubt, I should like to make clear that the Post Office has not made application for anyone's committal for contempt. ... We have sought to assist the court as we were invited to do," referring to signed undertakings, "... the court suggested that all legal representatives sign an express undertaking not to use disclosed material other than for the proper conduct of these proceedings." Lord Justice Holroyde interjected, "I thought you suggested that," and Altman replied, "Ultimately, my Lord, I think it was at the suggestion of the court but that is what has happened and that is what has been done."<sup id="cite_ref-auto_128-0"><a href="#cite_note-auto-128">[128]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 137–141">: 137–141 </span></sup>

"... we direct that the question of whether any contempt proceedings are to be initiated against Mr Marshall and/or Miss Page and, if so, whether by the Post Office or by the Court of its own initiative, must be adjourned for consideration after the appeals have been concluded. ... we direct that all further hearings must be before a different constitution."<sup id="cite_ref-129"><a href="#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup> On 15 January 2021, the court set out its reasons.<sup id="cite_ref-Felstead_127-1"><a href="#cite_note-Felstead-127">[127]</a></sup> It led to Marshall and Page facing the possibility of an action against them, either by the court or by the Post office, for contempt of court. By 4 December, barristers Paul Marshall and Fiona Page had resigned from the Hamilton case. Mr Marshall had written two letters to the court. Of the second, Nick Wallis said, "It makes for troubling reading."<sup id="cite_ref-x258_126-1"><a href="#cite_note-x258-126">[126]</a></sup> In April 2021, the matter came before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Fulford" title="Adrian Fulford">Lord Justice Fulford</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_High_Court_judges_of_England_and_Wales" title="List of High Court judges of England and Wales">Mrs Justice Cutts</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_High_Court_judges_of_England_and_Wales" title="List of High Court judges of England and Wales">Mr Justice Saini</a> when it was declared no further action to be taken.

The appellants have suffered very severely as a consequence of their prosecutions, and a finding in their favour on Ground 1 alone would not fully vindicate them. ...

</p>
<ol><li>abuse of court process is an important matter to the parties and the public, notwithstanding that the appellants had not previously applied for leave to appeal.</li>
<li>Ground 1 presupposes that there should be a prosecution.

The Post Office maintained privilege over documents relevant to the ongoing group litigation claim in the Employment Tribunal. It maintained privilege over legal advice related to the Historical Shortfall Scheme and to current and anticipated claims from individuals whose criminal convictions have been or will be quashed. This could have wide-reaching ramifications for the inquiry; if advice is withheld on the basis that it is relevant to current and anticipated claims from those who have had their convictions quashed, this may lead to gaps in the inquiry.<sup id="cite_ref-160"><a href="#cite_note-160">[160]</a></sup>
</p><p>On 13 February 2022, in a report prior to the start of the Wyn Williams hearings, the BBC quoted a prosecuted, jailed and subsequently cleared subpostmaster: "I want someone else to be charged and jailed like I was." This request was later repeated by several other subpostmasters.<sup id="cite_ref-161"><a href="#cite_note-161">[161]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-162"><a href="#cite_note-162">[162]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-163"><a href="#cite_note-163">[163]</a></sup>
</p><p>The inquiry issued an interim report on 17 July 2023. The recommendations were as follows:<sup id="cite_ref-164"><a href="#cite_note-164">[164]</a></sup>
</p>
<ul><li>The Horizon Compensation Advisory Board (HCAB) should not be prevented from monitoring individual cases</li>
<li>HCAB shall produce written reports in respect of each of their meetings</li>
<li>Membership of HCAB should be increased to ensure that it has sufficient capacity</li>
<li>The Government should within 28 days seek directions under section 306 of the Insolvency Act 1986 to ensure that compensation payable to bankrupt claimants is not diverted to insolvency practitioners</li>
<li>The government should publish proposals for ensuring that applicants to all schemes are treated equally and fairly</li>
<li>The government should ensure that legislation is enacted to allow compensation under group litigation orders to be made to applicants after midnight on 7 August 2024</li>
<li>No applications for compensation to the Horizon Shortfall Scheme should be entertained after such date as agreed by the minister</li></ul>
<p>The government accepted the recommendations in full or in part on 26 October 2023.<sup id="cite_ref-165"><a href="#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup>

<p>Subpostmasters in <i>Bates &amp; Others v Post Office</i> announced on 11 December 2019 that they had reached an out-of-court settlement with the Post Office.<sup id="cite_ref-168"><a href="#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup> The Post Office did not accept liability so this was a costs settlement, not compensation. The details of the settlement were not made public until August 2020.<sup id="cite_ref-169"><a href="#cite_note-169">[169]</a></sup> At the time of the high court verdict, the government decided this group could not apply for compensation through the historical shortfall scheme. The group that brought the legal action was awarded £57.75M, but some £46M was taken in legal costs, leaving only about £20,000 for each person, which MPs said the victims saw as "inadequate".<sup id="cite_ref-170"><a href="#cite_note-170">[170]</a></sup>
</p><p>In April 2021, Nick Read, Post Office chief executive, urged the government to provide funding for compensation, saying "The Post Office simply does not have the financial resources to provide meaningful compensation."<sup id="cite_ref-Read_14-1"><a href="#cite_note-Read-14">[14]</a></sup> Shortly afterward, the government promised "fair and speedy" pay-outs for the 555 victims of the Horizon IT scandal who had been excluded from the Post Office's compensation scheme.<sup id="cite_ref-171"><a href="#cite_note-171">[171]</a></sup>

<p>In May 2021, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Computer_Society" title="British Computer Society">British Computer Society</a>, the official body for IT professionals in the UK, called for reconsideration of courts' default presumption that computer data is correct.<sup id="cite_ref-174"><a href="#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-175"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup>
</p><p>The presumption that computer evidence is correct is based on a naïve and simplistic understanding of software systems. Large systems are complex and lay people cannot discern whether these systems are reliable or be confident that they can spot errors as they happen.

</p>
<blockquote><p>If one were commissioned – any investigation would need to be disclosed in court. Although we would be doing the review to comfort others, any perception that POL doubts its own systems would mean that all criminal prosecutions would have to be stayed. It would also beg a question for the Court of Appeal over past prosecutions and imprisonments.<sup id="cite_ref-Ismay_Report_178-0"><a href="#cite_note-Ismay_Report-178">[178]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>No independent review was conducted until Second Sight was commissioned in 2012, and the contract was terminated abruptly.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h2 id="intro">
  Intro
  <a href="#intro">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Vcc - the Vulkan Clang Compiler, is a proof-of-concept C and C++ compiler for Vulkan leveraging Clang as a front-end, and <a href="https://github.com/Hugobros3/shady">Shady</a> our own research IR and compiler. Unlike other shading languages, Vcc aims to stick closely to standard C/C++ languages and merely adds a few new intrinsics to cover GPU features. Vcc is similar to CUDA or Metal in this regard, and aims to bring the advantages of standard host languages to Vulkan shaders<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img src="https://shady-gang.github.io/vcc/vcc.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="key-features">
  Key Features
  <a href="#key-features">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Vcc supports advanced C/C++ features usually left out of shading languages such as HLSL or GLSL, in particular raising the bar when it comes to pointer support and control-flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unrestricted pointers
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic is legal, they can be bitcasted to and from integers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generic pointers
<ul>
<li>Generic pointers do not have an address space in their type, rather they carry the address space as a tag in the upper bits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>True function calls
<ul>
<li>Including recursion, a stack is implemented to handle this in the general case</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Function pointers
<ul>
<li>Lets you write code in a functional style on the GPU without limitations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arbitrary <code>goto</code> statements - code does not need to be strictly structured !</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these capabilities are present in compute APIs, but are not supported in most graphics APIs such as DirectX or Vulkan. We aim to address this gap by proving these features can and should implemented. <a href="https://shady-gang.github.io/vcc/why">More on why we think that’s important</a></p>
<h2 id="status-and-caveats">
  Status and Caveats
  <a href="#status-and-caveats">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Vcc is still a work-in-progress. While we do commit to making all the previously mentioned features work reliably, and generally attempt to bring the entirety of C and C++ to the GPU without sub-setting, there are still limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain functions, such as <code>malloc</code>/<code>free</code> require communicating with the host kernel which we currently do not implement.</li>
<li>Non header-only libraries, including parts of the C and C++ standard libraries, will not work on the GPU without additional work, because of the way Vcc works.
<ul>
<li>While addressable, this would massively increase the scope of the project.</li>
<li>For now it’s best to think of Vcc as only supporting a <code>-ffreestanding</code> dialect of C/C++</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C++ exceptions and their corresponding LLVM instructions (<code>landingpad</code> etc) are not supported.</li>
<li>Function and data pointers are not portable between host and device. Taking addresses and passing them across in either direction is UB - since Vulkan lacks a unified addressing extension this is a limitation we cannot address at this time.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    <div id="post-wrapper">
                            <p>[update] I'm on some list now that I have written an article about some kind of "bomb", ain't I?</p>
<hr>
<p>If you have ever hosted a website or even administrated a server you'll be very well aware of bad people <em>trying</em> bad things with your stuff.</p>
<p>When I first hosted my own little linux box with SSH access at age 13 I read through the logs daily and report the IPs (mostly from China and Russia) who tried to connect to my sweet little box (which was actually an old ThinkPad T21 with a broken display running under my bed) to their ISPs.</p>
<p>Actually if you have a linux server with SSH exposed you can see how many connection attempts are made every day:</p>
<pre><code>grep 'authentication failures' /var/log/auth.log</code></pre>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/u1ath9io4n.jpg"><figcaption>Hundreds of failed login attempts even though this server has disabled password authentication and runs on a non-standard port</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Wordpress has doomed us all</h2>
<p>Ok to be honest, web vulnerability scanners have existed before Wordpress but since WP is so widely deployed most web vuln scanners include scans for some misconfigured wp-admin folders or unpatched plugins.</p>
<p>So if a small, new hacking group wants to gain some hot cred they'll download <a href="https://wpscan.org/">one</a> of <a href="https://github.com/sullo/nikto">these</a> scanner <a href="http://rgaucher.info/beta/grabber/">things</a> and start testing against many websites in hopes of gaining access to a site and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_defacement">defacing</a> it.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/8c7cbrxql5.jpg"><figcaption>Sample of a log file during a scan using the tool Nikto</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is why all server or website admins have to deal with gigabytes of logs full with scanning attempts. So I was wondering..</p>
<h2>Is there a way to strike back?</h2>
<p>After going through some potential implementations with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection_system">IDS</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail2ban">Fail2ban</a> I remembered the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">ZIP bombs</a> from the old days.</p>
<h2>WTH is a ZIP bomb?</h2>
<p>So it turns out ZIP compression is really good with repetitive data so if you have a really huge text file which consists of repetitive data like all zeroes, it will compress it really good. Like REALLY good.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.unforgettable.dk/">42.zip</a> shows us it can compress a 4.5 peta byte (4.500.000  giga bytes) file down to 42 kilo bytes. When you try to actually look at the content (extract or decompress it) then you'll most likely run out of disk space or RAM.</p>
<h2>How can I ZIP bomb a vuln scanner?</h2>
<p>Sadly, web browsers don't understand ZIP, but they do understand GZIP.</p>
<p>So firstly we'll have to create the 10 giga byte GZIP file filled with zeroes. We could make multiple compressions but let's keep it simple for now.</p>
<pre><code>dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=10240 | gzip &gt; 10G.gzip</code></pre>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/es8b6god0j.jpg"><figcaption>Creating the bomb and checking its size</figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can see it's 10 MB large. We could do better but good enough for now.</p>
<p>Now that we have created this thing, let's set up a PHP script that will deliver it to a client.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
//prepare the client to recieve GZIP data. This will not be suspicious
//since most web servers use GZIP by default
header("Content-Encoding: gzip");
header("Content-Length: ".filesize('10G.gzip'));
//Turn off output buffering
if (ob_get_level()) ob_end_clean();
//send the gzipped file to the client
readfile('10G.gzip');</code></pre>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p>So we could use this as a simple defense like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
$agent = filter_input(INPUT_SERVER, 'HTTP_USER_AGENT');

//check for nikto, sql map or "bad" subfolders which only exist on wordpress
if (strpos($agent, 'nikto') !== false || strpos($agent, 'sqlmap') !== false || startswith($url,'wp-') || startswith($url,'wordpress') || startswith($url,'wp/'))
{
      sendBomb();
      exit();

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>It is now widely accepted that an </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-teen-mental-illness-epidemic" rel="">epidemic of mental illness began among American teens in the early 2010s</a><span>. What caused it? Many commentators point to events in the USA around that time, such as a particularly horrific school shooting in 2012. But if the epidemic started in many nations at the same time, then such country-specific theories would not work. We’d need to find a global event or trend, and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis doesn’t match the timing at all, as </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197121000853" rel="">Jean Twenge and I</a><span> have </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/social-media-mental-illness-epidemic" rel="">shown</a><span>.</span></em></p><p><em><span>In our 2018 book </span><a href="https://www.thecoddling.com/" rel="">The Coddling of the American Mind</a><span>, Greg Lukianoff and I presented evidence that the same trends were happening in Canada and the United Kingdom—not just the rise in depression and anxiety, but also the overprotection of children, the rise of “safetyism,” and the shouting down of speakers on university campuses when students deemed the speaker to be “harmful.”&nbsp; It seemed that all the Anglo nations were setting up their children for failure in the same ways at the same time.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><em><span>In 2019 I went on a speaking tour of Australia and New Zealand (thanks to </span><a href="https://thinkinc.org.au/" rel="">Think Inc</a><span>) and discovered that the same trends were coming, more slowly, to the Southern hemisphere Anglo nations too.&nbsp; I then created two new collaborative review documents, one for </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19maacSq_DYIaQ-IccCS3psBAvCy24GNt709Tl_L5AhM/edit" rel="">Australia</a><span>, and one for </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vq10ex65igy5PP2IQYjnjvbGaGUFBBo8VLQRtaS2KGI/edit" rel="">New Zealand</a><span>, to gather all the empirical studies and journalistic accounts I could find.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><em><span>In early 2020, just as COVID swept in, I hired </span><a href="https://zach-rausch.com/" rel="">Zach Rausch</a><span> as a research assistant to help me handle these collaborative review docs. I connected with Zach, who was finishing his master’s degree in Psychological Science at SUNY New Paltz, after reading his </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/darwins-subterranean-world/202002/gendered-values-in-higher-education" rel="">blog post</a><span> about his research related to The Coddling. Zach and I created many more collaborative review docs for many more countries and topics, which you can find (and add to) </span><a href="http://jonathanhaidt.com/reviews" rel="">on this page</a><span>.</span></em><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><em><span>In 2021, as I was beginning to work on the </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-after-babel-substack" rel="">Babel project</a><span>, I told Zach that it was urgent that we figure out just how international the mental illness epidemic was. Is it just happening in the five countries of what is sometimes called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglosphere" rel="">The Anglosphere</a><span>? Is it all Western countries? Is it happening everywhere? Go figure it out and report back to me.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><em>The rest of this post is Part 1 of Zach’s report, in his voice. I think his findings are momentous and should cause an immediate global rethinking of what children need to have a healthy childhood, and what obstacles to development arrived around the globe around 2012. </em><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>— Jon Haidt</strong></p><p><em><span>(Addendum April 19th: Zach published his second post on international mental health trends. The post explores trends in the five Nordic Nations: You can read the report </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/international-mental-illness-part-two" rel="">here</a><span>).</span></em><span> </span></p><p>When Jon first asked me to figure out whether teen mental health had collapsed around the globe after 2012, I thought he was nuts. The task felt impossible and beyond what I thought I could accomplish. But it was precisely this kind of work that I aspired to do. I set aside my doubt, put my head down, and gathered every relevant study I could find on teen mental health trends across the globe. In a series of posts, I will share with you what I have found so far. I address the Anglosphere today. In future posts, I’ll show what I have learned about Scandinavia and other developed nations and what I have learned from five international surveys, each with data from dozens of nations. There is much more to be done, especially beyond Western countries.</p><p><span>The short answer to Jon’s question is: </span><em>Teen mental health plummeted across the Western world in the early 2010s, particularly for girls and particularly in the most individualistic nations.</em><span> The longer answer begins below and will continue in parts 2 and 3.</span></p><p><span>As Jon mentioned in the introduction to this post, he and Greg Lukianoff had already found evidence that the mental illness epidemic was occurring in Canada, the UK, and the USA. But it has been more than four years since the publication of </span><em>The Coddling of the American Mind, </em><span>and we now have access to a lot more data, so let me run through the five countries.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-teen-mental-illness-epidemic" rel="">two</a><span> </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/mental-health-liberal-girls" rel="">previous</a><span> posts of the </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/" rel="">After Babel Substack</a><span>, Jon has shown the astounding rise of mental illness among American adolescents since 2010. Therefore, I won’t cover the United States in much detail. However, I will include a few figures to provide a baseline for the countries we explore in the rest of this post. For each country, I try to show at least one graph or study on mood disorders (anxiety and/or depression), which is usually self-reported, and one on something related to self-harm or psychiatric hospitalization, which is usually not based on self-reports from teens. (Note that I defer the discussion of suicide rates to a future post. You can find data and graphs about suicide rates in each of the Collaborative Review Docs that I link to.)&nbsp;</span></p><p>Figure 1 shows the percentage of US teens since 2004 who reported having a major depressive episode in the last year.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png" width="1092" height="690" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:690,&quot;width&quot;:1092,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Percent of teens with Major Depression in the last year&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Percent of teens with Major Depression in the last year" title="Percent of teens with Major Depression in the last year" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em><strong>Figure 1.</strong><span> Percent of teens with Major Depression in the last year.

National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH).</span></em></p><p>To summarize, four trends emerged in the data from the USA, which we will call the “basic pattern.” They include:</p><blockquote><p>A) A substantial increase in adolescent anxiety and depression rates begins in the early 2010s.</p><p>B) A substantial increase in adolescent self-harm rates or psychiatric hospitalizations begins in the early 2010s.</p><p>C) The increases are larger for girls than for boys (in absolute terms).</p><p>D) The increases are larger for Gen Z than for older generations (in absolute terms).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><span>Note that there are two ways to calculate increases. We can measure an increase in </span><em>absolute</em><span> terms, e.g., a rise from 5% to 15% of teens with a diagnosis is a ten percentage-point increase, or we can report it in </span><em>relative</em><span> terms, e.g., a rise from 5% to 15% is a 300% increase, relative to the anchor point. Both are important. From a utilitarian or public health point of view, we care more about the absolute increase, for it tells us the number of people affected. From a psychological research point of view, we also care about the relative increase since a large relative increase may alert us that something is changing for that group, even if its illness rate only moves from 2.1% to 4.3%. We decided to report the relative changes on our graphs since that is hard to calculate by eye. For example, as shown in Figure 1, the </span><em>absolut</em><span>e increase from 2010 to 2021 was much larger for girls (17.3%) than for boys (7.1%), and that jumps out at you as soon as you look at the graph. However, the </span><em>relative</em><span> increase was slightly larger for boys (161%) than for girls (145%), which tells us that whatever is happening, it’s also affecting boys quite a lot.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>With this basic pattern in mind, let’s move north to see how Canadian teens are doing.

Since 2010, there has been a 138% increase in self-harm hospitalization for 13-17-year-old girls (from a low of 294.0 per 100,000 teens in 2010 to a high of 701.6 per 100,000 in 2017). The boys show an increase too, but from a much lower baseline, and there is no spike around 2012. Again, the pattern and timing are very similar to the USA: no sign of a problem before 2010, and then something terrible happens to Canadian teens in the early 2010s, especially to the girls.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, Canada also shares the basic pattern. Although we do not have specific changes in rates of anxiety and depression, we see a significant decline in mental well-being among young Canadians. The changes in well-being and self-harm are larger for girls than for boys, in both absolute and relative terms. And the changes in well-being were much larger for the youngest cohort than for the older ones.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Because Jon and Greg had been studying the UK along with the US, all of the studies on teenage mental health trends in the UK were included in the original collaborative review doc, “</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1diMvsMeRphUH7E6D1d_J7R6WbDdgnzFHDHPx9HXzR5o/edit#" rel="">Adolescent Mood Disorders Since 2010: A Collaborative Review</a><span>.”</span></p><p><span>An essential UK data source, the </span><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-of-children-and-young-people-in-england/2017/2017" rel="">United Kingdom National Health Survey</a><span>, examined trends among 11- to 15-year-old English boys and girls for anxiety and depressive disorders at 3 points (1999, 2004, 2017).

This graph confirms something we see in the American data repeatedly: something big seems to have happened to girls around 2012.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png" width="1428" height="798" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:798,&quot;width&quot;:1428,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Figure 9.</strong><em><span> UK Teens, Self-harm rates per 100,000</span><strong>. </strong><span>Aurum and GOLD datasets of the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).

We do not believe that the underlying rates of anxiety disorders increased as quickly as the lines in Figure 11 suggest. Nonetheless, given what we are seeing in all of the Anglosphere countries, and given the self-harm data below, we believe that much or most of the rise is real.

The timing of that event is exactly the </span><em>opposite</em><span> of what you’d expect, namely: the epidemic should have started in 2009 and then gotten progressively </span><em>better</em><span> after 2012 as the economy improved in the USA and other countries. In an </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/academic-pressure-social-media" rel="">earlier post, Jean Twenge showed</a><span> that it can’t be caused by rising academic pressure either. And it certainly can’t be caused by the most popular theory we hear in the USA: school shootings and other stress-inducing events. Why would school shootings or active shooter drills implemented only in the USA lead to an immediate epidemic across the entire English-speaking world?</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-111288830" href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/international-mental-illness-part-one#footnote-4-111288830" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span></p><p>At this point, there is only one theory we know of that can explain why the same thing happened to girls in so many countries at the same time: the rapid global movement from flip phones (where you can’t do social media) to smartphones and the phone-based childhood. The first smartphone with a front-facing camera (the iPhone 4) came out in 2010, just as teens were trading in their flip phones for smartphones in large numbers. (Few teens owned an iPhone in its first few years). Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, which gave the platform a huge boost in publicity and users. So 2012 was the first year that very large numbers of girls in the developed world were spending hours each day posting photos of themselves and scrolling through hundreds of carefully edited photos of other girls.&nbsp;</p><p><span>If you suddenly transform the social lives of girls, putting them onto platforms that prioritize social comparison and performance, platforms where we know that </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(18)30060-9/fulltext" rel="">heavy users are three times more likely to be depressed</a><span> than light users, might that have some impact on the mental health of girls around the world? We think so, but if anyone can offer another explanation that fits the graphs we’ve shown in this post, we’d love to hear it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This concludes the first part of my report. In Part 2, I’ll examine the Scandinavian countries. In Part 3, I’ll examine studies that collected evidence from multiple countries, mostly in Europe. In later posts, I’ll examine the limited data we have from non-Western nations. To give you a sneak preview, there </span><em>are</em><span> cultural variations within the West, and the Anglosphere was hit a bit harder than other regions. Whatever it was that changed about childhood in the early 2010s, it took the greatest toll on teens in the most individualistic nations.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Please tune in next week, and subscribe to the After Babel Substack if you have not already done so.&nbsp;(It’s free.)</p><p>Here is the list of open-source collaborative review documents that Jon and I curate to track the mental illness epidemic around the globe.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="quartz-body"><article><p><em>Atuin supercharges your productivity by enabling you to rapidly retrieve any command you’ve ran, at any time, from anywhere. It stores your shell history in a database, recording additional command context and syncing it (e2e encrypted) across devices.</em></p>
<p>The 22nd of December was my last day leading the infrastructure team at <a href="https://posthog.com/">PostHog</a>. Going forwards, I’m starting a company and working full time on <a href="https://atuin.sh/">Atuin</a>.</p>
<blockquote data-callout="info">

<p>Atuin will continue to be open source and available for free in its current form as a self-hosted tool. By going full-time I hope I can focus on adding new premium hosted features for advanced users, and begin to support business usage.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="how-did-i-get-here">How did I get here?</h3>
<p>I started Atuin a few years ago now, to scratch an itch I had. I always felt that the shell should be easier to use, and that the state of shell history was the #1 problem there. I’d be googling commands that I knew I’d ran several times at some point in the past, or booting up my other laptop just to retrieve an incantation from earlier that week.</p>
<p>It turns out, a whole bunch of people felt the same.</p>
<p><a href="https://star-history.com/#atuinsh/atuin&amp;Date"><img src="https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=atuinsh/atuin&amp;type=Date" alt="Star History Chart"></a>
Some people even contributed - thank you so much to the more-than-150 people who’ve taken the time to make a PR, no matter how large or small. An extra special thank you to those of you who’ve stuck around a bit longer ❤️</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2023, I spoke at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyRmV19qJ2o">FOSDEM</a>. I had a <em>tonne</em> of fantastic feedback about the tool, both in person and online. This was great for my motivation - after a couple of years, I was starting to feel tired as an OSS maintainer.</p>
<p>I started putting more time and energy into the project, which paid off very well. Our usage grew massively - more contributors, more signups, more active community members, more features in blogs/podcasts/etc. We also moved the GitHub repo from <code>ellie/atuin</code>, to <code>atuinsh/atuin</code>.</p>
<p>I also had to make some improvements to the infrastructure, mostly because we store a lot of data (encrypted blobs don’t compress well…). While it is possible to self host Atuin, many people use the hosted sync server. Some metrics:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.ellie.wtf/i/2b7564cc93397c096dcf0ce9f903c5ac06c337f16336b54ddffc4c82e58dd896.jpg" alt="User growth chart"></p>
<h4 id="history-growth">History growth</h4>
<p><img src="https://img.ellie.wtf/i/84fb1e13d7fa2e667822803b36fa5d6ab71c0f7ead9e66237ac116a278778371.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We started 2023 with users uploading (in total) around 10,000 lines of history a day. We ended it with users uploading almost 200,000 lines a day.</p>
<h3 id="a-balancing-act">A balancing act</h3>
<p>It turns out, the more you put in, the more you get out. While it was great to see growth in the project, it started to get away from me towards the end of the year. I’d work on Atuin before work, but more often than not I wouldn’t even get through the open PRs + issues. Let alone work on new features/fixes that were needed. Earlier in the year, my friend <a href="https://github.com/conradludgate">Conrad</a> had also stepped back from helping out maintaining, which was totally understandable.</p>
<p>I felt like I was letting the project down, neglecting my social life, and was trying very hard not to be distracted at work.</p>
<p>In order to grow the project how I’d like to, I needed to be able to dedicate more time to it than is fair while having a full time job.</p>
<p>So, I’m starting a company and working on Atuin full-time.</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to run my own company, for pretty much my entire life. But I didn’t want to start something just for the sake of it. I want to build something people love, and find useful.</p>
<h3 id="money">Money</h3>
<p>I’d been paying out of pocket to run the Atuin servers the whole time. While not a huge amount, it also wasn’t tiny - 10s of millions of lines of encrypted shell history add up to a reasonably large amount of storage. Especially when you account for backups and moderate redundancy.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2022, a friend suggested I setup GitHub sponsors. I didn’t think anything would come of it, but it did! After a few months I received enough sponsorship to cover the server bills, and to offset some of what I’d paid so far.</p>
<p>I really appreciate all of my sponsors for liking my work enough to contribute financially, when there’s no paywall or requirement whatsoever.</p>
<p>One thing I did notice though - I only really gained sponsors when I regularly mentioned that my sponsors account existed. Otherwise, I lost more to attrition than I gained. This sat weirdly with me, as it felt like begging.</p>
<p>Speaking privately with some other maintainers, this is not an uncommon experience. I definitely won’t be paying my rent with sponsors any time soon.</p>
<p>I read an <a href="https://codecodeship.com/blog/2023-04-14-mike-perham">interview with Mike Perham</a>, the creator of Sidekiq, that sat with me. I encourage you to check it out, but these two quotes stuck in my mind</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“in the end, OSS burnout will kill any free project which gets traction”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d certainly felt this. I don’t want the project to die, and I know just how great it can be with proper care and attention. But without change, I’d probably give up to spend more time on other projects or pursuits.</p>
<p>The second quote is one that I’d spend a good while thinking about</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you build something valuable, charge money for it”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="looking-forwards">Looking forwards</h3>
<p>My hope is that I can build valuable features that people wish to pay for, on top of what we already have. Partly advanced/power users, but especially for business use cases.</p>
<p>I’d love to grow Atuin to the point where I can pass it on, and sponsor the people and projects that we depend on.</p>
<p>I’m going to wrap up there, but if you have any thoughts please do get in touch! I’d love to hear your thoughts on where Atuin should go next.</p>

<p>If you or your company would like to provide support, please check out the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/atuinsh">Atuin GitHub sponsors</a>!</p>
<p>Depending on the tier, I’ll mail out stickers and t-shirts to supporters - there’s also some tiers for companies that wish to show their support publicly, and receive a link back to their site.</p>

In fact, authentication, easy opt-out, and spam monitoring have been high on the list of <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/blog/email/understanding-email-deliverability/" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">email deliverability best practices</a> for quite some time now.</p><p>And while it’s no surprise it has caused some concern among senders, at Sinch Mailgun we suspect requirements like these will soon spread across the industry.</p><p>The most straight forward answer to this question is that, if you haven’t already, you’ll need to get serious about certain email deliverability best practices.</p><p>Both Gmail and Yahoo have highlighted three key changes that senders will need to prioritize if they want to be seen as legitimate senders come 2024:</p><ol><li><p><b>Authenticate their email: </b>Senders will be required to verify their sender identities with standard protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.</p></li><li><p><b>Enable easy unsubscription: </b>Senders will need to implement a single-click unsubscribe link within emails if they haven’t already, to allow recipients to easily opt out.</p></li><li><p><b>Only send emails users want: </b>Gmail and Yahoo are getting serious about spam monitoring and senders will need to ensure they’re keeping below a set spam rate threshold.</p></li></ol><p>These mandates will only affect bulk senders, defined by Google as senders with volumes of 5000 or more messages to Gmail addresses in one day. The announcements don’t specify that a sender must send 5000 messages <i>each</i> day, or within a certain time frame, though. So, <b>it’s important to consider your peak holiday sending habits, and large campaigns when checking if these rules will apply to you. </b><i>You</i> may not think of yourself as a bulk sender, but mailbox providers might disagree.</p><p>As we mentioned before, these requirements are not unexpected or revolutionary changes in the way we should be sending emails, but they’re still not followed by many senders.&nbsp;For example, email authentication has been strongly encouraged for a number of years now. Still, our <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/resources/research/state-of-deliverability-2023/" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">State of email deliverability report</a> found that around 40% of senders are either unsure or not implementing both SPF and DKIM, and among those using DMARC, 40% are not sure what their policy is.</p><div><svg width="280px" height="184px" viewBox="0 -30 280 215" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g id="Homepage-2020" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g id="Homepage-Desktop-01" transform="translate(-864.000000, -1808.000000)" fill="#FFFFFF"><g id="Quote-Red" transform="translate(0.000000, 1772.000000)"><path d="M1077,12 C1103.99512,12 1144,22.4392548 1144,93.5 C1144,164.560745 1086.96748,220 1028,220 L1028,172 L1028,172 C1059.89781,172 1087.5,142.097776 1087.5,120 C1058.4043,128.935547 1016,116.44552 1016,69.5 C1016,22.5544799 1050.00488,12 1077,12 Z M925,12 C951.995117,12 992,22.4392548 992,93.5 C992,164.560745 934.967484,220 876,220 L876,172 L876,172 C907.897807,172 935.5,142.097776 935.5,120 C906.404297,128.935547 864,116.44552 864,69.5 C864,22.5544799 898.004883,12 925,12 Z" id="Combined-Shape"></path></g></g></g></svg><p>Neil Kumaran Group Product Manager, Gmail Security &amp; Trust</p></div><p>The good news is that both providers have highlighted similar updates in their statements, primarily focused on maintaining higher standards of authentication, simplifying unsubscription from commercial emails, and holding senders under a lower spam rate threshold.&nbsp;Here’s a snapshot of what to expect.</p><div><picture id="f6ad4cca-8148-5ac7-967e-d8c031377d57" contentful_id="4Ft87oPVWBXDqOtqxdC0c" name="Mailgun Gmail Inbox Updates 2024 Image" alternative="Image outlining Gmail inbox update for Feburary 2024 that include authentication expectations, single click unsubscribe, and maintaining a low spam rate." internal="[object Object]" __typename="ContentfulImage" picture="[object Object]" sys="[object Object]"><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/y6oq7udscnj8/10DCm9h2Krzx5VIDcJEHWd/d5439ad30bea24d0951769c6d961d60d/MG-Gmail-Update-1200x630__3_.png?w=300&amp;h=158&amp;q=50&amp;fm=webp 300w,

				<p>Edge of Emulation: Glucoboy</p>
				<p>. . . . . . . . . . .</p>

				<p><img src="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/gluco_01.png" alt="Running out of good ideas, so here, have whatever this is"></p>

				<p><strong>A Poor Prognosis</strong></p>

				<p>The Game Boy handheld platform served as many things over the years, thanks to a wide array of accessories. It was a camera. It was a printer. It was a sonar. It was a barcode reader. It was a music player. It was a movie player. It connected to cellphones, videophones, sewing machines, TV remotes, PC modems, toys, and racetracks. Game Boys were seemingly capable of doing everything and anything imaginable, especially when accounting for unlicensed third-party hardware. However, there was one area that it never really explored: the medical field. Some may point out the <a href="https://consolevariations.com/collectibles/game-boy-pedisedate">PediSedate</a> as the earliest example of a Game Boy medical device, however, it's been sensationalized over the years on countless blogs and articles. In reality, there was nothing Game Boy-specific about the PediSedate at all, and it was advertised as working with anything with a 3.5mm jack, including CD players.</p>

				<p>The first true medical device for the Game Boy didn't appear until very late in the GBA's lifetime. On November 14, 2007, an Australian company called Guidance Interactive released the Glucoboy. This specialized game cartridge doubled as a glucose meter. By inserting testing strips at the top, its hardware would analyze the blood sample and report the results to the user. The Glucoboy was intended to aid diabetic children, using video games as an incentive to regularly test themselves and keep their glucose within healthy limits. Paul Wessel invented the Glucoboy after observing his own diabetic son, noting how he always carried around his Game Boy. From there, Wessel came up with the idea of integrating a glucose meter into a cartridge and using software to reward kids when playing games. After designing and patenting his work, the Glucoboy was born.</p>

				<p>Well, almost born. Wessel tried for years to get Nintendo's approval and make it an officially licensed product. The Japanese company initially balked. Part of the reason may have been Nintendo's unwillingness to open themselves up to any potential liabilities if the Glucoboy did not work or were misused. They may have also been sensitive to the optics of a malfunctioning Glucoboy leading to someone's injury or illness. Compounding all of this was the fact that juevenile diabetes is very rare in Japan, creating a sort of cultural barrier. In the end though, Wessel finally managed to convince Nintendo to give their blessings to the project. The delay was pretty extreme. News of the Glucoboy's plans date back to late 2004, almost 3 full years before it hit the market! By that time, the Nintendo DS was already dominating mobile gaming, and the GBA was on its way out.</p>

				<p>When it launched, the Glucoboy was exclusive to Australia. According to Wessel, some 70,000 units were sold. The German pharmaceutical giant Bayer took note of what was happening and sought to buy Guidance Interactive. Their goal was to bring a newer international version of the Glucoboy to the DS. They did just that and released the Bayer Digit in April 2009. Unfortunately, Bayer seized and destroyed any unsold stock for the Glucoboy. It was a tragic mistake in terms of video game preservation, but a logical captialistic manuever for the company. They likely didn't want the older Glucoboy to take away from any future sales of the Bayer Digit. They also probably wanted to avoid any consumer "confusion" about two similar devices.</p>

				<p>As a result of its limited release in Australia and the subsequent annihilation of some copies, the Glucoboy became an incredibly rare Game Boy accessory. Over the course of a decade-plus, the hardware proved extremely elusive. No one seemed to have any photos of it. No one seemed to even have come across any current or past auctions. The ROM had never been dumped, as far as the internet at large was concerned. Evidence of the Glucoboy's existence became so hard to come by that a few game collectors thought it had never hit retail shelves at all. It was effectively deemed "lost media" by the community, as any info related to the hardware was wrapped in pure mystery. It wasn't until 2018 that game historian Kelsey Lewin managed to contact Wessel and obtain gameplay footage for a brief documentary on the Glucoboy. Even so, the game and cartridge remained inaccessible. For a time, it looked as if this unique part of the Game Boy's history would never be recovered...</p>

				<p><strong>A Panacea Arrives</strong></p>

				<p>The Glucoboy's situation presented a fairly challenging dilemma. My ultimate goal is to emulate every officially licensed piece of hardware for the Game Boy platforms. The question here is how does one emulate something no one seems able to get their hands on? It's one thing to only have access to the ROM. The software alone typically acts like a blueprint for how the hardware should function. For example, LIJI32, author of the <a href="https://github.com/LIJI32/SameBoy">SameBoy</a> Game Boy emulator managed to support the unreleased WorkBoy, despite not having access to actual hardware. All that was necessary was a peek at the ROM here and there. However, with the Glucoboy, not even that much could be done. As mentioned above, at this point, the Glucoboy's ROM simply wasn't available to anyone. Just getting access to that data would have been enough for me to figure out how the hardware works. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/ep8f1a/what_are_some_systems_that_are_not_emulated_at_all/fej1jq9/">I even said this explicitly on Reddit some years ago:</a></p>

				<blockquote>If I could get my hands on it, it'd be emulated, I guarantee it. ... Theoretically, I wouldn't even need to physically have the Glucoboy. A lot could be reverse-engineered if we just had a ROM dump of the cart and a picture of the inside components.</blockquote>

				<p>I was adamant about keeping my word. Give me the ROM and the Glucoboy was as good as emulated, simple as that. Nevertheless, I didn't get that chance, at least not right away. Slowly over the years, small bits of info on the Glucoboy began to emerge. After Lewin's video, a streamer known as TheKBLife <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGCpVxF8V7I">played some of the Glucoboy's games</a> as part of the Extra Life 2018 charity event. Evidently, they had worked at the game studio responsible for developing the software, so it made sense that they had access to the ROM. Sadly that data wasn't widely shared or leaked. In early 2022, I received several high-resolution photos from someone acquainted with Lewin that showed the Glucoboy's PCB. Apparently the Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) had contacted someone with an actual Glucoboy. They'd tracked down this individual and were in the long process of verifying things. Here was absolute proof that the hardware did exist; contrary to what some believed, people had their hands on units Bayer had not eliminated.</p>

				<p>I assumed the VGHF would release the results of their work when it was ready, so for most of 2022 I focused on handling hardware I currently had access to: the Advance Movie Adapter, the GBA Jukebox, the Magical Watch, and some other odds and ends. As 2023 rolled around, I was beginning to get a bit nervous, however. My infamous <em>Triforce of Terror</em> was basically all that was left when it came to emulating everything on the GBA. Both the Play-Yan and the Campho Advance were being reverse-engineered and documented quite thoroughly. The Glucoboy remained the only one left behind in terms of research, since I had nothing to work with. Truth be told, the Glucoboy was one of the hardest chapters to write in my book, <em>Peripheral Vision</em>, given the relative lack of materials. I started to wonder if we'd ever see any meaningful progress on digitally preserving one of the oddest Game Boy cartridges ever made.</p>

				<p>Thankfully, right at the end of May that year, the VGHF shared the fruits of their labor. As I understand it, they had an evaluation unit of the Glucoboy in their possession, and they wanted to determine whether or not it was the same as what was sold in stores. That is to say, everything had to be checked out and authenticated. Real preservation work requires some amount of investigation, after all. While the wait was a bit worrisome on my end, I do appreciate being thorough and meticulous. At any rate, at long last, a fully functional ROM for the Glucoboy was available. Someone had helpfully uploaded it to the Internet Archive for all to access, and now I could keep my promise and get this thing emulated.</p>

					<img src="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/gluco_02.png" alt="Glucoboy PCB">
				</p>
				<p>It took quite a long time for someone to finally get a hold of the Glucoboy, but somehow they managed.</p>

				<p>Before getting into the process of dissecting and analyzing the ROM, I'd like to take a moment to talk about a serious subject concerning video game preservation. For every single <em>Edge of Emulation</em> article so far, I've always had the required materials on hand. No matter how rare or exotic, I managed to grab a copy myself, and in some cases I've been able to rely on cooperation from others online. The Glucoboy was an entirely different case. Procuring it for any sort of testing was likely beyond me, so I couldn't just go on and make my own dump. I'd have to rely on *gasp* <em>downloading a ROM from the internet</em>. Now, personally, I don't find anything morally wrong about doing that. It's not like I'm trying to sell a bundle of ROMs on some cheap Android TV stick or something to make a quick buck. There's a valid educational and academic purpose here: to document how the Glucoboy works and ensure emulators can preserve that experience long after the hardware disappears.</p>

				<p>Sadly, copyright and intellectual property laws (at least in the U.S.) are pretty inflexible on the matter. While it seems clear to those of us involved with video game preservation that people should have access to older works for research, downloading ROMs in such cases has not been proven Fair Use in any court over here. Ideally, we'd have something like a digital library where validated users are granted access to preserved game data. When I was in college, I remember getting blanket authorization to tons of pay-walled papers and databases simply by being a university student, so I see no reason why something similar shouldn't exist for other published media. Why even stop at video games too? Let movies and music in there as well.</p>

				<p>Of course, that's not the world we live in. Far too many companies are preoccupied with wringing every last (mostly imaginary) dollar and cent out of their inventory, even if their stuff was published 10, 25, or 50 years ago. The very thought of losing any "potential profit" sends every bean-counting suit with an MBA into a cold sweat, probably. It's an industry-wide attitude that favors maximum money above all else, even common sense. There's no indication that giving researchers access to older video games would mean companies would see a sudden drop in revenue. Most of these games are available secondhand, meaning no money would get transferred to Giant Media Corps anyway. And in the case that a game is rare and expensive on the used market, researchers have been able to turn to "unauthorized copies" of games since, well, forever. Even so, groups like the Electronic Software Association have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/why-game-archivists-are-dreading-this-months-3ds-wii-u-eshop-shutdown/">fought against DMCA exemptions for remote access to archived games.</a></p>

				<p>With the Glucoboy, we have a situation where someone is trying to study the hardware and software to keep its history alive. There's no way I'd be able to get my hands on this thing any time soon, so remote access, such as getting a copy through the Internet Archive or some other repository, would be a great way to achieve this. Regrettably, the law doesn't allow for that, and some folks with the ESA think that would lead to undue piracy (ignoring the fact that undue piracy happens elsewhere all the time). It would be great to have a legit means of probing the Glucoboy, but copyright, particularly the DMCA, is rigid over here, and companies always got money on their mind. Nevertheless, I'm simply not willing to let the Glucoboy fade away into obscurity, so for me there was only one thing to do. I'm sure everyone can guess what that was.</p>

				<p><strong>A Routine Proceedure</strong></p>

				<p>Moving on, with the Glucoboy software on hand, I started digging into the mysteries contained within. The first order of business was to just see what happened when my emulator tried to run it. Much to my relief, the Glucoboy booted with no issues. There's always the chance that such devices may require emulation of large portions of the hardware in order to display any graphical output. The Advance Movie Adapter was perhaps the most notorious example of that kind of behavior. Thankfully, that was not the case this time. Eventually after a few company logos, the Glucoboy came to a screen waiting for user input. Upon pressing the Start button, the Glucoboy tried to retrieve something called <strong>Glucose Reward Points</strong> or more simply known as <strong>GRPs</strong>. These points were given to children when they regularly tested their glucose levels and stayed within acceptable ranges. GRPs acted as a sort of in-game currency that could only be gained through a healthy lifestyle.</p>

				<p><img src="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/gluco_04.png" alt="Glucoboy Screen Reading GRPs"></p>
				<p>Although any GBA emulator could boot the Glucoboy, none handled the process of reading GRPs.</p>

				<p>By some unknown means, the Glucoboy was trying to access some kind of data. At this stage of the reverse-engineering process, I had no idea what it was doing. At any rate, the Glucoboy returned an error after a few moments, as nothing was properly emulated. Even so, the software let me access the main menu where I could create a character and start exploring the actual game. Players would find themselves in a bedroom with an arcade machine, a game console, and a poster of a clown. These contained 5 games in all. Lost Star Saga was a full-fledged sci-fi RPG, while Knock'em Downs was a top-down carnival-themed action game; these 2 comprised the bulk of the Glucoboy's entertainment. The other 3 were shorter minigames. Solar Wing was a horizontal shooter, Plexus was similar to Breakout, and Raccoon Rancher was a puzzle where players had to separate raccoons with a controllable fence. Yeah, that last one is... it's definitely different, and surprisingly challenging.</p>

				<p>

					<img src="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/gluco_07.png" alt="Raccoon Rancher">
				</p>
				<p>The Glucoboy didn't skimp on gaming, offering children a wide variety of options to choose from. Everything's pretty fun to play.</p>

				<p>When starting a fresh new game, only Knock'em Downs was initially unlocked. The other 4 required players to accumulate and spend GRPs. Unfortunately, GRPs were not immediately available without emulating the hardware. At first glance, it may seem like these games are lost to us unless we know how the Glucoboy really works. However, the save data in EEPROM can easily be hacked to give players free GRPs. Additionally, editing values in RAM via cheat codes can achieve a similar effect. Last but not least, there is a legit way to earn GRPs without emulating the Glucoboy or using hacks. Every so often, if the player idles in the bedroom for a while, a brief 3-choice quiz will pop up. These are always related to diabetes, such as best practices for maintaining good glucose levels to trivia such as which pop stars and movie celebs (circa 2007 anyway) were diabetic. Each quiz nets the user a small amount of points. Using an emulator's turbo/unlocked speed mode and save states, anyone can gather points in a reasonable timeframe.</p>

				<p>Given all of that, the Glucoboy's games were readily accessible. Still, emulating the Glucoboy would ensure that no one needed to resort to such measures. It was time to take a closer look at how the software interfaced with the hardware to obtain GRPs. Going back to the screen where the Glucoboy tried to read GRPs, I used my emulator, GBE+, to scan for any suspicious addresses read from or written to. There only seemed to be one located at <code>0xE000000</code>. At first it wrote the value <strong>0x00</strong> to this location, perhaps as a means of resetting some of the Glucoboy's hardware. Then it wrote the value <strong>0x20</strong> and... did absolutely nothing else. This kind of set off a few alarms in my head. Some kind of I/O was being written, but nothing was being read. The Glucoboy couldn't get any GRPs if it wasn't reading anything. My immediate hypothesis was that the Glucoboy was waiting for something, some kind of signal, maybe an interrupt... generated by the cartridge...</p>

				<p>At first I didn't want to believe it. This was the work of my most feared enemy: the Game Pak Interrupt. As I explained previously in my last article about the Play-Yan, Game Pak interrupts basically give the cartridge free license to do all sorts of things. The conditions for triggering that interrupt could be anything. The cartridge could expect various bits of data before or after a Game Pak interrupt fires. It's just one giant headache if you're trying to figure out how a piece of hardware works, especially when there's zero documentation on hand. I manually confirmed that the Glucoboy used Game Pak interrupts by looking at what interrupts the software had enabled, and sure enough there it was. To say the least, I was prepared for a long, hard fight.</p>

				<p>Fortunately, that fight never came! The Glucoboy uses Game Pak interrupts in a very simple way. Essentially, any time the software reads or write to <code>0xE000000</code>, it waits for a Game Pak interrupt. The interrupt itself seems to alert the game code when the cartridge is ready to send or receive data. It's completely different from the Play-Yan, and it's about as basic as you can make something like this. I was able to breathe a sigh of relief and reclaim a small fraction of my remaining sanity.</p>

				<p>With the Game Pak interrupt out of the way, I quickly hacked together some code in GBE+ that would allow it to process those IRQs whenever. After this, I let the Glucoboy run on its own to see what kinds of reads and writes it made. Altogether, the software accessed <code>0xE000000</code> over 120 times, but no other memory location was ever touched. It appeared that all data going in or coming out of the Glucoboy was restricted to a single I/O register. Typically I would have expected more, but sometimes it's just easier to design and develop hardware like this. In any case, it vastly simplfied emulation as well. I decided to name this register <strong>GLUCO_CNT</strong>, short for Glucoboy Control.</p>

				<p>There was an immediate and obvious pattern to the reads/writes to <strong>GLUCO_CNT</strong>. The Glucoboy would always write an 8-bit number, then it would read either 4 times or just once. Those 8-bit numbers looked to be some sort of index, a value that the Glucoboy would receive when it was supposed to lookup specific data. For example, if the software wanted to read back the player's current GRPs, it would use one index. Other data, such as the player's current streak of days with healthy glucose level, would use a different index. The data stored in each index was evidently either 32-bit or 8-bit, which explained why the Glucoboy did 4 reads or 1 read. After all of these reads and writes, the main game never touched <strong>GLUCO_CNT</strong> at all. Whatever data the Glucoboy wanted, it was grabbed shortly after boot. The question now was what did each index represent?</p>

				<p><img src="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/gluco_08.png" alt="Sample Data Logs"></p>
				<p>A sample of the initial data logs for <strong>GLUCO_CNT</strong>. The function of each index was unknown.</p>

				<p><strong>Clinical Trial and Error</strong></p>

				<p>It was time to break out one of my favorite tools when working with software: the old spray and pray methodology! The idea here was to change values randomly and see how that affected the game. For this operation, I only had to focus on each index. When the Glucoboy requested an index's data, I returned whatever number I could smash on a keyboard, then observed how that changed anything when running the software. The first 3 indices I tried manipulating didn't seem to do anything at all, no matter what I changed them to read. Strangely, I tracked where those values were stored in RAM, and the Glucoboy seemed to ignore them entirely. They weren't used or referenced in any capacity.</p>

				<p>This was quite curious behavior, but I reasoned that it was probably reading data from the Glucoboy that wasn't relevant to any actual gameplay. It was potentially reading data like the real-time clock, which the Glucoboy only used internally to make sure blood testing was done frequently. The game itself only needed to know if GRPs were rewarded, and if so how much. There was also the possibility that it was reading old debug information that was necessary during development, but for a retail release it was non-essential data. In any case, I had no idea what those mysterious indices did because they had no visible impact on the software.</p>

				<p>Fortunately, the next series of indices were used by the game. Altogether, there were only 4 indices that the Glucoboy really cared about. <strong>Daily GRPs Earned</strong> represented the amount of GRPs earned for a given day after the player had tested themselves. <strong>Bonus GRPs Earned</strong> was an extra amount of GRPs earned for consecutive days of maintaining good glucose levels. <strong>Current Number of Good Days</strong> was the number of days the player had maintained this good streak. <strong>Number of Good Days Until Bonus Rewarded</strong> was the remaining days players needed to maintain a streak until they got a bonus. These values could all be checked in-game when the player moved to a piggy bank in their virtual bedroom. When testing various values, this feature made it clear which indices controlled which properties.</p>

				<p>All of these indices were 32-bit, so they could contain some fairly large numbers. The Glucoboy's software treated them as signed values, and it only registered positive values. The maximum allowed for each category was <strong>2147483647</strong>. Imagine playing with the Glucoboy for so long that you managed to maintain a streak of... 5.8 million years of healthy glucose levels! Can't wait to see someone do a "Let's Play" of that! Those 8-bit indices, however, seemed to have a completely different purpose. As far as I could tell, they acted as binary flags. Any non-zero value caused the Glucoboy to freeze when reading <strong>GLUCO_CNT</strong> and eventually return an error after timing out. Whatever they were, these indices had to hold a value of zero, otherwise it would abort reading GRPs altogether.</p>

				<p>The last index was also a bit of a puzzle. Unlike the others, the Glucoboy actually wrote data to it instead of reading from it. The Glucoboy wrote 6 bytes every time, and all in all, it accessed this index 10 times. I had no clue what the Glucoboy would need with all of that input. Nevertheless, the Glucoboy never actually read data from that index, so it basically had no effect on the software. It felt as if half of the Glucoboy's indices weren't being used at all. I questioned just how much data really wasn't useful for the main game, or how much debug information had been dropped. I couldn't do much about it as I didn't have the hardware in front of me.</p>

				<p>However, I had finally discovered exactly how the Glucoboy read and used GRPs. This was the most important information, after all. With that, an emulator could artificially generate as many GRPs as the player wants. It could dole out points like candy and instantly unlock every game in one fell swoop. With <strong>2 billion</strong> GRPs on hand, players could also buy as many in-game items as they wanted. Now, all of this looks like cheating (and, well, it is), but it's also breaking down barriers so people can easily experience the Glucoboy's games. The key thing here is that the glucose testing hardware is no longer required, so current and future gamers can understand what it was like playing masterpieces like Raccoon Rancher. For preservationists and video game historians, the Glucoboy becomes much more accessible to study, analyze, and comment on. And last but not least, everyone gains a bit more insight on the hardware itself.</p>

				<p>Knowing how the GRPs worked, I quickly implemented a way for GBE+ to insert its own values from the user. By reading data from its .ini configuration file, GBE+ could put any value it wanted in the four indices mentioned above. In doing so, the Glucoboy was now technically emulated! Players had full control of their GRPs and could explore everything the Glucoboy had to offer. Overall, the whole process was incredibly straightforward as far as reverse-engineering goes. There weren't many surprises. It only took me a couple of hours over the course of 3 days to get everything in GBE+ setup. It was one of the easiest and fastest projects I'd worked on. Even so, it was kind of huge relief. Cartridges with special hardware can often be absolute nightmares. I anticipated a long, hard battle with the Glucoboy, but everything went very well. To see one of the last undocumented GBA cartridges fall so quickly and smoothly felt great. Sometimes you just don't want to deal with overly complicated devices and take a nice, enjoyable win.</p>

				<p>With literal <em>billions</em> of GRPs at our disposal, we could buy everything and anything in-game.</p>

				<p><strong>Remission and Relapse</strong></p>

				<p>Even though the basics of the Glucoboy were now emulated, I still couldn't help but feel there should have been more to its story. For something that had proved so elusive, I figured it would at least have some more secrets left inside. As one of the infamous members of the <strong>Triforce of Terror</strong>, I expected a bit more intrigue. It was rather anticlimatic, honestly. There just had to be something more...</p>

				<p>Of course, there were plenty of unknown indices. Their purpose remained obscure and inscrutable. The Glucoboy's software treated them as if they didn't exist at all after accessing them. Not knowing what they were supposed to do bothered me. It meant that, even though the peripheral worked via emulation, there were still elements of its hardware that we simply didn't understand, details that might disappear if all the world's Glucoboys ever stopped working. To me, it were as if the job was only half-finished. But how exactly would I be able to probe these unknown indices without having a Glucoboy myself? The software was my only guide, and it revealed nothing, or so it seemed at first.</p>

				<p>Some months after I had added support for the Glucoboy in GBE+, I returned to my research and decided to take a peek at the ROM. Out of curiosity, I ran the <code>strings</code> Linux command on the Glucoboy's ROM. This command pulled every identifiable ASCII string from the file; I redirected its output to a text file for further analysis. Looking through a binary file's strings is often a good way at piecing together a bunch of clues about the software that might otherwise remain hidden. On many occassions, strings will be labels for text and menus, or even messages used for debugging. It can expose a lot of internal naming schemes that may go unused or unnoticed when actually running the game. When looking for tips about how certain software functions, its a good first step.</p>

				<p>Now, pulling ASCII strings isn't perfect. The technique doesn't distinguish what's a real word versus random bytes that happen to map out to readable ASCII characters. So while it can find strings like <strong>"GLUCOBOY"</strong>, it also finds garbage data like <strong>"Mhyhp(y(phzhq(z(qi{ir({(r"</strong>. All of the strings require manual review to determine what's nonsense and what's actually noteworthy. There's no guarantee that anything useful will turn up, but unless that data is checked, no one will ever know. I started skimming over dozens and dozens of lines in the text file holding the strings. Most of it was useless noise, but I soon found something that really captured my eye.</p>

				<p>There was a group of readable strings with values such as <strong>"CLEAR REG"</strong>, <strong>"WRITE REG"</strong>, and <strong>"READ REG"</strong>. I assumed they were all in reference to memory-mapped registers or something along those lines. It seemed to hint at some sort of hardware behavior, and by the looks of all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf">printf</a> type fields like <code>%d</code>, <code>%s</code>, and <code>%x</code>, I guessed these strings were used for debugging. More importantly, however, I stumbled upon the following list:</p>

				<p><code>DATE</code></p>
				<p><code>FLAGS</code></p>
				<p><code>SERIAL</code></p>
				<p><code>DAILY POINT</code></p>
				<p><code>BONUS POINT</code></p>
				<p><code>GOOD DAYS</code></p>
				<p><code>DAYS LEFT</code></p>
				<p><code>LD THRESH</code></p>
				<p><code>GAME STATS</code></p>

				<p>Now, the ones like <strong>"DAILY POINT"</strong> and <strong>"BONUS POINT"</strong> referenced the same indices I had previously studied, the ones the Glucoboy used to read GRPs, bonuses, and calculate when to reward bonuses. The rest of the stuff, however, I had no idea what they were. My first thoughts were that they corresponded with the unused indices from the Glucoboy's boot process. These same strings appeared together again in the Glucoboy's ROM, further reinforcing this theory.</p>

				<p><code>System Date</code></p>
				<p><code>Hardware Flags</code></p>
				<p><code>Serial Number</code></p>
				<p><code>Daily Points</code></p>
				<p><code>Bonus Points</code></p>
				<p><code>Good Days</code></p>
				<p><code>Days Left</code></p>
				<p><code>LD Threshold</code></p>
				<p><code>Game Stats</code></p>

				<p>So, it seemed that those other indices were reserved for information such as the Glucoboy's RTC, some flags indicating the status of various bits of the Glucoboy's hardware, a serial number, some sort of threshold, and something else related to gameplay statistics. While it was nice to have some labels to attach to these previously unnamed indices, there was no information on what those values did or what sort of format they were expected to have. For example, the System Date was a simple 32-bit number, but how did that translate into an actual measurement of time? Was it a Unix timestamp, or something else entirely? What was the valid range of years (2000 to 2099, or 2000 to 3000, or 2000 to 2030)? Did it take just a calendar date, or did it also include details like hours, minutes, and seconds? And which bits affected which categories?</p>

				<p>Once again, these types of questions would be readily answered by probing the hardware itself. Since that's not an option, the software has to act as a blueprint. However, it wasn't clear that the software made use of these indices in any capacity. With the presence of these strings though, I suspected that there had to be some debugging code left behind by the developers. It was possible that the strings simply hadn't been deleted but the actual code was long removed. The only way to know for sure was to dive into the ROM and look at where the strings were located.</p>

				<p>Thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghidra">Ghidra</a>, a tool capable of picking apart all manner of binary blobs and analyzing their programming, I was able to track down the exact spot where the strings occurred as well as the code that used them. After briefly skimming through a few instructions, I saw that my assumptions were correct. The code here was used for debugging! This part of the Glucoboy's ROM would write to <strong>GLUCO_CNT</strong> to access a specific index, then read/display the 32-bit contents of that index. For an index like the System Date, it seemed to handle converting that value into a calendar date as well.</p>

				<p>This progress proved most welcome, as I now technically had all the information regarding how each index was used. Even so, I wanted to go even further. The debug menu seemed completely intact inside the Glucoboy's ROM. Unfortunately, there didn't appear to be any easy way to access it. If I could reach the debug menu, I'd have a way to actually test and verify these indices once emulated in GBE+. It would avoid the awkward situation of trying to implement something but having no means to ensure its correctness. Plus, as a fan of websites like <a href="https://tcrf.net/The_Cutting_Room_Floor">The Cutting Room Floor</a>, I've always wanted to uncover something buried away in a game.</p>

				<p>Although the debug menu didn't look accessible under normal conditions, there had to be a way to trick or force the ROM to start executing its code. For this task, Ghidra provided a lot of support. The first step was to find out if the debug menu was completely isolated or if it was linked to other sections of code. If the former case were true, that meant that the debug menu had basically been stripped from the main program and it was just hanging out in ROM by itself. Accessing the menu would be quite troublesome then, as all the variables it needed to run would have to be hacked into place somehow. If the latter case were true, I just had to find some existing codepath that eventually executed the debug menu, and hopefully the rest of the Glucoboy's code would handle any variables as expected.</p>

				<p>Luckily, the debug menu was connected to another function within the Glucoboy. Better yet, this function was connected to another one, and another one, and another one. I followed this chain until I reached an area of code that the Glucoboy ran periodically, once per frame. So, the debug menu was reachable under the right conditions. The next step was figuring out how to go from the Glucoboy's main loop all the way down to the debug menu. Once again, Ghidra made this work feasible, as it allowed me to jump across sections of code with a single click. I had hoped that I'd need only change a single variable at startup to enable the debug menu, but I couldn't find such a mechanism. Instead, it looked like I had to alter a total of 4 variables sometime after boot. As long as they held the correct values, the debug menu should have popped up. Below is a chart of the memory locations in RAM along with the expected 8-bit data:</p>

				<p><code>0x200015E  =  0x09</code></p>
				<p><code>0x200015F  =  0x04</code></p>
				<p><code>0x2000160  =  0x02</code></p>
				<p><code>0x2000161  =  0x01</code></p>

				<p>GBE+ has a built-in debugger that allows the user to arbitrarily change any value in memory. After a bit of fiddling with that, I managed to make some text appear on-screen. The rest of the Glucoboy froze, but there it was definitely showing at least the first bits of the debug menu. I tried changing those 4 variables at different times during the startup process. If they were changed too soon, the Glucoboy only showed a black screen. If they were changed too late, sometimes fragments of text would appear, and sometimes nothing at all would show up. In all cases, the Glucoboy seemed to come to a halt. There was only one scenario where things actually worked: the brief period where the Glucoboy accessed <strong>GLUCO_CNT</strong> to read GRPs. Setting the 4 variables at that moment finally caused the debug menu to reveal itself, and this time nothing froze.</p>

				</p>
				<p>This debug menu was hidden away for the past 16 years.</p>

				<p>As I had hoped, the menu had the strings I had located earlier. Perhaps the most striking thing about the debug menu was that it referred to <strong>GLUCO_CNT</strong> as something else, <strong>MAGIC PORT</strong>. This was most likely the internal name used by the development team. The language makes sense, in that a single MMIO register is basically where all the "magic" happens on the Glucoboy. Although this tidbit had no real bearing on anything technical, it did offer some previously lost insight into the Glucoboy's history. Still, the real treasure trove was the debug menu itself.</p>

				<p>Sadly, the menu was not immediately usable. It was designed to read/write certain indices, but it got stuck in an infinite loop when trying to do either. Because I had bascially forced the menu to appear instead of taking its proper codepath, some things didn't quite act right. The issue here was related to one of the GBA's timer interrupts. After reading or writing to <strong>GLUCO_CNT</strong>, the Glucoboy was programmed to delay very briefly before moving on. This delay was measured precisely by the GBA's hardware timers. Interrupts from the timer alerted the CPU when a certain amount of cycles had passed. However, when executing my hack, all interrupts for the GBA's timers were disabled. When the Glucoboy ran code for the debug menu, it kept waiting for an event that never came.</p>

				<p>Rather than enable interrupts, I actually patched the ROM to avoid all timer-related code. Only a dozen 16-bit THUMB instructions had to be replaced. GBE+'s debugger can edit ROM values as well, so the patch was done in real-time. After eliminating timers from the debug menu, I gained full access to the Glucoboy's indices. As a result, I rapidly tested each one to figure out how they worked.</p>

				<p><strong>Medical Mysteries</strong></p>

				<p>There were several unknowns to investigate. I began at the top and made my way down. First was the System Date. This index was never used by the Glucoboy in-game, but the GBA could still read its value. The debug menu lets users pick a date, then it writes the equivalent 32-bit value to <strong>GLUCO_CNT</strong>. By playing around with some dates, I was able to see the minimum/maximum ranges for days, months, and years, and I could see which bits of the index were affected when changing the time. As it turns out, the Glucoboy handles minutes, hours, days, months, and years, but it does not provide an interface to read seconds. This is similar to the HuC-3 cartridge on the DMG/GBC. That level of granularity just isn't useful, I suppose.</p>

				<p>Next, I took a look at "Hardware Flags". This index used only a single byte's worth of data, despite being 32-bit in size. The debug menu displayed a total of 7 unique flags, all of which presumably held the status of various components within the Glucoboy. Hardware Flags presented some of the most fascinating and significant details about the Glucoboy, showing a side of the device that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. Each bit represented a different status using a <code><strong>0</strong></code> or a <code><strong>1</strong></code>. The list of flags was as follows:</p>

				<p><code>BIT 0 :: GMEM FAULT</code></p>
				<p><code>BIT 1 :: PMEM FAULT</code></p>
				<p><code>BIT 2 :: INCENTIVE</code></p>
				<p><code>BIT 3 :: PNEW STATS</code></p>
				<p><code>BIT 4 :: MEASUREMENT</code></p>
				<p><code>BIT 5 :: GMETER FAULT</code></p>
				<p><code>BIT 6 :: PMETER FAULT</code></p>

				<p>Most of it looks pretty obscure until one considers what sort of tasks a glucose meter needs in order to do its job. <strong>GMEM FAULT</strong> and <strong>PMEM FAULT</strong> looked to be flags about some kind of memory error. According to published articles when the Glucoboy was released, the cartridge was able to save somewhere between 400 to 500 blood testing results (the exact number varies based on the source). It makes sense that the Glucoboy would have the ability to check on it, since it seems like a pretty big error. But what do the "G" and "P" stand for? Most likely, they refer to memory used to save general glucose and postprandial glucose results. The latter are glucose results taken after a meal.</p>

				<p>The <strong>INCENTIVE</strong> flag seemed to reference the Glucoboy's proprietary method of determining how to best reward and encourage players to live as healthily as possible and keep their glucose levels in check. Paul Wessel did a lot of work tuning the Glucoboy's algorithms for handing out GRPs. While that exact formula is not found anywhere in the ROM, as far as I could tell, this flag seemed to indicate whether or not the player was fulfilling the Glucoboy's expectations. This flag would probably have changed depending on when players tested themselves.</p>

				<p><strong>PNEW STATS</strong> conceivably marked any time new postpandrial test results had occurred, thereby signaling to the Glucoboy to update any statistics relating to the user's performance in terms of healthy glucose levels. Basically, this flag probably told the Glucoboy to check to make sure the user was on track when new data was available. <strong>MEASUREMENT</strong> seemed much more straightforward; it simply told the Glucoboy whether or not a new measurement for blood glucose had been made, or something to that effect. <strong>GMETER FAULT</strong> and <strong>PMETER FAULT</strong> indicated whether or not there was some kind of error with the actual testing meters.</p>

				<p>Interestingly enough, although most of the System Flags involved serious hardware failures, the Glucoboy happily ignores them. Whether or not those flags are set, the Glucoboy goes in-game without so much as a warning to the user. As I mentioned earlier, the System Flags are only used in the debug menu. While some of the flags are not at all relevant for players to know, it seems like an oversight to not inform them about issues that might make the Glucoboy unusable. In any case, most of the interpretations of the System Flags are at best an educated guess. Despite being prone to diabetes myself due to heredity, I'm not exactly knowledgable about the disease and certainly not an expert on glucose meters. I could be completely off-target, but at least we have some new clues about what's going on inside the Glucoboy.</p>

				<p>Once finished with the System Flags, I turned to the "Serial Number" index. This looked easy enough to grasp. Every Glucoboy may have had its own identifiable serial number. It's hard to say exactly what the serial number looked like or how it was made. Perhaps it worked like the Game Boy Camera, which had 8-digit IDs randomly generated and saved to SRAM. Perhaps it was somehow hardcoded into a small component, similar to the 128-bit IDs used in SmartMedia cards. Without knowing more about how the Glucoboy was made, I can't provide a definitive answer. Given the debug menu's ability to write a new serial number, I'd say it's probably closer to the first scenario. What I did find out, however, was that the serial number was written in Base 10 instead of hexadecimal and had a range of <code>00000000</code> through <code>99999999</code>. Interestingly enough, the Glucoboy the VGHF obtained was an evaluation unit, and on the back it has a serial number that's also 8-digits long.</p>

				<p><img src="https://shonumi.github.io/articles/gluco_15.png" alt="Glucoboy Serial Number"></p>
				<p>A real example of the Glucoboy's serial number.</p><p>"LD Threshold" was more challenging to parse. Like the Serial Number, this index worked on Base 10 numbers and had the same minimum/maximum range for values. Its purpose was puzzling. As best as I could tell, one possible reading was "Low-Data Threshold", a number that represents the smallest amount of data that's useful for a given tool/system/process. It's like a cutoff value at which point the data is too small to be helpful and signifies it should probably be ignored. This is used frequently in areas like sampling. Now, the Glucoboy could get accurate test results from a surprisingly low amount of blood, but even it had limits. It stands to reason that LD Threshold was that sort of value.</p>

				<p>Finally, there was "Game Stats", which obviously stood for... Game Statistics. But what did that really mean? When accessing the Glucoboy's debug menu, selecting Game Stats brought up a list with various values displayed. Unlike the other indices in the debug menu, Game Stats could only be read, not written. Here are the items it displayed:</p>

				<p><code>VCSECS</code></p>
				<p><code>VCHIGH</code></p>
				<p><code>KDSECS</code></p>
				<p><code>KDHIGH</code></p>
				<p><code>SWSECS</code></p>
				<p><code>SWHIGH</code></p>
				<p><code>PLSECS</code></p>
				<p><code>PLHIGH</code></p>
				<p><code>RRSECS</code></p>
				<p><code>RRHIGH</code></p>

				<p>Once again, it's all very obscure at first glance. However, taking a moment to really look at the list, break it down, and think a little about it really makes things clearer. Consider that the first two characters of each string in the list is a reference to the Glucoboy's games. "KD" refers to <strong>K</strong>nock'em <strong>D</strong>owns, "RR" refers to <strong>R</strong>accoon <strong>R</strong>ancher, "PL" refers to <strong>Pl</strong>exus, and "SW" refers to <strong>S</strong>olar <strong>W</strong>ing. The only odd one is "VC" which seems to have no relation to Lost Star Saga. My bet is that VC might be the initials of the game's earlier working title that got changed at some point in development, or perhaps it was an internal codename.</p>

				<p>At any rate, the values seem pretty self-explanatory. Each game has a high score and tracks the play time in seconds. This is the same index that I observed being written 10 times when the Glucoboy booted. Unsurprisingly, there are 10 pieces of data the index can retrieve. As best as I could tell, the game records this information as part of a save data file, stored on the cartridge's EEPROM. It's updated as the player progresses through their games. When turning on the Glucoboy, it grabs data from EEPROM and sends it back to the Glucoboy. Essentially, a copy of the most recent Game Stats is transferred to the Glucoboy every time it starts up. Exactly why the Glucoboy needs Game Stats at all isn't certain. It could have very well been used as input data for the Glucoboy when calculating how many GRPs to rewards players.</p>

				<p>Each entry in Game Stats was just an unsigned 32-bit number. For whatever reason, when writing to this index, a special 16-bit number has to be sent first before 32-bit contents. There's no evidence of what that 16-bit number does, but it was a constant value of <code>0x3000</code>. Perhaps a different number would affect some other operation? Additionally, it appeared that reading and writing were done sequentially. That is to say, to change the value of <code>RRSECS</code>, the other previous 8 entries had to be written first. Strangely, the debug menu not only doesn't write to Game Stats, it just reads the current values from EEPROM.</p>

				<p>That pretty much covers everything I managed to learn from the debug menu. The last useful information I gleaned was that technically reading data used one set of indices, while writing used a completely different. For example, when the Glucoboy wanted to read the System Date, it used the 8-bit index <code>0x20</code>. When the Glucoboy wanted to write the System Date, it would use the index <code>0x60</code> instead. All in all, the debug menu provided a glimpse into the Glucoboy that no one (aside from the original developers) previously had before. Thanks to a few bytes of code and a pile of strings, we were able to unmask many of its innermost secrets.</p>

				<p><strong>Road to Recovery</strong></p>

				<p>Overall, I found my time with the Glucoboy both exciting and satisfying. Even though it was easy to emulate at first, I was actually rather happy to find out there was more to the device. With its debug menu, I was able to emulate parts of the Glucoboy few had ever known about. GBE+, for example, uses the host PC's clock when reading the System Date. These don't affect the actual gaming side of the Glucoboy, but it's very nice for the sake of completeness. I was also thrilled that finally, after many, many long years, the Glucoboy had been digitally preserved. It always seemed like such a monumental task, given how scarce the hardware was. Now, however, the job is done.</p>

				<p>The Glucoboy was a very intriguing chapter for Nintendo. It officially marked the last time any Game Boy received specialty hardware licensed or approved by the company. No more crazy cartridges, no more freaky peripherals, and no more exotic accessories. By late 2007, the DS was dominating the mobile video game market. Developers were turning their attention to this platform, and in doing so they began making brand new products. Pianos, guitars, wireless keyboards, pedometers, motion controls, video cameras, TV tuners, rumble paks, card scanners, and much more. While the Glucoboy was the end of the Game Boy's impressive 18 years of innovation, that same spirit persisted, extending into the next generation of handhelds. What started in 1989 with the original DMG-01 and its humble Link Cable continued well into 2010 and beyond.</p>

				<p>As far as I'm concerned, that's case-closed for the Glucoboy. Maybe one day we'll be able to emulate the entire device on a low-level and require actual blood samples from the user! For now, I think it's well enough to generate the GRPs via high-level emulation. We also came away with some pretty solid hardware documentation, which is always great. Another foe from the <strong>Triforce of Terror</strong> has fallen. The Play-Yan is mostly a done deal, with only audio/video output needed. Its cousin, the Nintendo MP3 Player, is slowly but surely cracking as well. The Glucoboy, possibly the most evasive of the trio, has been vanquished. Only one villain yet remains undispatched: the conniving Campho Advance. With a seemingly undumpable ROM, an extremely rare cartridge, and a complex architecture capable of video transmissions over landlines, the Campho Advance poses one of the most challenging obstacles to fully preserving the entire Game Boy Advance library. Will the heroes succeed in their mission, or will the Campho Advance prove too much for them? Find out in the next episode of <strong>Edge of Emulation</strong>!</p>

In 2024 the OpenWrt project turns 20 years! Let's celebrate this 
anniversary by launching our own first and fully upstream supported 
hardware design.

If the community likes the idea outlined below in greater details, we 
would like to start a vote.

---

The idea

It is not new. We first spoke about this during the OpenWrt Summits in 
2017 and also 2018. It became clear start of December 2023 while 
tinkering with Banana Pi style devices that they are already pretty 
close to what we wanted to achieve in ’17/‘18. Banana PIs have grown in 
popularity within the community. They boot using a self compiled Trusted 
Firmware-A (TF-A)and upstream U-Boot (thx MTK/Daniel) and some of the 
boards are already fully supported by the upstream Linux kernel. The 
only nonopen sourcecomponents are the 2.5 GbE PHYandWi-Fi firmware 
blobsrunning on separate cores that areindependent of the main SoC 
running Linuxand the DRAM calibration routines which are executed early 
during boot.

I contacted three project members (pepe2k, dangole, nbd) on December 6th 
to outline the overall idea. We went over several design proposals, At 
the beginning we focused on the most powerful (and expensive) 
configurations possible but finally ended up with something rather 
simple and above all,feasible. We would like to propose the following as 
our "first" community driven HW platform called "OpenWrt One/AP-24.XY".

Together with pepe2k (thx a lot) I discussed this for many hours and we 
worked out the following project proposal. Instead of going insane with 
specifications, we decided to include some nice features we believe all 
OpenWrt supported platforms should have (e.g. being almost 
unbrickablewith multiple recovery options, hassle-free system console 
access, on-board RTC with battery backup etc.).

This is our first design, so let's KiSS!


Hardwarespecifications:

* SOC: MediaTek MT7981B
* Wi-Fi: MediaTek MT7976C (2x2 2.4 GHz + 3x3/2x2 + zero-wait DFS 5Ghz)
* DRAM: 1 GiB DDR4
* Flash: 128 MiB SPI NAND+ 4 MiB SPI NOR
* Ethernet: 2x RJ45 (2.5 GbE + 1 GbE)
* USB (host): USB 2.0 (Type-A port)
* USB (device, console): Holtek HT42B534-2 UART to USB (USB-C port)
* Storage: M.2 2042 for NVMe SSD (PCIe gen 2 x1)
* Buttons: 2x (reset + user)
* Mechanical switch: 1x for boot selection (recovery, regular)
* LEDs: 2x (PWM driven), 2x ETH Led (GPIO driven)
* External hardware watchdog: EM Microelectronic EM6324 (GPIO driven)
* RTC: NXP PCF8563TS (I2C) with battery backup holder(CR1220)
* Power: USB-PD-12V on USB-C port (optional802.3at/afPoE via RT5040 module)
* Expansion slots: mikroBUS
* Certification: FCC/EC/RoHS compliance
* Case: PCB size is compatible to BPi-R4 and the case design can be re-used
* JTAG for main SOC: 10-pin 1.27 mm pitch (ARM JTAG/SWD)
* Antenna connectors: 3x MMCX for easy usage, assembly and durability
* Schematics: these will be publicly available (license TBD)
* GPL compliance: 3b. "Accompany it with a written offer ... to give any 
third party ... a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding 
source code"
* Price: aiming for below 100$


How will the device be distributed?

OpenWrt itself cannot handle this for a ton of reasons. This is why we 
spoke with the SFC early. The idea is that BPi will distribute the 
device using the already established channels and for every device sold 
a donation will be made to ourSFC earmarked fund for OpenWrt. This money 
can then be used to cover hosting expenses or maybe an OpenWrt summit.

SFC is committed to working with us in various ways on this project — 
including making sure OpenWrt'strademark is properly respected, that 
this router isabeautiful example of excellent GPL/LGPL compliance, 
andthatthis becomes a great promotional opportunity for our project and 
FOSS generally!


FAQ

* Why are there are 2 different flash chips?
- the idea is to make the device (almost!) unbrickable and very easy to 
recover
- NAND will hold the main loader (U-Boot) and the Linux image and will 
be the default boot device
- NOR will be write-protected by default (with WP jumper available on 
the board) and will hold a recovery bootloader (and other essential 
data, like Wi-Fi calibration)
- a dedicated boot select switch will allow changing between NOR and NAND

* What will the M.2 slot be used for?
- we will use M.2 with M-key for NVMe storage. There is a 
work-in-progress patch to make PCIe work inside the U-Boot bootloader. 
This will allow booting other Linux distributions such as Debian and 
Alpine directly from NVMe

* Why is there no USB 3.x host port on the device?
- the USB 3.x and PCIe buses are shared in the selected SoC silicon, 
hence only a single High-Speed USB port is available

* What is the purpose of the console USB-C port?
- Holtek UART to USB bridge with CDC-ACM support on USB-C makes the 
device ultra easy to communicate with. No extra hardware or drivers will 
be required. Android for example has CDC-ACM support enabled by default

* What MAC OUI will the device have?
- we plan to register an OUI block for OpenWrt which can also be used 
for other vendor extensions such as Wi-Fi beacon IEs

* What is the purpose of the mikroBUS connector?
- mikroBUS was chosen as we wanted to make the hardware extendable. 
There are dedicated pins for UART, SPI, I2C buses and RST/INT signals. 
The standard uses regular 2.54 mm pitch connectors (you can use 
available mikroBUS modules or just connect to it something else, with 
2.54 mm jumper cables)

 &nbsp;* Why have the RTC on board instead of a mikroBUS module?
 &nbsp;- we believe there are many things a Wi-Fi (or networking in general) 
device should have on-board by default. Always having a correct time on 
the device is crucial in many applications, like VPN, DNSSEC, …


Timeline of events leading up to this e-mail

Forgive us for the lack of public communication during the initial 
phase(which as you can see was short and quick). We wanted to ensure 
that this project is feasible before disclosing it to the community. It 
would be a real shame if we announced something that we later found out 
to not be feasible thus failing expectations raised within the community.

03.12 - initial idea
06.12 - ping pepe2k, dangole, nbd
07.12 - ping MediaTek and ask if this sounds doable
08.12 - ping jow, Hauke
08.12 - request for call with SFC, we want them involved as soon as possible
09.12 - MediaTek replies and says they can help
09.12 - ping apacar, ynezz, dwmm2, lynxis, rsalvaterra
12.12 - MediaTek spoke with Banana Pi, they also like the idea
18.12 - call with SFC (Hauke joined, we found no prior slot to talk)
20.12 - started writing the U-Boot PCIe driver, made recovery from USB 
and android fastboot recovery work.
... and then the end of year celebrations started and not much happened 
for 2 weeks.

			<p>Juniper Networks to Combine with HPE: Accelerating AI-Native Networking Leadership</p>
							
			</div>
	<div>

		<p>Juniper Networks was born just as the Internet was about to explode. And in many ways, the Internet would not be what it is today without Juniper.</p>
<p>I joined this company as a junior engineer in the 90’s. Together with a small team, we invented a new breed of router that helped the internet scale, enabled the dot-com boom and spurred innovation like the world had never seen.&nbsp;Since then, embracing change, disrupting the status quo and solving the hard problems that arise in every new technology shift have been firmly embedded in our DNA.</p>
<p>Now, AI is here. And it’s here in a big way. I believe it’s the biggest inflection since the dawn of the Internet itself – with implications for how we live, work and play, as well as the technology we make.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, Juniper started taking steps to capture the opportunity. With leading AIOps, we reduced manual work, sped deployments and crushed time-consuming trouble tickets for our customers. We have shifted the perception of what a network can and should be – and have seen great success. In fact, revenue from our products that leverage this AI have grown nearly 100% year-over-year for the last two reported quarters. And we’re starting to see early momentum from our investments in enabling and automating AI data centers, including those handling emerging AI training and inference models.</p>
<p>At Juniper, “AI” stands for “All In.”</p>
<p>And we recognize that taking full advantage of a once-in-a-generation opportunity requires that we continue to make <strong>big</strong> and <strong>bold</strong> moves to truly go all in on AI.</p>
<p>That is why I’m so excited that we have <a href="https://newsroom.juniper.net/news/news-details/2024/HPE-to-Acquire-Juniper-Networks-to-Accelerate-AI-Driven-Innovation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">entered into a definitive agreement for HPE to acquire Juniper</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogs.juniper.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Web-Graphic-1c_wline-1200-x-675-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://blogs.juniper.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Web-Graphic-1c_wline-1200-x-675-1.jpg 1200w, https://blogs.juniper.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Web-Graphic-1c_wline-1200-x-675-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blogs.juniper.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Web-Graphic-1c_wline-1200-x-675-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.juniper.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Web-Graphic-1c_wline-1200-x-675-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p>
<p>This combination will supercharge our offerings in AI-native networking. Together, we will accelerate innovation at every layer: compute, storage and networking; silicon, systems and software; campus and branch, data center and the wide area network.</p>
<p>This combination with HPE is expected to enable us to deliver more comprehensive, more competitive, truly end-to-end experience-first AI-native solutions.<span size="3"></span></p><p><span size="3">
<ul>
<li><strong>End-to-end secure and assured connectivity</strong> including WLAN, Wired, secure SD-WAN, network access control, location services and cloud delivered security with leading Mist AIOps that gives enterprise the flexibility to embrace AI and cloud at their own pace based on business objectives. Furthermore, customers will be able to embrace SASE and Zero Trust architectures.</li>
<li><strong>Differentiated network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering</strong> By bringing together HPE GreenLake with the unique AI capabilities of Juniper’s Mist, the combined company will have an incredibly exciting ability to offer NaaS to our customers in a very comprehensive way.</li>
<li><strong>AI Data Center </strong>with comprehensive and data center solutions including compute, storage, and networking. HPE brings years of experience in high-performance computing, including interconnect technologies like Slingshot, liquid cooling solutions and GPU servers that all apply to the current AI data center revolution. By combining with our intent-based automation solution Apstra that has already been simplifying customers’ DC operations around the world, and our QFX switches and PTX series routers, we will be positioned to be a pioneer in the development of a comprehensive solution for customers building AI data centers.</li>
<li><strong>End-to-end Wide Area Networking</strong> portfolio to efficiently deploy automated networks across the core, edge and metro while assuring experiences. We have a strong base of service provider, cloud and enterprise WAN customers and we see a great opportunity to offer more extensive end-to-end solutions and expand our presence with these valued customers.</li>
</ul>
</span></p><p><span size="3"></span>So, make no mistake – this is not just a bet for the enterprise segment. This combination is expected to dramatically increase the global footprint and reach across ALL customer verticals, including cloud, service provider and enterprise. This reach provides us with the ability to collect, protect, analyze and act on much deeper aggregated telemetry across a broader installed base, which will seek to drive even better end-user experiences and streamlined network operations.</p>
<p>HPE is a values-oriented and people-oriented company, like Juniper. In sharing a strong track record for sustainability, a focus on diversity and inclusion, and a deep-rooted passion for innovation, HPE is a natural partner for us in this next chapter.</p>
<p>I believe our spirit and drive that’s gotten us to this point will only strengthen now with HPE. As we enter our next era to continue building on our established position in AI-native networks, we will do so with a renewed sense of speed and scale to meet today’s evolving demands for network experiences.</p>
<p>The sky is the limit for all of us, and I’m so excited about what this next chapter with HPE will bring as we position ourselves as an industry leader together.</p>

<p><img alt="LINUX NETWORKING" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/linuxnetworking.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Beyond the usual new wired/wireless network hardware support and the other routine churn in the big Linux networking subsystem, the Linux 6.8 kernel is bringing some key improvements to the core networking code that can yield up to a ~40% improvement for TCP performance when encountering many concurrent network connections.
</p><p>
First up, there's been an analysis and reorganization of core networking structures. This effort has been around optimizing cacheline consumption and adding safeguards to ensure future changes don't regress. In turn this optimizing of core networking structures is causing TCP performance with many concurrent connections to increase by as much as 40% or more!
</p><p>
Coco Li of Google <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20231129072756.3684495-1-lixiaoyan@google.com/">explained</a> of their cachline optimization effort to the networking code:
</p><blockquote>"Currently, variable-heavy structs in the networking stack is organized chronologically, logically and sometimes by cache line access.
<p>
This patch series attempts to reorganize the core networking stack variables to minimize cacheline consumption during the phase of data transfer. Specifically, we looked at the TCP/IP stack and the fast path definition in TCP."</p></blockquote>
<p>Their results are mighty impressive for being done to the core networking code:
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2024&amp;image=linux_68_network" alt="Networking performance optimization"></p>
<p>A hell of an improvement especially for the AMD EPYC servers. Kudos to those at Google continuing to push these very enticing low-level kernel optimizations.
</p><p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=2024&amp;image=epyc_network_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2024&amp;image=epyc_network_med" alt="AMD EPYC CPU with network switches"></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile new Ethernet driver hardware support in Linux 6.8 includes the Octeon CN10K devices, Broadcom 5760X P7, Qualcomm SM8550 SoC, and Texas Instrument DP83TG720S PHY. On the Bluetooth side is new driver support for the IMC Networks Bluetooth radio.
</p><p>
As we've seen recently with efforts to <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.7-Staging">drop old/obsolete network drivers</a>, several outdated WiFi drivers were removed for Linux 6.8. Newly-dropped Wifi support include Libertas 16-bit PCMCIA support, Atmel at76c50x drivers, HostAP ISA/PCMCIA style 802.11b driver, zd1201 802.11b USB dongles, Orinoco ISA/PCMCIA 802.11b driver, Aviator/Raytheon driver, Planet WL3501 driver, and the RNDIS USB 802.11b driver.
</p><p>
When it comes to network driver improvements in Linux 6.8, the Intel high-speed NIC driver has added support for temperature and clock information reporting, among other random improvements throughout the many network drivers. NVIDIA Mellanox Ethernet data center switches can also now enjoy firmware updates without a reboot. On the WiFi side there remains ongoing WiFi 7 work and Extremely High Throughput (EHT) improvements.
</p><p>
The full list of new networking patches for the Linux 6.8 kernel merge window can be found via today's <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240109162323.427562-1-pabeni@redhat.com/">pull request</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unfortunately, the Reed-Muller code has a serious drawback: The number of bits required to encode a message increases exponentially with the number of variables. If you want a highly local code that corrects errors with just a handful of queries, you’ll need a lot of variables for long messages, and the Reed-Muller code will quickly become useless in practice.</p>
<p>“Exponential in this case is very bad,” Dvir said. But is it inevitable?</p>
<h2><strong>Correctable or Decodable?</strong></h2>
<p>As computer scientists tried and failed to find more efficient locally correctable codes, they began to suspect that such codes weren’t possible at all. In 2003, two researchers <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/780542.780560">proved</a> that there’s no way to beat the Reed-Muller code using only two queries. But that’s as far as anybody got.</p>
<p>“Once you go to three, our knowledge becomes very sketchy,” Kothari said.</p>
<p>The next breakthrough just complicated matters further. In two papers published in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1326554.1326555">2008</a> and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1536414.1536422">2009</a>, the computer scientists Sergey Yekhanin and Klim Efremenko showed how to construct three-query codes that were more efficient than Reed-Muller codes, but these codes were not quite locally correctable. Instead, they had a subtly different property called local decodability.</p>

<p>To understand the difference, let’s again imagine a cloud storage provider that combines users’ data into one long message and protects it using an error-correcting code. Both locally correctable codes and locally decodable codes can correct an error in any bit of the original message with just a few queries.</p>
<p>But every error-correcting code also requires extra bits that weren’t in the original message — that’s why encoding a message makes it longer. The two types of codes differ in how they treat these additional bits. Locally decodable codes make no promises about the number of queries needed to correct errors in these bits. But in a locally correctable code, an error in any of the extra bits can be fixed in precisely the same way as an error in any bit of the original message.</p>
<p>“Everything that you store, whether it’s the original data of users or the redundancy and the check information — all of this can be locally corrected,” said <a href="https://madhu.seas.harvard.edu/">Madhu Sudan</a>, a computer scientist at Harvard University.</p>
<p>Though different in principle, local correctability and local decodability always seemed interchangeable in practice before 2008 — every known locally decodable code was also locally correctable. Yekhanin and Efremenko’s discovery raised the possibility of a fundamental difference between the two conditions. Or perhaps it was possible to modify Yekhanin and Efremenko’s codes to make them locally correctable. That would put the two conditions on equal footing once more, but it would also mean that researchers had been mistaken about how efficient three-query locally correctable codes could get. Either way, conventional wisdom would have to change.</p>
<h2><strong>Borrowing Logic</strong></h2>
<p>Kothari and Manohar finally resolved that tension by adapting a technique from a different area of computer science: the study of so-called constraint satisfaction problems. Trying to coordinate dinner plans with a group of friends is a constraint satisfaction problem of a sort. Everyone has choices they’ll accept and choices they’ll veto. Your job is to either find a plan that satisfies everybody, or, if there is no such plan, figure that out as soon as possible.</p>

<p>There’s an inherent asymmetry between those two possible outcomes. An acceptable solution may not be easy to find, but once you have it, it’s easy to convince anyone else that it will work. But even if you know that the problem really is “unsatisfiable,” there may not be an example that provides proof.</p>
<p>In 2021, Kothari and Manohar, together with Venkatesan Guruswami of the University of California, Berkeley, made a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04415">major breakthrough</a> in the study of constraint satisfaction problems using a new theoretical technique for identifying those tricky unsatisfiable cases. They suspected that the new method would be a powerful tool for solving other problems too, and Guruswami’s graduate student Omar Alrabiah suggested that they look at three-query locally decodable codes.</p>
<p>“This was a nail with a hammer in our hand, so to speak,” Kothari said.</p>
<p>Yekhanin and Efremenko’s surprising results had shown that three-query locally decodable codes could be more efficient than Reed-Muller codes. But were their codes the best ones possible, or could three-query locally decodable codes get even more efficient? Kothari, Manohar, Guruswami and Alrabiah thought their new technique might be able to prove limits on how efficient such codes could get. Their plan was to build a logical formula encompassing the structure of all possible three-query locally decodable codes of a given size, and prove it unsatisfiable, thereby showing that no such code could exist.</p>
<p>The four researchers took a first step in that direction in 2022, setting a <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/101/">new limit</a> on the maximum efficiency of three-query locally decodable codes. The result went well beyond what researchers had been able to achieve with other techniques, but it didn’t rule out all codes more efficient than Yekhanin and Efremenko’s.</p>
<p>Kothari and Manohar suspected they could go further. But progress stalled until Manohar jotted down a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation indicating that the technique might work even better for locally correctable codes than it had for locally decodable ones.</p>

<p>A few months later, after many more false starts that made them fear they’d been too optimistic, the technique finally delivered on its promise. Kothari and Manohar proved that as researchers had suspected, it’s impossible for any three-query locally correctable code to work appreciably better than Reed-Muller codes. That exponential scaling is a fundamental limitation. Their result was also a dramatic demonstration that local correctability and local decodability, though superficially similar, really do differ at a fundamental level: The latter is unequivocally easier to realize than the former.</p>
<p>Kothari and Manohar now hope to extend their techniques to study codes that are allowed to make more than three queries, as very little is known about them now. And progress in the theory of error correction often has implications in other seemingly unrelated fields. In particular, locally correctable codes make surprise appearances everywhere from the problem of <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/cryptographers-devise-an-approach-for-total-search-privacy-20231106/">private database searches</a> in cryptography to proofs of <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-team-of-math-proves-a-critical-link-between-addition-and-sets-20231206/">theorems in combinatorics</a>. It’s too early to say how Kothari and Manohar’s technique will impact these different fields, but researchers are feeling optimistic.</p>
<p><span>“There’s a really beautiful new idea here,” Dvir said. “I think there’s a lot of potential.”</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="ember611083">    <h2>The Contract</h2>
<p>On March 13, 2023, I did something crazy:</p>
<p>I opened <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stickk.com/">StickK.com</a>, a site for making commitment contracts, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stickk.com/commitment/details/1009092?pid=0">placed a bet</a> that I would write a novel in 9 months and submit it to my literary agent by the end of the year. I told all of my friends about this contract and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ChanningAllen/status/1643958786057461763">discussed it publicly</a> many times, including to 100,000+ podcast listeners.</p>
<p>The stakes of the bet? If I failed, I would send $9,999, the maximum amount allowed by StickK, to a so-called "anti-charity" whose cause I didn't support.</p>
<p>Spoiler: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.loom.com/share/a6fe4ceb382f48c19e316cdbbb8dbcbc">I succeeded</a> with about an hour left in the year and zero gas left in the tank. I'd even found a free day to whip together <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ChanningAllen/status/1727415542456193087">an AI-based book trailer</a> after finishing the first draft.</p>
<p>But here's what you need to know: even though I was confident I would pull through on the contract, there was simply <em>no clear path to victory</em> at the time that I signed it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I hadn't written a word of fiction in almost 10 years.</li>
<li>I'm a <em>good</em> writer, but I've historically been a <em>slow</em> writer.</li>
<li>I run a business which requires a <em>lot</em> of my time, energy, and attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>How, then, was I so confident I would succeed?</p>
<h2>Plan, Do, Learn</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." —Bruce Lee</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was confident because I've spent years mastering a simple iteration process — the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/plan-do-learn-my-somewhat-hardcore-work-routine-1fb500959f">plan, do, learn loop</a> — which helps me innovate and course-correct toward just about any goal, provided I'm given a reasonable time frame.</p>
<p>I encourage you to go read that old post if you haven't, but tl;dr:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I make a plan, then do the plan, then learn from my efforts by reviewing my progress. I do this every day of the year, going on half a decade now.</p>
<p>These plan, do, learn loops ("PDL loops" for short) exist at six nested levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quarters</strong></li>
<li><strong>Months</strong></li>
<li><strong>Weeks</strong></li>
<li><strong>Days</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sessions:</strong> multiple per day, lasting ~3 hours each and broken up by 60-minute breaks</li>
<li><strong>Actions:</strong> multiple per session, lasting anywhere from 5–60 minutes each</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If it sounds simple, it is. And it isn't. Throw a kick 10,000 times and you'll find lots of nuance.</p>
<p>My original post hinted at my iteration <em>speed</em> but said little about my iteration <em>strategy</em>. That is, I didn't explain <em>how</em> I plan, <em>how</em> I do, or <em>how</em> I learn.</p>
<p>Better late than never. In this post, I'll talk about 20% of the factors that lead to 80% of my outcomes. They're captured in the following acronyms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AIM</strong>: Plan</li>
<li><strong>FIRE</strong>: Do</li>
<li><strong>SCAN</strong>: Learn</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the concepts deserves its own standalone post, so I'm going to try to keep things short and sweet from here.</p>
<h2>AIM: The 80/20 of Good Planning</h2>
<p>AIM stands for ABZs, Interrogate, and Mandatory.</p>
<h3>1. <strong>ABZs</strong>:</h3>
<p>This gem is from <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ShaanVP">Shaan Puri</a>:</p>

<h3>2. <strong>Interrogate</strong>:</h3>
<p>Suppose you've already made an iteration through the loop and now you're reviewing your original plan. Rather than thoughtlessly continuing down that original path, interrogate the plan and confirm that it still makes sense.</p>
<p>At one point while writing my novel, I reflexively started working on a new chapter because I'd included it in the original outlining process. But interrogation helped me realize that it was no longer needed, which literally saved me weeks of wasted effort.</p>
<p>Heed Peter Drucker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After completing the original top-priority task, the executive resets priorities rather than moving on to number two from the original list. He asks, “What must be done now?” This generally results in new and different priorities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. <strong>Mandatory</strong>:</h3>
<p>Identify a mandatory, must-ship objective for the work iteration, and commit to shipping it regardless of the obstacles you encounter. If you can't think of a concrete objective, make it a time commitment like "contribute 5 on-task hours to my novel this week."</p>
<p>I've personally found it really effective to give myself a "day must-ship objective" and a "week must-ship objective." A few months into my StickK contract I even started taking out $50 "mini-contracts" to hold myself accountable to my week must-ship objectives.</p>
<h2>FIRE: The 80/20 of Good Doing</h2>
<p>FIRE stands for Frontload, Improvise, Resourcefulness, and Exhaust.</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Frontload</strong>:</h3>
<p>Mark Twain said it best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To repeat what I've <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ChanningAllen/status/1658145647223091205">written elsewhere</a>, long-term optimism for difficult projects is made out of short-term pessimism.</p>
<p>Wake up assuming everything will go wrong today. This week. This month. And execute accordingly.</p>
<p>If things do go wrong, you'll still be on track. If they don't, you'll be way ahead.</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Improvise</strong>:</h3>
<p>Speaking of things going wrong: they will. And when they do, you'll be happy you followed the ABZ framework and didn't overplan.</p>
<p>I use all sorts of techniques for improvising and getting unstuck. Here are just a few of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/the-bus-method-for-getting-unstuck-9c9f614b3d">The BUS method</a>: freewrite ideas, then organize them</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling">interstitial journaling</a>: journal as you work through tasks</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubberducking</a>: explain the problem you're trying to solve to an inanimate object</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: there's a huge difference between improvising on the iteration path and improvising on the iteration itself. Using the ABZ framework, a legitimate improvisation might be rethinking <em>how</em> to achieve B, but it will almost never be rethinking B itself. As a rule with few exceptions, you want to move forward through iteration loops, not backward. (Too often, moving backward is a sign of problems with doing, not problems with planning.)</p>
<h3>3. <strong>Resourcefulness</strong>:</h3>
<p>Human brains suck at most things. Instead of relying only on mental resources like willpower and memory, use <em>extra-mental</em> resources for added leverage.</p>
<p>This is a book-length topic and perhaps the main secret of my success, so forgive me the vagueness of simply bucketing extra-mental resources into two categories and leaving it at that for now: 1) The Three Me's and 2) The Two We's:</p>
<p>The Three Me's:</p>
<ol>
<li>Techniques, e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/the-bus-method-for-getting-unstuck-9c9f614b3d">the BUS method</a></li>
<li>Tools, e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/procedures-in-the-world-95d9c93a6f">standard operating procedures</a>, ChatGPT</li>
<li>Territories, i.e. environmental constraints on your behavior, e.g. putting your phone on DND mode</li>
</ol>
<p>The Two We's:</p>
<ol>
<li>Teachers, e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/i-read-60-books-every-year-ama-30d949cce4">books</a>, mentors, content creators</li>
<li>Teams, e.g. personal assistants</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. <strong>Exhaust</strong>:</h3>
<p>Don't take the "exhaust" term too literally here. Burnout is real, and I'm not suggesting you should do that. Instead I mean that if you decide to do an hour of work, try to work a <em>60-minute</em> hour rather than, say, a 30-minute hour filled with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_partial_attention">continuous partial attention</a>.</p>
<p>Easy to do when <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/are-your-projects-110s-80-20s-or-50-50s-7093388c0a">you're passionate</a> or things are going well. Less easy when you're stuck or bored, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/the-power-technique-a-strategic-approach-to-self-discipline-11bc6724d6">discipline is required</a>.</p>
<p>Enforced time constraints work wonders here. My own convention is to do intensive work sessions for set blocks of time then self-impose 30- to 60-minute cooldown periods where I relax and recharge. I use a website blocker called <a target="_blank" href="https://freedom.to/">Freedom</a> for this. I did a deep-dive on this process <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/artificial-scarcity-artificial-fatigue-4e6bd31061">here.</a></p>

<h2><strong>SCAN: The 80/20 of Good Learning</strong></h2>
<p>SCAN stands for Score, Critique, Adjust, and Notes.</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Score</strong>:</h3>
<p>Scoring helps you measure your performance objectively. If you don't do it, you end up lying to yourself without knowing you're lying to yourself.</p>
<p>Again, heed Drucker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One company chairman was absolutely certain that he divided his time roughly into three parts. One third he thought he was spending with his senior men. One third he thought he spent with his important customers. And one third he thought was devoted to community activities.</p>
<p>The actual record of his activities over six weeks brought out clearly that he spent almost no time in any of these areas. These were the tasks on which he knew he should spend time — and therefore memory, obliging as usual, told him that these were the tasks on which he actually had spent his time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like to score (or at least track) two things: inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>By <em>inputs,</em> I really just mean time: "How many hours did I put in versus the amount of hours I was supposed to put in?" <em>Outputs</em> is more self-explanatory: "Did I ship my must-ship objective?"</p>
<p>Both can be scored with a simple 0 or 1. (My personal scoring systems have become a lot more sophisticated after years of iteration, but I started with something like this.)</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Critique</strong>:</h3>
<p>If you take the time to look, you will always, always, always identify at least one flaw in your performance that can improve upon. But if you don't look, that flaw will often go unnoticed for many iterations, or even forever.</p>
<p>What I do is identify at least one of these flaws at the end of each iteration cycle.</p>
<h3>3. <strong>Adjust</strong>:</h3>
<p>It's not enough to notice a flaw. You also want to take action. And in my experience, simply saying, "Okay, next time I won't do [flaw]" is bullshit 90% of the time.</p>
<p>One of my bad habits early on in the process of working on the novel was putting other work in front of it: answering work emails, chatting with my team, doing morning routine tasks, etc. By the time I got around to writing — which requires an enormous amount of mental energy — I was often drained.</p>
<p>So I made an adjustment: within 30 minutes of waking up, I needed to get started on the manuscript and knock out at least 2 hours of work before opening the pandora's box of digital distractions.</p>
<h3>4. <strong>Notes</strong>:</h3>
<p>Write down how things went during this iteration, and why. Benjamin Franklin began each day by asking himself in his journal: “What good shall I do this day?” Then, at the end of the day, he'd ask “What good have I done today?”</p>
<p>If it's good enough for Big Ben, it's good enough for you. The first reason why documenting your progress is good is because it leaves a record for you to investigate later. You'll be less likely to make the same mistakes over again without being able to lie to yourself about it.</p>
<p>The second reason why this is good is because writing is thinking. Often, the act of writing your learnings from the iteration will lead to far greater clarity about your performance than you could gain otherwise. It's similar to the process of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubberducking</a>.</p>

                      <h3>Researchers at Ocean Conservancy and University of Toronto estimate that American adults could be consuming up to 3.8 million microplastics per year from protein alone</h3>
          
          
        </div><div>
          
<p>Portland, Ore. – A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123022352?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new study</a> led by researchers at Ocean Conservancy and the University of Toronto and published today in the journal <em>Environmental Pollution</em> found microplastic particles in 88% of protein food samples tested. The samples were drawn from 16 different protein types* destined for U.S. consumers, including seafood, pork, beef, chicken, tofu, and three different plant-based meat alternatives.</p>



<p>While scientists have long documented the presence of microplastics in the digestive tracts of commercial fish and shellfish like salmon, halibut and oysters, there has been little research into whether these microplastics are entering the filets of the fish – the parts that are actually eaten by people; and little research into terrestrial protein sources like beef and chicken that make up a large part of the American diet. In this study, microplastics were found in all 16 protein types tested, suggesting that humans are likely eating microplastics no matter the source of protein they choose. Furthermore, there were no statistical differences in microplastic concentrations between land- and ocean-sourced proteins.</p>



<p>“This is a startling reminder of just how prolific plastic pollution has become – humans live on land and yet seafood samples are just as likely to be contaminated with plastics as are terrestrial derived proteins,” said study co-author Dr. Britta Baechler, a marine biologist and Associate Director of Plastics Science at Ocean Conservancy. “And there’s no escaping them no matter what you eat, it seems. The plastic pollution crisis is impacting all of us, and we need to take action to address its many forms.”</p>



<p>The study found evidence that food processing is a likely source of microplastic contamination, as highly processed protein products (like fish sticks, chicken nuggets, tofu, and plant-based burgers, among others) contained significantly more microplastics per gram than minimally processed products (items like packaged wild Alaska pollock, raw chicken breast, and others). However, no statistical difference was found between high-processed products and fresh-caught products, suggesting that food processing is not the only source of microplastic contamination and opening avenues for further research.</p>



<p>“It’s tempting to want to draw conclusions like ‘eat less of this and more of that’ to avoid microplastics in your diet; but right now we still know very little about the microplastic burdens in commonly consumed foods. Our study adds to this knowledge but also demonstrates the need for further research to better understand the bigger picture, including where these microplastics are coming from and the potential human health risks<a>,</a>” said primary co-author Madeleine Milne, who conducted the research while at the Rochman Lab at the University of Toronto in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, across all samples, nearly half (44%) of the identified microplastics were fibers, which is consistent with other studies suggesting that fibers are the most prevalent form of microplastic in the environment. About a third of the microplastics (30%) were plastic fragments.</p>



<p>Using survey data from <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1323477/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a separate study</a> by Ocean Conservancy and the University of Toronto (to be published in <em>Frontiers in Marine Science)</em> the authors estimate an American adult will consume, on average, 11,500 microplastics per year. Annual exposure could be as high as 3.8 million microplastics per year if calculated using the highest levels of microplastics found in each individual protein type and the average reported protein consumption rates.</p>



<p>“As ocean scientists, my co-authors and I are deeply concerned about the growing plastics crisis in the world’s ocean,” said Dr. George Leonard, Ocean Conservancy’s Chief Scientist and a co-author of the study. “But our study shows that plastics in our food goes well beyond fish and shellfish to a wide variety of other protein sources, as well.&nbsp; Our work is a call to action to reduce plastic pollution in its many forms to ensure a safe and healthy food supply for all consumers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>###</p>



<p>*Protein types included store-purchased breaded shrimp, minced pollock, fish sticks, white Gulf shrimp (headless/shell-on), Key West pink shrimp (headless/shell-on), Alaska Pollock fillets (skinless), chicken nuggets, top sirloin steaks, pork loin chops, chicken breasts, plant-based nuggets, plant-based fish sticks, plant-based ground beef, and tofu blocks.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1576">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		




<div><p>This post is not going to be about what’s wrong with individual databases. There are so many databases and so many individual API issues, operational problems, and arbitrary limitations that it would be take forever to cover all of them. This post is about what’s wrong with databases as a collection. It’s about what’s wrong with databases as they exist today conceptually and have existed for decades.</p>
<p>Of course, something can only be wrong if there’s a different, better way to do things. There is, and we’ll get to that too.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Global_mutable_state_is_harmful">Global mutable state is harmful</h2>



<div><p>Every programmer learns early on to minimize the use of state in global variables. They do have the occasional legitimate use, but as a general rule they lead to tangled code that’s difficult to reason about.</p>
<p>Databases are global mutable state too. They’re actually even worse than global variables since interactions are frequently spread across multiple systems, making it even harder to reason about. Also, they’re durable. So if a mistake is made that corrupts the database, that corruption doesn’t get fixed by just fixing the bug. You have to manually figure out what got corrupted and fix it. In a lot of cases it’s impossible to figure out exactly what got corrupted, and you may not have enough information to correct the corruption perfectly. Your best option in these cases is to either revert to a backup or merge in partial data from a backup, neither of which are optimal.</p>
<p>Most programmers simultaneously believe global mutable state in variables is harmful while also believing global mutable state in a database is fine, even though they share most of the same issues.</p>
<p>The better approach, as we’ll get to later in this post, is <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event sourcing</a> plus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view">materialized views</a>. There are many ways to go about applying that pattern, and it’s important to do so in a way that doesn’t create other complexities or performance regressions.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Data_models_are_restrictive">Data models are restrictive</h2>



<div><p>Databases revolve around a “data model”, like “key/value”, “document”, “relational”, “column-oriented”, or “graph”. A database’s data model is how it indexes data, and a database exposes an API oriented around the kinds of queries that data model can efficiently support.</p>
<p>No single data model can support all use cases. This is a major reason why so many different databases exist with differing data models. So it’s common for companies to use multiple databases in order to handle their varying use cases.</p>
<p>There’a a better abstraction for specifying indexes, and it’s one that every programmer is already familiar with: data structures. Every data model is actually just a particular combination of data structures. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key/value</strong>: map</li>
<li><strong>Document</strong>: map of maps</li>
<li><strong>Relational</strong>: map of maps, with secondary indexes being additional maps</li>
<li><strong>Column-oriented</strong>: Map of sorted maps</li>
</ul>
<p>Data structures can be of huge size by being durable on disk, just like data models. This includes nested data structures. Read and write operations on durable data structures can be just as efficient as the corresponding operations on data models. If you can specify your indexes in terms of the simpler primitive of data structures, then your datastore can express any data model. Additionally, it can express <strong>infinite</strong> more by composing data structures in different ways.</p>
<p>Because only a tiny percentage of the possible data models are available in databases (since each database implements just one particular data model) it’s incredibly common for a database to not match an application’s needs perfectly. It’s extremely expensive to build a new database from scratch, so programmers frequently twist their domain model to fit the available databases. This creates complexity at the very base of an application. If you could instead mold your datastore to fit your domain model, by specifying the “shape” (data structures) precisely, this complexity goes away.</p>
<p>Specifying indexes in terms of data structures rather than data models is a big part of the approach to backend development we’ll look at later in this post.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Normalization_versus_denormalization_problem">Normalization versus denormalization problem</h2>



<div><p>Every programmer using relational databases eventually runs into the normalization versus denormalization problem. It’s desirable to store data as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms">normalized</a> as possible to have a clear source of truth and eliminate any possibility of inconsistency. However, storing data normalized can increase the work to perform queries by requiring more joins. Oftentimes, that extra work is so much you’re forced to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormalization">denormalize</a> the database to improve performance.</p>
<p>Storing the same information multiple times creates the possibility of inconsistency if there’s a bug of any sort in processing. However, to meet performance constraints you’re forced to store the same information in multiple ways, whether in the same database or across multiple databases. And it’s not just RDBMS’s that have this problem. So the burden is on you, the engineer, to ensure complete fault-tolerance in achieving consistency for all code that updates those databases. Code like that is frequently spread across many services.</p>
<p>There’s a fundamental tension between being a source of truth versus being an indexed store that answers queries quickly. The traditional RDBMS architecture conflates these two concepts into the same datastore.</p>
<p>The solution is to treat these two concepts separately. One subsystem should be used for representing the source of truth, and another should be used for materializing any number of indexed stores off of that source of truth. If that second system is capable of recomputing indexes off of that source of truth, any bugs that introduce inconsistency can be corrected.</p>
<p>Once again, this is event sourcing plus materialized views. If those two systems are integrated, you don’t need to take any performance hit. More on this soon.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Restrictive_schemas">Restrictive schemas</h2>



<div><p>Databases vary a ton regarding what kinds of values can be stored in them. Some only allow “blobs” (byte arrays), putting the burden of serializing and deserializing domain types on clients. Others allow a variety of types like integers, floating point numbers, strings, dates, and others.</p>
<p>It’s rare that you can store your domain representations in a first-class way in a database such that queries can reach inside your domain objects to fetch or aggregate information nested inside. Partially this is due to database implementation languages being distinct from application languages so they can’t interoperate in these ways. Sometimes you can extend a database to handle a language-neutral representation, like <a href="https://github.com/mpartel/postgres-protobuf">this extension</a> for Postgres, but it’s cumbersome and has limitations.</p>
<p>It’s common to instead use adapter libraries that map a domain representation to a database representation, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping">ORMs</a>. However, such an abstraction frequently leaks and causes issues. This has been discussed extensively already, like <a href="https://medium.com/building-the-system/dont-be-a-sucker-and-stop-using-orms-190add65add4">here</a> and <a href="https://dev.to/harshhhdev/why-orms-arent-always-a-great-idea-41kg">here</a>, so I don’t need to go into all the issues with ORMs again.</p>
<p>Being forced to index data in a way that’s different from your ideal domain representation is pure complexity. At the very least, you have to write adapter code to translate between the representations. Frequently, the limitations restrict what kinds of queries can be performed efficiently. The restrictiveness of database schemas forces you to twist your application to fit the database in undesirable ways.</p>
<p>This issue has been so universal for so long, it can be hard to recognize that this complexity is unnecessary. When you can mold your datastore to fit your application, including your desired domain representations, this complexity goes away.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Complex deployments">Complex deployments</h2>



<div><p>Databases do not exist in isolation. A complete backend requires using many tools: databases, processing systems, monitoring tools, schedulers, and so on. Large-scale backends oftentimes require dozens of different tools.</p>
<p>Updating an application can be a complex orchestration process of migrations, code updates, and infrastructure changes. It’s not uncommon for companies to have entire teams dedicated to deployment engineering.</p>
<p>On top of all this, to be production-ready you have to ensure everything has sufficient telemetry so you’re able to detect and diagnose any issues that may arise, whether performance or otherwise. Every tool has its own bespoke mechanisms for collecting telemetry, so getting everything gathered together into one monitoring dashboard is another non-trivial engineering task.</p>
<p>The complexity and cost of deployment is an artifact of the development model which currently dominates software engineering, what I call the “a la carte model”. On the surface, the a la carte model is attractive: pick the most optimal tool for each part of your architecture and make them work together.</p>
<p>The reality of the a la carte model doesn’t meet that ideal. As the tools are designed independently from one another, “making them work together” is oftentimes a ton of work, including the pain of building deployments. And as already discussed, the tools are usually far from optimal. Things like fixed data models and restrictive schemas mean you’re frequently twisting your application to fit your tools rather than molding your tools to fit your application.</p>
<p>If you take a step back and think about what we do as software engineers, the high cost of building applications doesn’t really make sense. We work in a field of engineering based on abstraction, automation, and reuse. Yet it takes hundreds or thousands of person-years to build applications that you can describe in total detail within hours –&nbsp;look at the sizes of the engineering teams behind pretty much every large-scale application. Even many small-scale applications require engineering effort that seems severely disproportionate to their functionality. What happened to abstraction, automation, and reuse? Why isn’t the engineering involved in building an application just what’s unique about that application?</p>
<p>The a la carte model exists because the software industry has operated without a cohesive model for constructing end-to-end application backends. When you use tooling that is built under a truly cohesive model, the complexities of the a la carte model melt away, the opportunity for abstraction, automation, and reuse skyrockets, and the cost of software development drastically decreases.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="A_cohesive_model_for_building_application_backends">A cohesive model for building application backends</h2>



<div><p>To go beyond databases to find a better approach to software development, you have to start from first principles. That’s the only way to break free from the shackles of decades of inertia of software architectures. So let’s clearly and rigorously define what a backend is, and then reason from there as to how backends should be structured.</p>
<p>The primary functions of a backend are receiving new data and answering questions on that data. Answering a question may involve fetching one piece of data that had been previously recorded (e.g. “What is Alice’s current location?”), and other questions may involve aggregations of lots of data (e.g. “What is the average bank account balance of people in Freedonia over the last three months?”). The most general way to answer a question is to literally run a function on all the data the backend has ever received:</p>
</div>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br></p></td><td><p>query = function(all data)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<div><p>Forget for a moment the practicalities of this, that your dataset may be 10 petabytes in size and your queries need to be answered within milliseconds. What matters is this is a starting point from which to think about backend design. Unlike the data models of databases, this clearly encapsulates all possible backends. The closer your backend design is to this ideal while meeting the necessary practical constraints (e.g. latency, scalability, consistency, fault-tolerance), the more powerful it will be. How close can you get to this ideal? In other words, what is the smallest set of tradeoffs necessary to arrive at a practical system?</p>
<p>It turns out all you have to do is add the concept of an index, a precomputed view of your data that enables certain queries to be resolved quickly. And so the above model becomes:</p>
</div>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br></p></td><td><p>indexes = function(data)<br>
query = function(indexes)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>Every backend that’s ever been built has been an instance of this model, though not formulated explicitly like this. Usually different tools are used for the different components of this model: data,

<code>function(data)</code>

, indexes, and

<code>function(indexes)</code>

. In a typical RDBMS backend, an RDBMS is used for both data and indexes, with possibly other databases like ElasticSearch used for more indexing. Computation (both

<code>function(data)</code>

and

<code>function(indexes)</code>

) is usually done either as part of an API server’s handlers or in background jobs managed with queues and workers.</p>
<p>Larger scale backends may use NoSQL databases like Cassandra, MongoDB, or Neo4j for indexing, Kafka for incoming data, and computation systems like Hadoop, Storm, or Kafka Streams for

<code>function(data)</code>

.</p>
<p>In all these cases backends are constructed with a hodgepodge of narrow tooling. None of these are general purpose tools for any of the components of backends (data,

<code>function(data)</code>

, indexes,

<code>function(indexes)</code>

), able to satisfy the needs of that component for all backends at all scales for all performance requirements.</p>



<div><p>What this model does is provide a framework for a next-generation tool that takes all the needs of a backend into account. If a tool could implement all these components in an integrated and general purpose way –&nbsp;at any scale, fault-tolerant, and with optimal performance –&nbsp;the complexities described earlier in this post could be avoided.</p>
<p>That brings us to <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/index.html">Rama</a>, a backend development platform designed with these first principles at its foundation.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Rama">Rama</h2>



<div><p>We announced Rama on August 15th with the tagline “the 100x development platform”. Since that sounds so impossible on the face of it, we paired our announcement with a <a href="https://blog.redplanetlabs.com/2023/08/15/how-we-reduced-the-cost-of-building-twitter-at-twitter-scale-by-100x/">direct demonstration</a> of that cost reduction. We re-implemented <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> (basically the same as the Twitter consumer product) in its entirety from scratch to be able to run at Twitter-scale. To demonstrate its scale, we operated the instance with 100M bots posting 3,500 times per second at 403 average fanout. Twitter wrote 1M lines of code and spent ~200 person-years building the equivalent (just the consumer product), and we did it with Rama with 10k lines of code and nine person-months. Our implementation is <a href="https://github.com/redplanetlabs/twitter-scale-mastodon">open-source</a>, complete, high-performance, and production-ready.</p>
<p>Twitter’s implementation was so much more expensive because of the complexities described earlier. For instance, to reach scale they had to build multiple specialized databases from scratch (e.g. social graph database, in-memory timeline database) because there were no databases that had the right data models. They have an extremely complex deployment consisting of a large number of different tools, with <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2017/the-infrastructure-behind-twitter-scale">over 1M lines</a> of just Puppet configuration.</p>
<p>These complexities and many others are completely avoided by our Rama-based implementation. Our solutions to the performance and scalability challenges of Twitter are similar (e.g. keep timelines in memory and reconstruct on read if lost, how we balance processing of an unbalanced social graph), but we were able to do it by simply composing the primitives of Rama together in different ways rather than build specialized infrastructure from scratch for each subproblem. Our <a href="https://blog.redplanetlabs.com/2023/08/15/how-we-reduced-the-cost-of-building-twitter-at-twitter-scale-by-100x/#Performance_and_scalability">performance numbers</a> for our Mastodon implementation are as good or better than Twitter’s numbers.</p>
<p>This is the programming model of Rama:</p>

<p>These concepts correspond directly to the first principles described. What makes Rama so powerful is how it implements each piece so generally. Depots correspond to “data” and are distributed logs containing arbitrary data. “PStates” (short for “partitioned state”) correspond to indexes. You can make as many PStates as you need with each specified as an arbitrary combination of durable data structures. ETLs and queries are

<code>function(data)</code>

and

respectively, and they’re expressed using a Turing-complete dataflow API that seamlessly distributes computation. Being Turing-complete is critical to be able to support arbitrary ETL and query logic.</p>



<div><p>How to use Rama is documented extensively <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/index.html">on our website</a>. That documentation contains a six-part tutorial that does a much better job introducing the API than I could possibly squeeze into this post. That tutorial explores Rama through the Java API, but Rama also has <a href="https://blog.redplanetlabs.com/2023/10/11/introducing-ramas-clojure-api/">a Clojure API</a>.</p>
<p>So let’s instead look at how Rama avoids the complexities that have plagued databases for so long. While Rama does everything a database does, like durably indexing data and <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/replication.html">replicating changes incrementally</a>, it also does so much more. Rama handling both computation and storage is a big part of how it’s able to avoid these complexities.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the first complexity we looked at, databases being global mutable state suffering from the same issues as global mutable state in regular programs. Rama’s PStates serve the same role that a database does, but they are only writable from the ETL topology that owns them. Since every write to a PState is in the same ETL code, it’s much easier to reason about their state.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, PStates are materialized views over an event sourced log. So it doesn’t make sense for anything but the owning ETL topology to write to them. The combination of event sourcing and materialized views also addresses the other issue discussed earlier, that a bug deployed to production can corrupt a database in a way that’s difficult or impossible to fully correct. In Rama, a PState can always be recomputed from the depot data, which is the source of truth. This can completely correct any sort of human error.</p>
<p>The next complexity of databases was the restrictiveness of data models. We discussed how data structures are a much better way to specify indexes, and that each data model is just a particular combination of data structures. Being able to specify indexes in terms of data structures allows not just every existing data model to be supported, but also infinite more.</p>
<p>Rama’s PStates are specified as data structures. When developing Rama applications it’s common to materialize many PStates to handle all the different use cases of an application. For example, our Mastodon implementation has 33 PStates with a wide variety of data structures just for profiles, statuses, and timelines. Sometimes one PState handles 10 different use cases, and other times a PState exists just to support one use case.</p>
<p>PStates are durable, partitioned, and incrementally replicated. Incremental replication means there’s always another partition ready to take over if the leader partition fails, and it guarantees anything visible on a current leader will still be visible on subsequent leaders. These properties make PStates suitable for any use case handled by databases, including large scale ones.</p>
<p>The next complexity we covered was the normalization versus denormalization problem. Through being based on first principles, Rama inherently solves that by explicitly distinguishing between data (depots) and views (PStates).</p>
<p>The next complexity was the restrictive schemas of databases. One of the joys of developing with Rama is using your domain representations in every context, whether appending to a depot, reading/writing to PStates, or doing distributed processing in ETLs or queries. Any data representation is allowed, whether plain data structures like hash maps or lists, <a href="https://protobuf.dev/">Protocol Buffers</a>, or nested object definitions. There’s no difference between using any of them. If you want to use a type Rama doesn’t already know about, you just have to register a <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/serialization.html">custom serializer</a>.</p>
<p>The last complexity we discussed was complex deployments, and Rama addresses that too. Rama is an integrated platform capable of building an entire backend end-to-end. Rama applications are called “modules”, and a module contains any number of depots, ETLs, PStates, and query topologies. Rama provides built-in mechanisms to deploy, update, and scale modules. Each of these is <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/operating-rama.html#_launching_modules">just a one-liner</a> at the terminal. All that complexity of deployment engineering when dealing with traditional architectures comprising dozens of pieces of infrastructure completely evaporates from Rama being an integrated system.</p>
<p>Some people get the wrong impression that Rama is an “all or nothing” tool, but in reality Rama is <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/integrating.html">very easy to integrate</a> with any other system. This allows Rama to be incrementally introduced into existing architectures.</p>
<p>Another great consequence of Rama being such a cohesive and integrated platform is the monitoring Rama provides out of the box. Since Rama is so general purpose, it’s capable of monitoring itself: collecting monitoring data, processing it, indexing it, and visualizing it. Rama provides <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/operating-rama.html#_cluster_ui">deep and detailed telemetry</a> on all aspects of a module. This telemetry is invaluable for understanding the performance of a module in production, detecting and diagnosing issues, and knowing when to scale.</p>
<p>That covers all the complexities about databases discussed earlier, and we’re just barely scratching the surface on Rama. The best ways to learn more about Rama are to go through <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/index.html">the documentation</a>, play with the <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/downloads-maven-local-dev.html">publicly available build of Rama</a>, study the short, self-contained, thoroughly commented examples in <a href="https://github.com/redplanetlabs/rama-demo-gallery">rama-demo-gallery</a>, or study our <a href="https://github.com/redplanetlabs/twitter-scale-mastodon">Twitter-scale Mastodon implementation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<div><p>The software industry has been stuck near a local maximum for a long time with the a la carte model. The current state of databases is a consequence of backend development not being approached in a holistic manner.</p>
<p>Rama is a paradigm shift that breaks free of this local maximum. The complexities of databases that every programmer has gotten so used to are no longer necessary. The benefits of breaking out of that local maximum are very consequential, with a dramatically lower cost of development and maintenance. The 100x cost reduction we demonstrated with our Mastodon example translates to any other large-scale application. Small to medium scale applications won’t have as extreme a cost reduction, but the reduction in complexity is significant for smaller scale applications as well.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’d like to use Rama in production to build new features, scale your existing systems, or simplify your infrastructure, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfrhmBwI0YAeaL8u4XmgfscW4UIUUDp2ZHSs4KmPH_TaDt1QQ/viewform">apply to our private beta</a>. We’re working closely with each private beta user to not only help them learn Rama, but also actively helping code, optimize, and test.</p>
