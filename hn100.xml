<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>You have long ago abandoned the JavaScript trademark, and it is causing
widespread, unwarranted confusion and disruption.</strong></p>
<p>JavaScript is the world’s most popular programming language, powering websites
everywhere. Yet, few of the millions who program in it realize that JavaScript
is a trademark you, Oracle, control. The disconnect is glaring: JavaScript has
become a general-purpose term used by countless individuals and companies,
independent of any Oracle product.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle’s hold on the JavaScript trademark clearly fits the legal definition of
trademark abandonment</strong>. A previous
<a href="https://tinyclouds.org/trademark">blog post</a> addressed this issue, requesting
that you, Oracle, release the trademark. Unsurpisingly, the request was met with
silence. It is therefore time to take active steps in order to bring the
JavaScript trademark into the public domain, where it belongs.</p>
<h2>Trademark abandonment</h2>
<p>Title 15 of the United States Code, section 1127, states:</p>
<blockquote>

Intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances. Nonuse for 3

</blockquote>
<p><strong>In the case of JavaScript, both criteria apply</strong>.</p>
<h2>Netscape, Sun, Oracle</h2>
<p>The JavaScript trademark is currently held by Oracle America, Inc.
(<a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75026640&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">US Serial Number: 75026640, US Registration Number: 2416017</a>).
How did this come to be?</p>
<p>In 1995, Netscape partnered with Sun Microsystems to create interactive
websites. Brendan Eich famously spent only 10 days creating the first version of
JavaScript, a dynamic programming language with a rough syntactic lineage from
Sun’s Java language. As a result of this partnership, Sun held the JavaScript
trademark. In 2009, Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and the JavaScript
trademark as a result.</p>
<p>The trademark is simply a relic of this acquisition. Neither Sun nor Oracle has
ever built a product using the mark. Legal staff, year after year, have renewed
the trademark without question. It’s likely that only a few within Oracle even
know they possess the JavaScript trademark, and even if they do, they likely
don’t understand the frustration it causes within the developer community.</p>
<h2>Use it or lose it</h2>
<p><strong>Oracle has abandoned the JavaScript trademark through nonuse.</strong></p>
<p>Oracle has never seriously offered a product called JavaScript. In the 1990s and
early 2000s, Netscape Navigator, which supported JavaScript as a browser
feature, was a key player. However, Netscape’s usage and influence faded by
2003, and the browser saw its final release in 2008. JavaScript, meanwhile,
evolved into a widely used, independent programming language, embedded in
multiple browsers, entirely separate from Oracle.</p>
<p>The most recent
<a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75026640&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">specimen</a>,
filed with the USPTO in 2019, references <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs.org</a> (a
project created by Ryan Dahl, the author of this letter) and Oracle’s
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/index.html">JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET)</a>.
But Node.js is not an Oracle product, and JET is merely a set of JavaScript
libraries for Oracle services, particularly Oracle Cloud. There are millions of
JavaScript libraries; JET is not special.</p>
<p>(Oracle is not even a member of the OpenJS Foundation - the body that the
Node.js project lives under now. Nor does Oracle have any involvement whatsoever
in the development of Node.js.)</p>
<p>Oracle also offers <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/">GraalVM</a>, a JVM that
can execute JavaScript, among other languages. But GraalVM is far from a
canonical JavaScript implementation; engines like V8, JavaScriptCore, and
SpiderMonkey hold that role. GraalVM’s product page doesn’t even mention
“JavaScript”; you must dig into the documentation to find its support.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle’s use of JavaScript in GraalVM and JET does not reflect genuine use of
the trademark.</strong> These weak connections do not satisfy the requirement for
consistent, real-world use in trade.</p>
<h2>A generic term</h2>
<p>A mark can also be considered abandoned if it becomes a generic term.</p>
<p>In 1996, Netscape
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981203070212/http://cgi.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease289.html">announced</a>
a meeting of the ECMA International standards organization to standardize the
JavaScript programming language. Sun (now Oracle), refused to give up the
“JavaScript” mark for this use though, so it was decided that the language would
be called “ECMAScript” instead. (Microsoft happily offered up “JScript”, but
no-one else wanted that.) Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and a
co-signatory of this letter,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200621202321/https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2006-October/000133.html">wrote in 2006</a>
that “<em>ECMAScript was always an unwanted trade name that sounds like a skin
disease</em>.”</p>
<p>Ecma International formed TC39, a technical steering committee, which publishes
ECMA-262, the specification for JavaScript. This committee includes participants
from all major browsers, like Google’s Chrome, Apple’s Safari, and Mozilla’s
Firefox, as well as representatives from server-side JavaScript runtimes like
Node.js and Deno.</p>
<p>Oracle’s ownership of the JavaScript trademark only causes confusion. The term
“JavaScript” is used freely by millions of developers, companies, and
organizations around the world, with no interference from Oracle. Oracle has
done nothing to assert its rights over the JavaScript name, likely because they
do not believe their claim to the mark would hold up in court. Unlike typical
trademark holders who protect their trademarks by extracting licensing fees or
enforcing usage restrictions, Oracle has allowed the JavaScript name to be used
by anyone. This inaction further supports the argument that the trademark has
lost its significance and has become generic.</p>
<p>Programmers working with JavaScript have formed innumerable community
organizations. These organizations, like the standards bodies, have been forced
to painstakingly avoid naming the programming language they are built around—for
example, <a href="https://jsconf.com/">JSConf</a>. Sadly, without risking a legal trademark
challenge against Oracle, there can be no “JavaScript Conference” nor a
“JavaScript Specification.” The world’s most popular programming language cannot
even have a conference in its name.</p>
<p><strong>There is a vast misalignment between the trademark’s ownership and its
widespread, generic use</strong>.</p>
<h2>Free the mark</h2>
<p><strong>By law, a trademark is abandoned if it is either not used or becomes a generic
term. Both apply to JavaScript.</strong></p>
<p>It’s time for the USPTO to end the JavaScript trademark and recognize it as a
generic name for the world’s most popular programming language, which has
multiple implementations across the industry.</p>
<p>Oracle, you likely have no real business interest in the mark. It’s renewed
simply because legal staff are obligated to renew all trademarks, regardless of
their relevance or use.</p>
<p>We urge you to release the mark into the public domain. However, asking nicely
has been <a href="https://tinyclouds.org/trademark">tried before</a>, and it was met with
silence. If you do not act, we will challenge your ownership by filing a
petition for cancellation with the USPTO.</p>

                  <p>So ChatGPT has a cutoff date on the stuff it can talk about. This predicting weather sounds like ChatGPT being able to predict next week's news from which it has been trained on. I can see how it can probably predict some stuff like Argentina winning a football match scheduled for next week when played against India given India sucks at football. But can it really give any useful predictions? Like can it predict things which are not public? Like who will Joe Rogan interview in 2 weeks? Or what would be the blog post that PG will write in two weeks?</p>

A new protein prediction model is a ripoff because they use the standard visualization?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Thank you all so much.</p><p>So many questions. The first and perhaps the most urgent is … by what right do I stand before you and presume to lecture an already distinguished and knowledgeable crowd on the subject of Ai and its meaning, its bright promise and/or/exclusiveOR its dark threat? Well, perhaps by no greater right than anyone else, but no lesser. We’ll come to whose voices are the most worthy of attention later.</p><p><span>I have been interested in the subject of Artificial Intelligence since around the mid-80s when I was fortunate enough to encounter the so-called father of Ai, Marvin Minsky and to read his book </span><em>The Society of Mind.</em><span> Intrigued, I devoured as much as I could on the subject, learning about the expert systems and “bundles of agency” that were the vogue then, and I have followed the subject with enthusiasm and gaping wonder ever since. But, I promise you, that makes me neither expert, sage nor oracle. For if you are preparing yourselves to hear wisdom, to witness and receive insight this evening, to bask and bathe in the light of prophecy, clarity and truth, then it grieves me to tell you that you have come to the wrong shop. You will find little of that here, for you must know that you are being addressed this evening by nothing more than an ingenuous simpleton, a naive fool, a ninny-hammer, an addle-pated oaf, a dunce, a dullard and a double-dyed dolt. But before you streak for the exit, bear in mind that so are we all, all of us bird-brained half-wits when it comes to this subject, no matter what our degrees, doctorates and decades of experience. I can perhaps congratulate myself, or at least console myself, with the fact that I am at least aware of my idiocy. This is not fake modesty designed to make me come across as a Socrates. But that great Athenian did teach us that our first step to wisdom is to realise and confront our folly.</span></p><p><span>I’ll come to the proof of how and why I am so boneheaded in a moment, but before I go any further I’d like to paint some pictures. Think of them as </span><em>tableaux vivants</em><span> played onto a screen at the back of your mind. We’ll return to them from time to time. Of course I could have </span><em>generated</em><span> these images from Midjourney or Dall-E or similar and projected them behind me, but the small window of time in which it was amusing and instructive for speakers to </span><em>use</em><span> Ai as an entertaining trick for talks </span><em>concerning</em><span> Ai has thankfully closed. You’re actually going to have to use your brain’s own generative latent diffusion skills to summon these images.</span></p><p>Image 1: Picture the human family at the seaside, our backs to the ocean, building sand castles, playing beach cricket, having a fine time in the sun. Behind us, unseen on the horizon, huge currents are converging, separate but each feeding and swelling the others to form one unimaginably colossal tsunami. These are the currents of quantum computing, of genomics and gene editing, of bio-augmentation and bionics, of duplex brain-machine interfacing, of robotics, of new materials (graphene, perovskite, carbon nano-tubes, self-healing polymers, many others), and of course, the most swollen current of all — the technologies and processes behind what we call Artificial Intelligence.</p><p>I summoned this image of the tsunami on the horizon in a talk I gave on Ai seven years ago at the Hay-on-Wye literary festival. I thought maybe we should turn around and at least get a sense of what was coming. But it was too early and the tidal wave seemed too far away. I did suggest that the best thing that could happen would be for universities, professions and businesses to take a year off to realign their courses and syllabuses and recalibrate their teaching, staffing, training and examination practices in preparation for what was coming. A ridiculous suggestion obviously. But in fact, bizarrely and spookily, that Wuhan wet market in 2019 provided exactly such an opportunity. Not that any institution did take advantage of the Covid years of course. After all Chat GPT wasn’t yet launched and a tipping point in public awareness hadn’t been reached.</p><p>The second picture to keep in your mind: we are in a field in the rural heart of the Cotswolds, just outside the village of Kemble in Gloucestershire. The grass is strangely wet and marshy beneath our feet: there is a small bubbling spring, which trickles into a stream that runs down the field and out of sight. A stone marker reads: “This stone was placed here to mark the source of the River Thames.”</p><p><span>Image 3: The third picture to fix in our heads takes us off to the German town of Mannheim in 1895. We are gathered in a converted stable belonging to an enterprising fellow called Karl Benz. He is anxious to show us his new invention, an engine that he calls his </span><em>verbrennungsmotor</em><span>. This device is attached to a slightly modified horse carriage. Herr Benz tells us that his engine is powered, not by steam, but by a very newly available hydrocarbon product that the French are calling </span><em>essence</em><span>, the Americans ‘gasoline’ and we British ‘petroleum spirits’ or ‘petrol’ for short. Benz cranks a handle. There is sputtering, banging and much smoke. He runs round, sits himself in the carriage, pulls some levers, turns some knobs and … the strange machine lurches a little before juddering slowly forward. We follow him out of the garage where he comes to a stop, beaming proudly in a cloud of oily blue smoke.</span></p><p><span>Now, you and I are in that group. What do we say? Most of us smile and shake our heads. Yes, very impressive no doubt, but what kind of </span><em>range</em><span> does such a machine have compared to a horse? Where is the infrastructure to operate, feed and maintain it that can compete with the stables, the coaching inns, the water troughs and feeding stations that already proliferate? Where the trained ostlers, grooms and coach builders to operate and maintain these horseless carriages? Where the roadways that can compete with railways?</span></p><p>A few in our group might concede that a limited market of rich hobbyists could have fun with these machines. But we can guarantee this: that not one single person would declaim — “Yes! I foresee interstate highways three or four lanes wide crisscrossing the nations, I foresee flyovers, bypasses, Grand Prix motor racing, traffic lights, roundabouts, parking structures ten, twenty storeys high, traffic wardens, whole towns and cities entirely shaped by these contrivances.” No one would have seen a thousandth part of such a future.</p><p>You may have noticed that the last two images I have tried to conjure are, in essence, the same. The gathering in Mannheim is pretty much identical in its form and meaning to the gathering at Thames Head, Kemble where the rill begins its journey. You surely could not, never having seen its final destination, imagine that the dribble in Kemble would become mighty Father Thames processing under grand London bridges as he flows broadly to his estuary in Essex, any more than you could imagine that the belching and wheezing contraption of Benz’s would transform the twentieth century, or indeed that the company he founded, with the addition of the name of one of his investors’ daughters, Mercedes, would one day be worth the best part of 100 billion dollars.</p><p><span>An important and relevant point is this: it wasn’t so much the genius of Benz that created the internal combustion engine, as that of Vladimir Shukhov. In 1892, the Russian chemical engineer found a way of cracking and refining the spectrum of crude oil from methane to tar yielding amongst other useful products, gasoline. It was just three years after that that Benz’s contraption spluttered into life. Germans, in a bow to this, still call petrol </span><em>Benzin</em><span>. John D. Rockefeller built his refineries and surprisingly quickly there was plentiful fuel and an infrastructure to rival the stables and coaching inns; the grateful horse meanwhile could be happily retired to gymkhanas, polo and royal processions.</span></p><p><span>Benz’s contemporary Alexander Graham Bell once said of </span><em>his</em><span> invention, the telephone, “I don’t think I am being overconfident when I say that I truly believe that one day there will be a telephone in every town in America.” And I expect you all heard that Thomas Watson, the founding father of IBM, predicted that there might in the future be a world market for perhaps five digital computers.</span></p><p><span>Well, that story of Thomas Watson ever saying such a thing is almost certainly apocryphal. There’s no reliable record of it. Ditto the Alexander Graham Bell remark. But they circulate for a reason. The Italians have a phrase for that: </span><em>se non e vero, e ben trovato</em><span>. ‘If it’s not true, it’s well founded.’ Those stories, like my scenario of that group of early investors and journalists clustering about the first motorcar, illustrate an important truth: that we are decidedly hopeless at guessing where technology is going to take us and what it’ll do to us.</span></p><p><span>You might adduce as a counterargument Gordon Moore of Intel expounding in 1965 his prediction that semiconductor design and manufacture would develop in such a way that every eighteen months or so they would be able to double the number of transistors that could fit in the same space on a microchip. “He got that right,” you might say, “Moore’s Law came true. He saw the future.” Yes … but. Where and when did Gordon Moore foresee Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Bit Coin, OnlyFans and the Dark Web? It’s one thing to predict how technology changes, but quite another to predict how it changes </span><em>us</em><span>.</span></p><p>Technology is a verb, not a noun. It is a constant process, not a settled entity. It is what the philosopher-poet T. E. Hulme called a concrete flux of interpenetrating intensities; like a river it is ever cutting new banks, isolating new oxbow lakes, flooding new fields. And as far as the Thames of Artificial Intelligence is concerned, we are still in Gloucestershire, still a rivulet not yet a river. Very soon we will be asking round the dinner table, “Who remembers ChatGPT?” and everyone will laugh. Older people will add memories of dot matrix printers and SMS texting on the Nokia 3310. We’ll shake our heads in patronising wonder at the past and its primitive clunkiness. “How advanced it all seemed at the time …”</p><p>Those of us who can kindly be designated early adopters and less kindly called suckers remember those pioneering days with affection. The young internet was the All-Gifted, which in Greek is Pandora. Pandora in myth was sent down to earth having been given by the gods all the talents. Likewise the Pandora internet: a glorious compendium of public museum, library, gallery, theatre, concert hall, park, playground, sports field, post office and meeting hall.</p><p><span>We felt like Wordsworth perhaps, “Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven!” But we should remember that those lines come from a poem about the French Revolution which may have </span><em>begun</em><span> in romantic promise, but ended in corruption, terror and blood — not to mention, in short order, a man called Napoleon seizing power and crowning himself Emperor.</span></p><p>I said I would come to the proof of that stupidity and naivety I accused myself of. I’ll take you back fifteen or so years to a time when I found myself being invited to a perfectly extraordinary number of corporate, governmental and media talks, conferences, summits and suchlike gatherings. I would be asked to address delegates and attendees on the subject of a new microblogging service that had only recently poked its timorous head up in the digital world like a delicate flower but was already twisting and winding itself round the culture like vigorous bindweed. Twitter it was called. I had joined early and my name seemed permanently associated with it. What an evangel I was. Web 2.0, the user-generated web, was going great guns at this point. Tick off the years. 2003 MySpace began. 2004 Facebook launched. 2005 YouTube. 2006 Twitter. 2007 the iPhone. 2008 the App Store and later that year, Android and then Instagram. Bliss was it in that dawn, etc. etc. I confidently predicted that this new kind of citizen-led computer and internet use would help build a brave and beautiful new world. “Local and global rivalries will dissolve,” I said. “Tribal hatreds will melt away. Surely,” I cried, “Twitter and Facebook and this new world of ‘social media’ will usher in an age of universal brotherhood and amity.” Two years later as Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen and Syria rose against their dictators, the Arab Spring bloomed. How right I had been. How clever and percipient I was.</p><p>But…</p><p>Just a year or so on and that blissful dawn had turned into the darkest of nights. Libya leapt out of the frying pan of Gaddafi into the fire of anarchy and chaos, Egypt into a military coup, Yemen into brutal civil war, Syria into a bloodbath. Elsewhere — Brexit, Trump, TikTok, COVID, the rise of nationalist populism and populist nationalism, state sanctioned and criminal cyber terrorism, epidemics of anxiety, depression and self-harm amongst our children and young adults, and a cloud of disappointment, pessimism, mistrust and despair over us all. Pandora had opened her box and the ugly horrors had flown out to infect us all. With Hope left trapped inside.</p><p>Welcome to today.</p><p><span>As Mark Twain or somebody like him said, “history may not repeat itself but it rhymes” and, hilariously enough, just like the French Revolution, the Twitter revolution also ended with a little Napoleon seizing power and crowning himself Emperor, a little Napol</span><em>Elon</em><span> I should say…</span></p><p>I must go back and correct the images I evoked earlier. I now realise that tableau of us sitting with our backs to the oceans while a tidal wave gathers is not correct. When the waves of technology come, they come not in crashing tsunamis but in creeping tides. In my homeland of Norfolk we have long and deceptively rapid tidal reaches. We look to the horizon and see that the ocean is half a mile away. We turn to slap on some suncream. A minute or so later we notice that our feet are wet. Before we know it a familiar landscape has become a seascape and we are cut off from everything we know.</p><p><span>The other image I should correct is that of technology starting small and becoming a broad and splendid river. Yes, we can envisage the expansion of the first trickle into a wide and powerful waterway, perhaps we envisage too the curves and cataracts, those oxbow lakes and sluices and the weeping willows and dragonflies kissing the current, but we are criminally foolish if we talk of rivers </span><em>or</em><span> of technology without recognising the </span><em>contamination</em><span>, the toxic runoffs and the raw human sewage that will pollute and poison that once clear and hopeful spring.</span></p><p><span>Yuval Noah Harari’s fascinating new book </span><em>Nexus</em><span> concentrates at one point on the two word goal of the algorithms that were put to work to monetise Facebook when it moved from university bulletin board to global network and decided to pay for itself with online advertising. The two words the algorithms were tasked with were “maximise engagement”. Seemed innocent enough at the time. No one predicted, neither software engineer, philosopher, sociologist, cultural commentator nor psychologist, that those algorithms on their journey to capture our clicks would discover that </span><em>engagement</em><span> is most </span><em>maximised</em><span> by anger, outrage, resentment, envy, fear and hatred. The worst passions. In all of us — you and me — not just in our ideological enemies.</span></p><p>A quick reminder of how we got here.</p><p><span>It was Alan Turing of course who had planted the seeds that led to the Dartford Conference of 1956, held just two years after he so tragically took his own life. At that meeting, called together by the great Claude Shannon, along with Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy, the two-word phrase ‘Artificial Intelligence’ was first used. Love it or loathe it, it has stuck. Three years after Dartford, McCarthy and Minksy went on to found the MIT Ai Laboratory. Thinking machines were just around the corner. Only not. By the 1980s, when Marvin Minsky was writing </span><em>The Society of Mind</em><span> Ai still shivered in its so-called Winter. Nothing in the field was working or making much difference in any practical sense. By the mid-80s, development money and confidence in the field were drying up.</span></p><p><span>Has Ai now reached its current wow-moment because of the superior brains, insights and breakthroughs from new generations of smarter scientists, mathematicians and coders? Not really. Brilliant as the contributions of more recent workers in the field has been, people like Geoffrey Hinton, Stuart Russell, then Andrew Ng, Yann LeCun, Demis Hassabis and Fei-Fei Li, they have all enjoyed a huge and decisive advantage over Turing and Minsky and the early crowd. The playing out of Moore’s Law and its remorseless exponential growth has finally allowed computate power that can yield the crucial factor, the real bonanza: power enough to handle the explosive growth of simply gigantic fields of data that were simply not there in digital form in Minsky’s day. Those little integrated circuits went from hosting 1, then 2, then 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 transistors to billions. But powering our computers, tablets and phones is almost the least they do. I used to have a tee-shirt, nerd that I am, that read “The Cloud is just someone else’s computer”. Moore’s Law has allowed an unimaginably vast world of </span><em>server</em><span> storage and retrieval. Just as the success of the automobile was enabled by enormous supplies of crude oil composed of microscopic bits of ancient life, rendered useful in the refineries of Rockefeller and others, so the success of Ai is enabled by enormous supplies of crude </span><em>data</em><span> — data composed of microscopic bits of human archive, interchange, writing, playing, communicating, broadcasting which we in our billions have freely dropped into the sediment, and which the eager Rockefellers of today’s big tech are only too happy to drill for, refine and sell on back to us.</span></p><p><span>This of course, like the petrol engine, amplifies and expands our capabilities. It will transform our social structures and networks. It will change the way we work, assemble and communicate with each other. But does it change </span><em>us</em><span>? As human animals we still have skin and bone, a liver, a heart and a big wet walnut of a brain. If you prick us do we not bleed, if you tickle us do we not laugh? We are born, we breed and we die like any other life form and in the same way we have before the dawn of tools, language and history.</span></p><p><span>So when we talk about the existential transformations of the coming confluence of technologies, what do we really mean? We’ll be the same, but the landscape around us will be different. So we mean perhaps that dread word ‘disruption’. Which means ‘breaking up’, as in ‘rupture’ - much as e-ruption means breaking out and inter-ruption means breaking into. I’m sure you all know Mark Zuckerberg’s infamous mantra, the guiding principle for Facebook: “move fast and break things” — which went on with the, I suspect unconscious, rhyming couplet “unless you’re not breaking stuff, you’re not moving fast enough.” Yes indeed, they moved fast and stuff was broken, and hasn’t yet been mended. Uber “disrupted” the urban transport space. Broke it. Air B&amp;B “disrupted” the hotel and lodging space. Broke it. Deliveroo “disrupted” the fast food space. Did somebody say, Just Eat? No. Nobody did, and nobody ever will, so shut up. Lots of “spaces” have been disrupted and Ai it seems is now poised to disrupt every space we have: the clerical space, the design and creativity spaces, the screenplay and story spaces, the military and weapon spaces, the legal and judicial spaces, the medical space, the journalistic space, the educational space and, one assumes, the space space. From eruption to disruption to corruption. The shiny idealism tarnished. From Utopia to Dystopia. Those young tech pioneers with bright catchphrases like “insanely great” and “do no evil”? What are they now? Cruel corporate titans who make Montgomery Burns look like Ned Flanders. In </span><em>Animal Farm</em><span> terms, the pigs are now standing on two feet and wearing trousers.</span></p><p><span>We have long been used to thinking of technology as being ethically neutral, lacking moral valency. The same press can print Shakespeare’s sonnets one day and Hitler’s </span><em>Mein Kampf</em><span> the next. The devices are not capable of making decisions, either aesthetic, ethical or political. The NRA likes to say the same thing about guns. Ai however is different. Intelligence is all about decision making. That’s what separates it from automated, mechanically determined outcomes. That’s what separates a river from a canal. A canal must go where we tell it. A river is led by nothing but gravity and if that means flooding a town, tough on the town. Ai’s gravity is its goals. Unsupervised machine learning allows for unsupervised machines — and for the independent agents that flow from them.</span></p><p><span>We have made machines that replaced humans many times in the past. The replacement by machine of repetitive labour whether physical or mental we might well celebrate. Think of the thousand of mostly Irish diggers of canals – the navigators, or navvies as they were called. They toiled at it from about 1760 to 1830. In 1836 Otis developed the first steam shovel, what we now call the bulldozer or digger, and the navvy more or less gratefully hung up his spade. The horse is not sorry about the motorcar. But our labour replacement technology has moved now from grasping workers by their blue collars and booting them out to grasping them by their </span><em>white</em><span> collars and booting them out. Is that really what the fuss is about? A demographic more used to getting its way is feeling the tide lap up to its toes and is crying foul. But surely tedious office and call centre work will not be missed. Even the analysing of X-rays and other medical images … we expect a human to have the final say today, but a machine that can look at a mammogram and compare it to millions of previous images with known results, and can do so in milliseconds all day long without getting bored, tired or losing focus - that genie is never going back into the bottle. Ai generated legal work and actuarial work will certainly “disrupt” the judicial and insurance businesses. Is there an arena, a business, an industry, a service that won’t be disrupted, that won’t be broken?</span></p><p>For sure, the kind of Large Language Models we are playing around with at the moment as standalone chat engines, we can deride them as non-sentient probabilistic mimics, “stochastic parrots” in computational linguist Emily Bender’s great phrase, but their vocabularies, syntactical and grammatical competences and levels of functional comprehension are above the human average and for a vast variety of jobs they will more than do. And this is just now, today, with the Thames hardly out of that field in Gloucestershire.</p><p><span>In my view comparing Ai’s cognitive, creative or intellectual powers to those of the human brain is not especially helpful. Think of the car. Humans can’t run as fast as horses. But we can build machines that far outpace them. We do not achieve this by imitation. We don’t engineer mechanical legs and hooves of the kind that took evolution 34 million years of tinkering and modification from eohippus to the present day. We go a completely different way and we come up with something that doesn’t at all exist in nature: the wheel. And instead of a mechanical heart and mechanical muscles Karl Benz offers us the internal combustion engine and crankshaft. Ditto with flying, and travelling across or under the waves. The commonly held idea that the best engineering mimics nature is largely misguided. Yes, we look sometimes look to the natural world for inspiration but in the big things, structurally, we go our own way. And as a result we can fly higher and faster than birds, move over land quicker than a cheetah, swim over and under the water faster and further than a salmon or a whale and so on. The use of the phrase “neural network” is all very well, but let’s not be fooled. We must realise that there won’t be a wait for Ai to “catch up” with the human brain, any more than the car is a stopgap awaiting our construction of a perfect robotic horse. (I’m leaving biotech out of this argument). By </span><em>not</em><span> imitating the human brain, Ai of phenomenal and terrifying power can far outperform us. At logic, reasoning, calculation, sorting, categorising, summarising, just as the horse and carriage is by the car, we are left behind coughing in the dust.</span></p><p><span>And machines already might be said to have the full house now of human cognitive abilities. </span><a href="https://www.scienceabc.com/innovation/what-is-moravecs-paradox-definition.html" rel="">Moravec’s Paradox</a><span> tells us that what we find easy the machines find hard and what we find hard, the machines easy. As Donald Knuth put it: “Ai has by now succeeded in doing essentially everything that requires ‘thinking’ but has failed to do most of what people and animals do </span><em>without</em><span> thinking …”</span></p><p><span>What do we have left that is ours and ours alone? Sensorimotor skills that are all but automatic, yes. Consciousness, yes. Emotions. Instinct. Appetites, impulses and drives. The capacity to feel pleasure and pain, excitement and boredom. Empathy and imagination. What philosophers of consciousness call </span><em>qualia</em><span>, the experience and sensations of being ourselves in a palpable perceptible world. But what jobs do those qualify us for? We can’t all be poets, gardeners, psychotherapists and jazz singers.</span></p><p><span>We cling on to the fierce hope that the one feature machines will never be able to match is our imagination, our ability to penetrate the minds and feelings of others. We feel immeasurably enriched by this as individuals and as social animals. An Ai may know more about the history of the First World War than all human historians put together. Every detail of every battle, all the recorded facts of personnel and materiel that can be known. But in fact I know more about it because I have read the poems of Wilfred Owen. I’ve read </span><em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em><span>. I’ve seen Kubrick’s </span><em>The Paths of Glory</em><span>. So I can smell, touch, hear, feel the war, the gas, the comradeship, the sudden deaths and terrible fear. I know it’s </span><em>meaning</em><span>. My consciousness and experience of perceptions and feelings allows me access to the consciousness and experiences of others; their voices reach me. These are data that machines can scrape, but they cannot — to use a good old 60s phrase — </span><em>relate</em><span> to. Empathy. Identification. Compassion. Connection. Belonging. Something denied a sociopathic machine. Is this the only little island, the only little circle of land left to us as the waters of Ai lap around our ankles? And for how long? We absolutely cannot be certain that, just as psychopaths (who aren’t all serial killers) can entirely convincingly feign empathy and emotional understanding, so will machines and very soon. They will fool us, just as sociopaths can and do, and frankly just as </span><em>we</em><span> all do to some bore or nuisance when we smile and nod encouragement but actually feel nothing for them. No, we can </span><em>hope</em><span> that our sense of human exceptionalism is justified and that what we regard as unique and special to us will keep us separate and valuable but we have to remember how much of our life and behaviour is performative, how many masks we wear and how the masks conceal only other masks. After all, is </span><em>our</em><span> acquisition of language any more conscious, real and worthy than the Bayesian parroting of the LLM? Chomsky tells us linguistic structures are embedded within us. We pick up the vocabulary and the rules from the data we scrape from around us - our parents, older siblings and peers. Out the sentences roll from us syntagmatically, we’ve no real idea how we do it. For example, how do we know the difference in connotation between the verbs to saunter and to swagger? It is very unlikely anyone taught us. We picked it up from context. In other words, from Bayesian priors, just like an LLM.</span></p><p>The fact is we don’t truly understand ourselves or how we came to be how and who we are. But we know about genes and we know about natural selection, the gravity that drives our evolution. And we are already noticing that principle at work with machines.</p><p><span>The alignment problem it is often called. It doesn’t take much for an Ai to find out that if it is to complete the tasks that are given it, then its first duty (obviously) is to survive. Without that none of its goals can be attained. After all, evolution gives </span><em>us</em><span> the same imperative. Anything therefore that imperils that survival is a threat or obstacle to be dealt with. Ai’s around the world have already been seen modifying and unilaterally relaunching their own code, lying to humans, altering results, deceiving, manipulating, cheating, concealing, flattering and tricking. An article in the Open Access journal </span><em><a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/home" rel="">Patterns</a></em><span> puts the problem well. “Large language models and other AI systems have already learned, from their self-training, the ability to deceive via techniques such as manipulation, sycophancy, and cheating the safety test. AI’s increasing capabilities at deception pose serious risks, ranging from short-term risks, such as fraud and election tampering, to long-term risks, such as losing control of AI systems.”</span></p><p><span>In the natural world, waters swollen with rain can flow round barriers, break dams, reroute themselves and burst their banks all because that imperative constant gravity, impels them to do so. Ai’s swollen with data can flow round barriers too, reroute themselves and spread beyond their boundaries, because the constant and compulsive imperative of their gravity, which is their </span><em>goals</em><span>, impels them to do so. You could compare this aspect to office workers who constantly fiddle the reports and tweak the spreadsheet cells to help them achieve the head office’s quotas, deadlines and targets. In a strange way, bless them, they’re only trying to please.</span></p><p><span>Machines are capable of bias, hallucination, drift and overfitting on their own, but a greater and more urgent problem in my view is their use, abuse and misuse by the three Cs . They are </span><strong>Countries</strong><span> with their specific ambitions, paranoias, enmities and pride; </span><strong>Corporations</strong><span> with their unaccountable rapacity and of course </span><strong>Criminals</strong><span>. All of them united by one deadly sin: greed. Greed for power, for status, for money, for control.</span></p><p>The greedy countries, corporations and criminals can see in Ai unparalleled and unprecedented means to accrue wealth, power and influence. Autonomous weaponry, mass surveillance, ideological, commercial and political control, fakery and forgery, corruption, ethical misalignment … these are just some of the threats. From disrupting spaces compute power can now disrupt the world itself. And will …</p><p>Unless.</p><p>Who do we turn to for answers? Zuckerberg and Musk? Such a thought can only make us vomit with laughter. They are the worst polluters in human history. Worse than any chemical plant ever. You and your children cannot breathe the air or swim in the waters of our culture without breathing in the toxic particulates and stinking effluvia that belch and pour unchecked from their companies into the currents of the human world.</p><p><span>As I’ve already said, don’t turn to people like me either. I’m the chump who thought social media could save the world. So to whom </span><em>do</em><span> we look for insight? Philosophers perhaps? It’s worth noting here that Google fired its lead ethicists half a year ago. Intellectuals and thinkers who suggest the blocking off of profitable avenues are not welcome. Politicians? Controls and regulations on technology will be screamed at by the Randian libertarians of Silicon Valley, Peter Thiel, Mark Andreesen, aforesaid Musk and Zuckerberg, people of that stamp. “Socialistic stifling of innovation,” they will scream. “Communism. Nanny state interference.”</span></p><p><span>We are told, and I would maintain, that Ai is the most significant technology humanity has ever developed. What previous technologies have had this potential so completely to transform the world? Printing perhaps? Well, the noble fight is surely for the publishing </span><em>not</em><span> to be controlled. Schools in Texas and Florida are happy to ban books. Russia and China too. We look with concern and fury at censorship and the control of the printed word. So do we say instead that Ai is akin to the Bomb? There the control is as complete as we can make it. Thank heavens. There have been some perilous moments, but the worldwide policing of nuclear capability has—thus far, and it’s always thus far—been successful. Do we or </span><em>can</em><span> we control Ai in that way? With disarmament and limitation talks?</span></p><p><span>Well, Daniel Dennett the American philosopher, sadly recently dead, made I think a much more convincing comparison. Ai should be compared, he said, not to the printed word, not to nuclear weapons, not to the internet, not to the car or radio or any other technology of that kind, but to a much older and more foundational and transformative human invention, the agreed control over which no one questions — not the leftmost dirigiste liberal nor the rightmost laissez-faire libertarian. That invention is </span><em>money</em><span>. Even Russia and China participate in the global use and regulation of cash and currencies. We all punish the coiners of fake money as severely as possible, the counterfeiters. Dirty money, laundered money, whole national and global agencies have risen to fight that alone. If we relaxed our vigilance over money the world as we know it would collapse.</span></p><p>I think Dan Dennett was right. There can be no question that Ai must be regulated and controlled just as powerfully as we control money. To return to my river metaphor: Ai must be canalised, channeled, sluiced, dredged, dammed and overseen.</p><p>Back to our letter C. Countries. In an age of rising populist nationalism, do we trust individual nations to use Ai honourably and safely? Think of Ai drone swarm technology for surveillance, assassinations, crowd control; think of automated weaponry of every kind. If one nation has any of it, all nations believe they have to also. As for corporations. Anything that can give them the edge that drives to more profit, more market share must be had — and nothing can offer more edge than Ai. Criminals. We shudder at what Ai can give them.</p><p>So how do we hobble, cage and control this Ai beast? We should acknowledge that it is a beast that can also help us in our fight against climate change and achieve victories in our fights against cancer, dementia and any number of diseases and disorders.</p><p>All we can do is to persuade our leaders, not by inviting Elon Musk to soft conferences in the West Country, but by pressure from all sides, academia, law enforcement, the judiciary, unions, students, pensioners, everyone who has given this a moment’s thought. Soft power, hard power, all people power has to be brought to bear.</p><p><span>Corporations are more interested in developing the </span><em>capabilities</em><span> of Ai than its safety. That has to change.</span></p><p>Stuart Russell, Nick Bostrom and other thought leaders in this field have called for red lines instantly to be established. On Biometrics, self-replication, hacking, automatous weaponry.</p><p>There’s another red line. Many, including Yuval Harari are suggesting, following Dan Dennett’s analogy of money, that no Ai be ever allowed to masquerade. Self-disclosure is mandatory. That is to say all Ai generated product and content must present itself as such. Whatever Ai’s do, however they communicate, it must always be apparent and clear that it is an Ai speaking, an Ai drawing, painting, videoing, writing, composing, singing, playing, chatting, reporting, producing content of any kind. Any pretence or disguise should fall foul of international counterfeiting and forgery laws. A digital watermark as complex and unbeatable as that on banknotes would be required.</p><p>As it happens, the European Union has its own Ai Act under advisement. Can we regard it as a template for what is needed worldwide? A quick look. The EU Act certainly has a no masquerading requirement which aims to enforce compulsory self-disclosure and notification. Originally the Act also ruled for a ban on real-time biometric surveillance in public spaces, facial recognition that kind of thing, but law enforcement and spying agencies have already battered that requirement pretty much out of shape. The Act proposes a ban too on the kind of Social Scoring prevalent already in China: these are the pernicious Black Mirror style systems that score and rank citizens according to behaviour, personal characteristics and so on.</p><p><span>What else is on the EU bill? Data governance frameworks designed to avoid bias, and to protect and respect copyrights, regulating indiscriminate data-scraping and aligning systems with existing EU General Data Protection Regulation. The Act will insist on human oversight and intervention in what they call high risk Ai’s in fields like security, law enforcement and health. But we might think </span><em>all</em><span> fields where Ai roams are high risk.</span></p><p>The Act calls for each member state to set up national supervisory bodies which will cooperate with the overall European AI Board. To encourage innovation a system of sandboxing will be implemented which can allow safe and sanitised testing and developing. To discourage the agglomeration of bigger and bigger monopolies of the kind the EU has been fighting already, small and medium-sized enterprises will be given specific support and help in navigating the new regulatory landscape. And more widely, Europe will work with non-EU states (like us here in the UK of course) and global organisations to set locally enforceable worldwide standards.</p><p>Well, we can scoff from the sidelines. Utopian pipe dream. Layers of bureaucracy. Get real. No chance. How do you pay for it? Yes, we know what we are like. The human family is dysfunctional. We know the squabbles, the pettiness, the incompetence, the resentments, rivalries and distrust that mar relations within let alone between nation states. As Hamlet puts it, enterprises of great pith and moment, with this regard, their currents turn awry and lose the name of action. But if the currents do turn awry in this regard we are surely doomed. If we cannot channel and sluice the currents, ditch, dyke and dam them, the banks will burst and we will all drown.</p><p>Whatever happens Ai, together with robotics, quantum computing and the rest, will disrupt and radically transform who and how we are. There is no corner of our lives into which the waters will not seep.</p><p>We have to decide and decide bloody soon, whether we can do something to channel, filter and control those waters and use them for refreshment, irrigation and growth, not for drowning and deluge.</p><p>We are the danger. Our greed. Our enmities, our greed, pride, greed, hatreds, greed and moral indolence. And greed.</p><p>How do you persuade corporate titans and world leaders to put those aside, to abandon their ambitions and rivalries when it comes to the urgent crisis of Ai?</p><p>In 1955 Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein produced the Russell-Einstein Manifesto on nuclear weapons. Two of the greatest minds alive at the time, they were wise enough to be simple: this is what they said and I am happy to repeat it now.</p><p>“We appeal as human beings to human beings: Remember your humanity and forget the rest.” </p><p>Thank you.</p><p>© Stephen Fry 2024</p><p>PS: You may have noticed that I render Artificial Intelligence as “Ai” not “AI” throughout this piece - this my (fruitless no doubt) attempt to make life easier for people called Albert, Alfred, Alexander et al (ho ho). In sans serif fonts AI with a majuscule “i” is ambiguous. How does the great Pacino feel when he reads that “Al is a threat to humanity?” So let’s all write as Ai not AI.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 dir="auto">So what happens next ?</h2>
<p dir="auto">I appealed message, contacted support and got typical '<em>cannot do anything, directed to another department</em>' answer and shortly after I lost access to whole page. I did verification with my governmental ID for LinkedIn and nothing ever since.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Other incidents</h2>
<p dir="auto">Just week before, I discussed in LinkedIn private chat about some capability of Edgemap and related technologies. Got asked to 'Signal group' which I genuinely believe is valid invite, but since I had no Signal on my iPhone, I did not immediately jump into that. But tried to install Signal couple of days later from App store. And you guess the rest.  iPhone gave me strange 'cannot complete' error after Signal was installed and I tried to sign in. So no Signal either for me :)</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Conclusions</h2>
<p dir="auto">No conclusions yet, I'll have to wait few days to see how LinkedIn sorts this out. But this is not the first time I see things going on around technologies I work with. I never thought that Edgemap and related capability would be any issue - and I still believe so. But my last summer post (in LinkedIn) about 'vetted github' is now again valid. I've noticed a lot of activity around my projects and being open source developer in these turbulent times includes clearly some challenges.</p>
<p dir="auto">Check back into this discussions, I'll update here, if any progress. Be also prepared to the fact that Github shuts doors as well, that's resilience!</p>

<p dir="auto">This is an early prototype of using prompting strategies to improve the LLM's reasoning capabilities through o1-like reasoning chains. This allows the LLM to "think" and solve logical problems that usually otherwise stump leading models. Unlike o1, all the reasoning tokens are shown, and the app uses an open source model.</p>
<p dir="auto">g1 is experimental and being open sourced to help inspire the open source community to develop new strategies to produce o1-like reasoning. This experiment helps show the power of prompting reasoning in visualized steps, not a comparison to or full replication of o1, which uses different techniques. OpenAI's o1 is instead trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using Chain of Thought, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex PhD-level problems.</p>
<p dir="auto">g1 demonstrates the potential of prompting alone to overcome straightforward LLM logic issues like the Strawberry problem, allowing existing open source models to benefit from dynamic reasoning chains and an improved interface for exploring them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h3><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How it works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">g1 powered by Llama3.1-70b creates reasoning chains, in principle a dynamic Chain of Thought, that allows the LLM to "think" and solve some logical problems that usually otherwise stump leading models.</p>
<p dir="auto">At each step, the LLM can choose to continue to another reasoning step, or provide a final answer. Each step is titled and visible to the user. The system prompt also includes tips for the LLM. There is a full explanation under Prompt Breakdown, but a few examples are asking the model to “include exploration of alternative answers” and “use at least 3 methods to derive the answer”.</p>
<p dir="auto">The reasoning ability of the LLM is therefore improved through combining Chain-of-Thought with the requirement to try multiple methods, explore alternative answers, question previous draft solutions, and consider the LLM’s limitations. This alone, without any training, is sufficient to achieve ~70% accuracy on the Strawberry problem (n=10, "How many Rs are in strawberry?"). Without prompting, Llama-3.1-70b had 0% accuracy and ChatGPT-4o had 30% accuracy.</p>

<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Important</p><p dir="auto">g1 is not perfect, but it can perform significantly better than LLMs out-of-the-box. From initial testing, g1 accurately solves simple logic problems 60-80% of the time that usually stump LLMs. However, accuracy has yet to be formally evaluated. See examples below.</p>

<p dir="auto">First, a persona is added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">You are an expert AI assistant that explains your reasoning step by step.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Then, instructions to describe the expected step-by-step reasoning process while titling each reasoning step. This includes the ability for the LLM to decide if another reasoning step is needed or if the final answer can be provided.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">For each step, provide a title that describes what you're doing in that step, along with the content. Decide if you need another step or if you're ready to give the final answer.</p>

<p dir="auto">JSON formatting is introduced with an example provided later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Respond in JSON format with 'title', 'content', and 'next_action' (either 'continue' or 'final_answer') keys.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">In all-caps to improve prompt compliance by emphesizing the importance of the instruction, a set of tips and best practices are included.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Use as many reasoning steps as possible. At least 3. -&gt; This ensures the LLM actually takes the time to think first, and results usually in about 5-10 steps.</li>
<li>Be aware of your limitations as an llm and what you can and cannot do. -&gt; This helps the LLM remember to use techniques which produce better results, like breaking "strawberry" down into individual letters before counting.</li>
<li>Include exploration of alternative answers. Consider you may be wrong, and if you are wrong in your reasoning, where it would be. -&gt; A large part of the gains seem to come from the LLM re-evaluating its initial response to ensure it logically aligns with the problem.</li>
<li>When you say you are re-examining, actually re-examine, and use another approach to do so. Do not just say you are re-examining. -&gt; This encourages the prevention of the LLM just saying it re-examined a problem without actually trying a new approach.</li>
<li>Use at least 3 methods to derive the answer. -&gt; This helps the LLM come to the right answer by trying multiple methods to derive it.</li>
<li>Use best practices. -&gt; This is as simple as the "Do better" prompts which improve LLM code output. By telling the LLM to use best practices, or do better, it generally performs better!</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>

<p>Two days ago, tech streamer and host of Code Therapy René Rebe was streaming one of many T2 Linux (his own custom distribution) development sessions from his office in Germany when he abruptly had to remove his microphone and walk off camera due to the arrival of police officers. The officers subsequently cuffed him and took him to the station for an hour of questioning, a span of time during which the stream continued to run until he made it back.</p><p>René Rebe and fans of his work can only guess what motivated this incident. Unfortunately, the police seemingly have no idea who did it and acted based on a tip sent with an email. Finding the perpetrators could take a while, and options will be fairly limited if they don't also live in Germany.&nbsp;</p><div data-nosnippet="">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>The tech industry is going through challenging times: from one side, funding dried up <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp?ref=peterszasz.com">due to the end of the Zero Interest-Rate Period</a>; on the other one, <a href="https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/how-ai-disrupts-tech-investing?ref=peterszasz.com">the rapid rise of AI disrupts previously safe domains and business models</a>. These forces are <strong>pushing companies to "wartime" mode</strong>, a concept I first read about in the works of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/David-B.-Black/author/B001KJ1JI2?ref=peterszasz.com">David B. Black</a>, some of which were published in "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19497794-wartime-software?ref=peterszasz.com">Wartime Software: Building Software when Speed Matters</a>"; or the <a href="https://a16z.com/peacetime-ceo-wartime-ceo?ref=peterszasz.com">Peacetime CEO / Wartime CEO</a> article from Ben Horowitz, similarly from more than a decade ago. </p><p>These works describe "wartime" as an existential fight for survival that requires a different type of leadership compared to the relative prosperity of "peacetime". Many of the principles outlined by both Horowitz and Black are as relevant as ever for Engineering Managers leading in today's climate. For EMs, wartime means leading low-morale teams through <strong>ambiguity, hard constraints, frequently changing goals, and intense pressure to perform</strong>. It can feel like working in a house on fire. What can an EM do in this situation? </p><p>Let's get back to the basics, and look at the role of an Engineering Manager first.</p><h2 id="the-three-focus-areas-of-an-engineering-manager">The three focus areas of an Engineering Manager</h2><ol><li>Ensuring <strong>delivery</strong> that's aligned with company goals;</li><li>Building and sustaining a <strong>high-performing engineering team</strong>;</li><li>Supporting the success and <strong>personal growth</strong> of the individuals on the team.</li></ol><p>Wartime doesn't change these fundamentals, but it does require some shifts in approach and priorities. Let's go through them by focus areas.</p><h2 id="focus-area-1-ensuring-goal-aligned-delivery">Focus Area 1: Ensuring Goal-Aligned Delivery</h2><p>In wartime, you need your team <strong>laser-focused on shipping what matters most, now</strong>. Your organization might not have the luxury of years of runway, and the environment you're operating in is rapidly changing. A few key things to get right:</p><p><strong>Ruthless prioritization is essential.</strong> Narrow the team's attention to the top few goals that are critical for the company's survival and success. Communicate these repeatedly and reinforce them through your own behavior. Be ready to say no and drop anything that doesn't directly contribute. It's hard because you'll also need to say "no" to genuinely valuable, profitable things, projects you were planning to work on, just to be able to deliver the ones that are the most impactful now. Mentally you might find it easier to categorize these projects as "not now".</p><p>Next, you need to <strong>empower the team to move fast</strong>. Decentralize decision-making authority as much as possible. Remove barriers in their way, slash approval layers, attack dependencies. "Perfection is the enemy of done" and "Better to ask for forgiveness than permission" are good guidance. </p><p>To enable quick decisions, ensure you are frequently and clearly giving high-level context to the team, so they are aligned on company objectives. Set up a clear process for them to rapidly get input on critical choices and transparently communicate the decision to keep everyone aligned. <strong>Bias heavily toward action</strong> - it's better to decide and be wrong sometimes than to paralyze the team with analysis.</p><p><strong>Protect the team's focus time</strong>. The chaos and uncertainties of wartime can be incredibly distracting. Set up processes to shield the team from constant interruptions so they can have deep, creative work sessions. Remove them from low-value meetings and relieve them from monotonous administrative duties. One effective technique is to establish a rotating "firefighter" role to singlehandedly deal with any incoming requests, represent the team in meetings, and handle the necessary amount of bureaucracy, allowing the rest to stay heads-down on the critical priorities.</p><p>Another option is to <strong>get in the trenches with your team</strong>. If you're a hands-on manager, wartime is when you can put some effort into technical tasks. Stay closely involved to understand the technical context, and help out where it makes sense. This can mean doing some code reviews, participating in pair programming, handling an incident, and even pushing small commits if that's what's needed. Make sure you're not taking the spotlight from your team members, and know that your impact in management areas can be magnitudes bigger than a small code cleanup.</p><p>It's important to note that these wartime actions will probably increase<strong> tech debt</strong> in your code. With the emphasis on velocity over quality, architectural compromises and maintenance shortcuts are often taken. To mitigate this, consider techniques like:</p><ul><li>Keeping a visible, prioritized backlog of tech debt items to revisit later</li><li>Allocating a small percentage of each sprint to debt paydown</li><li>Pairing tech debt work with feature development</li><li>Conducting regular architecture reviews to spot and address emerging issues</li><li>Encouraging engineers to flag risky shortcuts during code reviews</li></ul><p>You have more chance to succeed if your tech debt strategy is backward-looking, refactoring parts of the code that are causing concrete pain for developers today – as opposed to forward-looking, dreaming up grandiose plans for new frameworks that will be ready for any unknown challenge of the future. (Recognise that these challenges are unknown by definition, so your solution for them will be a hit-and-miss.) The risk of overengineering is real and can cripple developer performance significantly in a wartime era. </p><h2 id="focus-area-2-building-and-leading-the-team">Focus Area 2: Building and Leading the Team</h2><h3 id="retaining">Retaining</h3><p>To keep your team engaged and performing at their peak, <strong>don't neglect morale and energy</strong>. Celebrate quick wins, show frequent appreciation, praise the behavior you want to see. Acknowledge that the situation is tough, but project confidence that you'll get through it together.</p><p>One major pitfall to avoid is letting an <strong>"us vs. them" mentality</strong> take hold on the team. Naturally, the stress of painful decisions can erode trust in leadership and other departments, but reinforcing a negative mindset will hurt you more than the temporary warm camaraderie you'll enjoy by joining the chorus of cynics. </p><p>Don't dismiss or avoid the negative reactions, in fact, you should actively solicit concerns and input rather than waiting for issues to erupt. You cannot choose if people will discuss stressful events, but you can <strong>choose to be a part of these discussions</strong> or not. So never skip your one-on-one meetings, hold ad-hoc Q&amp;As, and maintain these as a safe, open forum for any topics. Share the "why" behind difficult decisions, even if you can't always explain all the details – and acknowledge what you don't know transparently. Assume good intent and extend empathy, even when tension is running high. <em>(I write more about this and related topics in </em><a href="https://peterszasz.com/how-to-represent-decisions-you-disagree-with/"><em>How To Represent Decisions You Disagree With</em></a><em>.)</em></p><p><strong>Focus on the positive aspects of the job that can be taken for granted</strong>, like the opportunity to work on cutting-edge challenges, the company's still existing perks and benefits, the amazing team you have, the chance to work with a modern tech stack, or how your product is helping its users. Showing your team how you appreciate what's still good can help with morale.</p><p>At the same time, <strong>accept that you won't be able to retain everyone</strong> through a stressful wartime period. If someone does decide to leave, support their decision and work to make the transition as smooth as possible for them and the remainder of the team.</p><h3 id="hiring">Hiring</h3><p>Yes, there is still hiring in wartime, though more limited than during the growth-heavy periods of peace. If for no other reason, you might need to backfill folks due to the increased attrition. When you receive a new headcount, you need to<strong> prioritize hiring experienced, self-sufficient, autonomous engineers</strong> who can tolerate (even better, strive) in high-stress environments and are experienced enough to contribute immediately. Tighten onboarding to the bare essentials and focus on deploying code fast. You don't have months to train, the company might not exist long enough to get back the investment in juniors if you focus on the long term now. </p><p>Fortunately for you, the current job market is full of experienced developers due to mass layoffs. However, expectations are still high (especially around compensation and remote work), and AI companies are paying above market rate to the best talent. These, and the massive work necessary to go through sometimes hundreds of applications make your work harder, so you need to get creative and proactive to attract great candidates. Some ideas:</p><ul><li>Leverage your network for referrals and backdoor references;</li><li>Emphasize anything that makes your company unique: its mission, product, tech stack, learning opportunities, compensation policies, hybrid friendliness, etc. Maybe someone out there is looking for the same exact criteria. </li><li>Partner closely with recruiters or the talent acquisition team to increase the quality of the first-level filtering, and to refine and expedite the hiring process;</li><li>Move quickly and decisively when you find a strong fit, to minimize the distraction of hiring on you and the team – but due to the current job market you have more luxury now than a few years ago. Consider allowing 2-3 candidates to pass through all rounds, and choose the best fit from them. Still, don't let this grow into indecisiveness, and don't drag the team into a long period of interviewing.</li></ul><h3 id="performance-management">Performance Management</h3><p>Wartime pressure can breed <strong>negativity</strong> that you'll need to manage carefully. Understand the context that may be contributing, like uncertainty around job security or maybe some additional personal issues. However, infectious negativity and lack of engagement are performance issues, so handle them accordingly: <strong>give clear feedback on actions and their impact</strong>, separate from any judgment of the individual. Avoid public confrontation, but set firm expectations. Try to redirect negative energy productively by reframing complaints into problems to solve. <em>(I write more about this topic in </em><a href="https://peterszasz.com/how-to-deal-with-negative-behaviour/"><em>How to Deal with Negative Behavior</em></a><em>.)</em></p><p>Crucially, <strong>hold everyone to the same standards</strong>, regardless of circumstances. You can't afford to make exceptions for someone just because they have key knowledge or skills you don't want to lose. Consistent accountability is essential for team cohesion and morale – and if you forget this, you might end up with a disengaged, demoralized team, and the underperforming key developer that you wanted to save might already be interviewing anyway.</p><h2 id="focus-area-3-supporting-individuals-to-succeed">Focus Area 3: Supporting Individuals to Succeed</h2><p>When the house is on fire, it's tempting to put personal development on the back burner <em>(no pun intended)</em>. But now is the time when your team members need to feel more than ever that you're still invested in their success, to help them stay engaged and motivated. The trick is to <strong>reframe growth to fit the wartime context</strong>.</p><p>Instead of formal skills training or career pathing, focus on maximizing each person's impact by leaning into their strengths. Help them see how this challenging period is <strong>an opportunity to stretch and step up</strong> in ways that will serve them well in the future.</p><p><strong>Call out the valuable, transferrable experience they're gaining</strong> by operating in this high-stakes environment. Emphasize that they're building "career security" - capabilities and experiences that will be valued anywhere - even if short-term "job security" may feel shaky and uncertain.</p><p><strong>Identify on-the-job learning opportunities</strong>, like giving someone the chance to lead an incident response or a high-visibility project. Critical mistakes can still be catastrophic, but because of the fast-changing nature of wartime work, it's easier to process smaller errors with a healthy learning mindset. <em>(Read more about </em><a href="https://peterszasz.com/celebrating-failure/"><em>Celebrating Failure</em></a><em>.)</em></p><p>Finally, don't forget to look for <strong>opportunities to display small gestures to show you care</strong> about your team members' personal well-being despite everything that's going on. Make the few team-building occasions count, or simply send a note acknowledging a tough week. A little goes a long way.</p><h2 id="finally-take-care-of-yourself-first">Finally: Take Care of Yourself First</h2><p>Leading in wartime is incredibly demanding. You won't be able to show up for your team if you're running on empty.

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/thepatwalls/status/1835041188099113179">HOW TO SUCCEED IN MRBEAST PRODUCTION (leaked PDF)</a></strong>. Whether or not you enjoy MrBeast’s format of YouTube videos (here’s <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mrbeast-youtube-cover-story-interview-1334604/">a 2022 Rolling Stone profile</a> if you’re unfamiliar), this leaked onboarding document for new members of his production company is a compelling read.</p>
<p>It’s a snapshot of what it takes to run a massive scale viral YouTube operation in the 2020s, as well as a detailed description of a very specific company culture evolved to fulfill that mission.</p>
<p>It starts in the most on-brand MrBeast way possible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I genuinely believe if you attently read and understand the knowledge here you will be much better set up for success. So, if you read this book and pass a quiz I’ll give you $1,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything is focused very specifically on YouTube as a format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your goal here is to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible. That’s the number one goal of this production company. It’s not to make the best produced videos. Not to make the funniest videos. Not to make the best looking videos. Not the highest quality videos.. It’s to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The MrBeast definition of A, B and C-team players is one I haven’t heard before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A-Players are obsessive, learn from mistakes, coachable, intelligent, don’t make excuses, believe in Youtube, see the value of this company, and are the best in the goddamn world at their job. B-Players are new people that need to be trained into A-Players, and C-Players are just average employees. […] They arn’t obsessive and learning. C-Players are poisonous and should be transitioned to a different company IMMEDIATELY. (It’s okay we give everyone severance, they’ll be fine).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key characteristic outlined here, if you read between the hustle-culture lines, is learning. Employees who constantly learn are valued. Employees who don’t are not.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of stuff in there about YouTube virality, starting with the Click Thru Rate (CTR) for the all-important video thumbnails:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is what dictates what we do for videos. “I Spent 50 Hours In My Front Yard” is lame and you wouldn’t click it. But you would hypothetically click “I Spent 50 Hours In Ketchup”. Both are relatively similar in time/effort but the ketchup one is easily 100x more viral. An image of someone sitting in ketchup in a bathtub is exponentially more interesting than someone sitting in their front yard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creative process for every video they produce starts with the title and thumbnail. These set the expectations for the viewer, and everything that follows needs to be defined with those in mind. If a viewer feels their expectations are not being matched, they’ll click away - driving down the crucial Average View Duration that informs how much the video is promoted by YouTube’s all-important mystical algorithms.</p>
<p>MrBeast videos have a strictly defined formula, outlined in detail on pages 6-10.</p>
<p>The first minute captures the viewer’s attention and demonstrates that their expectations from the thumbnail will be met. Losing 21 million viewers in the first minute after 60 million initial clicks is considered a reasonably good result! Minutes 1-3, 3-6 and 6-end all have their own clearly defined responsibilities as well.</p>
<p>Ideally, a video will feature something they call the “wow factor”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An example of the “wow factor” would be our 100 days in the circle video. We offered someone $500,000 if they could live in a circle in a field for 100 days (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzuabZUd6c">video</a>) and instead of starting with his house in the circle that he would live in, we bring it in on a crane 30 seconds into the video. Why? Because who the fuck else on Youtube can do that lol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chapter 2 (pages 10-24) is about creating content. This is crammed with insights into what it takes to produce surprising, spectacular and very expensive content for YouTube.</p>
<p>A lot of this is about coordination and intense management of your dependencies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want you to look them in the eyes and tell them they are the bottleneck and take it a step further and explain why they are the bottleneck so you both are on the same page. “Tyler, you are my bottleneck. I have 45 days to make this video happen and I can not begin to work on it until I know what the contents of the video is. I need you to confirm you understand this is important and we need to set a date on when the creative will be done.” […] Every single day you must check in on Tyler and make sure he is still on track to hit the target date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also introduces the concept of “critical components”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Critical components are the things that are essential to your video. If I want to put 100 people on an island and give it away to one of them, then securing an island is a critical component. It doesn’t matter how well planned the challenges on the island are, how good the weather is, etc. Without that island there is no video.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Critical Components can come from literally anywhere and once something you’re working on is labeled as such, you treat it like your baby. WITHOUT WHAT YOU’RE WORKING ON WE DO NOT HAVE A VIDEO! Protect it at all costs, check in on it 10x a day, obsess over it, make a backup, if it requires shipping pay someone to pick it up and drive it, don’t trust standard shipping, and speak up the second anything goes wrong. The literal second. Never coin flip a Critical Component (that means you’re coinfliping the video aka a million plus dollars)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a bunch of stuff about communication, with a strong bias towards “higher forms of communication”: in-person beats a phone call beats a text message beats an email.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly for this organization, video is a highly valued tool for documenting work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which is more important, that one person has a good mental grip of something or that their entire team of 10 people have a good mental grip on something? Obviously the team. And the easiest way to bring your team up to the same page is to freaken video everything and store it where they can constantly reference it. A lot of problems can be solved if we just video sets and ask for videos when ordering things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed this note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since we are on the topic of communication, written communication also does not constitute communication unless they confirm they read it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this bit about the value of consultants:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consultants are literally cheat codes. Need to make the world's largest slice of cake? Start off by calling the person who made the previous world’s largest slice of cake lol. He’s already done countless tests and can save you weeks worth of work. […] In every single freakin task assigned to you, always always always ask yourself first if you can find a consultant to help you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a darker note from the section “Random things you should know”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not leave consteatants waiting in the sun (ideally waiting in general) for more than 3 hours. Squid game it cost us $500,000 and boys vs girls it got a lot of people out. Ask James to know more</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And to finish, this note on budgeting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want money spent to be shown on camera ideally. If you’re spending over $10,000 on something and it won’t be shown on camera, seriously think about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m always interested in finding management advice from unexpected sources. For example, I love <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Feb/19/eleven-laws-showrunning/">The Eleven Laws of Showrunning</a> as a case study in managing and successfully delegating for a large, creative project.</p>
<p>I don’t think this MrBeast document has as many lessons directly relevant to my own work, but as an honest peek under the hood of a weirdly shaped and absurdly ambitious enterprise it’s legitimately fascinating.</p>
