        Mozilla 2023 Annual Report: CEO pay skyrockets, while Firefox Marketshare nosedives    </p><div>
        <p>The Mozilla Foundation has <a href="https://stateof.mozilla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released their latest annual report</a> -- covering the time up through December of 2022 (Mozilla's reporting always lags by one year) -- and something peculiar leaps out of the data:</p><ul><li>The <strong>compensation of the Mozilla CEO has skyrocketed</strong> (by millions)</li><li>While the <strong>Mozilla revenue drops</strong></li><li>And the <strong>Firefox Marketshare takes a nosedive</strong></li></ul><p>While, at first, this seems ridiculously lopsided... perhaps it actually makes sense.</p><p><em>Perhaps</em> the decreasing Firefox marketshare is a good thing, from the Mozilla point of view.</p><h3>Mozilla CEO gets a raise</h3><p>Let's start by looking at the pay of the Mozilla CEO.</p><figure><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2023-12-27/102127/102127_dmnwn924regnp3j_custom.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption>Source: Mozilla Foundation 2022 IRS 990</figcaption></figure><p>That's right.&nbsp; Your eyes do not deceive you.&nbsp; The Mozilla CEO earned $6,903,089 in 2022.&nbsp; Just shy of $7 Million.</p><p>The year prior (2021), the CEO earned $5.6 Million.&nbsp; A <strong><em>raise</em></strong> of $1.3 Million dollars.&nbsp; Not a bad year-on-year increase!</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2023-12-27/102127/102127_ok8f4fnipan7noi_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="353" height="218"></p><p>Now let's take a look at the core performance of Mozilla: The overall revenue, and the marketshare of their core product (Firefox) during that same period.</p><p>If a CEO gets a $1.3 Million dollar raise, surely those numbers will be excellent! &nbsp;... <em>Right?</em></p><p>Turns out... the revenue for Mozilla actually <em>dropped</em> between 2021 and 2022.</p><figure><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2023-12-27/102127/102127_2irjcoofxpocsx6_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="610" height="348"><figcaption>Source: Mozilla Foundation 2022 IRS 990</figcaption></figure><p>To be fair, not a <em>huge</em> drop.&nbsp; Revenue went from $600 Million in 2021 to $593 Million in 2022.&nbsp; Roughly $7 Million lower.&nbsp; A small decrease, percentage wise... but a decrease just the same.</p><h3>The Firefox Nosedive</h3><p>Now let's look at the marketshare of Mozilla's primary product: Firefox.</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2023-12-27/102127/102127_n8chdg6gk3if4gd_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="388" height="240">From the end of 2021 to the end of 2022 (the period during which the Mozilla CEO received a $1.3 Million Dollar raise), Firefox marketshare took a massive tumble.</p><p>Going from (an already declining) 3.79%... down to 3.04%.</p><p>It's almost as if there is an inverse relationship between Firefox Marketshare and Mozilla CEO compensation -- as marketshare goes down... CEO pay goes up by a similar percentage.</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2023-12-27/102127/102127_n8vy8qci5obkq77_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="420" height="260"></p><p>Absolutely wild.</p><h3>Something doesn't add up... or does it?</h3><p>So.&nbsp; What can we learn from all of this?</p><p>Well, for starters, it is clear that Mozilla CEO compensation is <strong><em>not</em></strong> tied to either the success of the Firefox web browser (their current primary product) <strong><em>or</em></strong> to the overall revenue of Mozilla.</p><p>So what, <em>exactly</em>, could be the justification for that massive pay raise?</p><p>Turns out there are two big, measurable goals that Mozilla appears to have... and, at those goals, it is performing <em>exceptionally</em> well:</p><ol><li>Continued increases to overall corporate financial assets.</li><li>Transitioning Mozilla <em>away</em> from Firefox.</li></ol><p>That first goal is rather obvious.&nbsp; Let's be honest, what company doesn't want to have a massive pile of financial assets?</p><p>In 2022, the Mozilla war-chest (total assets) grew to a staggering <strong>$1.3 Billion Dollars</strong> -- up $157 Million from the year prior.&nbsp; A huge increase to their financial assets.</p><figure><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2023-12-27/102127/102127_qnkwb8vtwgx6cf8_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="554" height="357"><figcaption>Source: Mozilla Foundation 2022 IRS 990</figcaption></figure><p>With over half a Billion Dollars in <em>cash</em> alone.&nbsp; That's a lot of cheddar.</p><p>But that's only part of the story.</p><h3>The De-Firefox-ification of Mozilla</h3><p>Let's take another look at the 2022 revenue breakdown.</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2023-12-27/102127/102127_2lxxy1bxxwthsyp_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="571" height="326"></p><p><br>Note that revenue from "Royalties" is down substantially -- a decrease of $17 Million.&nbsp; Those "Royalties" are, in large part, made up of default search engine placement, within Firefox, for one single customer... Google.&nbsp; This decrease makes sense considering the signficant decline in Firefox marketshare.</p><p>But then look at the second row: <strong>"Subscription and advertising revenue"</strong>.</p><p>What is that, exactly? &nbsp;That line item includes some of the more recently launched subscription services -- "Pocket Premium" and "Mozilla VPN" (plus some advertising placement). &nbsp;And, you'll note, <em>that</em> revenue jumped from $56 Million to $75 Million in 2022.</p><p>While that may be a drop in the bucket of the overall Mozilla revenue and war-chest... it's a critical strategy for Mozilla to diversify their revenue stream <strong><em>away from Firefox</em></strong>.</p><p>As it turns out, moving away from Firefox is exactly Mozilla's plan.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/4671162/mozilla-downplaying-firefox-moving-into-a-i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mozilla laid out their vision for the future of their organization</a> -- and it did not include Firefox. &nbsp;The focus for the future of Mozilla -- <em>according to Mozilla</em> -- is primarily based around Artificial Intelligence services.</p><p>In fact, Mozilla leadership stated, quite plainly, that they intend to take Mozilla "in a&nbsp;different direction."</p><p>When you consider the goals of Mozilla... the decreasing Firefox marketshare is no longer much of a concern.&nbsp; In fact, moving revenue away from Firefox, while investing in A.I. systems (and other subscription services) becomes the primary goal.</p><p>And, at that, the Mozilla CEO is excelling.</p><h3>The future of Mozilla</h3><p>What does all of this mean for the future of Mozilla?&nbsp; What have we learned from Mozilla statements coupled with their financial reports?</p><ul><li>Mozilla rewards executives who oversee a decreasing success and reliance upon Firefox -- so we can expect more of that.</li><li>In turn, that likely means reduced investment in Firefox development and promotion over the coming years.</li><li>Mozilla intends to focus on A.I. -- so we can expect more A.I. investment, and possible A.I. services, in the year ahead.</li><li>If all of that holds true, we can likely expect the Mozilla CEO to receive additional raises in the next annual reports.</li></ul><p>If you are a fan of Firefox... none of that points to a particularly bright future.</p><p>That said... if you are the CEO at Mozilla... you might bring in enough income to buy your own island fortress pretty soon.&nbsp; And who doesn't want an island fortress?</p><hr><p>Want more truly independent Tech Journalism?&nbsp; Be sure to grab at least a free membership to&nbsp;<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/Lunduke.Locals.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lunduke.Locals.com</a>.</p><p>Want to support this important work (and get some exclusive books, videos, and other goodies in the process)?&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grab a paid subscription</a>.</p><hr><p>Other articles you might be interested in:</p><ul><li><a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5049241/linux-foundation-now-spends-only-2-of-their-revenue-on-linux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linux Foundation now spends only 2% of their revenue on Linux</a></li><li><a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/4408159/linux-foundation-decreased-linux-spending-to-3-2-in-2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linux Foundation decreased Linux spending to 3.2% in 2022</a></li><li><a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/4458111/the-wiki-piggy-bank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wiki Piggy Bank</a></li><li><a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/3983662/major-open-source-projects-how-much-money-do-they-actually-make" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Major Open Source Projects: How much money do they actually make?</a></li></ul><div>

<p><strong>WARNING LETTER</strong></p>

<p>December 20, 2023</p>

<p><strong>RE: 662503</strong></p>

<p>Dear Mr. Jassy:</p>

<p>This letter concerns your firm’s distribution of products that violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&amp;C Act”). The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) purchased on your website, www.amazon.com, products that are labeled as energy enhancing supplements or food, but laboratory analyses confirmed that they contained undeclared and potentially harmful active pharmaceutical ingredients. As discussed further below, your firm is responsible for introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce products that are unapproved new drugs under section 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). Furthermore, the products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a), 301(d), and 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a), 331(d), and 355(a). Your firm is also responsible for introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce a food that is prohibited under section 301(ll) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll).</p>

<p>FDA purchased “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement,” and “X Max Triple Shot Energy Honey” through your website, www.amazon.com. All of these products were introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce by Amazon via your Fulfillment by Amazon service.<sup><em><strong>1</strong></em></sup> FDA confirmed through laboratory analyses that the “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “Genergy,” and “X Max Triple Shot Energy Honey” products, purchased on www.amazon.com, contained the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) tadalafil; and the “WeFun,”<sup><em><strong>2</strong></em></sup> “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” products, also purchased on www.amazon.com, contained the API sildenafil. These ingredients are not declared on the products’ labeling.<sup><em><strong>3</strong></em></sup> Sildenafil and tadalafil are phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and the active ingredients in the FDA-approved prescription drugs Viagra and Cialis, respectively, used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). These undeclared ingredients may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs, such as nitroglycerin, and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels.</p>

<p>Information on the labels and/or labeling of “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” demonstrates that these products are marketed as dietary supplements<sup><em><strong>4</strong></em></sup>. However, these products do not meet the definition of “dietary supplement” under section 201(ff) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff). Under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a product is not a dietary supplement if it includes an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&amp;C Act, unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. Sildenafil and tadalafil were not marketed as dietary supplements or as foods before Viagra and Cialis were FDA-approved. FDA approved Viagra (containing sildenafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on March 27, 1998. FDA approved Cialis (containing tadalafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on November 21, 2003. Given that sildenafil and tadalafil were not marketed as dietary supplements or as foods before Viagra and Cialis were FDA-approved, “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement,” which contain sildenafil or tadalafil, are excluded from the definition of “dietary supplement” under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&amp;C Act.</p>

<p>The remaining product, “X Max Triple Shot Energy Honey,” is a food<sup><em><strong>5</strong></em></sup> that was confirmed by laboratory analysis to contain tadalafil.</p>

<p><u><strong>Unapproved New Drugs</strong></u></p>

<p>The “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” products that are marketed as dietary supplements are drugs as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Examples of claims observed on the labeling, including the outer packaging, that establish the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:</p>

<p><strong>“MANNERS Energy Boost”</strong><br>
From the product label:</p>

<ul><li>“Energy Boost”</li>
</ul><p><strong>“Round 2”</strong><br>
From the product label:</p>

<ul><li>“THE POWER TO GO AGAIN! STRENGTH * ENERGY * ENDURANCE”</li>
</ul><p><strong>“WeFun”</strong><br>
From the product label:</p>

<ul><li>“Energy[,] Performance”</li>
</ul><p><strong>“Genergy”</strong><br>
From the product label:</p>

<ul><li>“ENERGY FOR MEN”</li>
</ul><p><strong>“Big Guys Male Energy Supplement”</strong><br>
From the product label:</p>

<ul><li>From the product name: “Male Energy Supplement”</li>
	<li>“Extreme Power”</li>
	<li>“Focus . . . Energy . . . Mood”</li>
	<li>“500 MG POWER BOOST”</li>
</ul><p><strong>“Mens Maximum Energy Supplement”</strong><br>
From the product label:</p>

<ul><li>The product name: “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement”</li>
	<li>“NEVER ENDING ENERGY!”</li>
	<li>“STRENGTH[,] ENERGY[,] ENDURANCE”</li>
</ul><p>“MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement.” Introduction or delivery of these products into interstate commerce without approved applications violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a).</p>

<p><strong>Misbranded Drugs</strong></p>

<p>Additionally, “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” are misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for these products does not declare that they contain PDE-5 inhibitors. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in these products may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose these ingredients in the products’ labeling renders them misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&amp;C Act.</p>

<p>“MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” are also misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (see 21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1), include those that, because of their toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, and/or the method of their use, and/or the collateral measures necessary for their use, are not safe for use except under supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer them. All PDE-5 inhibitors which have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement,” which contain undeclared sildenafil or tadalafil, are also prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act, and as such, can be used safely only at the direction and under the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write “adequate directions for use” for “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” such that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended uses. These products are not exempt from the requirements that their labeling bear adequate directions for use by a layperson, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because there are no FDA-approved applications in effect for these products. For these reasons, “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act.</p>

<p>The undeclared sildenafil or tadalafil in “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” also causes the products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2), because their labeling lacks adequate warnings against unsafe dosage or methods or duration of administration or application, in such manner and form, as are necessary for the protection of users. As previously noted, there is a potential for serious health risks associated with these products, particularly since anyone who takes these products would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for the associated adverse events.</p>

<p>The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drug products is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).</p>

<p><strong>Prohibited Act under Section 301(ll)</strong></p>

<p>It is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&amp;C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. As noted above, FDA purchased “X Max Triple Shot Energy Honey” from www.amazon.com and confirmed through laboratory testing that the product contained undeclared tadalafil. Based on available evidence, FDA has determined that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to tadalafil.<sup><em><strong>6</strong></em></sup> The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of “X Max Triple Shot Energy Honey” is therefore prohibited under section 301(ll) of the FD&amp;C Act.</p>

<p>With so much of our digital lives neatly saved and synced in our web browser of choice, the idea of switching to a different one can feel as daunting as moving to a new home. Chrome Sync, in particular, has kept many people using Chrome. However, as good as Chrome Sync is, Firefox Sync is surprisingly better.</p>

<p>The promise of <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/408150/how-to-turn-syncing-on-or-off-in-chrome/">Chrome Sync</a> has always been great, and I feel like it lived up to it for a while. As time has gone on, though, I've had more than a few problems with Chrome Sync. Some of the features simply don't work like they should. It ends up be more frustrating than convenient, which completely defeats the purpose. That's why <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/787392/why-you-should-try-firefox-on-android/">a recent switch to Firefox</a> felt like a breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>As a refresher, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/408363/how-to-choose-what-information-to-sync-in-chrome/">Chrome Sync is capable of syncing</a> bookmarks, passwords, browsing history, tabs, payment info, personal info, and settings across devices signed into with the same Google account. That's the idea, at least.</p>
<!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"actualCount":868} -->
<p>The biggest problems I've had with Chrome Sync are history and tabs. I was constantly having issues with Chrome being able to find things in my history from the address bar. I'd start typing the page name into the bar, expecting to see it propagate in the results, and it never would. These were not pages I visited as a one-off, mind you—they appeared in my browsing history many times. Chrome simply wouldn't bring them up.</p>

<p>The Tab Syncing feature worked better, but I found it to be terribly laggy. The idea is to pick up where you left off on a different device. That's hard to do when you get to the other device and the "Tabs From Other Devices" aren't current. The situation gets more annoying when you add in the aforementioned history search woes, making it even more frustrating to find pages.</p>

<p>Long story short, Chrome's continuity features have felt lacking to me for a while. However, they weren't bad enough to be the reason I tried Firefox. I wasn't expecting Firefox Sync to be any better. To be honest, I assumed these were just common browser annoyances. I was wrong.</p>

<p>On the surface, Firefox Sync seems to be basically the same as Chrome Sync. To set it up, you just need to sign into your devices with the same Mozilla account and choose what you'd like to sync. It's an easy process made even easier with scannable QR codes from Firefox on your mobile devices.</p>

<p>The magic of Firefox Sync doesn't have anything to do with the core concept. It's essentially trying to do the same things as Chrome Sync. In my experience, the big difference is it actually works.</p>

<p>When I type the name of a web page from my history in the Firefox address bar, it shows up. Doesn't matter if I've visited that page a hundred times or only once. If it appears in my history, Firefox will show it to me. That includes history from Firefox on <em>all </em>my devices.</p>

<p>Tab Syncing is even better. As I'm writing this, I opened a webpage on my computer and immediately grabbed my phone, launched Firefox, opened the tabs, and the page had already synced to "Tabs From Other Devices." I didn't have to wait for anything to sync or manually tap a button to make it happen. To borrow a saying, "It just works." As it should.</p>

<p>Truly, if you do a lot of switching between devices, you should give Firefox a try. I haven't even mentioned the handy "Tabs From Other Devices" toolbar shortcut you can use on the desktop version or the ability to see other devices from the "<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-set-tab-pickup-firefox-view" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Firefox View</a>" screen.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
			
			<p><small>December 28, 2023
            </small></p><p>It’s 2004 and I’m sitting in one of the largest lecture halls at my university. I’m a computer science major but I’m taking a course on natural history — plants and animals — as one of my electives.</p>
<p>The professor tells us that he’s brought something from home, something he found in his freezer. He reaches down behind his desk, and then holds his arm out to show us what’s sitting in his palm: a baby painted turtle. We’re learning about cold-blooded animals, and it turns out that painted turtle hatchlings are pretty special — they’re one of only a few species that can survive being frozen.</p>
<p>Now, the lecture hall is pretty modern for 2004: there’s an overhead camera at the podium, where the professor can write notes that are displayed on screens around the hall. But instead of writing notes, he puts the turtle under the camera and starts his lecture.</p>
<p>Over the next hour, we watch this little reptile slowly come to life as the professor lectures. The first movements were nearly imperceptible. An eyelid cracking open, a leg inching forward. By the end of the lecture, the turtle has moved about halfway across our screens.</p>
<p>I’ll never forget that class, because it’s where I really understood what it means for an animal to be cold blooded. You see, warm-blooded animals — like humans or mice — have a stable body temperature that stays within a pretty narrow range. For humans, it’s around 37 degrees Celsius. A few degrees higher or lower and we’re in big trouble. Cold-blooded animals like the painted turtle can adapt their metabolism to the temperature around them. They’re active when it’s warm out, and as the environment (and their bodies) get cooler, they move more slowly. Very few of them can survive being frozen like the baby painted turtle can.</p>
<p>I see a similar dichotomy with software projects. Certain technology decisions lead to projects that are warm-blooded: everything is great when there’s constant motion on the project, generating heat. But put warm-blooded software in the freezer, and you’ll pull out a corpse six months later.</p>
<p>Maybe your CI isn’t working because one of the services you depend on got bought or ran out of money. You add a new dependency and find yourself needing to upgrade your compiler. Another package you depend on is deprecated, and doesn’t work with the latest version of the compiler.</p>
<p>Some projects are different. You work alone, make some changes when you’re inspired, and then don’t touch it again for another year, or two, or three. You can’t run something like that as a warm-blooded project. There’s not enough activity to keep the temperature up.</p>
<p>A cold-blooded project is like the baby painted turtle. You can freeze it for a year and then pick it back up right where you left off.</p>
<p>A cold-blooded project uses <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">boring technology</a>. The build and test scripts don’t depend on external services that might change, break, or disappear entirely. It uses <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#vendoring">vendored dependencies</a>.</p>
<p>The software that powers this blog is cold-blooded. The first commit was nearly twelve years ago — a simple little static site generator to replace my out-of-date Wordpress installation:</p>
<pre><code>commit 68949229ad426c1e8795ee640808db9987ab30ab
Author: Patrick Dubroy &lt;<a href="https://dubroy.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="4b3b2f3e293924320b2c262a222765282426">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&gt;
Date:   Sun Jan 8 19:10:24 2012 +0100

    Add templates and site-building script.</code></pre>


<p>It’s written in Python (2, not 3). It depends on four third-party modules, and they’re all committed to the project repository. Everything runs locally, and I deploy the result with rsync over ssh.</p>
<p>And boy am I glad I decided to do it that way. I’ve made a few small improvements over the years, but otherwise it’s continued to work without modification. And I fully expect that it will still be working in another twelve years.</p>
<p>🐢</p>

<p>Apparently Randall Munroe gets a lot of messages saying that the “random”
button on xkcd is biased.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2015-03-19 16:47:00    <strong>Hobz</strong>    also, Randall, the random button on the xkcd
frontpage is frustratingly un-random</p>
<p>2015-03-19 18:50:52   <strong>~Randall</strong>    it’s random.</p>
<p>2015-03-19 18:50:59   <strong>~Randall</strong>    people contact me constantly to tell me
that it’s not</p>
<p>2015-03-19 18:51:17   <strong>~Randall</strong>    which is a nice illustration of that mental
bias we have</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought I would do a little investigating to see just how random xkcd is.</p>
<hr>
<p>Making consistently random numbers (yes, that sounds weird) is really important
in things like cryptography. Unrandom random numbers can cripple an otherwise
secure network. So there’s a surprisingly large amount of work dedicated to
randomness.</p>
<p>There are services like <a href="http://www.random.org/">random.org</a> which pride
themselves on randomness, and <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/">HotBits</a>,
which lets you order random bytes that are generated from radioactive decay. A
lot of applications use <code>/dev/urandom/</code>, which is an OS-level random generator
that uses all sorts of sources of entropy such as network noise, CPU heat, and
the current weather in Kansas.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s <em>really</em> hard to tell whether numbers are random or not.
Of course, patterns <a href="http://boallen.com/random-numbers.html">can creep into random
numbers</a>. But more annoyingly, a
glaringly obvious pattern might just be accidental. My favorite example of this
is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_point">Feynman Point</a>, which is a
series of lots of 9s that appears somewhere in the (very unpredictable) decimal
expansion of pi.</p>
<p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ayn_random.png" alt="xkcd 1277"></p>
<p>There are a bunch of established ways to test the randomness of a random number
generator (such as the excitingly-named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diehard_tests">Diehard
tests</a>). They all test for features
that ostensibly random data should have. For example, a random stream of bits
should have almost as many ones as zeros. Not all tests are that obvious,
though, and statistics can be very slippery and unintuitive when it feels like
it.</p>
<p>NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology, who deal with things
like how long an inch is and how to backdoor elliptic curves)
<a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/rng/documentation_software.html">publishes</a>
a standard for randomness based on such tests, and distributes software that
runs these tests on datasets.</p>
<p>I wrote a Python program to download 10,000 xkcd-random numbers (yay
<code>requests</code>!), and converted them into bitstrings. Then, I fed them to the NIST
Statistical Test Suite.</p>
<p>The results are below:</p>

<p>I encourage you to play with the STS code. It lets you do all sorts of other
neat things, like testing bitstrings for common “templates” and reporting if
too many are found. It also segfaults all over the place, which is actually
very disturbing considering that it’s technically part of the US government’s
computer security project.</p>
<p>In any case, we’ve established that xkcd’s random generator is reasonably
unpredictable and unbiased. As it happens, they’re using the Mersenne Twister,
which is a well-established pseudorandom generation algorithm.</p>
<hr>
<p>So why does the random number generation appear so biased when we’re idly
refreshing on lazy Sunday nights? Part of it is, of course, human nature. We
like to see patterns everywhere.</p>
<p>But here’s a more concrete, mathematical explanation. The conceptual idea is
that in the beginning, hitting “random” is likelier to hit an unread comic, but
once you’ve seen more and more of them, you get repeats. Let’s try to quantify
this: we’re going to calculate the <em>expected value</em> of the number of times you
need to hit “random” until you have seen every single comic. You may have seen
this problem in the context of “how many times do you need to roll a die until
you have rolled all six faces at least once?”.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">Expected value</a> is the average
value of some random variable if you do an experiment lots of times. For
example, if you roll a die gazillions of time, the average number you’ll get is
$ (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = 3.5 $, so that’s the <em>expected</em> value.</p>
<p>We’re going to calculate the expected number of times you hit “random” by
calculating the number of times you need to hit it to get the first, second,
third, and (in general) nth unique comic. Then, because of a useful property of
expected values, we can just add them together until $ n = 1500 $ (there are
1500 comics published as of right now) to see how long, as of today, this
process would take.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for your $ n $th unread comic, each time you hit “random”
you have a $ 1 - n/1500 $ chance of getting a fresh one. This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">geometric
probability distribution</a>,
which is Math for “you keep trying something with a constant probability until
it succeeds”.  For geometric probability distributions, the expected value is
one over the probability (though I’m not going to prove it here, this
intuitively makes sense: you would expect to have to roll a die around 6 times
until you get your first 1, or to flip a coin twice until you get your first
heads).</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the nth comic, the expected number of clicks is $ 1500/(1500-n) $. Adding
these up for each $ n $, we have this monstrosity:</p>
<p>\[ \sum_{n=1}^{1500} \frac{1500}{n} = \frac{1500}{1500} + \frac{1500}{1499} + \dots + \frac{1500}{2} + \frac{1500}{1} \]</p>
<p>This works out to, on average, 11836 clicks. That’s a lot of clicks.</p>
<p>As common sense dictates, the more times you have clicked “random”, the less
likely it is for you to hit a new comic. And that’s why Randall’s random button
seems biased.</p>
<hr>
<p>One more bit of statistics: if you’ve taken a probability class, you might have
heard of the birthday problem. That is, say you have a party with $ n $ people.
What is the probability that some pair of people at the party share a birthday?</p>
<p>It turns out that if you have just 23 people, the probability is already 50-50.
This is somewhat counterintuitive; most birthday parties only have one birthday
boy! The fallacy is that the problem isn’t asking if some <em>particular</em> person
shares a birthday with someone else. It’s asking if <em>any</em> two people share a
birthday.</p>
<p>The birthday “paradox” turns out to be important in cryptography, especially
when looking for hash collisions. The number of hashes you need to generate
before you hit a collision is similar to the number of people you need at a
party before some pair shares a birthday—much smaller than what you would
expect.</p>
<p>In terms of xkcd-surfing, this helps answer the question “how many times will I
hit random before I see a repeat?”.</p>
<p>There are plenty of good explanations for the math behind the birthday problem
online (<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BirthdayProblem.html">Wolfram Mathworld</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">Wikipedia</a>)—but if you
don’t believe the number 23 quoted above, it’s worth spending some time trying
to solve it yourself just to understand what’s really going on (it’s not hard).
I’m just going to dump the formula here without any explanation.</p>
<p>For 1500 comics, the probability that you get a repeat after $ k $ clicks is:</p>
<p>\[ 1 - \frac{1500!}{(1500-k)!1500^k} \]</p>
<p>Throwing this at WolframAlpha, we see that after only 45 clicks, you have a
50-50 chance of seeing a duplicate comic. Put a different way, <em>there are even
odds that the last 45 comics you have seen contain a duplicate pair somewhere
in there</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>So we’ve empirically validated that xkcd’s RNG is as close as we can expect for
something statistically random. We’ve also seen two reasons why it feels
biased.</p>
<p>But on a deeper and much more important level, we’ve seen how counterintuitive
and messy the random-number business is, and how statistical facts can trick us
into seeing patterns that aren’t there.</p>
<hr>
<p>P.S. My methodology for these experiments probably not the best, since I have
no formal statistics background. If you want to check out the code used or a
dump of my dataset, leave a comment below and I’ll send it to you.</p>

Back then, I did not fully comprehend what I was doing and why the tools I used were impressive given the constraints of the hardware we had. Having gained more knowledge throughout the years, it is now really fun to pick up DOSBox to re-experience those programs and compare them with our current state of affairs.</p><p>This time around, I want to look at the pure text-based IDEs that we had in that era before Windows eclipsed the PC industry. I want to do this because those IDEs had little to envy from the IDEs of today—yet it feels as if we went through a dark era where we lost most of those features for years and they are only resurfacing now.</p><p>If anything, stay for a nostalgic ride back in time and a little rant on “bloat”. But, more importantly, read on to gain perspective on what existed before so that you can evaluate future feature launches more critically.</p><p>In the 1990s, almost every DOS program you ran had a full-screen Text User Interface (TUI) which sported text-based windows, drop shadows, colors, and mouse support. Here is just one example:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png" width="1264" height="948" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:948,&quot;width&quot;:1264,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:70830,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1db3aeed-b831-49f5-a534-34d993bed81e_1264x948.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The MS-DOS Editor (aka EDIT.COM) with one of its settings dialog open.

However, they were all so similar in how they looked like—80x25 characters didn’t leave much room for uniqueness—and how they worked that the differences didn’t really get in the way of usability and discoverability. Once you learned that the Alt key opened the menus and that Tab moved across input fields and buttons, you could navigate almost any program with ease.</p><p><span>But let’s talk about editors. MS-DOS shipped with a TUI text editor since version 5 (1981), which </span><a href="https://blogsystem5.substack.com/p/a-cli-text-editor-in-my-windows" rel="">I previously covered in a recent article</a><span> and is shown above. This editor “worked”, but it was really inconvenient for coding: you needed to exit the editor to compile and run your code, and when you re-ran the editor, you’d have to navigate back to where you were before.</span></p><p><span>“In my house”, we used something called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Sidekick" rel="">SideKick Plus</a><span> (1984), which wasn’t really a code editor: it was more of a Personal Information Management (PIM) system with a built-in notepad. The cool thing about it, however, was that it was a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program, which meant that it loaded in the background and you could bring it up at any time by pressing Ctrl+Alt.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png" width="1264" height="948" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:948,&quot;width&quot;:1264,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:65113,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>SideKick Plus' main screen after pressing Ctrl+Alt to bring it up.

I did not implement the equivalent of Ctrl+Alt, but I’ve considered it many times.)</span></p><p><span>By this point, however, real IDEs had already existed for a few years. Turbo Pascal 1.0 (1983) shows the beginning of an integrated experience, although it did not feature its iconic TUI yet. QuickBASIC 2.0 (1986) shows more of a “traditional” TUI (the same as </span><code>EDIT.COM</code><span>, because they are the same editor), and MS-DOS 5 came with QBasic, a reduced version of QuickBASIC that didn’t allow compiling to native code but that had the same look.</span></p><p>The crown jewel of IDEs, in my opinion, were the later Borland Turbo series, which included Turbo C++ (1990), Turbo Assembler and Turbo Pascal. These IDEs were language specific, but they had full-screen TUIs and were extremely powerful.</p><p>Here, take a look at what we had.

printf.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Remember: all of this in the early 1990s—a little over 30 years ago at the time of this writing.</p><p><span>I was an avid user of Turbo C++, with which I learned a lot. I remember using their </span><code>conio.h</code><span> libraries to implement TUIs of my own, and then their builtin </span><code>graphics.h</code><span> libraries to play with implementing GUIs. And note: this was </span><em>without the Internet</em><span>. There was no option for many to just “look up how things worked” in Stack Overflow: the IDE had to be discoverable right away (which it was) and self-contained to offer you a complete development experience.</span></p><p>Now take a moment to compare this scene with Linux in the early 1990s.</p><p><span>In Linux, almost every program was </span><em>also</em><span> text based, but those programs did not come with a full-screen TUI. It just wasn’t “the Unix way”. I remember watching the X11 configuration tool (</span><code>XF86Setup</code><span>) or the OpenBSD installer and feeling shocked by how simplistic those were: me, a young teenager with barely any “real” coding experience, had written better-looking programs already.</span></p><p><span>In any case, this didn’t stop me from my quest to </span><em>not</em><span> use Windows. I continued to learn the ways of Linux and soon faced the “best” editors recommended by every book and community online: Vim and Emacs. And I could not understand why they were praised. Using these was like stepping back into the past. They were full-screen programs indeed, but they seemed pretty arcane. Vim did have syntax highlighting but it was far from being an IDE. Emacs could be configured to integrate with some code assisting features and the like, but it was far from being “fire and forget” like the Turbo family of IDEs.</span></p><p><span>Just look at the default Emacs configuration </span><em>today</em><span>, which hasn’t changed much (if at all) since then. It does have windows, but they aren’t decorated. It didn’t have colors (and now barely has), because why? It didn’t use to have mouse support. It </span><em>does</em><span> have a menu bar though, but it is just a gimmick? If you press M-` as the instructions tell you, you face a truly strange interface to navigate the menu—which makes one wonder why they even bothered to waste a full line of screen real state to show a menu bar that does nothing.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png" width="973" height="650" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:650,&quot;width&quot;:973,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:127463,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A fresh installation of Emacs in the console, with the standard welcome screen in the background and the "menu" open after pressing M-`.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Now try giving this to anyone with little coding experience and getting them to create, compile, and debug a program.

In fact, it feels like during these 30 years, we regressed in many ways, and only now are reaching feature parity with some of the features we used to have.</span></p><p><span>It is natural that TUIs diminished in popularity once graphical OSes gained traction, and it is somewhat interesting that they are making a comeback just now. As for why, I think we have to thank the invention of </span><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" rel="">LSP</a><span> for most of the recent progress in this area. TUI editors were “on hold” for many years because building IDE features for them was a lot of effort and their small maintainer base could not afford to implement them. LSP unlocked access to existing language-specific integrations and reinfused interest in the old-and-trusty Vim and Emacs. Hopefully, the upcoming </span><a href="https://build-server-protocol.github.io/" rel="">BSP</a><span> will do even more to make these TUIs more IDE-like.</span></p><p>It is fair to ask “Who cares? Every desktop and laptop runs a graphical OS now!”</p><p><span>And it’s a good question. In general, you probably </span><em>don’t</em><span> want a TUI IDE. If VSCode is your jam, its remoting abilities are superb and VSCode has a reasonably good graphical interface without being a full-blown IDE. But there are a few things that VSCode doesn’t give us.</span></p><p><span>The first is that a TUI IDE is excellent for work on remote machines—even better than VSCode. You can SSH into </span><em>any</em><span> machine with ease and launch the IDE. </span><a href="https://jmmv.dev/2015/09/my-coding-workflow.html" rel="">Combine it with tmux and you get “full” multitasking.</a><span> Yes, you could instead use a remote desktop client instead of SSH, but I’ve always found them clunky due to lag and the improper integration with the local desktop shortcuts.</span></p><p><span>The second is that </span><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source" rel="">VSCode’s remote extensions are </a><em><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source" rel="">not</a></em><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source" rel=""> open source</a><span>, which isn’t a major problem… except for the fact that they don’t work on, say, FreeBSD and there is no way to fix them. So this makes it impossible for me to remote into my primary development server with VSCode.</span></p><p>And the third is… reduced resource consumption.</p><p>I can’t leave without ranting about “bloat” for a little bit. Borland Turbo C++, with all its bells and whistles (the UI, the C++ toolchain, the integrated manuals…), is less than 9 MB after installation and ran within 640kb of RAM.</p><p>For comparison, Helix is 16 MB on disk, which is pretty impressive (and honestly unexpected), but Doom Emacs is about 500 MBs and consumes many MBs of RAM. Note, however, that none of these numbers account for the language toolchains or help systems, and toolchains nowadays rank in the GBs of disk space.</p><p>To get “real” IDEs, we have to jump to graphical programs like IntelliJ or VSCode. VSCode, for example, is about 350 MBs on disk (surprisingly less than Doom Emacs) but it will eat your computer for lunch: it’s Electron after all. I have noticed very significant savings in laptop battery life by dropping VSCode and moving to Doom Emacs.</p><p><span>So the question I want to part with is: have we advanced </span><em>much</em><span> in 30 years? Modern IDEs have some better refactoring tools, better features, and support more languages, but fundamentally… they haven’t changed much. The only major difference that we are </span><em>starting</em><span> to see might be AI-assisted coding, but this is a feature mostly provided by a remote service, not even by the installed code!</span></p><p><span>And that’s all for today. On my side, I’ll happily continue using </span><em>all of</em><span> Doom Emacs, Vim, VSCode, and IntelliJ depending on the situation. Merry Christmas if this is your thing!</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>How the history of military and government PSYOPS involving mind-control, UFOs, magic, and remote-control zombies, explains the future of AI and generative media. Along the way, talk attendees will be given an enrollment code to join a specialized CTF/ARG game called CYCLOPS that explores these themes and that will run the duration of Congress. </p>

<p>As AI-generated content, social-media influence operations, micro-targeted advertising, and ubiquitous surveillance have become the norm on the Internet and in the market in general, we have entered an era of PSYOP Capitalism. This is an era of hallucinations designed to transform each of us into a “targeted individual” through the manipulation of perception. This talk explores a secret history of reality-altering military and intelligence programs that serve as antecedents to a phantasmagoric present.</p>

<p>At the talk, attendees will be given a registration code to play “CYCLOPS,” a CTF/ARG game that will run the duration of Congress. CYCLOPS explores the themes of the mind-control and PSYOPS through an interactive parafictional narrative taking place in the context of an obscure CIA cognitive warfare program from the early days of the Cold War.

      <p>After some struggle, I managed to de-list the address of my mail server from Microsoft’s blocklist. Here is some experiences may help you.</p>
      <p>I am running my mail server on one Oracle Cloud Computer, which has no cost. You can read my another blog post<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> to dig the setting up details. After all work has been done, I can deploy mail to all major Mail Service Providers like Gmail, Yahoo Mail, QQ Mail, and so on. My employer uses the enterprise edition service of Office365. And I send testing mail to it, no problem has been found. Since I do not own a personal account of Outlook or Hotmail, I do not test mail to the domain of outlook.com/hotmail.com, assuming there is no problem.</p>
      <p>One day some reader of my blog leave a message to me and He uses a mail address with the domain of live.com, which is part of Outlook/Hotmail. When I try to reply his message in my mail client, it received the following error message:</p>
      <pre><code>Delivery to xxx@outlook.com failed with error:
outlook-com.olc.protection.outlook.com. said:

Unfortunately, messages from [xx.xx.xx.xx] weren't sent.
Please contact your Internet service provider since part of their network
is on our block list (S3150). You can also refer your provider to
http://mail.live.com/mail/troubleshooting.aspx#errors.

[BN7NAM10FT025.eop-nam10.prod.protection.outlook.com 2023-12-15T15:17:55.319Z 08DBF7ED000951E3]

Diagnostic-Code: smtp; 550 5.0.0 outlook-com.olc.protection.outlook.com.</code></pre>
      <p>I opened the link it offered. In the section <em>Sender services, tools, and issue submission</em>, they offers a link to create support list. You need an account of Microsoft to submit request, and I registered one with my own email address and some fake contact information, because I do not want to lave too many of my personal data to Microsoft. It take several days that Microsoft replied my request with Email. However, the reply is very frustrating, because it said that they do not block mail from my IP address.</p>
      <pre><code>Hi ,
 
Thanks for your patience while we investigated your request.
Below your IP address(es) and their status(es) are listed.

XX.XX.XX.XX;

Nothing was detected to prevent your mail from reaching Outlook.com customers. Please follow the instructions below.

Still need help?

If you have additional questions or still experiencing deliverability issues or want further investigation, please reply to this email with the following information and an advocate will respond to you by via email.
Relevant IP addresses(es)
Detailed description of the problem you are having
specific error message(s)</code></pre>
      <p>According some article from the Internet, I replied the mail immediately with the following content:</p>
      <pre><code>Hello,

Thanks for replying. 

You say my IP address XX.XX.XX.XX was not prevent from reaching outlook.com.
However, I still can not send email from XX.XX.XX.XX to outlook.com customers.

Here is the error message:

[...]

XX.XX.XX.XX is my own personal email server, with controlled user creation access.

This is a newly acquired IP address.

Security
    This server is used solely for the purpose of mailserver, with ssh
    access only granted to an administrator.

Settings
    The server is also configured with all the necessary records to ensure
    only authenticated users connected to our secured smtp can send mails
    from our domains.</code></pre>
      <p>Microsoft never reply my mail. Three days later, I resend another mail trying to persuade them to unblock my server. In the mail, I explained this is an indie mail server and for personal usage only. I also try to let them understand that I am not an spam sender by offering relative content of my blog. Maybe the fake contact information of my Microsoft Account make them worry that I am not a good guy. Here is the full content.</p>
      <pre><code>Sorry for replying again.

I still can't delivery email to outlook/hotmail now.

This server is my personal mail server for my own usage.
I have setup only one month ago.

I am also writing on my blog, and the readers may contact me by this mail server.

My blog URL is https://taoshu.in/ and the setting process was recorded at

https://taoshu.in/net/selfhost-email.html

Some readers contacted me by hotmail/outlook, and I can't reply to them.
That's when I discovered I hotmail/outlook has blocked my server.

The IP XX.XX.XX.XX I am using is from Oracle Cloud, and it is not in any public blacklist according to mxtoolbox

https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=blacklist%3amx1.lehu.in&amp;run=toolpage

I have not, and will not to try to delivery bulk mail or spam mail to outlook/hotmail or any mail service provider.

Please consider to unblock my IP.

Thanks.</code></pre>
      <p>Still get no response. So I tried to contract to Oracle Cloud and wished they could offically communicate with Microsoft and make their IP address range unblocked. Unfortunately, they did not offer any help.</p>
      <pre><code>Thank you for your response. Unfortunately, we do not have any power or say
when it comes to blacklists from third-parties. You would need to continue
to work with Microsoft in order to resolve this issue.</code></pre>
      <p>I have no choice but wait the response from Microsoft.</p>
      <p>Five days passed, there still no reply. But today I login the server and try to connect the MX server for Outlook/Hotmail by telnet. After I sent the command of <code>mail from</code>, the other side responded <code>250 2.1.0 Sender OK</code>. I known Microsoft has finally unblocked my mail server. Cheering up🍻</p>
      <p>If you also encounter this kind of problem, do not be afraid. You are not alone. So many people have replied this thread<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, complaining Outlook/Hotmail block their mail server unreasonably. It is a problem for self-mail-hosting, however, it can be addressed. So don’t be intimidated by this difficulties.</p>
      <p>According to my experiences, although Microsoft may block some IP range, it does not intend to do so. This blocking policy is only one stress measure for the increasingly rampant Spam problem. They are just not very friendly, but never hostile to self-mail-hosting. If you encounter this kind of issue, using a normal Microsoft Account with real contact information and submit request with detailed information may address you problem.</p>
      <p>So many words have been said that you should never run your own mail server. I beg to differ on this point. Because Email is the only successful federate system that is always defending the foundation of the freedom of the Internet. Every one should have the freedom to run their own mail server and communicate with each other freely. So we should defend the right for self-mail-hosting.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently stumbled upon this screenshot while researching social media on the train. Of course, it was followed by a cascade of spiteful comments, criticizing this fresh programmer’s attempt to solve a classical problem in computer science. The modulus operation.</p>

<p><img src="https://andreasjhkarlsson.github.io/assets/images/GCPVDa1WYAAoBut.jpg" alt="TikTok screenshot" width="250"></p>

<p>Now, in a world where AI is replacing programmers by the minute, taking their jobs and revolutionizing the way we think about code, maybe we should be more open to the thoughts of the fresh new blood of the industry? In fact, the above code is a perfect example of a time-memory tradeoff. You’re trading off your time and at the same time, the computers memory and time as well! Truly a marvelous algorithm!</p>

<p>So I went to work to explore this idea of checking if a number is odd or even by only using comparisons to see how well it works in a real world scenario. Since I’m a great believer in performant code I decided to implement this in the C programming language as it’s by far the fastest language on the planet to this day (thanks to the visionary genius Dennis Richie).</p>

<p>So I started composing</p>

<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Beautiful! Lets compile the code, disabling optimizations with /Od to make sure that the pesky compiler doesn’t interfere with our algorithm. After compiling we can do a quick test of the program we get some positive results:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>cl.exe</span><span> </span><span>/Od</span><span> </span><span>program.c</span><span>
</span><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>\program.exe</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> 
</span><span>even</span><span>
</span><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>\program.exe</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span>
</span><span>even</span><span>
</span><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>\program.exe</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>
</span><span>odd</span><span>
</span><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>\program.exe</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>
</span><span>odd</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, after doing some further testing I found some problems:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>\program.exe</span><span> </span><span>50</span><span>
</span><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>\program.exe</span><span> </span><span>11</span><span>
</span><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>\program.exe</span><span> </span><span>99</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>No output! It seems that the program only works for numbers under 11! Going back to the code we can find the issue right after the last if statement, we need more if statements!</p>

<p>Now, this is a time-memory tradeoff, but my time on this earth is limited so I decided to meta-program the if statements using a programmer program in a different programming language. To compensate for this cheating I decided to use the slowest language on the planet, Python (thanks to the visionary genius of Ross van der Gussom).</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"/* Copyright 2023. All unauthorized distribution of this source code"</span><span>)</span>

<p>Nice! Now we can generate a program that solves the even-odd problem for all 8-bit integers!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>programmer.py</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>program.c</span><span>

</span><span>odd</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Would you look at that! It works flawlessly! Now, let’s scale it up to 16 bit!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"    uint16_t number = atoi(argv[1]); // No problems here"</span><span>)</span>
<span>…</span>
<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>**</span><span>16</span><span>):</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This gives a nice and thick c file of around 130k lines. Nothing really when looking back at some of the code bases I’ve worked on over the years. Let’s compile!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>programmer.py</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>program.c</span><span>

<p>Beautiful! Our algorithm seems to scale with the data! The executable is around 2 MB, but that’s no match for my beefy gaming rig with a whopping 31.8 GB of memory.</p>

<p>Now, 16 bit is a very cool bitwidth, but as we all know, 32 bit is the holy grail of computing and is the final bitwidth that we need to solve all practical engineering and scientific problems. After all, IPv4 is still standing stronger than ever, 60 years after it was deemed deprecated due to so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion">“address exhaustion”</a>.</p>

<p>So without further ado, lets scale to our final size. 32 bit is only 65536 times as many numbers as 16 bit, what could go wrong?</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"    uint32_t number = atoi(argv[1]); // No problems here"</span><span>)</span>

<p>So I let the mighty snake do its work and after getting a cup of coffee and getting back to check on the program 48 hours later I was left with a beautiful c file, almost 330 GB in size! Almost certainly among the largest c files in history. My fingers were trembling when I entered the next command, surely MSVC had never before encountered such powerful source code. After abusing the pagefile of my poor, powerful computer for half an hour the following was spat out:</p>

<p>Pathetic!</p>

<p>And not only did the compiler fail us, but when looking into the limits of the Portable Executable format (.exe) for windows, I discovered that it cannot handle more than a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6976693/what-is-the-maximum-size-of-a-pe-file-on-64-bit-windows">measly 4 GB</a>! With more than 4 billion comparisons needed to be encoded into the executable, this is a major obstacle for implementing our algorithm. Even if each comparison would use less than a single byte we would still be too heavy.</p>

<p>However, bad compilers and file formats should not stop us from achieving our dream. After all, all what a compiler does is writing some fancy machine code into a file and the file format is just some structure telling the OS how to put the binary code into memory. Really, we can do that ourselves.</p>

<p>Let’s start by writing an IsEven function in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language">x86-64 assembly</a> as it’s the native language of my Intel powered machine. It looks something like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="assembly">; Argument is stored in ECX, return value in EAX
XOR EAX, EAX ; Set eax to zero (return value for odd number)
CMP ECX, 0h ; Compare arg to 0 
JNE 3h ; Skip next two instructions if it wasn't equal
INC EAX ; It was even, set even return value (1)
RET ; Return
CMP ECX, 1h ; Compare arg to 1
JNE 2 ; Skip next instruction if not equal
RET ; Odd return value already in EAX, just RET
; add the next 2...2^32-1 comparisons here
RET ; Fallback return</code></pre></figure>

<p>Not really correct asm, but it doesn’t matter much, because we’re gonna compile it into machine code manually.</p>

<p>How did I do this? Well I jumped online, using a mix of my early life experience coding emulators and hacking and looked into the x86(-64) architecture manuals to figure out the correct opcodes and format for each instruction.</p>

<p>… Just kidding, that’s horrible. I asked ChatGPT what the correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode">opcode</a> was for each instruction and lucky for us it didn’t hallucinate any new extensions to x86-64.</p>

<p>So now we just write a “compiler” to output this code. Note that we will write the opcodes we got from the AI for the instructions directly. Here’s how it looks in our friend python:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>struct</span>

<p>While we somewhat deviated from the original vision of the TikTok post, the essence remains the same. We create a long, long, long list of if-statements to determine if any number is even or odd, ignoring any arithmetic operation that would help out.</p>

<p>Running this gives us a nice 40 GB file which contains all 4.2 billion comparisons needed to determine if any 32 bit number is even or odd! Now we just need to write our host program that can load and use these instructions. For added performance (it is very important), I decided to map the file into the address space instead of reading all of it. By doing this, we can just pretend that the entire file is already in memory and let the poor OS deal with fitting a 40 GB blob into virtual memory. After mapping the file with READ and EXECUTE permissions we can call into the code by using a function pointer. It looks like this:</p>

<p>And there we go! We now have everything to check if any 32 bit number is even or odd. Let’s take it for a spin:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span>.</span><span>\program.exe</span><span> </span><span>300</span><span>

</span><span>even</span><span>

</span><span>even</span><span>
</span><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span>.</span><span>\program.exe</span><span> </span><span>400000001</span><span>

</span><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span>.</span><span>\program.exe</span><span> </span><span>400000006</span><span>

</span><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span>.</span><span>\program.exe</span><span> </span><span>4200000000</span><span>
</span><span>odd</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>----</span><span> </span><span>WRONG</span><span>!</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Almost! Seems like the algorithm has some issues with signedness, any value over 2^31 seems to give random results. Sad!</p>

<p>Let’s fix the final bug.</p>

<p>It turns out that atoi cannot deal with unsigned pureness, so it failed to parse our big boy numbers. Replacing it with strtoul fixes everything.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>uint32_t</span> <span>number</span> <span>=</span> <span>strtoul</span><span>(</span><span>argv</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>);</span><span>// No problems here</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span>.</span><span>\program.exe</span><span> </span><span>4200000000</span><span>
</span><span>even</span><span>
</span><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span>.</span><span>\program.exe</span><span> </span><span>4200000001</span><span>
</span><span>odd</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As a side note, the program is amazingly performant. For small numbers the results are instantaneous and for the large number close to the 2^32 limit the result is still returned in around 10 seconds. Considering the computer has to read 40 GB of data from disk, map it to physical memory and then let the CPU has a rip of it without many chances of caching is honestly quite mind blowing. For reference, the computer is a Core i5 12600K with 32 GB memory and the files are residing on a M.2 SSD disk. While calculating, the peak read speed I saw from the SSD was around 800 MB/s (which doesn’t really make sense as that should give execution speeds at 40+ seconds, but computers are magical so who knows what is going on).</p>

<p>And there we have it! The Internet proven wrong once again, not only can you actually write a fully functioning and performant program in the manner of the TikTok post, but it’s also very fun.</p>

<!-- cache hit 339:single/related:c68a8bff5724c49da7e49cf4e16a54d5 --><!-- empty -->
<p>In August, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/report-potential-nyt-lawsuit-could-force-openai-to-wipe-chatgpt-and-start-over/">word leaked out</a> that The New York Times was considering joining the growing legion of creators that are suing AI companies for misappropriating their content. The Times had reportedly been negotiating with OpenAI regarding the potential to license its material, but those talks had not gone smoothly. So, eight months after the company was reportedly considering suing, <a href="https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf">the suit has now been filed</a>.</p>
<p>The Times is targeting various companies under the OpenAI umbrella, as well as Microsoft, an OpenAI partner that both uses it to power its Copilot service and helped provide the infrastructure for training the GPT Large Language Model. But the suit goes well beyond the use of copyrighted material in training, alleging that OpenAI-powered software will happily circumvent the Times' paywall and ascribe hallucinated misinformation to the Times.</p>
<h2>Journalism is expensive</h2>
<p>The suit notes that The Times maintains a large staff that allows it to do things like dedicate reporters to a huge range of beats and engage in important investigative journalism, among other things. Because of those investments, the newspaper is often considered an authoritative source on many matters.</p>
<p>All of that costs money, and The Times earns that by limiting access to its reporting through a robust paywall. In addition, each print edition has a copyright notification, the Times' terms of service limit the copying and use of any published material, and it can be selective about how it licenses its stories. In addition to driving revenue, these restrictions also help it to maintain its reputation as an authoritative voice by controlling how its works appear.</p>
<p>The suit alleges that OpenAI-developed tools undermine all of that. "By providing Times content without The Times’s permission or authorization, Defendants’ tools undermine and damage The Times’s relationship with its readers and deprive The Times of subscription, licensing, advertising, and affiliate revenue," the suit alleges.</p>
<p>Part of the unauthorized use The Times alleges came during the training of various versions of GPT. Prior to GPT-3.5, information about the training dataset was made public. One of the sources used is a large collection of online material called "Common Crawl," which the suit alleges contains information from 16 million unique records from sites published by The Times. That places the Times as the third most referenced source, behind Wikipedia and a database of US patents.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>OpenAI no longer discloses as many details of the data used for training of recent GPT versions, but all indications are that full-text NY Times articles are still part of that process (Much more on that in a moment.) Expect access to training information to be a major issue during discovery if this case moves forward.</p>
<h2>Not just training</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/two-artists-suing-ai-image-makers-never-copyrighted-their-works/">number of suits</a> have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/universal-music-sues-ai-start-up-anthropic-for-scraping-song-lyrics/">been filed</a> regarding the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/book-authors-sue-openai-and-meta-over-text-used-to-train-ai/">use of copyrighted material</a> during <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/george-r-r-martin-joins-authors-suing-openai-over-copyright-infringement/">training of AI systems</a>. But the Times' suit goes well beyond that to show how the material ingested during training can come back out during use. "Defendants’ GenAI tools can generate output that recites Times content verbatim, closely summarizes it, and mimics its expressive style, as demonstrated by scores of examples," the suit alleges.</p>
<p>The suit alleges—and we were able to verify—that it's comically easy to get GPT-powered systems to offer up content that is normally protected by the Times' paywall. The suit shows a number of examples of GPT-4 reproducing large sections of articles nearly verbatim.</p>
<p>The suit includes screenshots of ChatGPT being given the title of a piece at The New York Times and asked for the first paragraph, which it delivers. Getting the ensuing text is apparently as simple as repeatedly asking for the next paragraph.</p>
<p>ChatGPT has apparently closed that loophole in between the preparation of that suit and the present. We entered some of the prompts shown in the suit, and were advised "I recommend checking The New York Times website or other reputable sources," although we can't rule out that context provided prior to that prompt could produce copyrighted material.</p>

<p>But not all loopholes have been closed. The suit also shows output from Bing Chat, since rebranded as Copilot. We were able to verify that asking for the first paragraph of a specific article at The Times caused Copilot to reproduce the first third of the article.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The suit is dismissive of attempts to justify this as a form of fair use. "Publicly, Defendants insist that their conduct is protected as 'fair use' because their unlicensed use of copyrighted content to train GenAI models serves a new 'transformative' purpose," the suit notes. "But there is nothing 'transformative' about using The Times’s content without payment to create products that substitute for The Times and steal audiences away from it."</p>
<h2>Reputational and other damages</h2>
<p>The hallucinations common to AI also came under fire in the suit for potentially damaging the value of the Times' reputation, and possibly damaging human health as a side effect. "A GPT model completely fabricated that “The New York Times published an article on January 10, 2020, titled ‘Study Finds Possible Link between Orange Juice and Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma,’” the suit alleges. "The Times never published such an article."</p>
<p>Similarly, asking about a Times article on heart-healthy foods allegedly resulted in Copilot saying it contained a list of examples (which it didn't). When asked for the list, 80 percent of the foods on weren't even mentioned by the original article. In another case, recommendations were ascribed to the Wirecutter when the products hadn't even been reviewed by its staff.</p>
<p>As with the Times material, it's alleged that it's possible to get Copilot to offer up large chunks of Wirecutter articles (The Wirecutter is owned by The New York Times). But the suit notes that these article excerpts have the affiliate links stripped out of them, keeping the Wirecutter from its primary source of revenue.</p>
<p>The suit targets various OpenAI companies for developing the software, as well as Microsoft—the latter for both offering OpenAI-powered services, and for having developed the computing systems that enabled the copyrighted material to be ingested during training. Allegations include direct, contributory, and vicarious copyright infringement, as well as DMCA and trademark violations. Finally, it alleges "Common Law Unfair Competition By Misappropriation."</p>
<p>The suit seeks nothing less than the erasure of both any GPT instances that the parties have trained using material from the Times, as well as the destruction of the datasets that were used for the training. It also asks for a permanent injunction to prevent similar conduct in the future. The Times also wants money, lots and lots of money: "statutory damages, compensatory damages, restitution, disgorgement, and any other relief that may be permitted by law or equity."</p>

When I turned on the motor with a metal toggle switch, a drive shaft spun a heavy ceramic knob that gouged out the hearts of lemon and orange halves, leaving not a scrap of pulp uncrushed. The thing worked beautifully, almost like new, so I looked up its serial number on the internet to see when the unit was manufactured, guessing it might be almost forty years old. Wrong. It dated to the 1940s. It was seventy, the stubborn monster, still giving satisfaction with every use.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can’t say the same about my coffee grinders. I use the plural because I’ve owned a lot of them, all bought in their original packaging and dead within a year. They’re good ones, supposedly, with burrs not blades, but they stop performing before long, ending their long journeys from overseas factories in unmarked graves in my local Montana landfill. I have a whole ghost kitchen in this landfill, and soon I will need to reserve a bigger plot. For the nifty under-the-counter fridge that has stopped getting cold after three years and which no one in the area can fix. For the cool bagless vacuum cleaner that clogs and chokes when I run it over a rug. For the set of glass measuring cups whose numbers and hashmarks are swiftly fading and becoming illegible, much like those on the dials of the washer my wife bought just three years ago. For the remains of the Pyrex casserole that shattered when I removed it from the oven, strewing the floor with blade-like shards, some so tiny I probably won’t find them until they lodge in my bare feet.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should I go on? I think I will. It’s important to get to the thoughtful, speculative part, where I ask what it means when the objects in our lives demoralize us in a blizzard of malfunctions, but it’s also important – to me, emotionally -- to bury the reader in details of the unceasing material disappointments I’ve faced &nbsp;&nbsp;The cute yellow mittens my wife picked up at Target which unraveled the second time she wore them. The new suitcase which won’t stand upright when it’s full. The laptop computers that have turned to bricks within months of their warranties expiring. And the hybrid sedan with fifty thousand miles on it that also turned into a brick while going eighty down the freeway, losing its power steering, its power brakes, its power everything. I survived, by some miracle, issued legal threats, and the car’s manufacturer repaired it, free. Then it bricked again a few weeks later.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s the little things too, of course, because they’re constant. The staples that won’t pierce five stacked sheets of paper. The matches that sizzle and smoke but don’t catch fire. The grocery bags split by the corners of the milk cartons whose inadequately seals leak drops of milk. The strangely short power cords on electronics. The two or three new pens I use each week that, because no ink comes out of them (at least not continually, in lines) aren’t really pens at all, in fact, but tributes to pens, Potemkin pens, mere props.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baffled by how to measure this decline in the quality of common wares – a decline whose significance I promise to cover once I’ve further gratified my rage -- I opened the matter to my Twitter audience and quickly garnered two thousand replies, by far the longest thread I’ve ever triggered. The complaints were specific and formed patterns. One was a loathing for newer washers and dryers, because they don’t wash or dry well, and then they break. The clothes that go inside them were disliked too. (A former top executive of Levi’s chimed in to confirm that jeans aren’t what they used to be.) My favorite replies were the picky ones. One person noted that the “juice content” of juice is going down. Another observed that the “foaming liquid hand soap” which suddenly is dominating store shelves is just normal liquid soap, diluted.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many blamed these problems on the government. They believed it had crippled certain products (major home appliances especially) with environmental regulations, causing them to function poorly and turn rapidly to landfill fodder -- an ecological net loss, perhaps. Some folks blamed our trade arrangements with China and the evils of capitalism itself. Weak-link computer chips in items that don’t require them also came in for abuse. One philosophical reply spoke of a sinister general trend toward the degradation of everything human. “There’s a war on value that’s going that’s comprised of three parts: war on quality, war on money, war on life.” Lofty rhetoric, but I understood. When my suddenly de-electrified hybrid car became a hurtling giant stone inside which my wife and I were helplessly strapped – all for the crime of trying to save fuel and, ultimately, earth-- it was hard not to feel ambushed, tricked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a couple of my correspondents challenged my premise – and the flood of testimony -- that stuff is getting crappier, acutely so. They made an economic argument. They claimed things are worse because we want them cheaper, but if price is adjusted for inflation, they’re of the same quality as always. These rant-killing sophisticates annoyed me. Our new washing machine with the faded dials and the vanishing enamel on its corners (I forgot to mention that defect) is the costliest model we’ve ever purchased. As for the much of the cheap stuff – those Target mittens, say – they aren’t merely inexpensive, they’re valueless. In fact, they’re of negative value when one considers the waste or materials involved, and the wasted energy of driving to buy them, then driving to return them later – a second trip that in this case, and many others, wasn’t worth making. Instead, we took the loss. And the world took the loss. A small one, but they add up.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In England in the 19</span><sup>th</sup><span> Century there arose certain thinkers – John Ruskin, William Morris – who believed that the quality of material objects reflects and affects the quality of society, even of the spirit. “Have nothing in your home,” wrote Morris, the father of the Arts and Crafts movement, which aimed to elevate the lives of the working and middle classes, “that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.” This would be a tall order nowadays. Recently, my wife needed a carrot peeler. She needed one rather quickly. Off to Target. The one she bought (the only one on sale) looked handsome enough, and the brand was one she recognized, but it failed in the useful department, miserably. It wasn’t sharp enough to peel a carrot. Like my pens which aren’t pens because pens put ink on paper, her peeler which didn’t peel was a nullity, a simulacrum, a representation of something, not the thing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world is going digital, we’re told, and someday there will even be digital real estate inhabited by people in digital clothes drinking digital orange juice extracted with digital juicers. &nbsp;People will play at the lives they once took seriously, lives that had once had heft and weight, and the juice content of juice will fall to zero. I suspect my old physical squeezer will still be working then, but the rest of my kitchen gear won’t. Not much of it. I might not last, either. I fear I won’t. The psychic toll of goods that don’t endure is that one loses faith that future will even come, and then one loses interest in it coming, for little that we own or use or cherish seems likely to be there with us to meet it.</p><p>             One wonders whose obsolescence is being planned, our products’ or our own?</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>speaking of math, you might want to take a look at Axler's <i>Linear Algebra Done Right</i> and Knuth's <i>Concrete Mathematics</i>. you'll want to know your combinatorics, your prob/stats, and your linear algebra cold. calculus through diffeqs is necessary to know, but i'm a pretty hardcore nerd and yet don't find myself integrating things all that often.
</p><p>now go forth and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUt0dZXPFoU">fight in the streets</a>. i list no machine learning because i dislike machine learning. there are no quantum books because quantum is not yet useful for streetfighting (we all look forward to this situation changing). i list no SIMT/accelerator books because they're all shite. i list no infosec because infosec is a subfield of QA, fight me. there are no links because i'm a lazy, lazy man.
</p><p>i've heard good things about Tim Roughgarden's algorithms books, and have them on my shelves to read soon, but cannot yet speak to them.
</p><p>you should of course also read <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Planet-Notcurses-Character-Graphics/dp/B086PNVNC9">Hacking the Planet with Notcurses</a>, buying copies for your team and family.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

      <p>
  <h2>Free your vacuum from the cloud</h2>
</p>

<p>Valetudo is an opinionated software solution for cloud-free vacuum robots installed on thousands of robots.<br>
Since it was started in 2018, it has matured to a reliable fire-and-forget solution that just works.</p>

<p>Valetudo is made, managed, maintained and more by me,
<a href="https://hypfer.de/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sören Beye</a>, with occasional contributions by
<a href="https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo/graphs/contributors" rel="noopener" target="_blank">these awesome people</a>.<br>
It would not exist without the ongoing work of <a href="https://dontvacuum.me/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dennis Giese</a>,
who is constantly providing us with new ways of liberating and gaining actual ownership of our robots.</p>

<p>As there is no telemetry built-in and no commercial interest to change that, I can’t tell you how many users exactly are there,
however judging by download counts and support group members, I’d guesstimate that there are a few thousand.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about why someone would want to use something like Valetudo, check out the <a href="https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/why-valetudo.html">Why Valetudo?</a> page.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about why someone would <strong>not</strong> want to use something like Valetudo, check out the <a href="https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/why-not-valetudo.html">Why not Valetudo?</a> page.</p>

<p>To choose the right robot to buy, head over to <a href="https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/buying-supported-robots.html">Buying supported robots</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about why I’m building Valetudo, the answer is actually pretty simple:<br>
When I was looking for a vacuum robot for myself, I didn’t find anything that matched what I was looking for.<br>
Thus, in a brief moment of hubris, I thought to myself: “How hard can it be?”.<br>
Now, four years later, we’re here and I’m quite happy with how it turned out.</p>

<p>Valetudo is licensed under the Apache-2.0 open-source license, because you need to be able to know what your smart
devices are doing and also alter (some parts of) it without being dependent on some vendor and/or third party.
The only way of truly achieving that is by being able to see and modify the code.</p>

<p>The Apache-2.0 license is a very permissive license and a lot of work is being shared for free here, so I trust people to not take
advantage of that and sell Valetudo; especially not as their own work.<br>
Please don’t disappoint me. Thank you.</p>

<p>These are the Valetudo Docs.
Simply use the navigation menu on the left to find what you’re looking for.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/getting-started.html">getting started guide</a> is a good place to start.</p>

<p>Also, make sure to check out the companion apps section.</p>

<h3 id="valetudo-is-a-garden-">Valetudo is a garden <a id="garden"></a></h3>
<p>This project is the hobby of some random guy on the internet. There is no intent to commercialize it, grow it
or expand the target audience of it. In fact, there is intent to explicitly not do that.</p>

<p>Think of Valetudo as a privately-owned public garden. You can visit it any time for free and enjoy it.
You can spend time there, and you can bring an infinite amount of friends with you to enjoy it.
You can walk the pathways built there. You can sit on some patch of grass and maybe watch a Duck or something.
You can leave a tip in the tip jar at the entrance if you really enjoy it and want to support it flourish.</p>

<p>You can take inspiration from it and bring that home to your own garden, giving it a personal twist and adapting it as needed.
You can even make friendly suggestions if you have a really good idea that ties into the vision that is already there.</p>

<p>But, at the end of the day, you must understand that it is still privately-owned. You’re on someone else’s property
over which you have no power at all. You will have to show the necessary respect. And - most importantly - you need to
understand that letting you into this garden is a gift and should be treated as such.</p>

<p>If you don’t like this garden because you don’t like how it’s structured, or you feel like it’s missing something, or maybe
I choose the wrong flowers to plant over there that’s fine. It’s just not for you then. You can leave at any time.</p>

<p>There is simply no ground to stand on to demand change to the garden. It doesn’t matter if it would attract more people
or if all the other gardens in town are doing something in a specific way. It doesn’t matter if your idea of what gardens
even are differs.<br>
This at the end of the day is simply private property with free public access as a gift to everyone.</p>

<p>When it comes to software development, <em>everyone</em> has access to infinite plots of undeveloped land that they can claim at any time.
Therefore, a garden being build with a specific vision does not take away the ability for anyone else to build their own garden with a different vision.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>What’s the deal with iOS security updates, anyway?</p>

<p>Not everybody can afford the newest and greatest Apple product. Luckily, Apple continues to support nearly-decade-old devices like the iPhone 6S, which and iOS 15.8 is still powering those devices, seemingly with official Apple support, with the latest update from <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/109032">October the 25th, which addressed some security vulnerabilities</a>.</p>

<p>In reality, however, Apple seems to only be addressing <em>some</em> security issues in its older supported devices.</p>

<hr>

<p>On June the 28th, Chromium announced that it had patched a vulnerability titled <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/08/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_15.html">“CVE-2023-4357: Insufficient validation of untrusted input in XML”</a>. In the <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1458911">bug report</a> for that issue, it was shown that on various devices, Google Chrome’s Blink rendering engine could reveal the contents of arbitrary files: <code>/etc/passwd</code>, for example. Interestingly, this also included Chrome for iOS. Given that Apple forces all browsers in iOS to use the WebKit rendering engine, that meant this vulnerability not only affected Blink, but also WebKit.</p>

<hr>

<p>Taking that exploit from June:</p>

<p><code>exploit.svg</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/foreignObject&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>exploit.php</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span> <span>header</span><span>(</span><span>"Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *"</span><span>);</span><span>?&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;p</span> <span>style=</span><span>"border-style: dotted;"</span><span>&gt;</span>/etc/group:

<span>&amp;group;</span>
<span>&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Aand trying it on the latest version of iOS that the (supported) iPhone 6S, we indeed see that the exploit <em>still</em> works. When opening the page, your <code>/etc/passwd</code> is there for the world to see.</p>

<p>That means that any website visited by anybody using an iPhone 6S (or possibly later versions) can silently steal internal system files. What files could somebody steal? Well, there’s always:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AddressBook.sqlitedb: which contains all of the personal contact information of the user and any saved contacts.</li>
  <li>call_history.db: which contains all received, dialled, and missed calls of the user.</li>
  <li>SMS/call_history.db: which contains the SMS history of the user.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or maybe:</p>
<ul>
  <li>History.plist: which contains the browsing history of the user.</li>
  <li>Cookies.plist: which contains the browser’s cookies – including authentication cookies, which an attacker can re-use once they are stolen.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>After contacting Apple to see whether they intended to patch this, the response was quite short: <code>If in the future you are able to reproduce this issue using a different device that's running iOS 17 or later, please let us know.</code></p>

<p>This raises some interesting questions. First off, does it imply that Apple does not patch vulnerabilities in older versions of iOS unless they may used to root/jailbreak the iPhone, or are known to be actively being either mass-exploited or exploited by some nation-state?</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/skysafe/reblog/tree/main/cve-2023-45866">new exploit targeting the iOS</a> (among other OS’) Bluetooth stack has also been <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214035">left unpatched by Apple in all versions except iOS 17</a>.</p>

<p>If I was an exploit vendor, I would be paying very close attention to vulnerabilities fixed in iOS 17, and seeing whether they work on previous (supported) iOS versions. Not every target has the newest Apple device, and minimal amount of surveillance may save the vendor from burning a 0day on a target that is using a slightly older device.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note: I haven’t tested this against older (supported) MacOS versions, but it’s definitely possible that Safari is exploitable here, too.</p>

The Debian project has <a href="https://www.debian.org/vote/2023/vote_002">completed a
general-resolution vote</a>, adopting a statement expressing concern about
the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) pending in the European Union.
</p><blockquote>
	Even if only "commercial activities" are in the scope of CRA, the
	Free Software community - and as a consequence, everybody - will
	lose a lot of small projects. CRA will force many small enterprises
	and most probably all self employed developers out of business
	because they simply cannot fulfill the requirements imposed by
	CRA. Debian and other Linux distributions depend on their work. If
	accepted as it is, CRA will undermine not only an established
	community but also a thriving market. CRA needs an exemption for
	small businesses and, at the very least, solo-entrepreneurs

<p>From December 18 to January 1, <em>Today in Energy</em> will feature some of our favorite articles from 2023. Today’s article was originally published on August 1.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/images/2023.08.01/main.svg" alt="U.S. nuclear power capacity additions"></p><p><span>
<strong>Data source: </strong>U.S. Energy Information Administration, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860m/"><em>Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory</em></a>, and Georgia Power press release<br><strong>Note: </strong>Data excludes capacity built and retired before 2002.

<p>A new reactor at Georgia’s Vogtle nuclear power plant is now in commercial operation, according to an <a href="https://www.georgiapower.com/company/news-center/2023-articles/vogtle-unit-3-goes-into-operation.html">announcement from Georgia Power</a>, one of the plant’s owners. It is the first new nuclear reactor to start up in the United States since the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Watts Bar 2 was commissioned in 2016.    </p>
	
     
	
<p>The new 1,114 megawatt (MW) Unit 3 reactor joins two existing reactors at Plant Vogtle, which is jointly owned by Georgia Power and three other electric utility companies. The plant’s first two reactors, with a combined 2,430 MW of <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.php?id=Generator%20nameplate%20capacity">nameplate capacity</a>, came online in the late 1980s. Georgia Power expects another similar-sized fourth reactor, Vogtle Unit 4, <a href="https://www.georgiapower.com/company/news-center/2023-articles/hot-functional-testing-completed-for-vogtle-unit-4.html#:~:text=Unit%204%20is%20projected%20to,or%20the%20first%20quarter%202024.">to begin operation</a> sometime between November 2023 and March 2024. The two new reactors will make Plant Vogtle the largest nuclear power plant in the country, surpassing the 4,210 MW Palo Verde plant in Arizona. </p>

<p>Construction at the two new reactor sites <a href="https://www.augustachronicle.com/story/business/2009/11/22/stub-984/14385703007/">began in 2009</a>. Originally expected to cost $14 billion and begin commercial operation in 2016 (Vogtle 3) and 2017 (Vogtle 4), the project ran into significant construction delays and cost overruns. The total cost of the project is now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-power-co-southern-climate-and-environment-business-3b1d6c65353c6a65b1ccfddede753ab7">estimated at more than $30 billion</a>. </p>

<p>Both Vogtle Units 3 and 4 use a new reactor design, the Westinghouse <a href="https://www.westinghousenuclear.com/energy-systems/ap1000-pwr">AP1000</a>. This next generation advanced reactor has a smaller footprint and simpler design than previous generation reactor technologies. It also features robust <a href="https://www.westinghousenuclear.com/energy-systems/ap1000-pwr/safety/passive-safety-systems">passive safety systems</a> that can shut down the reactor without any operator action or external power source. Units 3 and 4 are the first U.S. deployment of the AP1000 Generation III+ reactor. Two other Westinghouse AP1000 reactors were planned for a nuclear power plant in South Carolina, but <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=32472#:~:text=South%20Carolina%20Electric%20%26%20Gas%20Company,Summer%20nuclear%20power%20plant.">construction was halted</a> in 2017. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.energy.gov/management/december-23-1957-shippingport">first commercial nuclear power reactor</a> in the United States came online in December 1957 in Shippingport, Pennsylvania. Most U.S. nuclear reactors were <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=30972#:~:text=Of%20the%2099%20gigawatts%20(GW,online%20between%201970%20and%201990.">built in the 20-year period from 1970 to 1990</a>. Prior to Vogtle Unit 3, the last nuclear reactor to start in the United States was <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=26652">Watts Bar Unit 2</a> in Tennessee. Construction on Watts Bar 2 began in 1973 but was suspended in 1985. Work resumed in 2007, and the reactor came online in 2016. </p>

<p>With 95,881 MW of nuclear power capacity at 93 operating commercial reactors, the United States has more nuclear capacity than any other country. Nuclear power plants produce nearly 20% of the country’s electricity. </p>

<p>Although a number of nuclear reactors have retired in recent years, there has been <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/25/america-aims-for-nuclear-power-renaissance">interest</a> in nuclear power as an energy resource to help reduce the carbon footprint of the U.S. electric power sector. Generation from nuclear reactors doesn’t produce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and can provide essential baseload power that would otherwise largely come from coal- and natural gas-fired plants. </p>

<p>Recent legislation, such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, supports U.S. nuclear energy as part of a clean energy, zero-carbon generating portfolio.</p>
