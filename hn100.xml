<p dir="auto">Ergo (formerly known as Oragono) is a modern IRC server written in Go. Its core design principles are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Being simple to set up and use</li>
<li>Combining the features of an ircd, a services framework, and a bouncer (integrated account management, history storage, and bouncer functionality)</li>
<li>Bleeding-edge <a href="https://ircv3.net/software/servers.html" rel="nofollow">IRCv3 support</a>, suitable for use as an IRCv3 reference implementation</li>
<li>High customizability via a rehashable (i.e., reloadable at runtime) YAML config</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Ergo is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/jlatt/ergonomadic">Ergonomadic</a> IRC daemon &lt;3</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Platform Packages</h3><a id="user-content-platform-packages" aria-label="Permalink: Platform Packages" href="#platform-packages"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Some platforms/distros also have Ergo packages maintained for them:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Arch Linux <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ergochat/" rel="nofollow">AUR</a> - Maintained by <a href="https://github.com/vith">Jason Papakostas (@vith)</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using Docker</h3><a id="user-content-using-docker" aria-label="Permalink: Using Docker" href="#using-docker"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A Dockerfile and example docker-compose recipe are available in the <code>distrib/docker</code> directory. Ergo is automatically published
to the GitHub Container Registry at <a href="https://ghcr.io/ergochat/ergo" rel="nofollow">ghcr.io/ergochat/ergo</a>. For more information, see the distrib/docker
<a href="https://github.com/ergochat/ergo/blob/master/distrib/docker/README.md">README file</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">From Source</h3><a id="user-content-from-source" aria-label="Permalink: From Source" href="#from-source"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can also clone this repository and build from source. Typical deployments should use the <code>stable</code> branch, which points to the latest stable release. In general, <code>stable</code> should coincide with the latest published tag that is not designated as a beta or release candidate (for example, <code>v2.7.0-rc1</code> was an unstable release candidate and <code>v2.7.0</code> was the corresponding stable release), so you can also identify the latest stable release tag on the <a href="https://github.com/ergochat/ergo/releases">releases page</a> and build that.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>master</code> branch is not recommended for production use since it may contain bugs, and because the forwards compatibility guarantees for the config file and the database that apply to releases do not apply to master. That is to say, running master may result in changes to your database that end up being incompatible with future versions of Ergo.</p>
<p dir="auto">For information on contributing to Ergo, see <a href="https://github.com/ergochat/ergo/blob/master/DEVELOPING.md">DEVELOPING.md</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building</h4><a id="user-content-building" aria-label="Permalink: Building" href="#building"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You'll need an <a href="https://golang.org/dl/" rel="nofollow">up-to-date distribution of the Go language for your OS and architecture</a>. Once that's installed (check the output of <code>go version</code>), just check out your desired branch or tag and run <code>make</code>. This will produce an executable binary named <code>ergo</code> in the base directory of the project. (Ergo vendors all its dependencies, so you will not need to fetch any dependencies remotely.)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration</h2><a id="user-content-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: Configuration" href="#configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The default config file <a href="https://github.com/ergochat/ergo/blob/master/default.yaml"><code>default.yaml</code></a> helps walk you through what each option means and changes.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can use the <code>--conf</code> parameter when launching Ergo to control where it looks for the config file. For instance: <code>ergo run --conf /path/to/ircd.yaml</code>. The configuration file also stores where the log, database, certificate, and other files are opened. Normally, all these files use relative paths, but you can change them to be absolute (such as <code>/var/log/ircd.log</code>) when running Ergo as a service.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Logs</h3><a id="user-content-logs" aria-label="Permalink: Logs" href="#logs"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">By default, logs go to stderr only. They can be configured to go to a file, or you can use systemd to direct the stderr to the system journal (see the manual for details). The configuration format of logs is designed to be easily pluggable, and is inspired by the logging config provided by InspIRCd.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Passwords</h3><a id="user-content-passwords" aria-label="Permalink: Passwords" href="#passwords"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Passwords (for both <code>PASS</code> and oper logins) are stored using bcrypt. To generate encrypted strings for use in the config, use the <code>genpasswd</code> subcommand as such:</p>

<p dir="auto">With this, you receive a blob of text which you can plug into your configuration file.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nickname and channel registration</h3><a id="user-content-nickname-and-channel-registration" aria-label="Permalink: Nickname and channel registration" href="#nickname-and-channel-registration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Ergo relies heavily on user accounts to enable its distinctive features (such as allowing multiple clients per nickname). As a user, you can register your current nickname as an account using <code>/msg NickServ register &lt;password&gt;</code>. Once you have done so, you should <a href="https://libera.chat/guides/sasl" rel="nofollow">enable SASL in your clients</a>, ensuring that you will be automatically logged into your account on each connection. This will prevent <a href="https://github.com/ergochat/ergo/blob/master/docs/MANUAL.md#nick-equals-account">problems claiming your registered nickname</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you have registered your nickname, you can use it to register channels:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Join the channel with <code>/join #channel</code></li>
<li>Register the channel with <code>/CS REGISTER #channel</code></li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">After this, your channel will remember the fact that you're the owner, the topic, and any modes set on it!</p>

<h2><a name="Introduction_" id="Introduction_"></a>Introduction<br></h2>
The XOR texture is a very easy to generate texture that looks fine.
However, it's so overused that it's not a good choice to use in in
a demo or intro release. It isn't useful for games either, unless
you want some fancy floor tiles. What it's useful for, is for
testing a texture mapper you just wrote, in case you want to
quickly test out a pattern without having to load an image file or
write more complex texture generation code.<p>

This is an extremely small article, but the XOR Texture just
couldn't be left out in a series of texture generation
articles.</p><h2><a name="The_XOR_Texture" id="The_XOR_Texture"></a>The XOR
Texture</h2>
The XOR texture is simply generated by xor-ing the x and y
coordinate of the current pixel. The '^' operator in C++ is the XOR
operator.<center>
<div>
<pre><span>int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  screen(256, 256, 0, "The XOR Texture");

  for(int y = 0; y &lt; h; y++)
  for(int x = 0; x &lt; w; x++)
  {
    Uint8 c = x ^ y;
    pset(x, y, ColorRGB(c, c, c));
  }

  redraw();
  sleep();
  return 0;
}</span></pre>
</div>
</center>
<br>
That's it, if you run it, you see the XOR texture:<p>

<img alt="The XOR Texture" src="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/images/xortexture.gif"></p><p>

There are 3 things you should keep in mind though:</p><p>

<b>1)</b> The sizes of the texture should be a power of two, if
they aren't, the texture doesn't look as good:</p><p>

<img alt="" src="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/images/xortexturesize.gif"></p><p>

<b>2)</b> Color component values range from 0 to 255. The maximum
color value generated by the XOR operation is the same as the
dimensions of the texture if its size is a power of two. So if the
size of your XOR pattern is smaller than 256, for example only 64,
it'll be too dark (image on the left). Multiply the color with 4 to
make it bright again (image on the right):</p><p>

<img alt="" src="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/images/xortexturedark.gif"> <img alt="" src="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/images/xortexturebright.gif"></p><p>

<b>3)</b> On the other hand, if the size is larger than 256, for
example 512, you have to make sure the color is limited to a
maximum value of 256. You can either modulo divide it through 256,
but then it isn't a real XOR pattern anymore. Better is to divide
it through 2. In any case, using a XOR texture larger than 256x256
doesn't increase the quality because there aren't enough distinct
color values, unless you're using a color mode that allows more
bits per channel. But who'd want to generate a 1024x1024 XOR
texture anyway.</p><p>

The XOR operator takes the binary values of both integers, and does
a binary XOR on every two corresponding bits. XOR or eXclusive OR
returns 1 if both bits are different, and returns 0 if both bits
are the same: "Bit a is 1 OR bit 2 is 1, but <i>not</i> both". In
other words, it applies the following truth table to every two
corresponding bits:</p><table>

<tbody><tr>
<td colspan="3" rowspan="1">
<b>XOR</b><br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>Bit_a</i><br></td>
<td><i>Bit_b</i><br></td>
<td><i>Result</i><br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0<br></td>
<td>0<br></td>
<td>0<br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0<br></td>
<td><b>1</b><br></td>
<td><b>1</b><br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>1</b><br></td>
<td>0<br></td>
<td><b>1</b><br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>1</b><br></td>
<td><b>1</b><br></td>
<td>0<br></td>
</tr>

</tbody></table>
<br>
This is done on every bit of the integer, creating the many
possible resulting values.<p>

For example, 5 XOR 13 = 8, because in binary 0101 XOR 1101 =
1000.</p><h2><a name="Colors" id="Colors"></a>Colors</h2>
You can also try the XOR texture with different colors, by using
different value for R, G and B. For example:<center>
<div>
<pre><span>int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  screen(256, 256, 0, "The XOR Texture");

  ColorRGB color;

  for(int y = 0; y &lt; h; y++)
  for(int x = 0; x &lt; w; x++)
  {
    Uint8 c = (x ^ y);
    color.r = 255 - c;
    color.g = c;
    color.b = c % 128;
    pset(x, y, color);
  }

  redraw();
  sleep();
  return 0;
}
</span></pre>
</div>
</center>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/images/xortexturecolor.gif"><p>

You can even use the xor value as hue for the HSVtoRGB
function...</p><center>
<div>
<pre><span>int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  screen(256, 256, 0, "The XOR Texture");

  ColorRGB color;

  for(int y = 0; y &lt; h; y++)
  for(int x = 0; x &lt; w; x++)
  {
    Uint8 c = (x ^ y);
    color = HSVtoRGB(ColorHSV(c, 255, 255));
    pset(x, y, color);
  }

  redraw();
  sleep();
  return 0;
}
</span></pre>
</div>
</center>
<br>
<img alt="" src="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/images/xortexturehsv.gif"><h2><a name="AND_and_OR" id="AND_and_OR"></a>AND and OR</h2>
The AND and the OR operator also generate a similar texture.<p>

The XOR operator returns 1 if both bits are different:</p><table>

<tbody><tr>
<td colspan="3" rowspan="1">
<b>XOR</b><br></td>

<br>
The AND operator is denoted '&amp;' in C++, and the OR operator
'|', replace the '^' operator with those to use the new operators.
Here's the result of XOR, AND and OR respectively:<p>

<img alt="" src="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/images/xortexture.gif"> <img alt="" src="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/images/andtexture.gif">
<img alt="" src="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/images/ortexture.gif"></p><p>

It makes sense that the AND texture is darker, because it returns 1
only in a single case. The OR texture is brighter, because it
returns 1 very often. The sum of the XOR texture and the AND
texture is the OR texture.</p><h2><a name="Conclusion" id="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
It was shown how easy it is to create a XOR texture, which makes
the XOR texture useful to test if a texture renderer is working.
However, it's not suitable for applications such as art or
games.<p>

Here, the XOR pattern was used as a 3D texture (x ^ y ^ z) to test
if a planet texture renderer was working correctly:</p><p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"><p>IncludeOS allows you to run your application in the cloud without an operating system. IncludeOS adds operating system functionality to your application allowing you to create performant, secure and resource efficient virtual machines.</p>

<p>IncludeOS applications boot in tens of milliseconds and require only a few megabytes of disk and memory.</p>

<p>To run a service with IncludeOS on Linux or macOS you do not need to install IncludeOS, however you need to install a few dependencies depending on the service you will run. You can start by trying out our simplest hello_world service. For this service you will need the following dependencies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conan package manager</li>
  <li>cmake, make, nasm</li>
  <li>clang, or alternatively gcc on linux. Prebuilt packages are available for clang 6.0 and gcc 7.3</li>
  <li>qemu</li>
  <li>python3 packages: psutil, jsonschema</li>
</ul>

<p>With the above dependencies you should be able to build an application within minutes.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://buffett.online/">buffett.online</a><a target="_blank" href="https://songdonkey.ai/">songdonkey.ai</a></p>
<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>conan config <span>install </span>https://github.com/includeos/conan_config.git
<span>$ </span>git clone https://github.com/includeos/hello_world.git
<span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>build_hello_world
<span>$ </span><span>cd </span>build_hello_world
<span>$ </span>conan <span>install</span> ../hello_world <span>-pr</span> 
<span>$ </span><span>source</span> ./activate.sh
<span>$ </span>cmake ../hello_world
<span>$ </span>cmake <span>--build</span> <span>.</span>
<span>$ </span>boot hello
</code></pre></div>

<p>The hello world booted service should look like this:</p>

<div><pre><code>================================================================================
 IncludeOS 0.14.1-1093 (x86_64 / 64-bit)
 +--&gt; Running [ Hello world - OS included ]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello world
    [ main ] returned with status 0
</code></pre></div>

<p>For detailed instructions see the <a href="https://github.com/includeos/IncludeOS/blob/master/README.md">GitHub README</a>. Once installed we suggest looking at and booting a few of the demo-examples to familarize yourself with the system.</p>

<p>We strive to make it easy to create fast and useful services. The below code will set up a simple TCP echo service and happily talk to anyone connecting.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;os&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;net/interfaces&gt;
</span>

      <span>conn</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>
  <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The network configuration of the virtual machine can reside in a JSON file, named config.json, placed in the same folder. It should look something like this, depending on your need:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"net"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
    </span><span>{</span><span>

      </span><span>"config"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"dhcp-with-fallback"</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span>"address"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"10.0.0.42"</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span>"netmask"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"255.255.255.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span>"gateway"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"10.0.0.1"</span><span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><figure data-sentry-component="ArticleHero" data-sentry-source-file="article-hero.tsx"><figcaption><span>Getty Images/Ringer illustration</span></figcaption></figure><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">The sun had already set in Newfoundland, Canada, and Paul Gatto was working late to give me a presentation on headlights. This, it should be said, is not his job. Not even close, really. Gatto, 28, is a front-end developer by day, working for a weather application that’s used by the majority of Canadian meteorologists, he told me on a video call, occasionally hitting his e-cig or sipping on a Miller Lite. As to how he ended up as one of the primary forces in the movement to make car headlights less bright—a movement that’s become surprisingly robust in recent years—even Gatto can’t really explain.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">“It is fucking weird,” he said. “I need something else to do with my spare time. This takes a lot of it.”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Gatto is the founder of the subreddit <a href="http://reddit.com/r/fuckyourheadlights/">r/FuckYourHeadlights</a>, the internet’s central hub for those at their wits’ end with the current state of headlights. The posts consist of a mishmash of venting, meme-ing, and community organizing. A common entry is a photo taken from inside the car of someone being blasted with headlights as bright as an atomic bomb, and a caption along the lines of <a href="http://reddit.com/r/fuckyourheadlights/comments/10s3rmy/how_is_this_fucking_legal/">“How is this fucking legal?!”</a> Or users will joke about going back in time and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/fuckyourheadlights/comments/1d4nthv/whats_the_poblem_with_their_headlights/">Skynet-style</a> killing the Audi lighting engineer who first rolled out LED headlights. Or they’ll discuss ways to write to their congresspeople, like Mike Thompson, House Democrat of California, who <a href="http://reddit.com/r/fuckyourheadlights/comments/1axtnfy/congress_gets_involved/">recently expressed support</a> for the cause.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">At its worst, the forum resembles Grampa Simpson writing a letter to the president to say that there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5dmxBUbzBU">too many states</a>. (“I am <em>not</em> a crackpot,” Grampa adds.) But at its best, it feels like a balm for those of us who have been pushed to optical-induced madness on the roads. For those who feel like, as headlights get brighter, it’s actually becoming harder to see.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">After I <a href="https://x.com/Nate_Rgrs/status/1662241673043116036">posted</a> about the subreddit on X last year, Gatto emailed me, and it wasn’t long before we were on a video call and he was giving a PowerPoint presentation he’d made the night before. It was titled “The Internet-Focused History of FuckYourHeadlights, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying About Headlights and Start Worrying About Society Itself.”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">“First, I’d like to teach you some words,” Gatto said, priming me for a conversation about the minutiae of government policy and auto engineering. There was “obfuscation” (the intentional act of making something hard to understand), “mutual recursion” (when two things are defined in terms of each other, creating a loop), and “Ouroboros” (the snake eating its tail). Around this point, Victor Morgan, who was also on the call, cut in. “Paul,” he said, “where are you going with this, bud?”&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Morgan does this kind of thing from time to time. The two are partners—moderating the subreddit together and working in tandem to research headlight arcana—but it’s a good cop–bad cop dynamic. Neatly dressed and carefully spoken, Morgan, 41, is a mechanical engineer and lives far from Gatto, in Greenville, South Carolina. One of the first times the two spoke, it was because Morgan wanted to tell Gatto he didn’t like the subreddit’s name. They’ve since become good friends.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Gatto is the one focused on the bigger picture: digging up publicly available information, refining the messaging of their cause, optimizing the subreddit for search engines (he’s <a href="https://x.com/BarneyRetina/status/1836228891175784570">proud</a> of how high up the subreddit appears if you google “bright headlights”). Morgan is the one who sees their ideas through with measurements and engineering: He’s created a device for your rear windshield that pops up a reflective surface when someone’s lights are glaring at you from behind (<a href="https://www.owmyeyes.com/products/owmyeyes-light-the-road-not-my-face">$70, homemade</a>, questionably legal), and he’s gone to car dealerships to measure the brightness of different headlights. (According to Morgan’s numbers, Teslas and Hondas are among the brightest.)</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">If you want Rust Cohle–worthy lines about how it’s all connected, you go to Gatto. (“The automakers and the insurers can all be classified as the same financial entity back at this point,” he told me. “They will doctor what they need to, as far as I can see.”) If you want an engineer-worthy dose of hard-nosed practicality, you go to Morgan. (He has a cat whom he just calls “Cat.”) They’re an unlikely pair, but they are <em>not</em> crackpots.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Headlight brightness might almost seem like too random a subject for anyone to be as invested in as they are. But as it turns out, that’s kind of the point. “There’s a lot of issues that I care about,” Morgan said. “This is one that I think is niche enough that I can have an influence on.” Gatto’s motivation comes from the experience of watching his partner, Liz, struggle to recover from being hit by a cab while walking across the street. He sees headlights as “a realistic and tangible attack surface on the current trend toward antihuman design in our world, primarily guided by the auto industry.”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">But deep down, what motivates them is the same twitch in the eye that brought me to the subreddit in the first place. “I’m not a very rageful person,” Gatto said, “but for some reason, these lights brought it out of me. And I kind of realized that’s why I had to do something about it. Because no one’s going to come help us.”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">There appear to be two types of drivers in North America these days: those who think about headlights only when one of theirs goes out, and those who fixate on them every time they drive at night. If you’re in the first camp, consider yourself lucky. Those in the second camp—aggravated by the excess glare produced in this new era of light-emitting diode headlights—are riled up enough that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration receives more consumer complaints about headlights than any other topic, several insiders told me.&nbsp;</p><figure data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="image.tsx"><div

at the same time, the number of demerits issued for lack of brightness have dropped precipitously. In other words: It’s not just your imagination. Headlights are brighter.</figcaption></figure></figure><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">It’s not just in the aggrieved drivers’ imaginations. Going by the publicly available data of the&nbsp;Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, headlight brightness has roughly doubled in the past 10 years—although you probably don’t need convincing if you’ve been paying attention over that span. Something <em>happened </em>out there, and a zap of light causing you to grimace behind the wheel suddenly went from a rarity to a routine occurrence.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">As opposed to the sepia-toned halogen lights we had mostly been using for generations of vehicles, LED lights—which are now used for the vast majority of new cars—come out blazing white or blue, like an omnipresent police flashlight shining at you during a traffic stop. And in what can be seen as a flawed attempt to match LED capabilities on other vehicles, it’s also become not uncommon, anecdotally speaking, for people to have their high beams on even on crowded highways and streets—something that’s technically illegal because it’s deemed to be a danger to other drivers. The strange thing is, though, I can’t say I notice much of a difference between one car’s high beams and another’s low beams anymore.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">John D. Bullough, a program director at the Mount Sinai Light and Health Research Center, has been studying light and its ramifications on health for the past 30 years, and he’ll tell you that the difference between older light sources and LEDs is night and day. “The first 20 years or so, [lighting] technology was very stable,” he told me over the phone. “In other words, you had incandescent light bulbs at home, and you had fluorescent lights in your office and sodium lights on the streets, and nothing really changed very much. And then, suddenly, the last 10 years of that 30 years have been a whirlwind because of LEDs. I mean, they’ve changed everything. Everything is LED. There essentially aren’t light bulbs anymore.”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">LEDs offer benefits over older light sources, which is why they’ve been fast-tracked into near-universal use <a href="https://www.vox.com/science/2023/8/12/23827110/light-bulb-incandescent-led-energy-efficiency-ban-explained">via government-mandated performance standards</a>. They last longer and require less energy, making them more environmentally friendly, and are more customizable, making them suited for endless purposes. But LEDs are fundamentally different from what came before them—the light can be carefully aimed as opposed to emitted in all directions—and they’re vastly more powerful. And as they were rolled out en masse at a rapid pace, any <a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/article/led-light-bulbs-investigation.html">potential repercussions</a> would have to be discovered on the fly.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">“We’re all like human experiments,” said Mark Baker, when I called him to talk about his nonprofit, the Soft Lights Foundation, the mission of which is to advocate “for the protection of people and the environment from the harms of visible light radiation emitted by products that use light-emitting diodes.” Baker’s concern is with the broader integration of LEDs in society, but he shows up regularly in the headlight world, having recently organized a <a href="https://www.softlights.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NHTSA-Petition-to-Limit-Headlight-Intensity.pdf">petition</a> that gathered nearly 60,000 signatures demanding that NHTSA limit headlight intensity. Unlike Morgan and Gatto, however, this isn’t a nights and weekends gig for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Baker was working as a middle school math teacher in Northern California and thought of himself “as a regular person” before the mass implementation of LEDs. Then the world shifted while he was in traffic one day around 2016. He remembers looking at a Cadillac that had daytime-running LEDs—the non-primary headlights that run at all times on many modern vehicles—and “when my brain saw this light, I couldn’t look away,” he said. “Even though it was intense, I was drawn to it, and I started to feel a presence I’ve never felt, like evil.” As LEDs became more common, Baker became overwhelmed and had a mental breakdown, ending up in the hospital. He was diagnosed with mild autism spectrum disorder—which he says explains his hyper-fixation on bright lights—and couldn’t go back to work because of the LEDs in his classroom.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">When I spoke to Baker, 59, he was living in a sparsely lit rural area that he moved to with his partner, where he had been focusing on the Soft Lights Foundation since founding it in 2021. Baker told me he’s heard from a variety of people with various diagnoses—epilepsy, photophobia, migraines, lupus, autism—who struggle with LEDs. “I’ve got a guy that calls me from time to time wanting to commit suicide because of these LED lights in the Blue Ridge [Mountains],” he said. “We know that individuals are highly individualized. Each of us is going to react differently.”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Baker is among a group of people who feel that NHTSA, which is responsible for regulating automotive safety, should have adjusted the rule book to accommodate LEDs before they were allowed in new cars. This was how NHTSA approached previous fundamental changes to headlight technology, Baker points out. As headlights went from circular to rectangular and from sealed beams to replaceable bulbs, the rules and accommodations changed with them. “Well, when LED headlights came out,” Baker said, “they skipped all that. They just started selling cars with the LED headlights.”&nbsp;</p><figure data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="image.tsx"><div data-radix-aspect-ratio-wrapper=""><p><img alt="" data-sentry-element="Image" data-sentry-source-file="image.tsx" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOne-day-energy-conservation-in-Ukraine-following-damaged-infrastructure-by-Russian-attacks-scaled.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 640w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOne-day-energy-conservation-in-Ukraine-following-damaged-infrastructure-by-Russian-attacks-scaled.jpg&amp;w=750&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 750w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOne-day-energy-conservation-in-Ukraine-following-damaged-infrastructure-by-Russian-attacks-scaled.jpg&amp;w=828&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 828w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOne-day-energy-conservation-in-Ukraine-following-damaged-infrastructure-by-Russian-attacks-scaled.jpg&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 1080w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOne-day-energy-conservation-in-Ukraine-following-damaged-infrastructure-by-Russian-attacks-scaled.jpg&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 1200w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOne-day-energy-conservation-in-Ukraine-following-damaged-infrastructure-by-Russian-attacks-scaled.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 1920w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOne-day-energy-conservation-in-Ukraine-following-damaged-infrastructure-by-Russian-attacks-scaled.jpg&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 2048w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOne-day-energy-conservation-in-Ukraine-following-damaged-infrastructure-by-Russian-attacks-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 3840w" src="https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOne-day-energy-conservation-in-Ukraine-following-damaged-infrastructure-by-Russian-attacks-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30"></p></div><figure><figcaption>The differences between blue-toned and sepia-toned headlights can be seen on a darkened street in Kyiv, Ukraine.</figcaption></figure><figcaption>Metin Aktas/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">It is certainly true that Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108—NHTSA’s regulation covering all forms of vehicle lighting, conceived in 1968—has not been adjusted to create new restrictions for LEDs. That’s easy to tell because the requirements in the standard haven’t been adjusted <em>at all</em> since 1986. One person I spoke to, who previously worked at NHTSA and discussed their former employer on the condition of anonymity, described 108 as being among the biggest entries in the book, yet also “probably one of the least updated.” (In response to an interview request for this story, NHTSA asked that questions be emailed; in response to the questions, NHTSA provided a broad statement that did not answer specific questions, such as ones about the nature of updating 108. “Although headlighting technology has changed over the years,” the statement read, “NHTSA’s lighting standard has remained constant in limiting the amount of glaring light directed toward oncoming and preceding traffic.”)</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Several people I spoke to insisted that the main issue with 108’s guidelines when applied to LEDs is that there’s no maximum brightness for certain areas of a headlight. The guidelines set limits on areas of bulb emissions that tend to cause glare problems for other drivers, but those areas were determined based on the light output of older bulbs. LEDs’ output and maneuverability changed the game. Think of an LED headlight more like a pixelated television or computer screen rather than a light bulb. Because of that design, the luminosity of precise areas of the headlight can be limited while the overall brightness is pushed up, up, up.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Chris Trechter, a lighting-focused engineer who used to work for Magna International, the largest automobile parts manufacturer in North America, told me the company would adhere to 108 in making headlights for clients like General Motors but that the rule is “archaic.” “It does not account for LEDs,” he said, “and there are giant loopholes that allow you to throw basically unlimited light as long as you meet all the other aspects of 108.”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">On a recent episode of the<em> Carmudgeon Show</em> podcast, auto journalist Jason Cammisa <a href="https://youtu.be/MkwjMV2of_8?t=697">described</a> a phenomenon occurring with some LED headlights in which there are observable minor spots of dimness among an otherwise bright field of light. “With complex arrays of LEDs and of optics,” he said, “car companies realized they can engineer in a dark spot where it’s being measured, but the rest of the field is vastly over-illuminated. And I’ve had now two car companies’ engineers, when I played stupid and said, ‘What’s the dark spot?’ … And the lighting engineers are all fucking proud of themselves: ‘That’s where they measure the fucking thing!’ And I’m like, ‘You assholes, you’re the reason that every fucking new car is blinding the shit out of everyone.’”&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Cammisa, who did not respond to an interview request, compared this situation to the massive dieselgate scandal, in which Volkswagen was caught rigging emissions tests. (Fines levied against VW ended up costing the company <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/legal/vws-dieselgate-bill-hits-30-bln-after-another-charge-idUSKCN1C4270/">around $30 billion</a>.) To Cammisa, deliberately darkening specific areas of LEDs to bypass the testing system demonstrates a craven approach similar to cheating on emissions tests. He’s called it lightinggate. Or headlightgate. He’s workshopping the name.&nbsp;</p><figure data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="image.tsx"><div data-radix-aspect-ratio-wrapper=""><p><img alt="" data-sentry-element="Image" data-sentry-source-file="image.tsx" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FMercedes-Headlight-Ad-2016.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 640w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FMercedes-Headlight-Ad-2016.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 750w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FMercedes-Headlight-Ad-2016.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 828w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FMercedes-Headlight-Ad-2016.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 1080w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FMercedes-Headlight-Ad-2016.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 1200w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FMercedes-Headlight-Ad-2016.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 1920w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FMercedes-Headlight-Ad-2016.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 2048w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FMercedes-Headlight-Ad-2016.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 3840w" src="https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FMercedes-Headlight-Ad-2016.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30"></p></div><figure><figcaption>This 2016 Mercedes-Benz ad campaign touting the power of the carmaker’s headlights has become notorious among anti-brightness activists.</figcaption></figure><figcaption>Mercedes-Benz</figcaption></figure><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">I reached out to over a dozen car companies for this story, and only one provided an interview: Audi. In subsequently talking to Audi spokesperson Mark Dahnke, I relayed Cammisa’s description of how LED headlights were being deceptively engineered, and Dahnke told me he was “not aware of anything like that.” But Trechter, the former auto lighting engineer, told me Cammisa’s account was “100 percent real.”&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">So why go through all this trouble just for more light? Cammisa believes it’s an <a href="https://youtu.be/MkwjMV2of_8?t=799">“arms race”</a>—part of a battle between automakers to make their cars seem as state of the art as possible. “‘I get into my <a href="https://lucidmotors.com/air">Lucid Air</a>, and I have great lighting in every direction,’” he said, taking on the theoretical perspective of a new customer. “‘Oh, my headlights are <em>great</em>!’” Consider it something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war">the loudness war</a> in music, in which albums were being mixed at increasing volumes, particularly in the 2000s, to make the music more attention grabbing, at the cost of quality. The brightness war, if you will.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Another possible explanation comes via a nongovernmental entity that has become a major force in the automotive world: the IIHS, a nonprofit funded by insurance companies with the goal of limiting loss. In the absence of any real NHTSA presence in the modern headlight conversation, the IIHS’s headlight safety rating has become a North Star for auto manufacturers, ostensibly for advertising reasons.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">“It made our life hell to try and make light that bright,” said Trechter. “But GM wanted it for that safety rating, and that’s it.” According to Trechter, the way to get the best safety rating is to exploit the lack of intensity limits on certain areas of the headlight and make the light shine as far down the road as possible. “They would push us to get as much down-road punch as they could get,” he said, in reference to the automakers.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Matthew Brumbelow, a senior research engineer at the IIHS, explained the headlight safety rating in a more nuanced way. While “you can’t get a good rating and have super high glare,” he said, “you also can’t get a good rating and have a dim headlight that doesn’t glare anyone but also is too dim to help people avoid crashes on the road.” Brumbelow said both factors play into their rating but admitted it’s the brightness that they weigh more heavily. “That’s what we’ve seen,” he said. “A huge reduction in crash rates based on more light reaching the road.”&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">The “brighter is better” mentality is the ultimate thorn in the side of activists like Gatto and Morgan, who view it almost as an insult to their intelligence. Brumbelow pointed to a <a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/good-iihs-headlight-ratings-linked-to-lower-crash-rates#:~:text=Controlling%20for%20differences%20in%20miles%20traveled%2C%20driver%2Drelated,single%2Dvehicle%20crash%20rate%2C%20compared%20with%20poor%2Drated%20ones.">2021 IIHS study</a> that demonstrated a 19 percent reduction in nighttime single-vehicle crashes for cars with good headlight safety ratings, but Morgan sees a major issue with that study. “Basically,” Morgan said, “it means that assholes with bright headlights are in less single-car accidents than the people that they blind.”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">One logical solution to this debate would be to factor in crashes that have occurred due to excessive glare, but this has proved to be a challenge out of the reach of the IIHS and other headlight experts. If a car is in an accident due to another car’s excessive glare, for instance, the offending vehicle that caused the situation would likely never know it and just keep driving.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">The inability to clinically prove the dangers of headlight glare is at the heart of the issue. “You cannot mandate or prohibit something in the U.S. system without meeting a stringent cost-benefit requirement,” said Daniel Stern, chief editor of Driving Vision News and one of the foremost authorities in headlights and headlight policy.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Stern told me about a conversation he once had in the late 2000s with Richard Van Iderstine, then a recently retired automotive safety standards engineer at NHTSA with great rulemaking authority over headlights. Stern and Van Iderstine had met for lunch and continued talking into dinner, duking it out over the finer points of headlight philosophy. Two giants of the headlight world, going head to head. Stern remembers Van Iderstine telling him, “Look, I’m not stupid. I know what good lighting is, and I know what lousy lighting is. … Does glare cause crashes? Of course glare causes crashes. But I couldn’t prove it.” (Van Iderstine could not be reached for comment.)</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Finding a way to empirically measure the danger that glare presents to drivers is one problem. Another is that people can’t seem to agree on what the <em>cause</em> of excessive glare actually is. Stern, for his part, noted that the situation is “very, very complex” and “doesn’t have an answer that sounds like yes or no or 42.” That said, he told me he did recently finish a 38,000-word report on headlight glare for a non-U.S. government (he could not say which one) and is adamant that the biggest factor “by far” is headlight alignment—which is to say, quite literally, how accurately one’s headlights are pointed.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">This is the second-biggest thorn in Gatto and Morgan’s side. Headlight aim is important—no one is denying that. If any headlight, no matter how bright, is misaligned even slightly upward, it will cause glare for other drivers—and many headlights are poorly aligned out of the factory or become misaligned after an accident or installation error. But to someone like Morgan, alignment is only one part of the equation when headlights have become as intense as they have. “It’s a half-truth,” Morgan said, “without really saying that there’s other solutions here and that if you didn’t have laser-beam headlights, this issue would be less severe.” In his PowerPoint presentation, Gatto had drawn a penis on an image of Stern’s head. “That just kind of appeared there, sorry,” Gatto said.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Headlight alignment is certainly Stern’s primary foe—and he is not a fan of the likes of Baker and Morgan, either, whom he described in an email as having a fervor that “greatly outstrips their topical expertise and understanding, and likely qualifies them for IRS classification as religious entities.” But Stern does list other causes of glare as well. There’s headlight <em>condition</em> (a dirty lens can cause the light to refract in chaotic ways), headlight <em>size</em> (as LEDs become smaller, the “density” of the light increases, making it more intense), and headlight <em>color </em>(the eye is more sensitive to blue and white light, making glare seem more significant in modern LEDs, which are generally made in that color field).&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Vehicle size is another issue that comes up regularly, since NHTSA regulations for headlights don’t include a standardized mounting height, even as cars have <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24139147/suvs-trucks-popularity-federal-policy-pollution">ballooned in size</a> in recent years. This means a perfectly aligned headlight in a larger car can still wreak havoc on a smaller car: “Where the [midsize] Civic might not give you glare,” Trechter, the former lighting engineer, said, “that F-350 [truck], if you’re sitting in a [sport-size] Miata, is gonna absolutely wreck your eyeballs.”</p><figure data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="image.tsx"><div data-radix-aspect-ratio-wrapper=""><p><img alt="" data-sentry-element="Image" data-sentry-source-file="image.tsx" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOsram-scaled.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 640w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOsram-scaled.jpg&amp;w=750&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 750w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOsram-scaled.jpg&amp;w=828&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 828w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOsram-scaled.jpg&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 1080w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOsram-scaled.jpg&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 1200w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOsram-scaled.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 1920w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOsram-scaled.jpg&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 2048w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOsram-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 3840w" src="https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FOsram-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30"></p></div><figure><figcaption>LED headlight bulbs can be seen in a showroom in Osram's headquarters.</figcaption></figure><figcaption>Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">In NHTSA’s brief statement to me, the only issue the organization brought up directly was aftermarket “LED conversion kits”—when headlight systems designed for halogen lights are swapped with LEDs—which it said are a “major contributor to excessive glare.” Due to the lack of data on what causes glare incidents on the road, it’s difficult to guess how much of a factor aftermarket LEDs are, but one thing’s for sure: They are illegal.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">By pointing to aftermarket LEDs, then, NHTSA essentially passes the buck to law enforcement. This is, perhaps not coincidentally, at the same time that traffic violations nationwide are in substantial decline; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/29/upshot/traffic-enforcement-dwindled.html">a <em>New York Times</em> study</a> reported a more than 50 percent reduction in traffic stops in many U.S. cities since the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">The result of the hydra-headed headlight problem appears to be general paralysis; with numerous routes available to potentially improve the situation, none are really being pursued by automakers or regulators. “In engineering,” Gatto told me, “we talk about fail state. What happens when [a system] fails? Does it fail well, or does it fail horribly?” He added, “If you’re planning for multiple of these fail states all the time, maybe consider what the true impact of this is. … You have to kind of go against the whole ethos in order to actually evaluate: Are these too bright?”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">There is one path that certain automakers would like to take to improve headlights—but first it has to make it through NHTSA regulations. Adaptive driving beam technology takes advantage of LED capabilities to adjust the spray of light away from other cars and objects while maintaining high-capacity light on the road. When I got on the phone with the Audi representative, Mark Dahnke, to discuss headlight brightness, it quickly became clear that he was mainly taking the call in the interest of hyping ADB.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">“It basically puts other drivers in the shadow of your full high-beam light,” Dahnke explained, “such that they are not blinded while providing not just you with more light but everyone with more light.” Dahnke pointed out that ADB has been rolled out in Europe for some time now and is not in the U.S. solely due to NHTSA restrictions. In February 2022, NHTSA belatedly published a rule to allow ADB, but because of the contradictory way the rule is written, no car company has yet been able to find an engineering formula to make it work. “We’re now three different generations of lighting behind the rest of the world in the U.S.,” Dahnke said, exasperated.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Gatto and Morgan, unsurprisingly, are not fans of ADB. They point out that with the way the technology currently works, the light being strategically dimmed is the <em>high beam</em>, meaning that the low beam will stay as bright as ever. “The adaptive high beam is only going to put more light on the road,” Morgan said, adding that people from Europe post in the subreddit about hating the headlight situation there, too. (In a <a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2024-04/GRE-90-20e-reduced.pdf">2024 European study</a> conducted by the Federation Internationale de l’Automobile, 81 percent of respondents said headlight glare needed to be reduced via regulation.) ADB, Morgan insisted, is a corporate over-solution to a simple problem. “That’s their panacea,” he said, “and it’s baloney.”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">In the course of automotive history, technology has saved countless lives, taking car accidents from a peak of 30.8 deaths per 100,000 people in 1937 to 13.8 per 100,000 in 2022—a 55 percent improvement. That makes it difficult to dismiss the idea that something <em>like</em> ADB could be the solution to the headlight problem. But Gatto feels that he’s dealing with a “philosophical enemy” in the techno-optimist idea that we can innovate our way out of this. “They want to insert this technology to have a maximum amount of trust in it,” he said, “and they believe that any bit of convenience outweighs any drawback they could get from it.”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Paris Marx, a tech critic who focuses on transportation and hosts the <em>Tech Won’t Save Us </em>podcast, is all too familiar with the trickiness of this conversation. LED headlight technology, when viewed through the same lens as evolving tech like self-driving cars, presents a vision of a world in which corporations are asking for perpetual forgiveness rather than permission.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">“In general,” Marx told me, “we think about the positive outcomes that can be the result of adopting these things, but then thinking about the negative impacts only comes quite a bit later.” Assessing the notion that something as simple as a headlight could get this out of control, he said, “As usual, we’re trying to play catch-up and figure out how we’re going to address the problems that have been created by this thing that we thought was a solution.”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">The most compelling argument I heard in defense of brighter lights is that, while glare is clearly a hazard, it may not be as <em>much</em> of a hazard as limited vision on the road. That is to say, brighter headlights—which could illuminate something like a deer on a dark, rural highway from farther away than ever before—may be preventing more accidents than they cause by shining in other drivers’ eyes. You’ll notice every overly bright light searing your brain, but you likely won’t really appreciate the accident you never had.</p><figure data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="image.tsx"><div data-radix-aspect-ratio-wrapper=""><p><img alt="" data-sentry-element="Image" data-sentry-source-file="image.tsx" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FHeadlightsGraphC_02-scaled.webp&amp;w=640&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 640w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FHeadlightsGraphC_02-scaled.webp&amp;w=750&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 750w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FHeadlightsGraphC_02-scaled.webp&amp;w=828&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 828w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FHeadlightsGraphC_02-scaled.webp&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 1080w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FHeadlightsGraphC_02-scaled.webp&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 1200w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FHeadlightsGraphC_02-scaled.webp&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 1920w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FHeadlightsGraphC_02-scaled.webp&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 2048w, https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FHeadlightsGraphC_02-scaled.webp&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30 3840w" src="https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F12%2FHeadlightsGraphC_02-scaled.webp&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;dpl=681dab30aca047401211554865665910a9df7e30"></p></div><figure><figcaption><p>Despite the increase in headlight brightness, data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that fatal crashes in dark conditions remain relatively stable. In fact, crashes on lighted roads have risen slightly over the past two decades. It raises the question: Is all this extra brightness actually doing anything?</p>
</figcaption></figure><figcaption>NHTSA</figcaption></figure><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">“Is it a problem for people, including myself,” said Brumbelow, the IIHS engineer, “to be on the road and have bright headlights in my eyes and feel like I can’t see? Yes, that’s a problem. But the bigger follow-up question is: Is that my feeling, or is it a reality that I’m at an increased risk of crashing? And that’s really what we’re talking about.”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Still, without concrete numbers indicating one way or another, this argument remains philosophical, and the stalemate continues. Morgan, anyway, is eager to figure this out from an engineering perspective, and he has the pie-in-the-sky idea of setting up some kind of nighttime traffic checkpoint, perhaps with the assistance of police, to assess high-glare events in everyday vehicles. “These are surmountable problems,” he said. “This is not like trying to determine divine intervention. These are problems made by men. We can figure this out. It just requires a little bit of effort.”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">But he and Gatto know what they think the solution to all this is, and it’s admittedly the simplest proposal anyone has provided: Make the lights less bright. That’s it. “I’m just at: There’s too much glare in my eyes,” Morgan said, “and I want it to stop.”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">At a certain point, I found myself more confused than when I started. There was name calling and corporate-interest lobbying and statistic volleying—often all at the same time. I needed a voice of reason. So I reached out to Ray Magliozzi.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Ray and his brother, Tom Magliozzi, hosted the radio show <em>Car Talk</em> for 35 years, from 1977 to 2012, serving as gurus of the car world and seasoning their advice with appropriately saucy New England–style banter and good humor. Tom died in 2014, but Ray still runs an auto mechanic shop in Cambridge and answers car questions via a blog. I decided to call the question line and ask Ray if he had any wisdom to share about headlights, not really expecting to get a reply.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">A few days later my phone started buzzing with a call from a New England area code, and there he was: the wonderful voice from the radio. I told Ray I was shocked to be talking to him, and he didn’t miss a beat: “You called <em>me</em>!”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Magliozzi, 75, is actually fine with the brightness of modern headlights—when they work. Alignment, he noted, is extra important with lights like these, and he abhors the aftermarket LEDs and light bars that people attach to their cars in case “they’re going to encounter a moose or something.” But more than anything else, what bothers Magliozzi about the state of headlights is the increasing number of people who drive with high beams on all the time at night. “I think it’s selfishness to a large degree,” Magliozzi said.</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">I had talked about this with many people in the headlight sphere: the possibility that the power of LEDs, supposed to be a bastion of safety, was actually contributing to an “I’ve got mine” mentality on the roads, which has become largely identifiable across the driving realm. It’s impossible to prove a causal relationship, but the rise of LEDs has directly coincided with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/10/magazine/dangerous-driving.html">the rise of reckless driving and road rage, as well as a new surge of fatal accidents</a>. “It seems like there’s an anti-collectivist vibe,” was how Gatto put it. “It’s a behavior that’s emerging.”</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">Some may genuinely not know they’re driving with their high beams on—digital car dashboards have gotten more complex and less intuitive in recent years—but it’s difficult to believe that most permanent high-beam users aren’t doing it deliberately, in an anti-collectivist kind of way. Magliozzi was bummed out about it. “When I learned to drive, 1,001 years ago,” he said, “we were taught to be courteous and polite. And I think we need to get back there.” Maybe that return toward courteousness has to start with automakers and regulatory bodies, however they decide to move forward with the LED headlight dilemma.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">The first time I heard Baker, the founder of the Soft Lights Foundation, tell his story about having to essentially drop out of society, I suddenly felt guilty. I may be the type to squint angrily at headlight glare, but at the end of the day, I install the light bulbs available to me and move on with my life. For certain people, it’s clearly a much worse relationship.&nbsp;</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">I asked Baker what kind of lighting he uses in his day-to-day, and he said he does use LEDs—it’s almost impossible not to at this point—and that he’s found some he’s happy with, like gentle, amber-colored, 300-lumen bulbs for the bedroom. That’s the beauty of LED lights: They can be made for any design or purpose. Sometimes they just have to be adjusted until they’re right.</p><p data-sentry-component="Component" data-sentry-source-file="paragraph.tsx">“But my favorite light is one that I replaced over the dining room table,” Baker said. His partner bought a chandelier-style fixture, and they put an incandescent bulb in it from a stockpiled supply. “It’s great,” Baker said. “I will go over and turn the switch on just to enjoy that light.”</p><div data-sentry-component="SingleCreator" data-sentry-source-file="article-creator-block.tsx"><div><p><a data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="creator.tsx" href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/nate-rogers"><img alt="" data-sentry-element="Image" data-sentry-source-file="creator.tsx" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" src="https://www.theringer.com/avatar-dark.svg"></a></p></div><div><a data-sentry-element="Link" data-sentry-source-file="creator.tsx" href="https://www.theringer.com/creator/nate-rogers"><p>Nate Rogers</p></a><p><span>Nate Rogers is a writer in Los Angeles.

      <p>Nadia Odunayo has been so often the smiling face on the door of this event, but did you know she’s the founder and (more impressively!) one woman development team behind <a href="https://thestorygraph.com/">The StoryGraph</a>, a reading community of over a million book lovers. Her story is one of grit, insight and technical insights into what it takes to execute on the “one person framework”.</p>


      

      <hr>

      <p>Nadia Odunayo is the founder and CEO of The StoryGraph, the app that helps you to track your reading and choose which book to read next based on your mood and favorite topics and themes. She previously worked at Pivotal Labs as a software engineer and originally learnt to code at Makers Academy in London. In her spare time she loves to take dance class and, naturally, read!</p>

<li>Understand how Langfuse is used and improve the most relevant features.</li>
<li>Track overall usage for internal and external (e.g. fundraising) reporting.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The distinction between hardware and software has historically been relatively easy to understand - hardware is the physical object that software runs on. This is made more complicated by the existence of programmable logic like FPGAs, but by and large things tend to fall into fairly neat categories if we're drawing that distinction.</p><p>Conversations usually become more complicated when we introduce firmware, but should they? According to Wikipedia, <q>Firmware is software that provides low-level control of computing device hardware</q>, and basically anything that's generally described as firmware certainly fits into the "software" side of the above hardware/software binary. From a software freedom perspective, this seems like something where the obvious answer to "Should this be free" is "yes", but it's worth thinking about <em>why</em> the answer is yes - the goal of free software isn't freedom for freedom's sake, but because the freedoms embodied in the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#fs-definition">Free Software Definition</a> (and by proxy the <a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">DFSG</a>) are grounded in real world practicalities.</p><p>How do these line up for firmware? Firmware can fit into two main classes - it can be something that's responsible for initialisation of the hardware (such as, historically, BIOS, which is involved in initialisation and boot and then largely irrelevant for runtime[1]) or it can be something that makes the hardware work at runtime (wifi card firmware being an obvious example). The role of free software in the latter case feels fairly intuitive, since the interface and functionality the hardware offers to the operating system is frequently largely defined by the firmware running on it. Your wifi chipset is, these days, largely a software defined radio, and what you can do with it is determined by what the firmware it's running allows you to do. Sometimes those restrictions may be required by law, but other times they're simply because the people writing the firmware aren't interested in supporting a feature - they may see no reason to allow raw radio packets to be provided to the OS, for instance. We also shouldn't ignore the fact that sufficiently complicated firmware exposed to untrusted input (as is the case in most wifi scenarios) may contain exploitable vulnerabilities allowing attackers to gain arbitrary code execution on the wifi chipset - and potentially use that as a way to gain control of the host OS (see <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/04/over-air-exploiting-broadcoms-wi-fi_4.html">this writeup</a> for an example). Vendors being in a unique position to update that firmware means users may never receive security updates, leaving them with a choice between discarding hardware that otherwise works perfectly or leaving themselves vulnerable to known security issues.</p><p>But even the cases where firmware does nothing other than initialise the hardware cause problems. A lot of hardware has functionality controlled by registers that can be locked during the boot process. Vendor firmware may choose to disable (or, rather, never to enable) functionality that may be beneficial to a user, and then lock out the ability to reconfigure the hardware later. Without any ability to modify that firmware, the user lacks the freedom to choose what functionality their hardware makes available to them. Again, the ability to inspect this firmware and modify it has a distinct benefit to the user.</p><p>So, from a practical perspective, I think there's a strong argument that users would benefit from most (if not all) firmware being free software, and I don't think that's an especially controversial argument. So I think this is less of a philosophical discussion, and more of a strategic one - is spending time focused on ensuring firmware is free worthwhile, and if so what's an appropriate way of achieving this?</p><p>I think there's two consistent ways to view this. One is to view free firmware as <em>desirable</em> but not <em>necessary</em>. This approach basically argues that code that's running on hardware that isn't the main CPU would benefit from being free, in the same way that code running on a remote network service would benefit from being free, but that this is much less important than ensuring that all the code running in the context of the OS on the primary CPU is free. The maximalist position is not to compromise at all - all software on a system, whether it's running at boot or during runtime, and whether it's running on the primary CPU or any other component on the board, should be free.</p><p>Personally, I lean towards the former and think there's a reasonably coherent argument here. I think users <em>would</em> benefit from the ability to modify the code running on hardware that their OS talks to, in the same way that I think users would benefit from the ability to modify the code running on hardware the other side of a network link that their browser talks to. I also think that there's enough that remains to be done in terms of what's running on the host CPU that it's not worth having that fight yet. But I think the latter is absolutely intellectually consistent, and while I don't agree with it from a pragmatic perspective I think things would undeniably be better if we lived in that world.</p><p>This feels like a thing you'd expect the Free Software Foundation to have opinions on, and it does! There are two primarily relevant things - the <a href="https://ryf.fsf.org/">Respects your Freedoms</a> campaign focused on ensuring that certified hardware meets certain requirements (including around firmware), and the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html">Free System Distribution Guidelines</a>, which define a baseline for an OS to be considered free by the FSF (including requirements around firmware).</p><p>RYF <a href="https://ryf.fsf.org/about/criteria">requires</a> that all software on a piece of hardware be free other than under one specific set of circumstances. If software runs on (a) a secondary processor and (b) <q>within which software installation is not intended after the user obtains the product</q>, then the software does not need to be free. (b) effectively means that the firmware has to be in ROM, since any runtime interface that allows the firmware to be loaded or updated is intended to allow software installation after the user obtains the product.</p><p>The Free System Distribution Guidelines <a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html#nonfree-firmware">require</a> that all non-free firmware be removed from the OS before it can be considered free. The recommended mechanism to achieve this is via <a href="https://www.fsfla.org/ikiwiki/selibre/linux-libre/">linux-libre</a>, a project that produces tooling to remove anything that looks plausibly like a non-free firmware blob from the Linux source code, along with any incitement to the user to load firmware - including even removing suggestions to update CPU microcode in order to mitigate CPU vulnerabilities.</p><p>For hardware that requires non-free firmware to be loaded at runtime in order to work, linux-libre doesn't do anything to work around this - the hardware will simply not work. In this respect, linux-libre reduces the amount of non-free firmware running on a system in the same way that removing the hardware would. This presumably encourages users to purchase RYF compliant hardware.</p><p>But does that actually improve things? RYF doesn't require that a piece of hardware have no non-free firmware, it simply requires that any non-free firmware be hidden from the user. CPU microcode is an instructive example here. At the time of writing, every laptop listed <a href="https://ryf.fsf.org/index.php/categories/laptops">here</a> has an Intel CPU. Every Intel CPU has microcode in ROM, typically an early revision that is known to have many bugs. The expectation is that this microcode is updated in the field by either the firmware or the OS at boot time - the updated version is loaded into RAM on the CPU, and vanishes if power is cut. The combination of RYF and linux-libre doesn't reduce the amount of non-free code running inside the CPU, it just means that the user (a) is more likely to hit since-fixed bugs (including security ones!), and (b) has less guidance on how to avoid them.</p><p>As long as RYF permits hardware that makes use of non-free firmware I think it hurts more than it helps. In many cases users aren't guided away from non-free firmware - instead it's hidden away from them, leaving them less aware that their freedom is constrained. Linux-libre goes further, refusing to even inform the user that the non-free firmware that their hardware depends on can be upgraded to improve their security.</p><p>Out of sight shouldn't mean out of mind. If non-free firmware is a threat to user freedom then allowing it to exist in ROM doesn't do anything to solve that problem. And if it isn't a threat to user freedom, then what's the point of requiring linux-libre for a Linux distribution to be considered free by the FSF? We seem to have ended up in the worst case scenario, where nothing is being done to actually replace any of the non-free firmware running on people's systems and where users may even end up with a reduced awareness that the non-free firmware even exists.</p><p>[1] Yes yes SMM</p></div></div>]]></description>
