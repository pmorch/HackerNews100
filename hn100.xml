<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
  
  <h2 id="htmx-2-0-0-release">htmx 2.0.0 Release</h2>
<p>I’m very happy to announce the release of htmx 2.0.  This release ends support for Internet Explorer and tightens up some
defaults, but does not change most of the core functionality or the core API of the library.</p>
<p>Note that we are not marking 2.0 as <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-dist-tag#purpose"><code>latest</code></a> in NPM 
because we do not want to force-upgrade users who are relying on non-versioned CDN URLs for htmx.  Instead, 1.x will
remain <code>latest</code> and the 2.0 line will remain <code>next</code> until Jan 1, 2025. The website, however, will reference 2.0.</p>
<h3 id="major-changes">Major Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>All extensions have been moved out of the core repository to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx-extensions/">their own repo</a>
and website: <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://extensions.htmx.org/">https://extensions.htmx.org</a>.  They are now all versioned individually and can be developed outside of
the normal (slow) htmx release cadence.
<ul>
<li>Most 1.x extensions will work with 2.x, however the SSE extension did have a break and must be upgraded.</li>
<li>The older extensions remain in the <code>/dist/ext</code> directory so as to not break the URLs of CDNs like unpkg, but please
move to the new extension URLs going forward</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We removed the deprecated <code>hx-sse</code> and <code>hx-ws</code> attributes in favor of the extensions, which were available and
recommended in 1.x.</li>
<li>HTTP <code>DELETE</code> requests now use parameters, rather than form encoded bodies, for their payload (This is in accordance w/ the spec.)</li>
<li>We now provide specific files in <code>/dist</code> for the various JavaScript module styles:
<ul>
<li>ESM Modules: <code>/dist/htmx.esm.js</code></li>
<li>UMD Modules: <code>/dist/htmx.umd.js</code></li>
<li>AMD Modules: <code>/dist/htmx.amd.js</code></li>
<li>The <code>/dist/htmx.js</code> file continues to be browser-loadable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>hx-on</code> attribute, with its special syntax, has been removed in favor of the less-hacky <code>hx-on:</code> syntax.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minor-changes">Minor Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>We made some default changes:
<ul>
<li><code>htmx.config.scrollBehavior</code> was changed to <code>'instant'</code> from <code>'smooth'</code></li>
<li>As mentioned previously, <code>DELETE</code> requests now use query parameters, rather than a form-encoded body.  This can
be reverted by setting <code>htmx.methodsThatUseUrlParams</code> to  the value <code>['get']</code>,</li>
<li><code>htmx.config.selfRequestsOnly</code> now defaults to <code>true</code> rather than <code>false</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<p>Not much, really:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>selectAndSwap()</code> internal API method was replaced with the public (and much better) <a href="https://htmx.org/api/#swap"><code>swap()</code></a> method</li>
<li>Web Component support has been <a href="https://htmx.org/examples/web-components/">improved dramatically</a></li>
<li>And the biggest feature of this release: <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/">the website</a> now supports dark mode! (Thanks <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pokonski">@pokonski</a>!)</li>
</ul>
<p>A complete upgrade guide can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://htmx.org/migration-guide-htmx-1/">htmx 1.x -&gt; 2.x Migration Guide</a></p>
<p>If you require IE compatibility, the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://v1.htmx.org/">1.x</a> will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h3 id="installing">Installing</h3>
<p>htmx 2.0 can be installed via a package manager referencing version <code>2.0.0</code>, or can be linked via a CDN:</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>script </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.0/dist/htmx.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>or <a href="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.0/dist/htmx.min.js" download="">Downloaded</a></p>

<p><a href="http://proton.me/">Proton</a>, the secure-minded email and productivity suite, is becoming a nonprofit foundation, but it doesn't want you to think about it in the way you think about other notable privacy and web foundations.</p>
<p>"We believe that if we want to bring about large-scale change, Proton can’t be billionaire-subsidized (like Signal), Google-subsidized (like Mozilla), government-subsidized (like Tor), donation-subsidized (like Wikipedia), or even speculation-subsidized (like the plethora of crypto “foundations”)," Proton CEO Andy Yen wrote in a blog post announcing the transition. "Instead, Proton must have a profitable and healthy business at its core."</p>
<p>The announcement comes exactly 10 years to the day after a crowdfunding campaign saw 10,000 people give more than $500,000 to launch Proton Mail. To make it happen, Yen, along with co-founder Jason Stockman and first employee Dingchao Lu, endowed the Proton Foundation with some of their shares. <a href="https://proton.me/foundation">The Proton Foundation</a> is now the primary shareholder of the business Proton, which Yen states will "make irrevocable our wish that Proton remains in perpetuity an organization that places people ahead of profits." Among other members of the Foundation's board is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, inventor of HTML, HTTP, and almost everything else about the web.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Of particular importance is where Proton and the Proton Foundation are located: Switzerland. As Yen noted, Swiss foundations do not have shareholders and are instead obligated to act "in accordance with the purpose for which they were established." While the for-profit entity Proton AG can still do things like offer stock options to recruits and even raise its own capital on private markets, the Foundation serves as a backstop against moving too far from Proton's founding mission, Yen wrote.</p>
<h2>There’s a lot more Proton to protect these days</h2>
<p>Proton has gone from a single email offering to a wide range of services, many of which specifically target the often invasive offerings of other companies (read, mostly: Google). You can now take your cloud files, passwords, and calendars over to Proton and use its VPN services, most of which offer end-to-end encryption and open source core software hosted in Switzerland, with its notably strong privacy laws.
</p><p>None of that guarantees that a Swiss court can't compel some forms of compliance from Proton, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/privacy-focused-protonmail-provided-a-users-ip-address-to-authorities/">happened in 2021</a>. But compared to most service providers, Proton offers a far clearer and easier-to-grasp privacy model: It can't see your stuff, and it only makes money from subscriptions.</p>
<p>Of course, foundations are only as strong as the people who guide them, and seemingly firewalled profit/non-profit models <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-ceo-says-company-could-become-benefit-corporation-information-2024-06-15/">can be changed</a>. Time will tell if Proton's new model can keep up with changing markets—and people.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Federal Trade Commission is taking action against software maker Adobe and two of its executives, Maninder Sawhney and David Wadhwani, for&nbsp;deceiving consumers by hiding the early termination fee for its most popular subscription plan and making it difficult for consumers to cancel their subscriptions.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/adobe_complaint.pdf">federal court complaint</a> filed by the Department of Justice upon notification and referral from the FTC charges that Adobe pushed consumers toward the “annual paid monthly” subscription without adequately disclosing that cancelling the plan in the first year could cost hundreds of dollars. Wadhwani is the president of Adobe’s digital media business, and Sawhney is an Adobe vice president.</p><p>“Adobe trapped customers into year-long subscriptions through hidden early termination fees and numerous cancellation hurdles,” said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “Americans are tired of companies hiding the ball during subscription signup and then putting up roadblocks when they try to cancel. The FTC will continue working to protect Americans from these illegal business practices.”</p><p>After 2012, Adobe shifted principally to a subscription model, requiring consumers to pay for access to the company’s popular software on a recurring basis. Subscriptions account for most of the company’s revenue.</p><p>According to the complaint, when consumers purchase a subscription through the company’s website, Adobe pushes consumers to its “annual paid monthly” subscription plan, pre-selecting it as a default. Adobe prominently shows the plan’s “monthly” cost during enrollment, but it buries the early termination fee (ETF) and its amount, which is 50 percent of the remaining monthly payments when a consumer cancels in their first year. Adobe’s ETF disclosures are buried on the company’s website in small print or require consumers to hover over small icons to find the disclosures.</p><p>Consumers complain to the FTC and the Better Business Bureau about the ETF, according to the complaint. These consumers report they were not aware of the existence of the ETF or that the “annual paid monthly” plan required their subscription to continue for a year. The complaint notes that Adobe has been aware of consumers’ confusion about the ETF.</p><p>Despite being aware of consumers’ problems with the ETF, the company continues its practice of steering consumers to the annual paid monthly plan while obscuring the ETF, according to the complaint.</p><p>In addition to failing to disclose the ETF to consumers when they subscribe, the complaint also alleges that Adobe uses the ETF to ambush consumers to deter them from cancelling their subscriptions. The complaint also alleges that Adobe’s cancellation processes are designed to make cancellation difficult for consumers. When consumers have attempted to cancel their subscription on the company’s website, they have been forced to navigate numerous pages in order to cancel.</p><p>When consumers reach out to Adobe’s customer service to cancel, they encounter resistance and delay from Adobe representatives. Consumers also experience other obstacles, such as dropped calls and chats, and multiple transfers. Some consumers who thought they had successfully cancelled their subscription reported that the company continued to charge them until discovering the charges on their credit card statements.</p><p>The complaint charges that Adobe’s practices violate the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act.</p><p>The Commission vote to refer the civil penalty complaint to the DOJ for filing was 3-0. The Department of Justice filed the complaint in the U.S. District Court<strong>&nbsp;</strong>for the Northern District of California.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Commission refers a complaint for civil penalties to the DOJ for filing when it has “reason to believe” that the named defendants are violating or are about to violate the law and that a proceeding is in the public interest. The case will be decided by the court.</p><p>The staff attorneys on this matter are Sana Chaudhry and Daniel Wilkes of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><em>Ask publishers to restore access to the 500,000 books they’ve caused to be removed from the Internet Archive’s lending library.</em></p>



<h2><a href="https://change.org/LetReadersRead">Sign the Open Letter</a></h2>



<hr>



<p>I’m Chris Freeland, a librarian at the Internet Archive. The lawsuit against our library—<em>Hachette v. Internet Archive</em>—is fast approaching the oral argument stage of its appeal on June 28. I’ve been reflecting on our ongoing, four-year experience with this litigation and on the outcome we’re hoping for. Our position is straightforward; we just want to let our library patrons borrow and read the books we own, like any other library.&nbsp;</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://archive.org/embed/LetReadersRead" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>We purchase and acquire books—yes, physical, paper books—and make them available for one person at a time to check out and read online. This work is important for readers and authors alike, as many younger and low-income readers can only read if books are free to borrow, and many authors’ books will <a href="https://neglectedbooks.com/?p=9498">only be discovered or preserved</a> through the work of librarians. We use industry-standard technology to prevent our books from being downloaded and redistributed—the same technology used by corporate publishers. </p>



<p>But the publishers suing our library say we shouldn’t be allowed to lend the books we own. They have forced us to <a href="https://help.archive.org/help/why-are-so-many-books-listed-as-borrow-unavailable-at-the-internet-archive/">remove more than half a million books from our library</a>, and that’s why we are appealing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Impact</h2>



<p>The legal decision and resulting injunction against our library have already had a profoundly negative impact on our patrons. They have inundated us with so many inquiries that our patron services team needed to prepare a<a href="https://help.archive.org/help/why-are-so-many-books-listed-as-borrow-unavailable-at-the-internet-archive/"> Help Document</a> explaining why our collection has been shrinking so rapidly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We asked our patrons to <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/06/14/patrons-speak-out-the-impact-of-losing-access-to-more-than-500000-books/">share their stories</a> of what losing access to these 500,000 books has meant to them. What’s clear from the <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/06/14/patrons-speak-out-the-impact-of-losing-access-to-more-than-500000-books/">hundreds of testimonials we’ve received</a> is the ability to access our books remains an absolute necessity for the many people around the world who depend on our library for their educational and professional development:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Mark, a researcher from New York, said that as an independent scholar without an institutional affiliation, he often struggles to gain access to books he needs for his research. He says that The Internet Archive has been a lifeline for him.</li>



<li>We heard from Lucero, an educator from Mexico City, who said that without our library, he wouldn’t have been able to complete his research on Mexican Sign Langauge.</li>



<li>Perhaps Mrittika said it best. She’s from a rural region in India and doesn’t have access to rare books. She asks the publishers, “If you are going to ban online availability of these resources, what about us?”</li>
</ul>



<h2>Take Action</h2>



<p>In appealing the district court’s decision, our goal is simply to let these readers continue on their journey. We envision a world in which Wikipedians can verify facts by following citations to information contained only in our printed history; where libraries can serve their communities online with collections financed through public investment; and above all, where library patrons are free to read without <a href="https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2024/05/18/librarians-are-waging-a-quiet-war-against-international-data-cartels">fear of corporate or government surveillance</a>.</p>



<h2><a href="https://change.org/LetReadersRead">Sign the Open Letter</a></h2>



<p>Please help spread the word across social media: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/archive.org/post/3kv53tybrb42q">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/internetnetarchive/videos/1519549638994455/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8UbEnvup2r/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.archive.org/deck/@internetarchive/112632880238617231">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@weareinternetarchive/video/7381422258365009182">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://x.com/internetarchive/status/1802658174777893309">Twitter/X</a></p>



<p>The potential repercussions of this lawsuit extend far beyond the Internet Archive. This is a fight for the preservation of all libraries, and the fundamental right to access information, a cornerstone of any democratic society. We believe in the right of authors to benefit from their work; and we believe that libraries must be permitted to fulfill their mission of providing access to knowledge, regardless of whether it takes physical or digital form. Doing so upholds the principle that knowledge should be equally and equitably accessible to everyone, regardless of where they live or where they learn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we head into this appeal, our message remains clear and unwavering: <strong>Let readers read</strong>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The US government is suing Adobe for allegedly hiding expensive fees and making it difficult to cancel a subscription. In the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/adobe_complaint.pdf">complaint filed on Monday</a>, the Department of Justice claims Adobe “has harmed consumers by enrolling them in its default, most lucrative subscription plan without clearly disclosing important plan terms.”</p><p>The lawsuit alleges Adobe “hides” the terms of its annual, paid monthly plan in the “fine print and behind optional textboxes and hyperlinks.” In doing so, the company fails to properly disclose the early termination fee incurred upon cancellation “that can amount to hundreds of dollars,” the complaint says.</p><p>When customers do attempt to cancel, the DOJ alleges that Adobe requires them to go through an “onerous and complicated” cancellation process that involves navigating through multiple webpages and pop-ups. It then allegedly “ambushes” customers with an early termination fee, which may discourage them from canceling.</p><p>Customers encounter similar obstacles when attempting to cancel their subscriptions over the phone or via live chats, the DOJ alleges. The complaint claims “subscribers have had their calls or chats either dropped or disconnected and have had to re-explain their reason for calling when they re-connect.” The lawsuit alleges that these practices break federal laws designed to protect consumers.</p><p>The lawsuit also targets Adobe executives Maninder Sawhney, the senior vice president of digital go-to-market and sales, as well as David Wadhwani, the president of the company’s digital media business. The complaint says both executives “directed, controlled, had the authority to control, or participated in the acts and practices of Adobe.” Adobe didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p>“Adobe trapped customers into year-long subscriptions through hidden early termination fees and numerous cancellation hurdles,” Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/06/ftc-takes-action-against-adobe-executives-hiding-fees-preventing-consumers-easily-cancelling?utm_campaign=ftc_takes_action_against_&amp;utm_content=1718638330&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">said in a statement</a>. “Americans are tired of companies hiding the ball during subscription signup and then putting up roadblocks when they try to cancel.” The federal government <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/15/24003532/adobe-says-the-ftc-is-looking-into-its-subscription-cancellation-practices">began looking into Adobe’s cancellation practices</a> late last year.</p><p>In 2012, Adobe went from selling its creative software for lifetime use to charging users for a monthly or yearly subscription to its suite of products, including Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and others. The company’s subscription model has long frustrated creatives, who are often forced to stay subscribed to Adobe in order to keep doing their jobs. Earlier this month, Adobe’s new terms of service were met with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173838/adobe-tos-update-firefly-generative-ai-trust">backlash after some interpreted</a> the move as an opportunity to train its AI on users’ art.</p><div><p>The lawsuit speaks to continued regulatory scrutiny of Adobe. In 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/15/23354532/adobe-figma-acquisition-20-billion-official">Adobe attempted to acquire</a> the product design platform Figma for $20 billion, but it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/20/24008189/adobe-figma-deal-eu-explained-decoder">abandoned the deal last year after facing antitrust scrutiny</a> from European regulators.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

These include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/30/stop-children-using-smartphones-until-they-are-13-say-french-experts-in-report" data-link-name="in body link">mental health concerns, screen time addiction, the impact on sleep and attention spans</a>, access to inappropriate and graphic content and increased risk of thefts and muggings.</p><p>“We were prompted to collaborate after seeing first-hand the negative impact of smartphones and social media on our children’s wellbeing and education,” said Mike Baxter, headteacher of the City of London academy.</p><p>“While the issues that we had to address typically occurred outside of school hours, it was often in school that these negative behaviours were exposed,” he added.</p><p>The schools have agreed that if any phone is used by a pupil during the school day, it will be confiscated. If the phone is a traditional mobile phone – without access to wifi – it will be returned relatively quickly. If the phone is a smartphone, however, it will not be returned for up to a week – or until parents collect it themselves.</p><p>The measures will impact more than 13,000 young people in one of the highest performing boroughs in London. All secondary schools will impose the policy for children from years 7 to 9. A number of schools in the group, however, are adopting a “whole-school” approach.</p><p>The group of secondary headteachers are also in contact with the leaders of primary headteachers in the borough, in the hope of establishing a borough-wide approach.</p><p>“Creating this positive change for the wellbeing and success of young people in Southwark is at the centre of this collective drive,” said Baxter. “Children are getting smartphones as young as four. We could make a massive difference if every parent in this borough knows what every school says about smartphones.”</p><p>Jessica West, headteacher of Ark Walworth academy, said the schools had to take action after phone companies failed to do so. “Many requests for stronger measures have been made of ‘big tech’ companies but action is woefully slow and that leaves our children at risk,” she said. “We are therefore acting in collaboration to support families and children in making healthy choices – we take our responsibilities to children seriously.”</p><figure id="d7675f42-b643-4ea0-bac3-99983ea56850" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:11,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Campaigners ‘thrilled’ as St Albans aims to be smartphone-free for under-14s&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;d7675f42-b643-4ea0-bac3-99983ea56850&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/22/st-albans-headteachers-call-for-under-14s-smartphone-ban&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false,&quot;updateLogoAdPartnerSwitch&quot;:true,&quot;assetOrigin&quot;:&quot;https://assets.guim.co.uk/&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>A recent House of Commons education committee report found that extended screen time had become increasingly normal for young children and teenagers, with a 52% increase in children’s screen time between 2020 and 2022.</p><p>According to the report, nearly 25% of children and young people use their smartphones in a way that is consistent with a behavioural addiction.</p><p>The collaboration was greeted with delight by Daisy Greenwell, co-founder of <a href="http://smartphonefreechildhood.co.uk/" data-link-name="in body link">Smartphone Free Childhood</a> (SFC).</p><p>“This move from the headteachers in south London is fantastically powerful and pioneering – never have secondary schools clubbed together to take collective action on this issue before,” she said. “We know that the younger a child gets their first smartphone, the higher their incidence of mental illness later on, so this has the potential to change the lives of a generation of children in south London.</p><p>“School leaders have the ability to effect change in their schools immediately and to shape social norms in their communities,” she added.</p><p>The concern about smartphones and children has rocketed.

<!-- cache hit 20:single/related:9c9bb8940fb30083d634bb2cc2fe8eb6 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Japan’s TDK is claiming a breakthrough in materials used in its small solid-state batteries, with the Apple supplier predicting significant performance increases for devices from wireless headphones to smartwatches.</p>
<p>The new material provides an energy density—the amount that can be squeezed into a given space—of 1,000 watt-hours per liter, which is about 100 times greater than TDK’s current battery in mass production. Since TDK introduced it in 2020, competitors have moved forward, developing small solid-state batteries that offer 50 Wh/l, while rechargeable coin batteries using traditional liquid electrolytes offer about 400 Wh/l, according to the group.</p>
<p>“We believe that our newly developed material for solid-state batteries can make a significant contribution to the energy transformation of society. We will continue the development towards early commercialisation,” said TDK’s chief executive Noboru Saito.</p>
<p>The batteries set to be produced will be made of an all-ceramic material, with oxide-based solid electrolyte and lithium alloy anodes. The high capability of the battery to store electrical charge, TDK said, would allow for smaller device sizes and longer operating times, while the oxide offered a high degree of stability and thus safety. The battery technology is designed to be used in smaller-sized cells, replacing existing coin-shaped batteries found in watches and other small electronics.</p>
<p>The breakthrough is the latest step forward for a technology industry experts think can revolutionize energy storage, but which faces significant obstacles on the path to mass production, particularly at larger battery sizes.</p>
<p>Solid-state batteries are safer, lighter and potentially cheaper and offer longer performance and faster charging than current batteries relying on liquid electrolytes. Breakthroughs in consumer electronics have filtered through to electric vehicles, although the dominant battery chemistries for the two categories now differ substantially.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The ceramic material used by TDK means that larger-sized batteries would be more fragile, meaning the technical challenge of making batteries for cars or even smartphones will not be surmounted in the foreseeable future, according to the company.</p>
<p>Kevin Shang, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a data and analytics firm, said that “unfavorable mechanical properties,” as well as the difficulty and cost of mass production, are challenges for moving the application of solid-state oxide-based batteries into smartphones.</p>
<p>Industry experts believe the most significant use case for solid-state batteries could be in electric cars by enabling greater driving range. Japanese companies are in the vanguard of a push to commercialize the technology: Toyota is aiming for as early as 2027, Nissan the year after and Honda by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>Car manufacturers are focused on developing sulfide-based electrolytes for long-range electric vehicles, an alternative kind of material to the oxide-based material that TDK has developed.</p>
<p>However, there is still skepticism about how quickly the much-hyped technology can be realized, particularly the larger batteries needed for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Robin Zeng, founder and chief executive of CATL, the world’s biggest electric vehicle battery manufacturer, told the Financial Times in March that solid-state batteries did not work well enough, lacked durability and still had safety problems. Zeng’s CATL originated as a spin-off from Amperex Technology, or ATL, which is a subsidiary of TDK and is the world’s leading producer of lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>TDK, which was founded in 1935 and became a household name as a top cassette tape brand in the 1960s and 1970s, has lengthy experience in battery materials and technology.</p>
<p>It has 50 to 60 percent global market share in the small-capacity batteries that power smartphones and is targeting leadership in the medium-capacity market, which includes energy storage devices and larger electronics such as drones.</p>
<p>The group plans to start shipping samples of its new battery prototype to clients from next year and hopes to be able to move into mass production after that.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m for more tests. I push my clients to measure and increase test coverage. When doing so, the start is easy. It is easy to get to 10%, 20% and 30% of coverage. It gets more interesting after that. You come to a point where you need to test code that contains calls to <code>IO</code> - code with side effects, e.g. databases or services.</p><p>There people introduce mocks. A mock is a an object that imitates another service, like a database Repository or a service. Mocks make testing code that has service calls in them easy. Mock frameworks are genius, a marvel to use. People use mocks they want to test things “in isolation”—not understanding that isolation is the core of the problem, not the solution. The bugs of the IO code you want to test, arises from the interaction with the service. If you mock that, you don’t test the reason for your bugs.</p><p><a href="https://dunnhq.com/posts/2024/prefer-test-doubles-over-mocking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Mocking frameworks are a path to insanity!”</a></p><p>Whenever I look at mocks, they mostly have the same problem as all unit tests that I see, they only model the happy path (I wrote about how to write unit tests to really find bugs in <a href="https://www.amazingcto.com/how-unit-tests-find-prevent-bugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“How Unit Tests Really Help Preventing Bugs”</a>). Modelling the happy path is great for <a href="https://refactoring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refactoring</a> - even a necessity, but doesn’t help with finding bugs.</p><p>You can do mocks the right way, but it takes a lot of effort, and many skip this effort. Or are not aware of this effort. It’s worse to have bad mocks than no mocks, because they give you a wrong feeling of confidence in your tests—especially when mocks increase test coverage. You think your tests are testing things that in reality - they are not testing. Confusing, I know.</p><p><span>Back to the title: Mocking is an anti-pattern. Mocking adds complexity, is hard to maintain, introduces its own bugs, doesn't test what should be tested and creates a false sense of security.</span></p><h2 id="what-is-mocking">What is Mocking</h2><p>Lets look at the term <em>“Mocking”</em>. From <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Fowler</a>
there are <strong>Dummy</strong> objects, <strong>Fake</strong> objects, <strong>Stubs</strong>, <strong>Spies</strong> and <strong>Mocks</strong>. All of them are different, in the context of this article I consider them the same.</p><p>When talking about IO, in general terms I mean side effects (in functional speak). This can include calling external services, REST calls, database calls, sending emails and reading and writing files.</p><p>Lets start at the beginning. Ha! <strong>How does mocking help with testing?</strong> Assuming you want to test this code:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>z</span>(<span>x</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>if</span> <span>x</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>service</span>.<span>IO1</span>()
</span></span><span><span>  } <span>else</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>service</span>.<span>IO2</span>()
</span></span><span><span>  }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>without executing the IO (too slow, no test setup possible etc.), how do you do that?</p><p>You replace the service with a mock:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>ServiceMock</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>IO1</span>() { <span>return</span> <span>1</span> }
</span></span><span><span>  <span>IO2</span>() { <span>return</span> <span>2</span> }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and put that into your code instead of <code>IOService</code> for testing (the mock is created with some <a href="https://github.com/golang/mock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mock library</a> the code above is just for illustration).</p><p>Refactoring <code>z</code> so we can inject the mock service:</p><p><em>(there are many other ways to inject the service)</em>.</p><p>Now we can write a test:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>TestZ</span>() {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>service</span> = <span>ServiceMock</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>result</span> = <span>z</span>(<span>true</span>, <span>service</span>)
</span></span><span><span>  <span>check</span>(<span>result</span>, <span>1</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This works fine.</p><p>The problem is when <code>IOService</code> has edge cases. When building the mock, does it address the edge cases? When you want to find bugs by testing, the tests need to test the real world. So to work, the mock for <code>IOService</code> needs to model the edge cases of <code>IOService</code>. Does it? Does the developer know they need to model the edge cases, or the mock is not helping with finding bugs? Do you even know the edge cases of <code>IOService</code>? When <code>IOService</code> is a database service, does your mock work for records that do not exist? Or return more than one record?</p><p>Beside edge cases, <code>IOService</code> has failure modes. To detect bugs in the code you’re testing, that is using <code>IOService</code>, your tests need to test for those failure modes, and your mock needs to model those failure modes. If <code>IOService</code> is a database service, does your mock model disconnects correctly? Is it even possible to model all failure modes when <code>IOService</code> is from another team or even another company (like a cloud service)? Do you know all the failure modes for a starter?</p><p><strong>This leads to bugs in the interaction of services being undetected and tests with mocks do less than people think they’ll do for them.</strong></p><p>As my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliverwehrens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oliver Wehrens</a> wrote: <em>“Especially when mocking services from other teams. Just had the case and bugs just showed up in e2e test by a qa team.”</em></p><p><strong>Instead of finding bugs, is the goal of the developer when using mocks here to increase test coverage and tell a “check, z() tested” to their manager?</strong></p><p>Lets look at a more real world example. Many mocked tests I see look - simplified - like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>find</span>(<span>id</span>, <span>service</span>) <span>string</span> {
</span></span><span><span> <span>return</span> <span>service</span>.<span>find</span>(<span>id</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>Test</span>() {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>mock</span> = <span>NewMock</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>mock</span>.<span>find</span>(<span>3</span>).<span>return</span>(<span>"Stephan"</span>)
</span></span><span><span>  <span>result</span> = <span>find</span>(<span>3</span>, <span>mock</span>)
</span></span><span><span>  <span>checkCall</span>(<span>"find"</span>, <span>3</span>)
</span></span><span><span>  <span>checkEqual</span>(<span>result</span>, <span>"Stephan"</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This does not test anything of value. It tests your mock library or your mock. I have looked at hundreds of tests that use mocks, and many of them test nothing - like the test above. But they increase test coverage and give a false sense of security (They are often the result of aggressive code coverage goals).</p><h2 id="alternatives-to-mocking">Alternatives to Mocking</h2><p>With all the problems of mocking, are there other ways to increase testing in the eye of <code>IO</code>?</p><p>There are several things you can do instead of mocking:</p><ul><li>More unit testing</li><li>Easier to Test IO</li><li>Just do IO</li><li>Separation of logic and services / IO</li><li>E2E integration tests</li></ul><p><em>Then after you have done all of that, and you still need more tests, go with mocking.</em></p><h2 id="more-unit-testing">More unit testing</h2><p>First of all, do more unit testing without mocks. I’d bet there is a huge potential for more testing in your code base. You might need to refactor your code to do so. The refactoring I love most is <a href="https://www.refactoring.com/catalog/decomposeConditional.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decompose Conditional</a>.</p><p>It does replace</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>if</span> <span>user</span>.<span>isGoodStanding</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>&amp;&amp;</span> len(<span>user</span>.<span>orders</span>)&gt;<span>5</span>

</span></span><span><span>  <span>&amp;&amp;</span> len(<span>user</span>.<span>email</span>)&gt;<span>0</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>send</span>(<span>CouponEmail</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>with the cleaner and easier to read - and possible to test! -</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>if</span> <span>goodCustomer</span>(<span>user</span>)
</span></span><span><span>  <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>canSendTo</span>(<span>user</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>send</span>(<span>CouponEmail</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>goodCustomer</code> and <code>canSendTo</code> are now easy to test. And there is no need to test the <code>if</code> or the <code>send</code>.</p><p>Another one is <a href="https://refactoring.com/catalog/introduceParameterObject.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Introduce Parameter Object</a>. The refactoring replaces several parameters in a function call with one parameter.</p><p>How does it help with testing? Given the code</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>invoiceCustomer</span>(<span>startDate</span>, <span>endDate</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>if</span> <span>endDate</span> &lt; <span>startDate</span> { <span>return</span> }
</span></span><span><span>  <span>...</span>
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>you can refactor it to</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>invoiceCustomer</span>(<span>dateRange</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>if</span> ! <span>valid</span>(<span>dateRange</span>) { <span>return</span> }
</span></span><span><span>  <span>...</span>
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>valid</span>(<span>dateRange</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>return</span> <span>endDate</span> &gt; <span>startDate</span>
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now <code>valid</code> can easily be tested.</p><p>Refactoring all you your (more complex) IF conditionals into their own functions, make the code easier to understand and you can write meaningful tests. There are many more refactorings (read the book!) to make your code easier to test. Start here, instead of mocking.</p><h2 id="easier-to-test-io">Easier to Test IO</h2><p>We can use alternatives to our dependencies. This often happens with an in-memory database, which is compatible to your main database you do use in production, but is faster. This way queries are faster, tests are faster, and especially fast enough to run them like unit tests. Then there is no need to mock the test service, just replace the database connection URL with the in-memory one and your done.</p><p>Where this is more common is with file access. When you use a virtual file system (like <a href="https://github.com/spf13/afero" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">afero</a>) in your application, it is easy to swap that out with a memory one during testing. You still create files and delete files, but everything happens in memory and is blazingly fast. This way it is easy to test code that does file operations, without creating or destroying files. An easy way to reduce the need for mocking.</p><p>Before you use a virtual file system though to check operations, refactor your code to work on abstractions, like <code>Reader</code>. Instead of a filename in your method, give the method a <code>Reader</code>. The caller opens the file, creates a <code>Reader</code> and hands it to the method. In testing, you create a <code>Reader</code> from a string or byte array and pass it into the method to be tested.</p><p>What can’t be abstracted, like testing the creation of a file in a correct way, with correct attributes, you can test with a virtual file system.</p><h2 id="just-do-io">Just do IO</h2><p>One reason to replace IO with testing - beside easier setup - is performance. Tests with IO are slow.</p><p>Or so it seems.</p><p>IO is getting faster and faster. I come from an 8bit world of tape drives. To play a game as a kid, you had to start the tape drive, have lunch, then play the game because it took minutes to load. I was amazed when I got my first disc drive. Then my first hard drive. Then a Seagate Barracuda (look it up). At one company we put expensive hard drives and sound isolation into developer machines, to speed up testing. Then came SSDs. And even they become <a href="https://www.octobench.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faster and faster</a>.</p><p>Now it might be the time to just do IO - in files or a database - because the IO has become blazingly fast. <em>Just do IO does not help with external services, but helps with IO.</em></p><p>And with Postgres you can easily copy a test database with a random name from a template for each test. So there is your easy setup.</p><h2 id="separation-of-logic-and-io">Separation of logic and IO</h2><p>Another way to get out of mocking, is to remove IO from your code. by separating IO logic from business logic.</p><p>Starting with your code that you want to test:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>z</span>() {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>if</span> <span>x</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>IO1</span>()
</span></span><span><span>  } <span>else</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>IO2</span>()
</span></span><span><span>  }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>How to move IO out of this code? First there is often logic in that code than can be separated. Take this code that I see often and that is hard to test:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>z</span>(<span>order</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>customer</span> = <span>IO1</span>()
</span></span><span><span>  <span>customer</span>.<span>payed</span> = <span>true</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>customer</span>.<span>order</span> = <span>order</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>customer</span>.<span>orders</span> = <span>customter</span>.<span>orders</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>IO2</span>(<span>customer</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Refactoring this to:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>addOrder</span>(<span>customer</span>, <span>order</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>customer</span>.<span>payed</span> = <span>true</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>customer</span>.<span>order</span> = <span>order</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>customer</span>.<span>orders</span> = <span>customter</span>.<span>orders</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>z</span>(<span>order</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>customer</span> = <span>IO1</span>()
</span></span><span><span>  <span>addOrder</span>(<span>customer</span>, <span>order</span>)
</span></span><span><span>  <span>IO2</span>(<span>customer</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>makes the logic of transforming a customer by adding a order easy to test. Just write a test for <code>addOrder</code>. I call this first step <code>untangling</code>.</p><p>After you’ve untangled all of your code, you end up with <code>IO</code> skeletons. How do you proceed testing <code>z()</code>?</p><p>One way is to use the command pattern:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span>  <span>IF</span> <span>x</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>return</span> <span>IO1Command</span>
</span></span><span><span>  } <span>else</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>return</span> <span>IO2Command</span>
</span></span><span><span>  }
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><em>(Functional programming would implement the separation of logic and IO with Monads, Monad Transformers and Monad Transformer stacks - <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/investigating-the-i-o-monad-in-go-3c0fabbb4b3d]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a simple example</a>)</em></p><p>Then either the commands have an <code>execute()</code> method that does the IO for you (commands need to be very very simple, with logic inside commands you just moved the logic around, you haven’t separated the logic!)</p><p>Or somewhere in the code you have</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>// z() is pure and returns a command
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>command</span> = <span>z</span>()
</span></span><span><span><span>SWITCH</span> <span>command</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>CASE</span> <span>IO1Command</span>:
</span></span><span><span>    <span>IO1</span>()
</span></span><span><span>  <span>...</span>
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><em>(with parameters like the user ID as fields in the command)</em></p><p>You then can test the code and see if it returns <code>IO1Command</code> and <code>IO2Command</code> correctly. No need to mock IO.</p><p>What if there is more IO in <code>z</code>? You might create a <code>command</code> list:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>IF</span> <span>x</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>commands</span>.append(<span>IO1Command</span>)
</span></span><span><span>} <span>else</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>commands</span>.append(<span>IO2Command</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span><span>// ... more comands here ...
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>return</span> <span>commands</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now <code>z</code> can perform a series of IO calls. But what if your decisions depend on IO (like the number of customers?):</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>IF</span> <span>IO0</span>() {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>IO1</span>()
</span></span><span><span>} <span>else</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>IO2</span>()
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>you might be drawn to solve this with:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>commands</span>.append(
</span></span><span><span>  <span>IF</span>(<span>IOCommand0</span>, <span>IOCommand1</span>, <span>IOCommand2</span>)
</span></span><span><span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and you’ve ended up with an interpreter. An interpreter?
Yes, most often you end up with a complicated interpreter when separating the last bits of <code>IO</code>. Or as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Greenspun’s tenth rule</a> puts it: <em>“Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.”</em></p><h2 id="e2e-integration-testing">E2E integration testing</h2><p><em>See my article <a href="https://www.amazingcto.com/brilliant-idea-e2e-tests-that-work-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I Had a Great Idea - E2E Testing For Free</a></em></p><p>One problem as outlined above is that mocks do not represent reality. Or a changing reality. When an external services changes, your mocks will still run fine!</p><p>You need to test reality. Instead of mocking, invest in end-to-end (E2E) testing. E2E testing and integration testing is often seen as UI driven. You use Selenium or Playwright to drive the browser or a mobile application for E2E testing.</p><p>And while I do think some amount of UI driven E2E tests is necessary to check for a broken UI, the majority of E2E tests should be backend-serverside tests. Why do I personally prefer server side E2E tests?</p><p>For example I use:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>user</span> = <span>NewUser</span>(<span>name</span>, <span>email</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>RegisterUserUseCase</span>(<span>user</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>CheckUserNotValidated</span>(<span>user</span>)
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>token</span> = <span>EmailValidationToUserUseCase</span>(<span>user</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>ok</span> = <span>ValidateUserUseCase</span>(<span>user</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>CheckUserValidated</span>(<span>user</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Server side E2E testing can do things, UI-driven testing can’t.</p><p>For my last startup, I wrote a DSL to write server side E2E tests for it’s subscription and payment service.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="golang"><span><span><span>sub</span> = <span>newSubscriptionWithMonths</span>(<span>customer</span>, <span>3</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>time</span>.<span>OneMonthForward</span>()
</span></span><span><span><span>subscriptionService</span>.<span>Run</span>(<span>sub</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>time</span>.<span>OneMonthForward</span>()
</span></span><span><span><span>subscriptionService</span>.<span>Run</span>(<span>sub</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>time</span>.<span>OneMonthForward</span>()
</span></span><span><span><span>subscriptionService</span>.<span>Run</span>(<span>sub</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>CheckSubscriptionEnded</span>(<span>sub</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>CheckInvoicesCreated</span>(<span>sub</span>, <span>2</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For every subscription model, for early cancellation, for refunds etc. we had end to end testing (simulating months) - finding bugs, finding edge cases and making sure there are no bugs in payment, invoicing and subscriptions.</p><p>E2E tests test the real thing. If they break, you have a bug.</p><p>When you add UI-driven tests (and you should have some), don’t add too many. UI-driven tests are fragile, break easily, take long to run, are flacky and a pain to maintain. Have some to test the main use cases (signup, checkout) to make sure the UI is not broken. Don’t overstretch or you will break under maintenance of UI-driven tests.</p><h2>Join CTO Newsletter</h2><p><h3>Join more than 2700 CTOs and Engineering Managers</h3></p><h3>More Stuff from Stephan</h3><h2>Other interesting articles for CTOs</h2><p>•

<p>In a vote along party lines, the National Defense Authorization Act, a must-pass bill that funds the Department of Defense for the next fiscal year, was passed by the House of Representatives. Within that bill is a small section that bans DJI from using the FCC frequencies.</p>



<p>After two days of debating and voting on amendments to the 2025 NDAA, the House voted and passed the bill that includes a <a href="https://dronedj.com/2024/06/14/advexure-dji-drone-ban-opinion/">ban on DJI drone usage in the United States</a>.</p>



<p>The NDAA funds all elements of the DoD and national defense operations of the Department of Energy, and every year a new version of this becomes law for the past six decades. What was once a bill <a href="https://x.com/ElenaWicker/status/1800662987361177692">one page long with only three sections</a>, is now over 1000 pages with even more sections, many of which don’t have anything to do with funding the military.</p>



<p>One of these sections, H.R. 2864, or the Countering CCP Drones Act, was added to the bill and can be found under Section 1722. For those who are just hearing about this for the first time, it would remove DJI’s ability to get approval from the FCC, banning any future drones from being imported and possibly grounding current drones.</p>



<p>The bill as it stands does not provide any compensation to those that could be affected by this ban, if it is retroactive.</p>



<p>The NDAA had wide bipartisan support until Thursday when House Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/14/house-republicans-narrowly-pass-defense-bill-loaded-with-culture-war-issues-00163453">tacked on partisan amendments</a> and the Left whipped its members to vote against it. So when the House came to vote on the NDAA Friday, the vote was pretty much along party lines.</p>



<p>However, this should not be taken as Democrats being against the ban, anti-China legislation is popular on both sides of the aisle.</p>



<p>The bill has already started working its way through the Senate. If it passes the Senate then it will go to the President’s desk for signature into law.</p>



<p>After that, the ball is in DJI and the public’s hands if any legal challenges are attempted.</p>

<p>Most folks dream of being entrepreneur; “<em>a path that seemed inevitable</em>“, they say. None of that shit applies to me. I’m only here cause I kept getting laid off and that nonsense infuriated me.</p>
<p>I treated my first layoff as a joke, as I’d seen them in movies &amp; TV; “<em>now they’re happening to me – how funny</em>“. My second felt like a whispered “fuck-you”, as the company had been acquired and I was deemed useless. The third and fourth scrambled my brain and forced me down a path <strong><em>I never intended to travel</em></strong>.</p>
<h2>I’m only here cause I had to save myself.</h2>
<p>I remember thinking:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I can’t trust them anymore; I gotta figure out a way to generate revenue myself; from my own business; that I control. Online preferably.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>That’s where I started. Daunting for someone with a History degree. I had no other choice.</p>
<p>So, I took stock of my background at that moment. Web analytics, Paid Search, and pittance of SEO.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ok, I’ll start there. I’ll skip coding for now.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d recently been exposed to a new online ad network, that paid by lead and/or click. I had previously implemented it on a company’s website &amp; it generated around $30-$50 a day for them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sounds good to me, let’s try something like that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since I couldn’t code, I couldn’t launch a website. So the gears of my dusty cobweb cranium began to turn. What can I do that doesn’t require coding? Eventually, a thought bubbled up:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, what’s stopping me from signing up for one of those ad networks, and then going to a search engine, typing a popular search term, digging through the organic results, searching for sites WITHOUT advertising, emailing them to request ad rates, and implementing <span>//my own//</span> ad pixel there.</p></blockquote>
<p>There wasn’t a damn thing stopping me. So I started doing that (with the hopes the website owner never found out about said ad network, as I could be cut out of loop). This was late 2003.</p>
<p>I needed a topic. Alot of people seemed to search for tourism information online, so I leaned into that corner. Began searching broad terms &amp; phrases in any search engine. My thought was, if site is in top ten results for major keyword, then it’s safe to say they’re receiving a significant (enough) amount of traffic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/Caribbean.jpg" alt="Caribbean" width="277" height="182">I’d search ‘Aruba’, and would email every site that fit the bill. “<em>Do you accept advertising? If so, what are your rates?</em>” I’d search ‘Bahamas’ &amp; repeat process. Then ‘Key West’. And on and on.</p>
<p>I’d get a nibble occasionally. I’d reply asking their traffic levels &amp; monthly ad rates. Then I’d napkin math whether I’d be able to cover *their* ad expense &amp; (possibly) generate profit with my own ad revenue from the network (which was guesstimated, on my part). Oftentimes, the numbers wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>Until the owner of a Cancun travel website replied. His rate was $50/month to advertise. His site ranked well for several Cancun related terms &amp; received significant traffic. I estimated my ad unit, if placed in a certain section on the page, would receive 2% CTR. Then I multiplied that number by his daily traffic levels, and guesstimated $5-$8 of revenue per day. I remember thinking I was going to get hosed on the deal, but me being me, I kept going.</p>
<p>He asked what type of ads I’d run. I didn’t know, as they were dynamically generated based on the content of the site/page. I told him “<em>several travel &amp; tourism promotions targeted to Cancun</em>“. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>That worked for him, so I began paying $50 a month, and shot him my ad pixel to implement. Off-the-bat, the darn thing began generating $300-$350 a month.</p>
<p>The ads were perfectly targeted. Cancun hotels. Swim with dolphins. Paragliding. Cruises. Most months I was clearing $300/month profit (after ad expenses to the website owner). I couldn’t fukkin believe it. It was my mini-watershed moment; exposing me to the fact that, yes, dolt-brain me could do this. If I could generate revenue from this disgustingly duct-taped business model, I could do it in other fashions online. I just didn’t know what those fashions were yet. One thing I did know:</p>
<blockquote><p>I gotta learn how to code</p></blockquote>
<p>This was the avenue hanging me up &amp; intimidating me. I was currently advertising <em>on other folks websites. That they built. They hosted. They managed.</em> I had to mimic that same position. And that meant coding, launching, &amp; managing my own sites. </p>
<p>Outside of its complexities, coding tripped me up cause it required a basic tenet that I typically veered away from: <em>basic reading</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/mad-corn.jpeg"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/mad-corn-230x300.jpeg" alt="Alfred E Neumann" width="230" height="300" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/mad-corn-230x300.jpeg 230w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/mad-corn.jpeg 474w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px"></a>I don’t mind reading, I just don’t like doing it, I find it difficult to focus (I’m more of a distinguished MAD Magazine type of reader). I’d rather watch a video tutorial, listen to an audiobook, or have someone side-by-side explaining things. Those avenues didn’t quite exist back then; so I had to get creative.</p>
<p>Instead of lamenting &amp; bemoaning my position, I decided to throw out all the rules and <strong>✨ <em>just start building a website although I didn’t know how</em> ✨</strong>. I’d figure out the rest once I started.</p>
<p>Someone told me ‘hosting’ was required, so I bought a cheap package and began to poke around. Once I skipped the documentation, I discovered they had a ‘ticket’ system where they allowed customers to submit support questions. Huhmm.</p>
<p>~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br>
<em><strong>Ticket #1:</strong><br>
<strong>from:</strong> Peter<br>
<strong>message:</strong> please help me get a website online</em> (╯˘ -˘ )╯<br>
~ ~ ~ ~ ~</p>
<p>… and – God bless them – they replied. That’s where I learned about the “index.html” file. They became my unpaid tutors. Volleying countless questions on how all this stuff works. What the hell a domain name was. How to update my DNS. File transfer protocol. They pushed me far enough where I became comfortable researching myself. Googling questions. Forum questions. Twitter. Asking friends. All of it. Hell, my friend Charles Lumpkin educated me on the wonders of a &lt; div &gt; tag.</p>
<p>From there, I got a basic one-page website online. Hand-coded. I felt like trashcan-Superman.</p>
<p>Then I channeled my advertising/marketing background. “What’s a website I can build that might generate ad revenue &amp; serve small businesses?”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yp2-300x256.jpeg" alt="Yellow Pages" width="300" height="256" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yp2-300x256.jpeg 300w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yp2.jpeg 558w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">My father’s friend worked in the Yellow Pages industry, and always remarked how profitable that business model was. We were still in early internet days (2004’ish), so I mused how I could mimic that industry online. In other words, create a central directory bringing buyers &amp; sellers together. Buyers searching for services; businesses providing those services. I liked this simple model, so I swung that way.</p>
<p>I grabbed a Yellow Pages book in my apartment, opened it up, and began to flip through. In those days, basic listing were free, but businesses could advertise large rectangle ads in their category. As I fanned through the pages, I’d keep an eye out for sections with heavy ad promotion (as it indicated an industry that understood the value of advertising). I found a few. Windshield repair. Limos. Carpet cleaning. Self storage. Pest control. And on and on. Then, I’d buy an ugly domain &amp; create an online directory of that category (ie. pest control), mixed in with geography based terms for seo, like ‘atlanta pest control’. And on that page, I’d curate several atlanta pest control operators, and list all their contact info. About as basic &amp; boring of a site as you can get. But simple to navigate, and no hoops to jump through.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/viewsourcedsv.jpg" alt="View source" width="500" height="291" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/viewsourcedsv.jpg 500w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/viewsourcedsv-300x175.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px">Then, as I further began to code, I discovered the wonders of “view page source”. I could right-click, copy &amp; paste another website’s syntax into my editor; monkey with that updated design; then upload it to my server. Tables &amp; rows, mainly. I’d swap out the logo; change the background color; the width of the container; manually add new pages. My trashcan-Superman aura was morphing into trashcan-Zeus. It felt like walking through a deep fog treasure-chest where I could only touch &amp; feel what was directly in front of me, and each outcome was bizarrely fascinating. An ape could have designed better, yes, but I was proud.</p>
<p>Then traffic began trickling in. From outreach; from sponsorships I placed; from seo stuff; from all kinds of marketing endeavors.&nbsp; I began offering premium listings; businesses began signing up; I’d charge them through Paypal (no Stripe back then). Then I began adding those ad networks (I mentioned above). And more revenue began to appear. A somewhat consistent monthly recurring revenue stream.</p>
<p>I was still working 9-5, but an escape hatch was coming into focus. A path to avoid someone else’s bonehead business decision which kneecaps a company &amp; executes my career. The glitter of fancy salaries had already grown dim – that hook they’d dangle to entrap me. I yearned for my own {mini} golden goose that provided the independence I was blindly searching for. The <em>Rage Against The Machine</em> lyric often came to mind:&nbsp; <em>“Fuck the G-ride, I want the machines that are makin’ ’em”.</em> [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDZV8TdnCoo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">src</a>]</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-300x194.jpg" alt="Wordpress" width="300" height="194" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">My development path accelerated when I discovered WordPress. Most hosts had one-click installation. WP had recently added the ability to create ‘Pages’, so I moved my development focus inside that petri dish. The pre-built themes (free &amp; paid) were a boon to my design inadequacies.</p>
<p>I built more sites ~ nights &amp; weekends ~ thanks to WordPress. But that became time consuming, so I began *<em>buying</em>* fully developed websites, direct from mom &amp; pop operators via cold email. Usually informational sites. Then I could expand the content based on search volume trends and incorporate small bits of advertising. </p>

I cold emailed the owner a $3,000 offer for the site &amp; domain. I received no reply, which was normal. Until I did receive a reply; 30 days later; accepting the offer. I further built the site out &amp; it began generating around $500/month for me.</p>
<p>What I kept noticing, though, when I’d transfer a site under my wing, I’d {immediately} focus on domain transfer, as control of that asset dictated ownership of the site.</p>
<p>These domain <em>‘things’</em> seemed intriguing, so I dug deeper. I discovered the expiring domain name market. A universe where 50k-100k domains expire &amp; auction every day. There, I discovered the impact of a blue chip, descriptive .com domain name ~ especially in development. An unfair advantage that allows small players to punch up.</p>
<p>I remember sitting in a pizza joint with my friend <a href="https://x.com/agraber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allen Graber</a>, grabbing lunch one day. At some point, he stepped away from the table and my mind was wandering. Dissecting my path to that point, and trying to stitch together what it all meant, and if there was a next step. And a thought surfaced: <em>Why not just wait. Sit and wait. And watch the expiry lists. For a premium .com domain to expire, that has development potential.</em> I was in no rush. That seemed to jive with my inner-nature. I’d already witnessed a few gorilla .com’s go up, so I understood others could as well. I’d just need to empty my mind and wait for the pull to arrive.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/boots-rope.jpeg" alt="boots and rope" width="170" height="187">The pull came in 2009. The domain was marvelous. A group in NY state abandoned ‘DudeRanch.com’, and I <a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/dude-that-built-duderanch-com/">acquired at auction</a> for $17,949. It provided the backbone for me to build a vacation marketplace for that historic industry. An environment where I could shepherd vacationers towards dude ranches that met their needs. And monetize the asset through premium (highlighted) listings that paid me a flat-fee per year.</p>
<p>The mild success I achieved there allowed me to quit the 9-5. It opened me to more projects. More domains. And opened me to empty myself into these endeavors.</p>
<p>I didn’t raise any money for these projects. I funded them with my 9-5 salary. Solo. And the reason for that was simple – why on earth would I vehemently abandon boneheaded micro-managing layoff kings in the 9-5 world only to raise money &amp; adopt a board of boneheaded micro-managing layoff kings in the startup world. If I’m gonna build, I’m gonna have free-rein decision making to pursue any and all ludicrous business models, with no oversight. If I fail, fine. That’s on me. If it works, son-of-a-gun, my job will feel like play.</p>
<p>I still to this day, over 20 years later, experience the sting from those layoffs. The check-mate move that I couldn’t counter. I had no plan, but I started. I had no goal; I just got going. I guess I’m still going; I don’t quite know where. But I’m quite content. And thankful. It appears peace of mind is the prize I’m pursuing.</p>
<p>it’s weird to look back.</p>

   <p>Retro devices, like old game consoles and CD players, bring joy to people who are <strong>nostalgic</strong>. They allow them to revisit the past in today’s ever-changing tech world. Now, someone has combined the old and now to create Linamp.</p>
<!-- BREAK 1 --> 

<p>Linamp is a physical media player inspired by Winamp, a Windows media player first released in 1997. The new device features a 7.9-inch touch screen that displays the interface of the legendary program, along with many other interesting features.</p>
<!-- BREAK 2 -->
<h2><strong>Linamp, the Physical Media Player Inspired by Winamp</strong></h2>

<p>Linamp is powered by a Raspberry Pi 4B with a 32 GB SD card. This microcomputer board has made it possible to include a <strong>3.5 mm headphone jack</strong>, a USB-C port, a USB-A port, and an Ethernet port. The body of the device is made of aluminum and seeks to mimic the style of audio devices from the 1990s.</p>
<!-- BREAK 3 --> 

<p>The front part has been 3D printed. Instead of “Winamp,” it says Linamp, but it adopts the exterior appearance of the program’s classic skin. To play an audio file, you need to to connect an SD card or use an external disc player.</p>
<!-- BREAK 4 --><div>
   <p><a href="https://www.xatakaon.com/audio/what-happened-to-creative-technology-the-company-that-created-the-legendary-sound-blaster-cards">

    </a>
   </p>
   
  </div>
<p>When users insert a CD, Linamp automatically detects the disc, extracts the track information, and is ready to play your selection. To start listening to music, all you need to do is <strong>press the Play button</strong> on the touch screen. In the future, the creator plans to add support for Bluetooth and Spotify.</p>
<!-- BREAK 5 -->
<p>Linamp is a project by Rodrigo Méndez. According to his <a rel="noopener, noreferrer" href="https://hackaday.io/rodmg">Hackaday profile</a>, he’s a Mexico-based “computer engineer by training, software engineer by trade, geek by birth” who “also enjoys embedded systems and electronics.” You can find additional details about his latest creation in a <a rel="noopener, noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=EyidVBoFrTISYUQ2&amp;v=5nUYHROVOmo&amp;feature=youtu.be">video posted on YouTube</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Working with PostgreSQL, and virtually any database system, extends far beyond merely inserting and retrieving data. Many application and business processes, maintenance tasks, reporting, and orchestration tasks require the integration of a job scheduler. While third-party tools can drive automation, you can also automate the execution of predefined tasks directly within the database environment. Although system-level cron might be a starting point, the power of the database system lies in its ability to store all the necessary information alongside your data/schema. In this article, we will explore <code>pg_cron</code> and <code>pg_timetable</code> as two distinct PostgreSQL-specific tools for scheduled task automation.</p>
<h2 id="the-many-roles-of-job-scheduling">The Many Roles of Job Scheduling
</h2>
<p>Usually, the first requirement to automate job execution is the optimisation of the PostgreSQL cluster and databases. Except in very low usage scenarios, <strong>routine maintenance</strong> is the foundation of all database deployments. Whether it is VACUUMing, index rebuilding, or updating statistics, these are tasks that you will eventually need to automate to maintain operational efficiency.</p>
<p>Job scheduling is also indispensable for <strong>maintaining data quality</strong>, particularly through operations like refreshing materialised views or batch removal of outdated data from the system. From there, it is just a step to <strong>reporting</strong>, which can involve the automation of generating operational and business reports.</p>
<p>I also believe that databases are an excellent place to <strong>coordinate business processes</strong>. Automating data flows between components, teams, and departments helps create agile systems. As mentioned above, there is no better place to store the description of such automations than alongside your data.</p>
<h2 id="pg-cron-automation-s-first-gear">pg_cron: Automation's First Gear
</h2>
<p>Traditionally, the role of automation started with operating system tools like cron or Task Scheduler. That's where <a href="https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron"><code>pg_cron</code></a> comes in. It's a PostgreSQL extension that provides the simplicity and familiarity of cron's scheduling directly within the database environment.</p>
<p>Due to its dependency on a shared library (because of the use of the background worker), it requires a full cluster restart. Nevertheless, due to its popularity, it is available within most managed cloud environments.</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span># requires configuration update in postgresql.conf (or conf.d)
</span><span>shared_preload_libraries = '</span><span>pg_cron</span><span>'
</span><span>
</span><span># add extension as superuser 
</span><span>CREATE EXTENSION pg_cron;
</span></code></pre>
<p>As long as you are familiar with cron-like syntax, you can get started immediately by using commands like:</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT </span><span>cron</span><span>.</span><span>schedule</span><span>('</span><span>30 3 * * 6</span><span>', $$</span><span>DELETE FROM</span><span> events </span><span>WHERE</span><span> event_time &lt; now() - interval '</span><span>1 week</span><span>'$$);
</span></code></pre>
<p>By default, <code>pg_cron</code> exposes its functionality in the <code>postgres</code> database (configurable), where it expects its metadata tables. Personally, I consider this a drawback, as it makes it less obvious to the casual DBA who might not be aware of the scheduling logic present.</p>
<p>In the same database, you can perform basic monitoring, for example, getting details of running and recently completed jobs:</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT </span><span>* </span><span>FROM </span><span>cron</span><span>.</span><span>job_run_details </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> start_time </span><span>DESC LIMIT </span><span>5</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p>There is no direct support to talk to other PostgreSQL clusters (you would have to facilitate this, for example, using Foreign Data Wrappers).</p>
<p>While cron-like syntax is beneficial for adoption, it is where <code>pg_cron</code> falls short, as it does not support advanced cases like task chaining, dependencies, and triggers.</p>

<p>If <code>pg_cron</code> offers automation in first gear, <code>pg_timetable</code> is where you can go full speed ahead. It not only provides cron-like syntax but elevates it to a whole new level with task chaining, parameter support, multiple execution clients, enhanced scheduling, and much more.</p>
<p>The first difference you might notice is in its distribution. Timetable is not a PostgreSQL extension but a standalone binary (or available as a Docker image) that you have to configure and run. This immediately raises the bar in terms of the infrastructure it requires. On the other hand, not being distributed as an extension makes it compatible with all managed services by default (if you can get the process up and running).</p>
<p>While the basic syntax might be similar to <code>pg_cron</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT </span><span>timetable</span><span>.</span><span>add_job</span><span>('</span><span>execute-func</span><span>', '</span><span>5 0 * 8 *</span><span>', '</span><span>SELECT public.my_func()</span><span>');
</span></code></pre>
<p>this is not anywhere near the limits of <code>pg_timetable</code>. <code>add_job</code> is a helper function that creates a simple one-task chain. For task execution, it directly supports more options, including built-in tasks (like sending emails if properly configured, downloading files, sleeping, copying files, etc.), external commands, the ability to choose which client should execute the job, concurrency, and more.</p>
<p>In its full definition, <code>add_job</code> is quite powerful (see <a href="https://pg-timetable.readthedocs.io/en/master/basic_jobs.html#add-simple-job">documentation</a> for details):</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT </span><span>timetable</span><span>.</span><span>add_job</span><span>(
</span><span>    job_name            =&gt; '</span><span>notify every minute</span><span>',
</span><span>    job_schedule        =&gt; '</span><span>* * * * *</span><span>',
</span><span>    job_command         =&gt; '</span><span>SELECT pg_notify($1, $2)</span><span>',
</span><span>    job_parameters      =&gt; '</span><span>["TT_CHANNEL", "Hello World!"]</span><span>'::jsonb,
</span><span>    job_kind            =&gt; '</span><span>SQL</span><span>'::</span><span>timetable</span><span>.</span><span>command_kind</span><span>,
</span><span>    job_client_name     =&gt; </span><span>NULL</span><span>,
</span><span>    job_max_instances   =&gt; </span><span>1</span><span>,
</span><span>    job_live            =&gt; </span><span>TRUE</span><span>,
</span><span>    job_self_destruct   =&gt; </span><span>FALSE</span><span>,
</span><span>    job_ignore_errors   =&gt; </span><span>TRUE
</span><span>) AS chain_id;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The components of <code>pg_timetable</code> consist of the <strong>command</strong> (SQL/program or built-in), <strong>task</strong> controlling the configuration for the command execution (error handling, timeout, or database connection to use), and <strong>chain</strong> which can contain a number of tasks chained together.</p>
<p>The big difference comes in the scheduling options. While <code>pg_cron</code> is limited (as its name suggests) to cron-like syntax, <code>pg_timetable</code> uses it for simple use cases but offers much more. It supports schedules <code>@every</code> and <code>@after</code>, allowing repeated execution and breaking away from the limitations of cron notation as it can go down to custom intervals (including second intervals). Another case is <code>@reboot</code> for instances when the <code>pg_timetable</code> controller reconnects to the database.</p>
<p>The timetable setup manages own schema migrations and stores all the configuration in schema <code>timetable</code> (by default), where you can find the definitions of chains/tasks and relevant auditing information (logs).</p>
<p>And yes, if you have been paying attention, <code>pg_timetable</code> architecture allows for running tasks across multiple PostgreSQL clusters, making it an advanced orchestration tool. The database connection, which can be configured in-place or via a drop-in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgservice.html">connection service file</a>, can be set on a per-task basis.</p>
<p>With chains, the setup can be much more complex:</p>
<pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>DO $$
</span><span>DECLARE
</span><span>  v_chain_id </span><span>BIGINT</span><span>;
</span><span>  v_notify_task_id </span><span>BIGINT</span><span>;

<h3 id="when-to-use-pg-cron">When to Use <code>pg_cron</code>
</h3>
<ol>
<li>If your requirements are straightforward, such as running maintenance tasks, refreshing materialised views, or generating periodic reports using simple SQL commands, <code>pg_cron</code> is an excellent choice. Its cron-like syntax is familiar and <strong>easy to use</strong>.</li>
<li><code>pg_cron</code> is a PostgreSQL extension, making it <strong>easier to install</strong> and configure within your existing PostgreSQL environment. This makes it ideal for users who prefer minimal setup effort.</li>
<li>When your environment is limited to a <strong>single PostgreSQL cluster</strong>, <code>pg_cron</code> is well-suited for the job. It does not support orchestration across multiple clusters, so it’s best used in environments where all operations are confined to one database cluster.</li>
<li>If <strong>Basic Error Handling and Logging</strong> is sufficient, <code>pg_cron</code> provides the necessary functionalities without additional complexity.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="when-to-use-pg-timetable">When to Use <code>pg_timetable</code>
</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you need more <strong>advanced scheduling capabilities</strong> and <strong>task depedencies and chaining</strong>, such as task chaining, complex intervals, and custom execution times, <code>pg_timetable</code> is the better choice. It supports extensive scheduling options beyond the typical cron syntax.</li>
<li><code>pg_timetable</code> supports a <strong>variety of job types</strong>, including SQL commands, built-in tasks (like sending emails or downloading files), and shell commands. This makes it ideal for more complex automation needs that go beyond simple SQL execution.</li>
<li>If your environment spans multiple PostgreSQL clusters, <code>pg_timetable</code> can handle <strong>advanced orchestration</strong>, allowing tasks to be executed across different clusters seamlessly.</li>
<li><strong>Intermediate Error Handling and Logging</strong> provides better insights and control over job executions.</li>
<li>Although bit more complex to setup, <code>pg_timetable</code> works as <strong>standalone Service</strong>, which makes it suitable for environments where extensions cannot be installed directly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Choosing between <code>pg_cron</code> and <code>pg_timetable</code> depends on your specific needs. For simpler, single-cluster tasks, <code>pg_cron</code> offers ease of use and straightforward setup. For more complex requirements involving advanced scheduling, task dependencies, and multi-cluster orchestration, <code>pg_timetable</code> provides a more powerful and flexible solution.</p>
<p>By understanding the strengths and limitations of each tool, you can make an informed decision that best suits your database automation needs.</p>
<p>PS: there's also <a href="https://github.com/pgadmin-org/pgagent">pgAgent</a>, but it is generally not used and does not seem to be actively maintained.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I was roasting some pumpkin for a delicious soup and towards the end of the cooking time the fan on the oven started into overdrive, making a lot of noise then it started beeping and popped up this obscure error message. I phoned the manufacturer, Electrolux, on the provided number and they told me I'd need to pay at least $160 to have their engineer come out and tell me what was wrong.</p><p>You've probably had this experience with lots of stuff. "Sorry, the item is out of warranty so you'll have to pay." The problem with this is that <a href="https://consumer.gov.au/consumers-and-acl">Australian Consumer Law</a> gives an <i>automatic</i> warranty. You can expect the item to last a reasonable amount of time. Now an old fashioned light bulb shouldn't be expected to last a decade, but an oven?</p><p>Challenged on this, I went around and around in circles with the Electrolux call centre worker. "So you think an oven should only last for two years?" and eventually I asked to be escalated to a manager who could actually make a decision. After some follow up, I finally got a call from a manager who was well drilled in shutting down any idea I should expect something from them. Eventually I said okay thanks, I'll see you at the Tribunal.</p><h2>How long should an appliance last?</h2><p>The "warranty" companies talk about is actually an "express warranty" and if you read them you'll notice these days they now include mandatory text about how they aren't able to exclude guarantees that come from the Australian Consumer Law. Anything they offer in their written warranty is in addition to your base rights.</p><p>So you have a reasonable expectation that your appliance will last a reasonable amount of time. So how long is reasonable? Well if you look around on the web you'll find different lengths of time for different classes of appliance. And if you buy the cheapest Chinesium appliance, you shouldn't expect it to last as long as the exxy Miele model.</p><h2>Time to book a court date</h2><p>NSW (and I think all the other states) has a tribunal especially for consumer claims, what used to be the "small claims court" is now the <a href="https://ncat.nsw.gov.au/" title="Link: https://ncat.nsw.gov.au/">NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal</a>, NCAT. It's specifically designed to be low cost and straightforward. You shouldn't need a lawyer and can turn up with your documents.</p><p>The important thing to know about tribunals like NCAT is you're paying mostly with your time. You'll need to front up on the booked date and make your case. There's a small filing fee: in this case it was $58, which is still a lot less than Electrolux wanted to charge just to tell me what the problem was.</p><p>Before you book your date, you need to work out who is the other side of the transaction. You don't ordinarily go after the manufacturer but the retailer. So I contacted Appliances Online to talk it through. They took the same line as Electrolux that it was out of warranty and so not their problem. Again: see you in the Tribunal.</p><p>I filled in the forms. They're annoyingly slow, but the online system mostly works. Paid my fee and bingo, out comes an email with a tribunal date and location.</p><h2>Amazing service, just add NCAT date</h2><p>And the next day I get a call from the lovely Dylan from Appliances Online, someone who's evidently empowered to make decisions that make tribunal appointments go away. He tells me he'll get Electrolux to invoice them instead, an appointment is booked and we're off to the races.</p><p>One thing worth understanding is this: if the retailer has to send someone along to the Tribunal, they lose already. Even the cost of a junior lawyer going to the tribunal is going to be more than it would cost to repair your appliance. They might do it on principle if you're taking the piss but if you have a decent case they're wasting time and money.</p><h2>A couple of engineer visits</h2><p>Don't go cancelling your NCAT date just yet though! First you need the problem resolved. Remember, this could have all been resolved by them applying Australian Consumer Law when you first asked, so keep that clock ticking, it keeps things moving.</p><p>I had a lovely engineer from Electrolux visit and take a look. He wasn't sure what the problem was: tested the fan and heater element and found no problem. In the end he replaced the light bulb (which hadn't worked for years, we hadn't bothered replacing it) and the message had gone away anyway.</p><p>Next day the message is back, and Dylan drops me a note asking me to remove the NCAT booking. I respond saying it still isn't resolved and magically another engineer appointment pops up.</p><p>The second visit does the trick. The engineer replaced the heating element and fan and the message has gone away. We've done a few baking projects since and all seems good!</p><h2>Satisfaction, but annoyed I have to assert my rights</h2><p>So my oven is fixed. Otherwise it's a <i>great</i> oven. It's annoying that I have to push to get my consumer rights though. It should just be standard! My hope is that by encouraging others to also assert their rights it'll become easier. Don't put up with this shit about appliances having a tiny warranty period!<br>

<h2>Beginning in 1979, former librarian Marion Stokes privately recorded broadcasts from multiple televisions at once, 24 hours a day, eventually accumulating a startling 71,000 tapes of television history.</h2><div id="attachment_475597"><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-475597" src="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/marion-stokes.jpg" alt="Marion Stokes" width="900" height="462" srcset="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/marion-stokes.jpg 900w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/marion-stokes-300x154.jpg 300w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/marion-stokes-768x394.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-475597"><span>Zeitgeist Films</span><span>Marion Stokes took it upon herself to record and archive every moment of television.</span></p></div>
<p>Marion Stokes believed that the news held crucial historical details at risk of disappearing forever. So, beginning around 1979, the former librarian and civil rights activist began obsessively recording television broadcasts 24 hours a day. </p>
<p>For more than three decades, Stokes attempted to archive every broadcast that she had access to, eventually recording programs on as many as eight televisions at once. In the end, she wound up with more than 70,000 recorded tapes. </p>
<p>Stokes was equal parts compulsive hoarder and guerrilla archivist, and her unique project has raised important questions about media preservation. Although she died in 2012, her project has been given new life thanks to the Internet Archive, which began the painstaking process of digitizing Stokes’ tapes in 2013. This massive undertaking is itself a years-long task, which shows just how prolific Marion Stokes’ work truly was. </p>

<p>Marion Marguerite Stokes was born on Nov. 25, 1929, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Stokes grew up in the city’s Germantown neighborhood and attended Girls High School. From the 1940s to the early 1960s, she worked as a librarian at the Free Library of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>But it was Stokes’ later work as a <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/civil-rights-movement-photos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">civil rights</a> activist, working to help integrate Girard College, that initially made her a standout. She helped organize buses to the 1963 <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/march-on-washington" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March on Washington</a>, and served as a founding board member of the National Organization for Women. She was likewise the Chair for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, an organization that opposed the economic boycott of Cuba. </p>

<p>In 1960, Stokes married a teacher named Melvin Metelits, with whom she had one son, Michael. The couple later split, and Marion would go on to marry television anchor John Stokes Jr., whom she met while working as a panelist on a local news show called <em>Input.</em> </p>
<p>The Stokeses later moved into a new home in Rittenhouse Square. Around 1975, Stokes bought herself a Betamax magnetic videotape recorder and began to casually record episodes of her favorite sit-coms, documentaries, and news broadcasts.</p>
<p>But in 1979, amid the Iran Hostage Crisis, something in Marion Stokes changed. </p>
<p>As her son Michael Metelits said in the 2019 documentary <em><a href="https://recorderfilm.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project</a>,</em> “she hit record and she never stopped.”</p>
<h2>The Birth Of A Unique Obsession</h2>
<p>Marion Stokes became obsessed with chronicling and archiving news footage. She would purchase countless tapes, load them into the recorder, and let the television run all day long. </p>
<p>Every six to eight hours — depending on the length of the tape — she quickly swapped it out for a new one. Sometimes, this meant rushing home early from a meal to ensure she didn’t miss a second of a broadcast.</p>
<p>Gradually, she bought more and more TVs so she could document multiple programs at once until she was recording from eight different devices.</p>
<p>“It was just a logistical nightmare — that’s really the only way to put it,” Michael Metelits told <em><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3022022/the-incredible-story-of-marion-stokes-who-single-handedly-taped-35-years-of-tv-news" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fast Company</a></em> in 2013.</p>

<p>As one might expect, these tapes eventually began to take up space — a lot of it. By investing in Apple stock, Stokes saved enough money to buy as many as nine additional apartments, which she used as storage units to hold all of her tapes. </p>
<p>“Pretty much everything else took a back seat,” Metelits said. “It provided a certain rhythm to her life, and a certain amount of deep, deep conviction that this stuff was going to be useful. That somehow, someone would find a way to index it, archive it, store it — that it would be useful.”</p>
<p>The archives eventually grew to approximately 71,000 VHS and Betamax tapes, stored in various locations. These tapes contained not only news broadcasts but also sit-coms, commercials, and talk shows, recorded in Extended Play format. </p>

<p>Stokes worried that facts and details from early news broadcasts could become lost or muddied as stories were retold over time. Little inconsistencies could start to add up, leaving viewers with no way of knowing how the story was originally reported. </p>
<p>“Television has been our most pervasive and persuasive medium,” said Roger MacDonald, the librarian in charge of the Internet Archive’s television portion. “But we’ve never really had much of a pause and rewind button on our experience of it to reflect back on television news, to compare and contrast and mine it for knowledge.”</p>
<p>Archiving television programs was not Stokes’ only fascination. In fact, the tech-savvy hoarder also took an early interest in Apple computers — and amassed 192 Macintosh computers before she died. </p>
<p>Still, it was her obsessive archiving of the daily news that would be her ultimate legacy.</p>
<h2>The Legacy And Lasting Impact Of Marion Stokes’ Work</h2>
<p>Marion Stokes continued to record and archive television footage up until the end. She lived to be 83 years old. And as it would turn out, her last day on Earth would coincide with her last recordings — and a horrible tragedy. </p>
<p>Stokes died on Dec. 14, 2012. That very same day, news organizations across the United States were reporting on the mass shooting at <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/false-flag-conspiracies" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sandy Hook Elementary School</a>. </p>
<p>“I got to the house and this horrific news was going on,” Metelits said. “Kids being killed. Teachers being killed while shielding children, that sort of thing… I remember being very grateful that that wasn’t the last news she saw.”</p>
<p>Marion Stokes’ project died with her that day. Her son did not continue her archival work, saying he “came to respect her project, but it wasn’t my project.” </p>

<p>But while no new tapes would ever be added to Stokes’ collection, her project did find new life in 2013, just a year after her death, when the Internet Archive began the process of digitizing Stokes’ tapes and putting them online. </p>
<p>Then, in 2019, filmmaker Matt Wolf released his documentary about Marion Stokes, allowing audiences to understand Stokes’ obsession with archiving television. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and was met with positive reviews, with some critics noting that the film — and Stokes herself — made a compelling case for guerrilla archiving.</p>
<p>Marion Stokes’ story also resonates strongly today, albeit somewhat differently, as private ownership of the media we consume daily begins to fade. With more and more services shifting to a streaming or digital model, only to then restrict access to certain media or get rid of it altogether, many are considering the merits of physical media as a means of preserving history.</p>
<p>As MacDonald told <em>Fast Company</em>, some moments in television history have likely been lost forever.</p>
<p>“But who knows,” he said. “Because there may be other Marion Stokeses out there who had that similar passion.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Between our ESP32 prokaryotic organisms and our 24/7 Internet-enabled
megafauna servers, there exists a vast and loosely-defined ecosystem of things
the
B2B world likes to call <strong>computer appliances</strong>. Picture a bespoke Pi 4 packaged
up neatly with some Python scripts, a little fancy plastic embossing, and maybe
a well-guarded <code>id_ed25519.pub</code> in case you end up in hot water during the
(long - very long, stable cash flow for generations long) maintenance contract,
and you’re in the ballpark.</p><p>This is the little slice of computing heaven I currently live within. In a lot
of ways it feels like what I imagine employed hackers of old in the 90s were up
to. You can’t feed your data into Grafana, but you <em>can</em> <code>tail -f /var/log/syslog</code>
and make
a tidy profit off of your long-gestating Bash/Perl scripting skills.
You probably can’t <code>terraform destroy &amp;&amp; terraform apply</code>, but when was the
last time you saw immutable infrastructure done right anyway? Et cetera,
et similia.</p><p>Hey, you know what’s really dangerous over the 15 to 30 year lifespan of an
average B2B computer appliance? <em>Forgetting stuff.</em> Everyone can feel their
way around Debian 12, 11, maybe even 10 – but how do you debug a service that
is running all the way back on Debian <em>4</em>? Let’s not even get into the horrors
of Windows XP-based appliances, which power more of the world than you want
to know.</p><p>If only there were a freely-usable set of Unix-like operating systems, with an
emphasis on keeping things very, very stable over releases, even more stable
than Debian does. Enter <strong>the BSDs</strong>. Free, Open, Net, take your pick. All of
them take a “don’t fix it if it ain’t broken” approach to things, which means
someone who started slinging NetBSD installs back in 2007 can probably spin up
a well-manicured VM of that 2007 install and reliably make their way around
the system, even today, in 2024.</p><p>I’ve recently
<a href="https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/i-m-turning-30-so-i-m-switching-to-openbsd/">taken to learning OpenBSD</a>
for this very reason. And for reasons of security: While having the box not
physically connected to the Internet creates an activation energy to doing
something nasty with them that
99.9% of
ne’er-do-wells will ignore, the remaining 0.1% are likely to be
<em>really motivated</em> to want to do this. If they run into OpenBSD, however, their
efforts are quite likely to be thwarted just because the blowfish is so darn
spiky.</p></div></div>]]></description>

      <p>I’ve reached a point in my setup where most of the devices that I use are
based around the coveted USB-C port. This meant that I had a valid reason to get
a few extra because I didn’t yet have a stockpile of good USB-C cables.</p>
<p>That’s when I found out that there exist cables that have little screens on them
that show the power consumption of the connected device. This is a great little
addition
to <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/05/02/smartplugs/">my power consumption monitoring addiction.</a>
It’s also a simple way to understand if your device is charging at the speed
that you expect it to.</p>
<p>The cable I ordered cost 6.72 EUR. It is a bit stiff and hard to work with,
probably due to its supposed USB 4 support requiring actually good cabling and
shielding. It works well enough for an USB-C dock with a DisplayPort
connection that’s running a 3440x1440 display at 60 Hz.</p>
<p>It’s too early to give a definitive answer about the longevity of the cable.</p>
<p>You should be able to find these types of cables with a search query like “USB 4
Cable with LED Display”.</p>
<p>The paranoid side of me suspects that a cable like this one would be an ideal
place to hide a malicious chip. That’s the only downside that I can think of.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in going more in depth with measuring the power consumption
over USB, then you might want to look at other options.
<a href="https://github.com/fqueze/usb-power-profiling?tab=readme-ov-file#power-meters-known-to-work">This GitHub repository lists a few examples of these types of measuring devices.</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p><span>Meta is currently operating many data centers with GPU training clusters across the world. Our data centers are the backbone of our operations, meticulously designed to support the scaling demands of compute and storage. A year ago, however, as the industry reached a critical inflection point due to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), we recognized that to lead in the generative AI space we’d need to transform our fleet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our increased focus on AI was driven both by its rise in driving business outcomes and the huge growth in these types of workloads’ computational needs. In addition to wider use of traditional AI for things like ad targeting, we have also seen increasing numbers of large generative AI models that mimic almost-human intelligence in everything from human verbal interaction to the creation of pictures and other media. And these types of models are huge, with trillions of training parameters, and to train them we need vast resources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this process, we’ve built one of the </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/12/data-center-engineering/building-metas-genai-infrastructure/"><span>world’s largest AI training infrastructures</span></a><span>, and it has been growing exponentially over the last years. Meta’s training infrastructure comprises dozens of AI clusters of varying sizes, with a plan to scale to 600,000 GPUs in the next year. It runs thousands of training jobs every day from hundreds of different Meta teams. Training jobs characteristics vary greatly too. They can be as small as a single GPU running for a couple minutes, while generative AI jobs can have trillions of parameters and often span thousands of hosts that need to work together and are very sensitive to interruptions. In addition to that, training jobs are tied much closer to the hardware, and that hardware varies greatly. Meta runs different types of backend networks, topologies, and training jobs that have tight dependencies between software and hardware components.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This transition has not been without its challenges. We had to reconfigure the fleet without disrupting our hypergrowth, a task akin to rebuilding an airplane mid-flight. This pushed us to innovate and collaborate with vendors and utility companies to create a supportive ecosystem. In this blog we will discuss only one of these transformations. We will describe how Meta is maintaining these training clusters and what sets us apart from the average AI environment. And what do we mean by maintaining? Basically, any kind of operation that updates or verifies software and firmware components in the clusters, including the networking path.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>The main characteristics of GPU training</span></h2>
<p><span>GPU training has some demanding characteristics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Capacity guarantees</b><span>: While some training jobs can be paused, a lot of Meta jobs are time-critical</span> <span>and recurring or online. This means we cannot take large amounts of capacity on a default basis.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Bad hosts are very bad</b><span>: Since many jobs require all hosts to be synchronized, bad hosts that are a bit slower, have some non-fatal hardware, or have networking issues are extremely damaging.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Low interruption rate</b><span>: Since many hosts work with each other on a shared problem, AI training jobs are sensitive to interruptions.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Rollout safety</b><span>: The AI software stack is deep, and problems are often hard to pinpoint, so we need to be careful when rolling out new components.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Host consistency</b><span>: AI training jobs are in general cross-host, and while outside of the CUDA version there are rarely hard incompatibilities, we have learned that cluster consistency is highly important for debugging and SEV avoidance.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>What’s special about Meta’s GPU training?</span></h2>
<p><span>Meta uses bespoke training hardware with the newest chips possible and high-performance backend networks that are highly speed optimized. We also try to stay as current and flexible as possible with the software stack; in the event of firmware upgrades, this allows us to utilize new features or reduce failure rates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Together this means we have more than:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>30 maintenance operations</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>50 different components that are updated&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Three different host-verification tasks to ensure optimal performance and stability</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Thousands of disruptive AI host tasks every day&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>And we need to do them safely, while guaranteeing capacity. After all, our training clusters are also used flexibly to run a wide variety of workloads, from single-host to some of the biggest training jobs in the world, and from offline tasks to jobs that need to be up and running 24/7.</span></p>

<p><span>Given the variety of upgrades, we have a large amount of overlapping inflight changes at any given time, including some that are consistently being applied, such as verification tasks. Accepting this gives Meta the flexibility we need in using cutting-edge hardware, scaling our infrastructure, and using both in flexible ways. In smaller environments it is often possible to keep clusters in a consistent state and upgrade the whole cluster and all of its firmware and software components in the same maintenance window. Doing this in a large, diverse environment like Meta, however, would introduce big risks and be operationally infeasible. Instead, we ensure components are compatible with each other and roll component upgrades up in a sliding fashion. This approach also allows us to guarantee capacity availability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Maintenance trains</span></h2>
<figure id="attachment_21312" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-21312"><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-2.jpg?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="295" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-2.jpg 1999w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-2.jpg?resize=916,264 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-2.jpg?resize=768,221 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-2.jpg?resize=1024,295 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-2.jpg?resize=1536,443 1536w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-2.jpg?resize=96,28 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-2.jpg?resize=192,55 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-21312">Meta maintains capacity by using maintenance trains, which involves shutting down small amounts of capacity in a cyclic fashion.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Outside of special cases, Meta maintains its fleet of clusters using a technique called maintenance trains. This is used for all capacity, including compute and storage capacity. A small number of servers are taken out of production and maintained with all applicable upgrades. Trains provide the guarantee that all capacity minus one maintenance domain is up and running 24/7, thus providing capacity predictability. This is mandatory for all capacity that is used for online and recurring training.</span></p>
<p><span>Maintenance trains pick up any new upgrade and guarantee a full-visit cycle in a guaranteed timeframe. Longer-running upgrades can have lower rollout guarantees and may be scheduled to be applied in multiple cycles. So you can have many overlapping upgrades, and, if beneficial, upgrades can be aligned.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For AI capacity, we have optimized domains that allow for different kinds of AI capacity, very strict SLOs, and a contract with services that allows them to avoid maintenance-train interruptions, if possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Gradual rollouts</span></h2>
<figure id="attachment_21313" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-21313"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-3.jpg?w=571" alt="" width="195" height="350" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-3.jpg 992w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-3.jpg?resize=511,916 511w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-3.jpg?resize=768,1377 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-3.jpg?resize=571,1024 571w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-3.jpg?resize=857,1536 857w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-3.jpg?resize=96,172 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-3.jpg?resize=192,344 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-21313">An illustration of the distinction between higher-level components of the AI stack—such as the CUDA drivers, and the lower-level components involved in the training job,.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Because of the scale of our infrastructure, we had to ensure that all disruptive rollouts outside of special cases happen in a gradual fashion. This means different servers in a cluster can run a different host stack for a short period of time. This is quite normal in traditional capacity but challenging in AI training, since AI jobs are very closely tied to the hardware.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At Meta, we’ve ensured that jobs have a consistent stack but upgrade lower-level components in a gradual fashion. In contrast to this, the AI job itself, which includes the CUDA library, is always consistent. </span><span>This distinction is necessary because lower-level components often require hours to install and configure or require rebooting the host, while higher-level components in the job container itself can be restarted fluidly. </span></p>
<p><span>This sounds simple, but because of the tight integration of AI with hardware, we have needed to do a lot of development, including careful testing on all lower levels, special monitoring, and tight work with vendors. </span></p>
<p><span>By and large, this has been very successful. The AI stack in general has matured a lot over the past three years. We also added tooling for rare compatibility-breaking upgrades.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span>Selecting the correct maintenance domains&nbsp;</span></h2>
<figure id="attachment_21314" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-21314"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-4.jpg?w=916" alt="" width="916" height="623" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-4.jpg 1950w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-4.jpg?resize=916,623 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-4.jpg?resize=768,522 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-4.jpg?resize=1024,696 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-4.jpg?resize=1536,1044 1536w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-4.jpg?resize=96,65 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Systems@scale_AI-Maintence_image-4.jpg?resize=192,131 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-21314">Maintenance domains are selected based on the amount of buffer-reserved capacity (the smaller the better) and the amount of interruptions we cause to training jobs (the bigger the better).</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>One way to ensure optimal AI performance was to work with AI teams to design the optimal size of maintenance domains. A maintenance domain is the percentage of capacity we take down in one go, and selecting the optimal size is a function of both the cost of interruptions and the capacity that is lost during the maintenance duration. Since interruption costs are high for AI jobs, optimizing this relationship allowed us to significantly reduce the maintenance overhead for AI capacity.</span></p>
<h2><span>OpsPlanner: Meta disruptive-work orchestrator</span></h2>
<p><span>Critical to AI capacity are the consistency requirements. For example, if you want to move to a new CUDA version, you may need all of the capacity on a new driver version. This becomes really difficult in an environment with thousands of hosts and lots of planned and unplanned operations that may overlap with each other. To do this safely and guarantee hosts have the correct upgrades applied before entering production, Meta has unified them in the OpsPlanner work orchestrator. Not only can it work on overlapping scopes of operations and correctly serialize them, it also takes them safely out and into production. In addition, it has a built-in handover flow that ensures correct escalation behavior and avoids overlaps and deadlocks. OpsPlanner can also ensure upgrades are applied to hosts before they are returned to production. And OpsPlanner owns planned maintenance and failure buffers and safeguards them. Furthermore, it’s highly effective and efficient: OpsPlanner currently handles a million operations per day.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span>Safety and failure scenarios&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Meta has a deep stack of safety features that includes:</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Autostop of maintenance trains if maintenance or failure buffers are exhausted;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Automatic offboarding of failing upgrades; and</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Rollout phases for upgrades, so that only well-tested changes reach global systems.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>If something does go wrong, however, we can react quickly, depending on the needed fix, with emergency trains, large-scale maintenance for breaking upgrades, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span>Rapidly moving to the future of generative AI</span></h2>

<em>Author: <a href="https://ideogram.ai/">IdeogramAI</a> Prompt: The image shows a typical Google Takeout interface with a large error message indicating that the service is unavailable. In the background, there are frustrated users trying to download their data with unsuccessful attempts, represented by repeated “Failed” and “Retry” notifications.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>My current data setup is centered around Google Cloud as a place where I store my data. That’s also related to how I use the whole vendor ecosystem.</p>
<p>The main issue I have with keeping the data only in Google Cloud is data safety. I just don’t want either identity theft or accidental block on my account (by Google) to cut me off from all of my previous photos. You might think it’s something close to impossible, but there are numerous examples of that happening to people - eg. look here <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html</a> And ok, this might be a reasonable approach from Google, but who knows what else can trigger that kind of blockage.</p>
<p>So, to be safe against anything similar or just any other data lose, it would be good to have some backup in place.</p>
<p>An ideal solution right now would be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy all the photos to some other cloud</li>
<li>have an offline copy of those files/photos</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally both of those should happen automatically, according to some predefined schedule. Of course be as maintenance-free as possible.</p>
<p>I have ~200GB of data that I would like backed up on a regular basis. I’d imagine this is not the biggest set of photos a person can have stored there.</p>
<h2 id="first-attempts">First attempts</h2>
<p>My first approach was to synchronize all the files and all the photos using some syncing tools. Store them on a local hard drive, for future use. But that was less then satisfying. Mainly due to how long the process would take for my size of data.</p>
<p>There’s this open-source python tool <a href="https://github.com/gilesknap/gphotos-sync">https://github.com/gilesknap/gphotos-sync</a> - but I’m yet to try that. Although they also note on their project page issues with the backup process. Citing from there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Videos are transcoded to lower quality</li>
<li>Raw or Original photos are converted to ‘High Quality’</li>
<li>GPS info is removed from photos metadata</li>
</ul>
<p>Bad, but I could live with that, if treating this as a backup.</p>
<p>There’s also a paid tool <a href="https://photovaultone.com/">https://photovaultone.com/</a> - but it’s just another small vendor lock-in. I’d like to avoid getting deeper into other vendor to be protected from Google.</p>
<h2 id="so-theres-google-takeout">So there’s Google Takeout</h2>
<p>And yet, there’s this Google-offered option, that’s designed as a way to take all your data out of Google Cloud and potentially go to some other vendor, or host that on your own. Great idea! Of course Google, as other BigTech companies was coherced to implement it mainly due to GDPR restrictions - so that any user can take the data he/she owns and move out to other place.
Naturally, I thought I’d use this approach to backup my data.
This seemed even more amazing, as there’s an option to backup directly to other providers - the options are Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, Box.</p>
<p>I thought that using Microsoft OneDrive is a good alternative! Especially in terms of provider diversification. Also, the options of the backup would allow me to create a couple of bigger files - and copying those to my local backup would be much easier then doing so with hundreds of thousands of photos.</p>
<p>Choosing Microsoft OneDrive as an intermediate solution is just using another vendor. But the goal is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>have the data backed up in another cloud</li>
<li>be able to download the data in bigger chunks</li>
</ul>
<p>On the surface, it looks nice. You can create a scheduled backup process - that may happen at specified intervals, or you can do it one-time.
You can select data you want to export - be it just Photos, or maybe whole Google Drive, and Calendar, Gmail. Everything is there.</p>
<p>But when it actually needs to happen - that’s where the issues happen.</p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>the process always fails - no matter what’s the size of a chunk I choose</li>
<li>the logs are kept only for some time, afer 7 days I’m not able to see what happened with the chunks. It’s easy to spot missing files - when you have parts from 1 to 10, but there’s a 7th missing. But what if there are 10 parts but should be 11?</li>
<li>no logs of the process</li>
<li>errors are very cryptic “Failed to backup”</li>
<li>tech support is non-existent - I’ve reached out to the tech support, but they were just passing my issue between different support divisions. Ultimately there were hints like “reinstall your operating system”, “turn it off and on”</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all I don’t see this whole process as <strong>extremely</strong> hard. Also, I totally understand those things may fail. But we, as an industry, know what to do with that. There are retries, informative logging. And here I got none of the above.</p>
<p>So for me, this broadly looks like Google just does not want people to backup their data outside of their cloud, which is super bad!</p>
<h2 id="important-considerations-that-i-may-have-missed">Important considerations that I may have missed</h2>
<p>I share my photo collection with my closest family. I suspect that Google Takeout won’t backup those shared photos. But my purpose <strong>is</strong> to do also copy those.</p>
<p>If I’ll be able to make this process reliable, I’d need to think of data retention on target.</p>
<p>Right now I backup just Google Photos - wanted to move to other parts of the ecosystem, when the backup issues are sorted out.</p>
<h2 id="follow-up-actions">Follow-up actions</h2>
<ul>
<li>try other providers - I don’t want to use Dropbox, but perhaps Box would work better then OneDrive?</li>
<li>are there tools that I’ve missed that might actually work?</li>
<li>schedule separate backup processes for other parts of the data stored in Google - they’ll be smaller and maybe that will result in successful backups</li>
<li>monitor the backup process state - based on target drive contents</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closing-notes">Closing notes</h2>
<p>So, for know I still do the backups. I accept the issues with Google Takeout. It’s just better to have majority of my data, then to not have any of that.</p>
