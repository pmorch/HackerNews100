            <p>By the Brave Web Standards Team</p>
        
    </section>

    <section><p><em>by Peter Snyder, VP of Privacy Engineering and Senior Privacy Researcher</em></p>
<p>Brave strongly opposes Google’s “<a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Environment Integrity</a>” (WEI) proposal. As with many of Google’s recent changes and proposals regarding the Web, “Web Environment Integrity” would move power away from users, and toward large websites, including the websites Google itself runs. Though Brave uses Chromium, Brave browsers do not (and will not) include WEI.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Further, some browsers have introduced other features similar to, though more limited than, WEI (e.g., certain parts of WebAuthn and Privacy Keys); Brave is considering how to best restrict these features without breaking benign uses.</p>
<p>Google’s WEI proposal is frustrating, but it’s not surprising. WEI is simply the latest in Google’s ongoing efforts to prevent browser users from being in control of how they read, interact with, and use the Web. Google’s <a href="https://brave.com/web-standards-at-brave/3-web-bundles/">WebBundles proposal</a> makes it more difficult for users to block or filter out unwanted page content, <a href="https://brave.com/web-standards-at-brave/8-first-party-sets/">Google’s First Party Sets feature</a> makes it more difficult for users to make decisions around which sites can track users, and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s weakening of browser extensions</a> straightforwardly makes it harder for users to be in control of their Web experience by crippling top ad-and-tracker-blocking extensions such as <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uBlock Origin</a>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> This is unfortunately far from a complete list of recent, similar user-harming Web proposals from Google. Again, Brave <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Deviations-from-Chromium-%28features-we-disable-or-remove%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disables or modifies</a> all of these features in Brave’s browsers.</p>
<p>The Web is the world’s most popular, and therefore most important, open system for sharing information and distributing applications. It is critical that users stay in control of how they interact with the Web, and for the Web not to be reduced to a series of take-it-or-leave-it black-boxes that users can’t inspect, can’t understand, and can’t modify. Google’s WEI proposal (like many other Google proposals) intentionally shifts power away from users, and towards large websites and advertisers.</p>
<p>WEI is the latest step in a <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/18-de-amp/">terrible</a> <a href="https://brave.com/web-standards-at-brave/6-privacy-sandbox-concerns/">direction</a> Google is pushing for the Web. Web users deserve a browser that doesn’t treat them as enemies that need to be restricted and controlled.</p>

                <p>The UK CMA (along with other regulators and web activists) are largely evaluating Google’s Privacy Sandbox as an isolated, independent set of features. Evaluations that fail to consider how Privacy Sandbox will interact with other upcoming Google proposals will miss how radical and harmful Privacy Sandbox will be to the Web in practice. This piece presents how Privacy Sandbox, when considered with other upcoming Chrome features, will harm user choice, privacy, and competition on the Web.</p>

<div>
<p>A firm founded by Rishi Sunak’s father-in-law signed a billion-dollar deal with BP two months before the prime minister opened <a href="https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/hundreds-of-new-oil-and-gas-licenses-to-be-granted-to-boost-british-energy-independence-353605/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of new licences </a>for oil and gas extraction in the North Sea.</p>
<p>In May, the <em>Times of India </em><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/infosys-wins-1-5-billion-deal-from-bp/articleshow/100289149.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that Infosys bagged a huge deal from the global energy company which is thought to be the second-largest in the history of the firm. </p>
<p>The Indian IT company is owned by the prime minister’s&nbsp;wife’s family although Sunak has insisted the matter is of “no legitimate public interest”.</p>
<p>It has since come to light that the IT giant has been involved in £172 million worth of public sector contracts in the UK, and even the most innocent bystanders would admit that the current drive to increase oil and gas exploration in the North Sea is more than convenient. </p>
<p>What’s more, it is made even more convenient by the fact that one of Infosys’ other major clients is Shell, whose CEO joined Rishi Sunak’s new business council two weeks ago and promised a “candid collaboration” with his government.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>Sunak has insisted granting new oil and gas licences for the UK was “entirely consistent” with the UK commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</p>
<p>The PM said even then the UK would still need oil and gas for 25 per cent of its energy needs, with the PM saying he was seeking to “power Britain from Britain” rather than the UK “relying on foreign dictators” for its energy supplies.</p>
<p>Speaking about the need for oil and gas, the Prime Minister said: “If we’re going to need it, far better to have it here at home rather than shipping it here from half way around the world with two, three, four times, the amount of carbon emissions versus the oil and gas we have here at home.</p>
<p>“So, it is entirely consistent with our plans to get to net zero.”</p>
<p>But doubts have even <a href="https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/politics/sunaks-claims-that-he-has-boosted-british-energy-independence-put-to-bed-in-viral-video-353678/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been raised</a> about those claims which are expertly set out by Ciaran Jenkins&nbsp;here: </p>

By a 17-point margin, Oregonians approved Ballot Measure 110, which eliminated criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of any drug, including cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. When the policy went into effect early the next year, it lifted the fear of prosecution for the state’s drug users and launched Oregon on an experiment to determine whether a long-sought goal of the drug-policy reform movement—decriminalization—could help solve America’s drug problems.</p><p>Early results of this reform effort, the first of its kind in any state, are now coming into view, and so far, they are not encouraging. State leaders have acknowledged faults with the policy’s implementation and enforcement measures. And Oregon’s drug problems have not improved. Last year, the state experienced one of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm">sharpest rises</a> in overdose deaths in the nation and had one of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/579bd717c534a564c72ea7bf/t/643988bad6f8d913a4f61afc/1681492164612/2022+Annual+Report+-+FINAL+2.pdf">highest percentages</a> of adults with a substance-use disorder. During one two-week period last month, three children under the age of 4 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/news/read.cfm?id=492958">overdosed</a> in Portland after ingesting fentanyl.</p><p>For decades, drug policy in America centered on using law enforcement to target people who sold, possessed, or used drugs—an approach long supported by both Democratic and Republican politicians. Only in recent years, amid an epidemic of opioid overdoses and a national reconsideration of racial inequities in the criminal-justice system, has the drug-policy status quo begun to break down, as a coalition of health workers, criminal-justice-reform advocates, and drug-user activists have lobbied for a more compassionate and nuanced response. The new approach emphasizes reducing overdoses, stopping the spread of infectious disease, and providing drug users with the resources they need—counseling, housing, transportation—to stabilize their lives and gain control over their drug use.</p><p>Oregon’s Measure 110 was viewed as an opportunity to prove that activists’ most groundbreaking idea—sharply reducing the role of law enforcement in the government’s response to drugs—could work. The measure also earmarked hundreds of millions of dollars in cannabis tax revenue for building a statewide treatment network that advocates promised would do what police and prosecutors couldn’t: help drug users stop or reduce their drug use and become healthy, engaged members of their communities. The day after the measure passed, Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, one of the nation’s most prominent drug-policy reform organizations, issued a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230225033031/https:/www.drugpolicy.org/blog/2020elections">statement</a> calling the vote a “historic, paradigm-shifting win” and predicting that Oregon would become “a model and starting point for states across the country to decriminalize drug use.”</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/harm-reduction-decriminalization-fentanyl-meth/674214/">Sam Quinones: America’s approach to addiction has gone off the rails</a></p><p>But three years later, with rising overdoses and delays in treatment funding, even some of the measure’s supporters now believe that the policy needs to be changed. In a nonpartisan statewide <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.dhmresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DHM-Panel-Oregon_Measure110_May-2023.pdf">poll</a> earlier this year, more than 60 percent of respondents blamed Measure 110 for making drug addiction, homelessness, and crime worse. A majority, including a majority of Democrats, said they supported bringing back criminal penalties for drug possession. This year’s legislative session, which ended in late June, saw at least a dozen Measure 110–related proposals from Democrats and Republicans alike, ranging from technical fixes to full restoration of criminal penalties for drug possession. Two significant changes—tighter restrictions on fentanyl and more state oversight of how Measure 110 funding is distributed—passed with bipartisan support.</p><p>Few people consider Measure 110 “a success out of the gate,” Tony Morse, the policy and advocacy director for Oregon Recovers, told me. The organization, which promotes policy solutions to the state’s addiction crisis, initially opposed Measure 110; now it supports funding the policy, though it also wants more state money for in-patient treatment and detox services. As Morse put it, “If you take away the criminal-justice system as a pathway that gets people into treatment, you need to think about what is going to replace it.”</p><p>Many advocates say the new policy simply needs more time to prove itself, even if they also acknowledge that parts of the ballot measure had flaws; advocates worked closely with lawmakers on the oversight bill that passed last month. “We’re building the plane as we fly it,” Haven Wheelock, a program supervisor at a homeless-services provider in Portland who helped put Measure 110 on the ballot, told me. “We tried the War on Drugs for 50 years, and it didn’t work … It hurts my heart every time someone says we need to repeal this before we even give it a chance.”</p><div><figure><picture><img alt="Workers from the organization Central City Concern hand out Narcan in Portland, Oregon, on April 5." loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 729px) 655px, (min-width: 576px) calc(100vw - 48px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/oFnNMYa1dWWMhRqjiZByrVZtyK0=/0x0:4800x2700/655x368/media/img/posts/2023/07/B20F13B9_FB9E_4311_8CB9_0ACE9AEC5CA2/original.jpg 655w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/_-YZv1UpyypXHxmzmKAgoCajYfM=/0x0:4800x2700/750x421/media/img/posts/2023/07/B20F13B9_FB9E_4311_8CB9_0ACE9AEC5CA2/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/9NqimZZKVYTXjnw1W02Fxs36OV8=/0x0:4800x2700/850x478/media/img/posts/2023/07/B20F13B9_FB9E_4311_8CB9_0ACE9AEC5CA2/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/332T6MsBYniDp-0FSlwA9URDFCY=/0x0:4800x2700/928x521/media/img/posts/2023/07/B20F13B9_FB9E_4311_8CB9_0ACE9AEC5CA2/original.jpg 928w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/qYtJMMAWrkrXyOHrb8KCpv-6yUc=/0x0:4800x2700/1310x736/media/img/posts/2023/07/B20F13B9_FB9E_4311_8CB9_0ACE9AEC5CA2/original.jpg 1310w" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/oFnNMYa1dWWMhRqjiZByrVZtyK0=/0x0:4800x2700/655x368/media/img/posts/2023/07/B20F13B9_FB9E_4311_8CB9_0ACE9AEC5CA2/original.jpg" width="655" height="368"></picture><figcaption>Workers from the organization Central City Concern hand out Narcan in Portland, Oregon, on April 5. (Jordan Gale)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Measure 110 went into effect at a time of dramatic change in U.S. drug policy. Departing from precedent, the Biden administration has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/National-Drug-Control-2022Strategy.pdf">endorsed</a> and increased federal funding for a public-health strategy called harm reduction; rather than pushing for abstinence, harm reduction emphasizes keeping drug users safe—for instance, through the distribution of clean syringes and overdose-reversal medications. The term <em>harm reduction</em> appeared five times in the ballot <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sos.oregon.gov/admin/Documents/irr/2020/044text.pdf">text</a> of Measure 110, which forbids funding recipients from “mandating abstinence.”</p><p>Matt Sutton, the director of external relations for the Drug Policy Alliance, which helped write Measure 110 and spent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://secure.sos.state.or.us/orestar/gotoPublicTransactionSearchResults.do?cneSearchButtonName=prev&amp;cneSearchFilerCommitteeId=20089&amp;cneSearchContributorTxtSearchType=C&amp;cneSearchFilerCommitteeTxtSearchType=C&amp;srtOrder=asc&amp;by=NAME&amp;cneSearchPageIdx=">more than $5 million</a> to pass it, told me that reform advocates viewed the measure as the start of a nationwide decriminalization push. The effort started in Oregon because the state had been an early adopter of marijuana legalization and is considered a drug-policy-reform leader. Success would mean showing the rest of the country that “people did think we should invest in a public-health approach instead of criminalization,” Sutton said.</p><p>To achieve this goal, Measure 110 enacted two major changes to Oregon’s drug laws. First, minor drug possession was downgraded from a misdemeanor to a violation, similar to a traffic ticket. Under the new law, users caught with up to 1 gram of heroin or methamphetamine, or up to 40 oxycodone pills, are charged a $100 fine, which can be waived if they call a treatment-referral hotline. (Selling, trafficking, and possessing large amounts of drugs remain criminal offenses in Oregon.) Second, the law set aside a portion of state cannabis tax revenue every two years to fund a statewide network of harm-reduction and other services. A grant-making panel was created to oversee the funding process. At least six members of the panel were required to be directly involved in providing services to drug users; at least two had to be active or former drug users themselves; and three were to be “members of communities that have been disproportionately impacted” by drug criminalization, according to the ballot measure.</p><p>Backers of Measure 110 said the law was modeled on drug policies in Portugal, where personal drug possession was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/drugs-library/portugals-national-drug-strategy-1999-english-version_en">decriminalized</a> two decades ago. But Oregon’s enforcement-and-treatment-referral system differs from Portugal’s. Users caught with drugs in Portugal are referred to a civil commission that evaluates their drug use and recommends treatment if needed, with civil sanctions for noncompliance. Portugal’s state-run health system also funds a nationwide network of treatment services, many of which focus on sobriety. Sutton said drafters of Measure 110 wanted to avoid anything that might resemble a criminal tribunal or coercing drug users into treatment. “People respond best when they’re ready to access those services in a voluntary way,” he said.</p><p>Almost immediately after taking effect, Measure 110 encountered problems. A state <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sos.oregon.gov/audits/Documents/2023-03.pdf">audit</a> published this year found that the new law was “vague” about how state officials should oversee the awarding of money to new treatment programs, and set “unrealistic timelines” for evaluating and funding treatment proposals. As a result, the funding process was left largely to the grant-making panel, most of whose members “lacked experience in designing, evaluating and administrating a governmental-grant-application process,” according to the audit. Last year, supporters of Measure 110<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelundreport.org/content/people-are-dying-while-state-bureaucracy-holds-treatment-dollars-say-measure-110-proponents"> accused</a> state health officials, preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, of giving the panel insufficient direction and resources to handle a flood of grant applications. The state health authority <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2021I1/Downloads/CommitteeMeetingDocument/255650">acknowledged missteps</a> in the grant-making process.</p><p>The audit described a chaotic process, with more than a dozen canceled meetings, potential conflicts of interest in the selection of funding recipients, and lines of applicant evaluations left blank. Full distribution of the first biennial payout of cannabis tax revenue—$302 million for harm reduction, housing, and other services—did not occur until late 2022, almost two years after Measure 110 passed. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiODU1NDNlNzUtMDBkNy00NTM1LWE4NzgtNGEyNzQxYWY0NTU2IiwidCI6IjY1OGU2M2U4LThkMzktNDk5Yy04ZjQ4LTEzYWRjOTQ1MmY0YyJ9&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">Figures</a> released by the state last month show that, in the second half of 2022, recipients of Measure 110 funding provided some form of service to roughly 50,000 “clients,” though <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelundreport.org/content/more-people-accessing-help-under-measure-110-gaps-services-data-remain">the Oregon Health Authority has said</a> that a single individual could be counted multiple times in that total. (A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelundreport.org/sites/default/files/OHSU%20-%20Oregon%20Gap%20Analysis%20and%20Inventory%20Report.pdf">study</a> released last year by public-health researchers in Oregon found that, as of 2020, more than 650,000 Oregonians required, but were not receiving, treatment for a substance-use disorder.)</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/05/nikki-king-opioid-treatment-program/609085/">From the May 2020 issue: America’s other epidemic</a></p><p>Meanwhile, the new law’s enforcement provisions have proved ineffectual. Of 5,299 drug-possession cases filed in Oregon circuit courts since Measure 110 went into effect, 3,381 resulted in a recipient failing to pay the fine or appear in court and facing no further penalties, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.courts.oregon.gov/about/Documents/BM110Statistics.pdf">according to</a> the Oregon Judicial Department; about 1,300 tickets were dismissed or are pending. The state audit found that, during its first 15 months in operation, the treatment-referral hotline received just 119 calls, at a cost to the state of $7,000 per call. A<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1114&amp;context=ccj_fac"> survey</a> of law-enforcement officers conducted by researchers at Portland State University found that, as of July 2022, officers were issuing an average of just 300 drug-possession tickets a month statewide, compared with 600 drug-possession arrests a month before Measure 110 took effect and close to 1,200 monthly arrests prior to the outbreak of COVID-19.</p><p>“Focusing on these tickets even though they’ll be ineffective—it’s not a great use of your resources,” Sheriff Nate Sickler of Jackson County, in the rural southern part of the state, told me of his department’s approach.</p><p>Advocates have celebrated a<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1114&amp;context=ccj_fac"> plunge in arrests</a>. “For reducing arrests of people of color, it’s been an overwhelming success,” says Mike Marshall, the director of Oregon Recovers. But critics say that sidelining law enforcement has made it harder to persuade some drug users to stop using. Sickler cited the example of drug-court programs, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/504">which</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/125"> multiple</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/93"> studies</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/128"> have</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/478"> shown</a> to be<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/597"> highly</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/69"> effective</a>, including in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/115">Jackson County</a>. Use of such programs in the county has declined in the absence of criminal prosecution, Sickler said: “Without accountability or the ability to drive a better choice, these individuals are left to their own demise.”</p><p>The consequences of Measure 110’s shortcomings have fallen most heavily on Oregon’s drug users. In the two years after the law took effect, the number of annual overdoses in the state rose by 61 percent, compared with a 13 percent increase nationwide, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm">according to</a> the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In neighboring Idaho and California, where drug possession remains subject to prosecution, the rate of increase was significantly lower than Oregon’s. (The spike in Washington State was similar to Oregon’s, but that comparison is more complicated because Washington’s drug policy has fluctuated since 2021.) Other states once notorious for drug deaths, including West Virginia, Indiana, and Arkansas, are now experiencing declines in overdose rates.</p><p>In downtown Portland this spring, police cleared out what <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2023/04/portland-police-clear-out-washington-center-open-air-drug-market-in-early-morning-mission.html"><em>The Oregonian </em>called</a> an “open-air drug market” in a former retail center. Prominent businesses in the area, including the outdoor-gear retailer REI, have announced closures in recent months, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://oregonbusiness.com/rei-announces-closure-of-portland-store/">in part citing</a> a rise in shoplifting and violence. Earlier this year, Portland business owners<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2023/03/01/a-familiar-fight-between-businesses-and-county-officials-over-homeless-services-plays-out-in-portlands-hotel-district/"> appeared</a> before the Multnomah County Commission to ask for help with crime, drug-dealing, and other problems stemming from a behavioral-health resource center operated by a harm-reduction nonprofit that was awarded more than $4 million in Measure 110 funding. In April, the center abruptly closed following employee complaints that clients were covering walls with graffiti and overdosing on-site. A subsequent<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.multco.us/multnomah-county/news/behavioral-health-resource-center-reopens-after-undergoing-security-building"> investigation</a> by the nonprofit found that a security contractor had been using cocaine on the job. The center reopened two weeks later with beefed-up security measures.</p><p>Portland’s Democratic mayor, Ted Wheeler, went so far as to attempt an end run around Measure 110 in his city. Last month, Wheeler unveiled a proposal to criminalize public drug consumption in Portland, similar to existing bans on open-air drinking, saying in a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.portland.gov/wheeler/documents/full-statement-ordinance/download">statement</a> that Measure 110 “is not working as it was intended to.” He added, “Portland’s substance-abuse problems have exploded to deadly and disastrous proportions.” Wheeler withdrew the proposal days later after learning that an older state law prohibits local jurisdictions from banning public drug use.</p><p>Despite shifting public opinion on Measure 110, many Oregon leaders are not ready to give up on the policy. Earlier this month, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek signed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2023R1/Measures/Overview/HB2513">legislation</a> that strengthens state oversight of Measure 110 and requires an audit, due no later than December 2025, of about two dozen aspects of the measure’s performance, including whether it is reducing overdoses. Other bills passed by the legislature’s Democratic majority strengthened criminal penalties for possession of large quantities of fentanyl and mandated that school drug-prevention programs instruct students about the risks of synthetic opioids. Republican proposals to repeal Measure 110 outright or claw back tens of millions of dollars in harm-reduction funding were not enacted.</p><p>The fallout from Measure 110 has received some critical coverage from media outlets on the right. “It is predictable,” a scholar from the Hudson Institute <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-drug-decriminalization-effort-tragedy">told Fox News</a>. “It is a tragedy and a self-inflicted wound.” (Meanwhile, in Portugal, the model for Oregon, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/07/portugal-drugs-decriminalization-heroin-crack/">some residents are raising questions</a> about their own nation’s decriminalization policy.) But so far Oregon’s experience doesn’t appear to have stopped efforts to bring decriminalization to other parts of the United States. “We’ll see more ballot initiatives,” Sutton, of the Drug Policy Alliance, said, adding that advocates are currently working with city leaders to decriminalize drugs in Washington, D.C.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-2" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 3" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="3"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/01/naloxone-stronger-form-opioid-overdose/621254/">Read: An anti-overdose drug is getting stronger. Maybe that’s a bad thing?</a></p><p>Supporters of Measure 110 are now seeking to draw attention to what they say are the policy’s overlooked positive effects. This summer, the Health Justice Recovery Alliance, a Measure 110 advocacy organization, is leading an effort to spotlight expanded treatment services and boost community awareness of the treatment-referral hotline. Advocates are also coordinating with law-enforcement agencies to ensure that officers know about local resources for drug users. “People are hiring for their programs; outreach programs are expanding, offering more services,” Devon Downeysmith, the communications director for the group, told me.</p><p>An array of services around the state have been expanded through the policy: housing for pregnant women awaiting drug treatment; culturally specific programs for Black, Latino, and Indigenous drug users; and even distribution of bicycle helmets to people unable to drive to treatment meetings. “People often forget how much time it takes to spend a bunch of money and build services,” said Wheelock, the homeless-services worker, whose organization received more than $2 million in funding from Measure 110.</p><p>Still, even some recipients of Measure 110 funding wonder whether one of the law’s pillars—the citation system that was supposed to help route drug users into treatment—needs to be rethought. “Perhaps some consequences might be a helpful thing,” says Julia Pinsky, a co-founder of Max’s Mission, a harm-reduction nonprofit in southern Oregon. Max’s Mission has received $1.5 million from Measure 110, enabling the organization to hire new staff, open new offices, and serve more people. Pinsky told me she is proud of her organization’s work and remains committed to the idea that “you shouldn’t have to go to prison to be treated for substance use.” She said that she doesn’t want drug use to “become a felony,” but that some people aren’t capable of stopping drug use on their own. “They need additional help.”</p><p>Brandi Fogle, a regional manager for Max’s Mission, says her own story illustrates the complex trade-offs involved in reforming drug policy. Three and a half years ago, she was a homeless drug user, addicted to heroin and drifting around Jackson and Josephine Counties. Although she tried to stop numerous times, including one six-month period during which she was prescribed the drug-replacement medication methadone, she told me that a 2020 arrest for drug possession was what finally turned her life around. She asked to be enrolled in a 19-month drug-court program that included residential treatment, mandatory 12-step meetings, and a community-service project, and ultimately was hired by Pinsky.</p><p>Since Measure 110 went into effect, Fogle said, she has gotten pushback from members of the community for the work Max’s Mission does. She said that both the old system of criminal justice and the new system of harm reduction can benefit drug users, but that her hope now is to make the latter approach more successful. “Everyone is different,” Fogle said. “Drug court worked for me because I chose it, and I wouldn’t have needed drug court in the first place if I had received the kind of services Max’s Mission provides. I want to offer people that chance.”</p><hr><p><small><em>This article originally suggested that REI’</em><em>s store in Portland had closed; it is scheduled to close early next year.</em></small></p></section><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>]]></description>

<p>The city attorney of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham,_North_Carolina" title="Durham, North Carolina">Durham, North Carolina</a> attempted to coax the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) to reveal the identities of three editors and to prohibit the placement of certain verifiable and truthful content on Wikipedia pages of city officials, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://indyweek.com/news/durham-officials-directed-city-attorney-to-try-to-unmask-anonymous-wikipedia-editors/"><i>Indy Week</i></a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/durham-county/article277624088.html"><i>The News and Observer</i></a> report.
</p><p>A letter, dated June 29, outlined three complaints about content on Wikipedia. Two of the complaints pertained to coverage of a council member's alleged attempted extortion of a developer, while the third related to an image depicting the signature of mayor of Durham.

<p>Recent months have been a tumultuous time for Durham's seven-member city council. In March, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_M._O%27Neal" title="Elaine M. O'Neal">Elaine M.

In the aftermath of these incidents, O'Neal <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/durham-county/article276653196.html">announced</a> that she would not seek re-election as Mayor and a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/durham-county/article273656055.html">state investigation</a> was opened into the extortion allegation (Holsey-Hyman <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/voter-guide/article276872203.html">denies</a> the alleged extortion attempt and a separate <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/durham-county/article273507350.html">allegation</a> that she ordered city employees to perform campaign work on her behalf).

</p><p>Several figures have publicly expressed concerns about the sending of the letter. Barry Saunders, a member of the editorial board of <i>The News and Observer</i>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/article277773328.html">wrote</a> that, "[u]nless the Wikipedia posts were egregiously wrong—and there’s no evidence that they were—the three Durham officials should have taken a page, when it came to criticism, from the title of the 1970s hit by the band Bachman-Turner Overdrive: let it ride... Few voters, though, will forgive attempts to silence critics". 
</p><p>Duke University law professor Stuart Benjamin was taken aback by the letter. He told <i>The News and Observer</i>, "I understand why public officials do not want unflattering information published about them, but it is deeply troubling that any public official tried to unmask someone who posted this accurate information."
</p><p>David Larson, opinion editor of <i>The Carolina Journal</i>, concurs. "[T]his attempt to intimidate anonymous people online for daring to discuss real but unflattering details of your political service is the stuff of dysfunctional regimes", he <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/opinion/durhams-attempt-to-intimidate-wikipedia-over-unflattering-pages-backfires/">wrote</a>.
</p><p>The WMF, for its part, told <i>Indy Week</i> that it is "strongly committed to protecting the privacy of editors and users on Wikimedia projects".
</p><p>The letter, signed by city attorney Kimberly Rehberg, also states that she had removed the image of the signature from the Wikipedia article about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_M._O%27Neal" title="Elaine M. O'Neal">Elaine M. O'Neal</a> on June 28. This checks out; that article <i>was</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1162379330" title="Special:Diff/1162379330">edited on that day</a> by a user named <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Kimlynn69">Kimlynn69</a></span>, and Kimlynn69 wrote a message to <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Johnson524">Johnson524</a></span> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1167184345#Signature_of_Elaine_M._O'Neal,_Mayor,_City_of_Durham,_NC" title="Special:PermanentLink/1167184345">identified herself</a> as "Kimberly M. Rehberg" and as the city attorney of Durham. Like it did for the editors who touched content relating to the scandal of the March 23 meeting, the letter had also requested Johnson524's name and identity as well.
</p><p>In response to Rehberg's message, Johnson524 explained that he had obtained the signature from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_Performing_Arts_Center" title="Durham Performing Arts Center">Durham Performing Arts Center</a> playbills. <i>Indy Week</i> reports that, following Johnson's reply to the message, Rehberg said in an email "there is little legal basis to demand that Wiki reveal the identity of the User or prohibit the upload of a photo of the signature to the Mayor’s Wiki page".
</p><p>The mayor, per an email obtained by <i>Indy Week</i>, was unsatisfied with Rehberg's reply. O'Neal told Rehberg that her request to send the letter to the WMF "still stands"; Rehberg said in an email sent later that day that the letter had been sent. Despite this, the letter may have never actually arrived at its intended destination. The WMF told <i>Indy Week</i> that they had not received the letter and that the letter that had been made public contained an incorrect postal address for the WMF's headquarters. Rehberg, meanwhile, told <i>Indy Week</i> that the letter had only been sent by physical mail.
</p><p><i>The Signpost</i> reached out to Johnson524 following the publication of Rehberg's letter. "I was so happy to see an outpouring of support from the Wikipedia community from editors who have been around longer than I have," he wrote: "I have always valued that Wikimedia has also never succumbed to external powers—and has continued to fight for a world of free information: whether that be not to take down/severely censor their project in Russia, to campaign for those jailed editors in Saudi Arabia, or even just go against unjust decisions by local governments here in the U.S.".
</p><p>He remained, however, displeased with the mayor's handling of the situation. "I would have even put it past the mayor Elaine O'Neal if she went back on her statement after I explained how I got the signature publicly, but since she doubled down on her attempt to try to 'unmask' me and two other editors after without really any prior contact, I am glad she will not be running for mayor again, because I don't think how this situation was handled was right at all", he wrote. – <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Red-tailed_hawk" title="User:Red-tailed hawk">R</a></span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mvp-content-main">
<p>The U.S. Senate has approved a large-scale defense bill that includes provisions to bar intelligence agencies like the CIA and NSA from denying security clearances to applicants solely due to their past marijuana use.</p>
<p>Senators adopted a number of amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) on Thursday before approving the overall legislation. That included attaching the full text of the separate Intelligence Authorization Act, which was itself previously <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/senate-panel-votes-to-let-people-whove-used-marijuana-work-at-intelligence-agencies-like-cia-and-nsa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amended in committee last month to include the cannabis provision</a> from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR).</p>
<p>Previously, the senator filed a broader amendment to last year’s version of the authorization legislation that would have prevented employment discrimination based on prior or present cannabis use at any federal department, not just those dealing with intelligence.</p>
<p>But the provision was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/key-senate-committee-chairman-scaled-back-marijuana-amendment-on-security-clearance-denials-to-secure-passing-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scaled back under a second-degree amendment</a> from the committee chairman before being adopted by the panel. And then the reform was ultimately quashed altogether <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/gop-senators-block-marijuana-security-clearance-protections-in-defense-bill-amendment-prompting-sponsor-to-file-broader-measures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when two GOP senators objected to attaching</a> the intelligence bill to the NDAA on the floor if it included the marijuana language.</p>
<p>But that level of pushback did not happen this year, and now the full Senate has <a href="https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/senate-amendment/1087" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed off</a> on protecting people from losing security clearances because of prior marijuana use.</p>
<p>“Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the head of an element of the intelligence community may not make a determination to deny eligibility for access to classified information to an individual based solely on the use of cannabis by the individual prior to the submission of the application for a security clearance by the individual,” the newly approved provision says.</p>
<p>Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), who cosponsored the reform in committee along with Wyden and Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM), said in a <a href="https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=B07CA7B8-AA42-43F4-899E-D6A077E78B10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> that it will “modernize workforce recruitment by prohibiting intelligence community agencies from denying a security clearance to individuals based solely on past use of cannabis.”</p>
<p>A newly published Senate Intelligence Committee report on the larger legislation shows that the panel <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/publications/intelligence-authorization-act-fiscal-year-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> the marijuana provision by a party-line vote of 10 to 7 last month.</p>
<p>“As more states legalize cannabis, it becomes less and less tenable to deny security clearances to those who have used it,” Wyden said in remarks inserted into the report. “The amendment…will help the Intelligence Community recruit the qualified personnel needed to protect the country.”</p>
<p>The senator had also filed a separate broader amendment in committee that would have “prohibited the head of any U.S. Government agency from denying an individual’s eligibility for access to classified information based solely on the individual’s cannabis use prior to submitting a security clearance application,” but ultimately withdrew it without a vote, the report says.</p>
<p>The White House on Thursday issued a statement of administration policy that <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/S2226-NDAA-SAP-Followon.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expresses</a> concerns with several provisions of the NDAA legislation, but is silent on the cannabis language.</p>
<p>House intelligence legislation, meanwhile, has cleared committee in that chamber but has not yet come up for floor consideration—and at this point contains no cannabis provisions.</p>
<p>The Senate-approved discretionary policy change was <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/democratic-congressman-hopes-for-very-bipartisan-support-on-marijuana-security-clearance-and-military-reform-amendments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less far reaching than a related amendment</a> that Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) tried to attach to the House version of the NDAA that would have prevented the denial of security clearances for federal jobs based solely on prior cannabis use—but was ultimately not made in order for floor consideration by the Rules Committee, nor were <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/gop-controlled-house-committee-blocks-every-marijuana-and-psychedelics-amendment-to-defense-bill-from-getting-floor-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than a dozen other drug policy reform proposals</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear if efforts to attach similar provisions will be made, or whether they will succeed, when the separate intelligence bill comes before the House Rules Committee.</p>
<p>There were <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/senators-seek-to-legalize-medical-marijuana-for-veterans-and-enact-other-cannabis-reforms-through-defense-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other marijuana-related amendments</a> proposed for the Senate NDAA this round, including a proposal to legalize medical cannabis for military veterans, but they also were not ultimately considered.</p>
<p>Wyden also sought to revise the defense bill with a separate amendment to make it so prior use of marijuana “may be relevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of the eligibility of the individual for access to classified information or the eligibility of the individual to hold a sensitive position.” But that did not advance either.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the House side, bipartisan lawmakers filed a standalone bill on Thursday to <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-agencies-couldnt-refuse-to-hire-people-because-of-marijuana-use-under-new-congressional-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protect people from being denied federal employment or security clearances due to marijuana use</a>—and to provide relief for people who lost opportunities due to cannabis in the past.</p>

<p>The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a memo in 2021 saying that federal employers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/top-federal-intelligence-official-loosens-marijuana-restrictions-for-workers-and-addresses-cannabis-stocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shouldn’t outright reject security clearance applicants</a>&nbsp;over past use and should also use discretion when it comes to those with cannabis investments in their stock portfolios.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Secret Service (USSS)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/u-s-secret-service-loosens-rules-on-past-marijuana-use-by-prospective-agents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently updated its employment policy to be more accommodating</a>&nbsp;to applicants who’ve previously used marijuana, making it so candidates of any age become eligible one year after they last consumed cannabis. Previously, there were stricter age-based restrictions.</p>
<p>The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-law-enforcement-agency-says-state-legal-marijuana-activity-will-no-longer-automatically-disqualify-job-applicants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revised its cannabis rules for job applicants</a>. Applicants who’ve grown, manufactured or sold marijuana in compliance with state laws while serving in a “position of public responsibility” will no longer be automatically disqualified.</p>
<p>FBI updated its hiring policies in 2020 to make it so candidates are only automatically disqualified from joining the agency if they&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/fbi-loosens-marijuana-employment-policy-for-would-be-agents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admit to having used marijuana within one year</a>&nbsp;of applying. Previously, prospective employees of the agency could not have used cannabis within the past three years.</p>

<p>Late last year, draft documents obtained by Marijuana Moment showed that the federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was proposing to replace a series of job application forms for prospective workers in a way that would&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/new-federal-job-applications-wont-ask-about-most-marijuana-use-unless-it-was-within-the-past-90-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treat past cannabis use much more leniently</a>&nbsp;than under current policy.</p>
<p>The Biden administration instituted a policy in 2021 authorizing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-use-wont-automatically-block-people-from-federal-jobs-biden-administration-memo-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waivers to be granted to certain workers</a>&nbsp;who admit to prior marijuana use, but certain lawmakers have pushed for additional reform.</p>
<p>A recent survey found that 30 percent of those between the ages of 18 and 30&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/one-in-four-young-adults-say-federal-marijuana-employment-policies-prevent-them-from-applying-for-government-jobs-survey-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have either declined to apply or withdrawn applications</a>&nbsp;for federal jobs because of strict marijuana policies required for security clearances.</p>

                    <p>This February, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki published a <a href="https://echa.europa.eu/-/echa-publishes-pfas-restriction-proposal" data-track="click" data-label="https://echa.europa.eu/-/echa-publishes-pfas-restriction-proposal" data-track-category="body text link">proposal that could lead to the world’s largest-ever clampdown on chemicals production</a>. The plan, put forward by environmental agencies in five countries — Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden — would heavily restrict the manufacture of more than 12,000 substances, collectively known as forever chemicals.</p><p>These chemicals, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), are all around us. They coat non-stick cookware, smartphone screens, weatherproof clothing and stain-resistant textiles.

</figure><p>PFASs are extraordinarily useful. Their fluorine-swaddled carbon chains let grease and water slide off textiles, and they protect industrial equipment from corrosion and heat damage. But their strong carbon–fluorine bonds cannot be broken apart by natural processes. So after PFASs escape from factories, homes and vehicles into the environment<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>, they add to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00441-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00441-1" data-track-category="body text link">forever-growing pollution problem</a>. The February proposal estimates that tens of thousands of tonnes of these chemicals escape annually in Europe alone.</p><p>Several PFASs are now known to be toxic. They have been linked to cancers and damage to immune systems, and are now banned under national and international laws. Most PFASs, however, have not yet undergone toxicology assessments or been linked to health harms. But officials at the agencies that submitted the plan to the ECHA say their persistence means they will inevitably build up until as-yet unknown safe thresholds are crossed.</p><p>“We see that there is an unacceptable risk now,” says Richard Luit, a policy adviser at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in Bilthoven.</p><p>There’s no prospect of an instant ban. The ECHA is consulting on the idea before it takes a position. European legislators are unlikely to have a plan to vote on before 2025, and even the current proposal offers grace periods — of more than a decade in some cases — to allow manufacturers to develop alternative materials or systems. Several permanent exemptions are also offered (including for fluorinated drugs, such as Prozac, and for materials used to calibrate scientific instruments).</p><p>But taken as a whole, the idea is to shrink PFAS use to a minimum. “We are asking society to make quite a shift,” says Luit. “We are asking to reverse all of it, go back to the drawing table and invent alternative solutions.”</p><p>Change is already under way for consumer use of PFASs. The notoriety of the toxic examples has pushed more than 100 companies and brands, including Apple, to pledge to phase out PFASs, even before it’s clear whether other materials can do the same job.</p><p>For industrial users, however, the idea of life without PFASs is a more shocking prospect. So February’s proposal has ignited debate about which uses of fluorinated chemicals the world could leave behind — and which must stay.</p><h2><b>Three forms of forever</b></h2><p>A peculiarity with fluorinated compounds, researchers say, is that some kill, whereas others are safe enough for use in medical products. “Fluorine compounds are really, really, incredibly strange in this regard,” says Mark McLinden, a chemical engineer at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado. “Certain fluorine compounds are incredibly toxic. And then you have things like [the gas] R134a, which is benign enough that you’re shooting it directly into your lungs in asthma inhalers”.</p><p>Forever chemicals come in three distinct forms (see ‘Fluorinated world’). The notoriously toxic kinds are fluorosurfactants. These molecules resemble those in soap, made of two parts: carbon chains with fluorine atoms wrapped around them, that repel everything, and a water-loving portion at one end of the chains that allows the molecules to dissolve in water.</p><figure>

</figure><p>After some of these molecules were linked to serious health harms and widespread water pollution, individual substances were banned or severely restricted internationally: first PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) in 2009, then PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) in 2019, and, last year, PFHxS (perfluorohexanesulfonic acid). Manufacturers have moved on to other fluorosurfactants, many of which lack toxicity studies.</p><p>The February proposal suggests phasing out all the fluorosurfactants at once to avoid “regrettable” substitutions, says Jona Schulze, a staff scientist at the German Environment Agency in Dessau-Roßlau.</p><p>But the proposal goes further than that. The five agencies behind it have adopted the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s definition of PFASs: any molecule with a carbon atom in a chain that’s bonded to two fluorine atoms (or, if at the end of the chain, three). Restrictions under this expansive definition cover the other two kinds of forever chemicals.</p><p>There are the fluoropolymers, the plastic-like form that most consumers encounter. The most famous example is Teflon, or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), long carbon chains wrapped in fluorine atoms. A Teflon-based coating makes frying pans non-stick; in medical products, it helps catheters to glide through the body, safeguards implants from deterioration, and, coated on the inside of bottles and blister packs, prevents drugs from interacting with their glass or foil containers. Stain-resistant textiles use a variant of this structure, in which fluorine-wrapped side chains hang off a main carbon chain.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The third category of PFASs is made up of small, light fluorocarbon molecules that generally exist as gases or liquids. R134a, the asthma-inhaler propellant, is also a common refrigerant in refrigerators and mobile air-conditioning systems, for instance. Sensitive equipment that is prone to overheating, such as servers in a data centre, can be submerged in fluorocarbon fluids that cool the apparatus without shorting its circuits or running the risk of fire.</p><p>Although fluoropolymers and fluorocarbons haven’t been shown to harm consumers directly, the problems come when they’re produced and when their useful lives end. Fluoropolymers are created using toxic fluorosurfactants, which pollute water and soil around fluoropolymer plants worldwide. Some researchers also suspect that fluoropolymers might, during their long lifetimes, shed fragments small enough to be ingested, as is known to happen with microplastics (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01143-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01143-3" data-track-category="body text link"><i>Nature</i> <b>593</b>, 22–25; 2021</a>). As for the fluorocarbons, some are powerful greenhouse gases, and others break up into a small-molecule PFAS that is now accumulating in water.</p><p>“If no action is taken, at some point the societal costs due to continued use are likely to exceed the costs which are now associated with their restriction,” says Schulze.</p><h2><b>The electric-car conundrum</b></h2><p>To see all three forms of PFAS in one product, look no further than cars. Their air-conditioning systems use a fluorocarbon refrigerant, the hydraulic fluids usually contain fluorosurfactant additives that prevent corrosion, the painted chassis probably has a weatherproof fluoropolymer coating, and the seats are usually covered in a stain-resistant fluorinated textile.</p><p>Electric vehicles are even more reliant on fluoromaterials because of their lithium-ion batteries. These batteries get their high energy density, and therefore range, by operating at relatively high voltages, explains Gao Liu, a chemist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California. The metallic content in their cathodes is usually a powder that must be bound together with a material that can withstand the high voltage. In the 1990s, that was PTFE; today, battery makers use a cheaper fluoropolymer called polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), containing half the fluorine.</p><figure>

</figure><p>Smaller fluorinated molecules have become crucial, too. Adding them to battery electrolytes allows a protective layer of lithium fluoride to form on the electrodes, improving performance and extending lifetime by preventing cracks, says Cheng Zhang, a chemist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. This area has become a battleground for battery manufacturers, who are developing cocktails of fluorinated additives.</p><p>Liu has developed a fluorine-free binder, but it works only for a lower-voltage battery such as one based on lithium iron phosphate. These batteries do have advantages: they last longer and don’t use critical minerals such as cobalt, nickel or manganese, important factors to consider as battery production ramps up in the fight against climate change, Liu says. But even though lithium iron phosphate batteries would work for stationary storage and already power half of Chinese electric vehicles, they might not be cost-effective for long-range vehicles.</p><p>“The whole field needs to look into better chemistries,” says Liu. “The reason we switch to batteries is to protect the environment. It doesn’t make sense to invent something that’s dirtier than before.”</p><h2><b>The hydrogen economy</b></h2><p>The push for clean energy involves fluoromaterials on another front: building the hydrogen economy. Central to this effort are electrolysers that generate ‘green’ hydrogen by splitting water, powered by renewable electricity.</p><p>The fluctuations of wind and sun favour a type of electrolyser that uses a proton-exchange membrane system (PEM). Such systems can ramp up and down quickly, unlike an older, well-established electrolyser for splitting water. As the name suggests, PEMs involve membranes that control the movement of protons (that is, positively charged hydrogen ions) between electrodes. Fluorinated materials are favoured for the membrane because they can tolerate the acidic operating conditions.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Seeking to enter green hydrogen production, the fluorochemicals manufacturer Chemours this January announced a US$200-million expansion in France to produce more of its fluorinated Nafion membrane. (Nafion is currently used for the valuable chlor-alkali process, which splits brine into chlorine and sodium hydroxide, products that in turn are used in half of all industrial chemical processes.)</p><p>But PFASs aren’t necessary for green hydrogen: an emerging alternative to PEMs involves systems that instead move negatively charged hydroxide ions across membranes in an alkaline environment, says Benjamin Britton, a chemist who co-founded the start-up Ionomr Innovations in Vancouver, Canada. Ionomr is among firms creating non-fluorinated membranes for such anion-exchange systems<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>.</p><p>It could prove harder to replace Nafion in the chlor-alkali process, however: there, fluorinated membranes are better than other materials at withstanding corrosive chlorine attack. Still, some researchers are studying whether this process can work without membranes at all.</p><h2><b>The refrigeration battle</b></h2><p>By far the largest source of PFAS emissions comprises the light fluorocarbon gases. Their main application is as refrigerants. Although ammonia, an early refrigerant, is still used for industrial applications, it was fluorinated compounds, specifically chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), that brought air conditioning and refrigeration to the masses. That’s because, unlike ammonia, they are not irritants and they are non-flammable, says McLinden.</p><figure>

</figure><p>CFCs were phased out because they deplete atmospheric ozone, and were replaced by hydrofluorocarbons such as R134a. But these are greenhouse gases — and so there is an ongoing switch to hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs)<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>. These contain a double bond between two carbon atoms, a link that’s susceptible to attack by atmospheric compounds, which helps these molecules to break apart in weeks.</p><p>Problem solved? Not exactly. Environmental scientists and officials are now advocating the phasing out of HFOs because those molecules break up in the atmosphere to form a PFAS called trifluoroacetic acid or TFA. Karsten Nödler, an analytical chemist at the German Water Centre in Karlsruhe, says that although TFA has not been linked to any health issues, its accumulation warrants concern because it is extraordinarily difficult to remove from water. Should the time come when a clean-up is required, the only option will be reverse osmosis, an expensive technique of last resort.</p><p>Other than ammonia, the fluorine-free refrigerant options are hydrocarbons, which are flammable, or carbon dioxide, which suffers efficiency losses, especially in hot weather when cooling is needed most, McLinden says. European refrigerators already use hydrocarbons, but these substances might pose too great a fire risk in large air-conditioning systems, for example. Air conditioners for small residences have become safe enough for hydrocarbons, argues Audun Heggelund, a senior adviser to the Norwegian Environmental Agency in Oslo. The February proposal gives the air-conditioning industry 12 years to switch to hydrocarbons, but it grants a permanent exemption where safety codes prohibit the use of flammable refrigerants.</p><p>McLinden suggests that a common-sense approach is to crack down on leaks. Refrigerants operate in a closed loop — in that if they leak, the device doesn’t work. So if manufacturers could assure no leaks, any refrigerant would be fine, he argues.</p><h2><b>Heavy industries</b></h2><p>The simplest but most pervasive uses of PFASs in machinery — from engines to chemical reactors — are at the interfaces between parts. Fluoropolymer greases lubricate moving surfaces, and fluoroelastomer O-rings, gaskets and seals join parts together. (Elastomers are polymers that regain their shape after being deformed.) Fluoromaterials are the only flexible ones that can resist aggressive chemical corrosion, very high temperatures and, in some applications, ultraviolet radiation, says Michael Eason, a materials engineer at James Walker, a company headquartered in Woking, UK, that manufactures high-performance sealing products. Fluoroelastomer seals are also usefully non-stick when equipment is disassembled for maintenance.</p><p>Fluoromaterials’ resistance to heat alone sets them apart from other soft materials: PTFE, for instance, can withstand a constant temperature of 260 °C for 10 years while losing only 1% of its mass, says Barbara Henry, a materials scientist at W. L. Gore, a materials-science company based in Newark, Delaware. This allows seals to last the lifetime of their equipment, for instance in an oil-well head, minimizing maintenance and therefore worker exposure to occupational hazards. It also allows machinery such as jet engines to operate at higher temperatures, and therefore more efficiently. “Because fluorinated polymers exist, every piece of equipment that’s followed a capitalist process, trying to get faster, quicker, more efficient, has adopted fluorinated materials,” says Eason.</p><figure>

</figure><p>PTFE also protects workers in heavy industries. A thin internal layer of PTFE in multilayered textiles allows garments to remain light and breathable while providing enough heat resistance to withstand arc flashes, the explosive electrical discharges that can melt textiles on to skin. Gore has developed fluorine-free weatherproof outerwear for consumers (using expanded polyethylene), but high-performance gear still demands PTFE, says Henry.</p><p>Aware of the push to ban PFASs, however, Eason and Chaoying Wan, a materials scientist at the University of Warwick, UK, are starting a collaboration to find alternatives. A replacement that has all the properties of PTFE would be “almost impossible” to find, Eason says. But substitutes could emerge for applications where just one or two properties of PTFE are needed, although this would complicate supply chains. Eason expects that the outcome might be dozens of specialized products, whereas now a handful of fluoropolymers meet the needs of industries ranging from aerospace to pharmaceuticals to semiconductors.</p><h2><b>Computer chips</b></h2><p>Fluorochemical producers are also buoyed by the world’s race for semiconductor dominance. Last September, Chemours announced an expansion at its North Carolina facility to support domestic semiconductor production. And this year, Asahi Glass Company, a chemicals and glass manufacturer in Tokyo, also cited strong demand from the semiconductor industry when it announced a ¥35-billion ($250-million) expansion in fluorochemicals production.</p><p>PFASs are used in many ways to make computer chips. In one crucial step, manufacturers coat a silicon wafer’s surface with a ‘photoresist’ material containing PFASs: when the photoresist is illuminated, those PFASs generate strong acids that eat away at portions of the material, leaving a carefully patterned gap. In a second step, the exposed parts of the wafer are etched away — and in ‘dry etching’, a mixture of gases is used, usually containing some fluorocarbons. (Fluoropolymers are also used in a variety of microchip coatings.)</p><figure>

</figure><p>It is not easy to find alternatives to the strong acids or the etching gases. Fluorine atoms impart the necessary acidity, and fluorocarbon gases are prized for their precision in etching. The Semiconductor Research Corporation, a consortium based in Durham, North Carolina, is promoting research into ways to limit PFAS emissions and to find alternatives in the microchip industry.</p><p>In one case, companies have managed to ditch a small use of fluorosurfactants in ‘wet etching’ — processes that involve chemicals in solution. Here, fluorosurfactants helped the solutions to spread over the surfaces to be etched, says Christopher Christuk, president of electronic chemicals supplier Transene in Danvers, Massachusetts. Transene is now using fluorine-free surfactants that were identified by researchers at the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML)<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>. Key support for this switch came from the Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute, a state agency funded by fees levied on businesses that use toxic chemicals, which set up the partnership between Transgene and UML and funded the research project, Christuk says.</p><h2><b>The magic of fluorine: myth or fact?</b></h2><p>Industries that have known nothing but fluorine chemistry need to break away from believing in its magic, says Martin Scheringer, an environmental scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ). “PFASs are a block to innovation,” he says, pointing to the example of firefighting foams. Despite making foams from PFOS for decades, the multinational technology company 3M managed to create fluorine-free firefighting foam in 2002, but only after PFOS became a high-profile pollutant. Many other industries now need to make similar breakthroughs. “We need lots of materials that have not been invented that are fluorine-free,” Scheringer says.</p><p>In December, 3M announced it would stop making all its fluorochemical products — including fluoropolymers and fluorocarbon gases and liquids — by 2025, but did not say what would take their place. This June, it reached a $10-billion settlement to pay to clean fluorosurfactants from drinking water in parts of the United States, although it faces other unresolved lawsuits.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>For the moment, most of the funding granted to PFAS topics relates to cleaning up pollution, and neither of the huge government-funded European Union or US programmes to boost clean energy or the manufacture of semiconductor chips specify the need to find alternatives to PFASs. “We should channel more of the funding to the research that will find new solutions,” says Jonatan Kleimark, an adviser at ChemSec, a non-profit organization based in Gothenburg, Sweden, that advocates for safer chemicals.</p><p>Eason and Wan are trying to find ways to manufacture fluoropolymers without using toxic fluorosurfactants. If that can be achieved, Eason argues, it should be fine to continue using fluoropolymers where they cannot be substituted, provided that recycling at the end of their life is also resolved. But Eason recognizes the problem of persistence with fluoropolymers. “The ECHA proposal has made everyone realize they have to do something different,” he says. “In my view, a responsible company should be looking to minimize the use of fluorinated materials.”</p><p>The officials who proposed the ban say that they welcome proposals from manufacturers to extend producer responsibility and develop closed-loop systems for recycling fluorochemicals. “They have to provide the information and step forward,” says Heggelund. But he is highly sceptical, noting the low rates of plastic recycling. And if fluoropolymers could be made without toxic surfactants, then manufacturers should have done it from the start instead of reacting to regulation, he says.</p><p>The ECHA is collecting feedback on the proposal until the end of September. After that, it will revise the plan and carry out a techno-economic assessment to evaluate the costs and benefits for society.</p><p>The agency is the only one in the world contemplating such comprehensive PFAS restrictions. But enacting a ban would send a signal to the rest of the world about the acceptability of the chemicals. Zhanyun Wang, an environmental scientist at ETHZ, thinks that the proposal will spur innovative research for applications that don’t have obvious alternatives to fluorinated chemicals. And for those that do, Wang hopes the proposal and market changes that follow could act as a “lighthouse”, as he puts it: showing industries around the world how to ditch forever chemicals for good.</p>

<p dir="auto">Welcome to <code>prompttools</code> created by <a href="https://hegel-ai.com/" rel="nofollow">Hegel AI</a>! This repo offers a set of free, open-source tools for testing and experimenting with prompts. The core idea is to enable developers to evaluate prompts using familiar interfaces like <em>code</em> and <em>notebooks</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In just a few lines of codes, you can test your prompts and parameters across different models (whether you are using
OpenAI, Anthropic, or LLaMA models). You can even evaluate the retrieval accuracy of vector databases.</p>

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi HN! We're Nick, Patrick, Philip, Sebastian, Sven, and Timo from Titap (<a href="https://tiptap.dev/">https://tiptap.dev/</a>), an open source developer toolkit for building collaborative editing apps. Our editor framework, based on ProseMirror, is at <a href="https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap">https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap</a>, and our real-time collaboration backend, based on Yjs, is at <a href="https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus">https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus</a>.</p><p>Building editor interfaces like Notion or Google Docs in your web app takes a lot of work and time. Our open source tools and cloud services let you build collaborative content editing faster—in days or weeks, rather than months or years. And this is just for the editor. If you want real-time collaboration or other advanced features like version history in your editor, the overall workload quickly escalates—you will need a robust and serious backend infrastructure that requires even more time to set up and maintain. This doesn’t make sense for most frontend developers or most startups.</p><p>We spent eight years as a digital agency developing applications with complex content editing functionality. We learned the hard way how limited the existing editors were. After building Tiptap as a headless editor framework with an extension-based architecture, we needed to allow multiple users to edit content simultaneously, which got complicated. There was no simple solution that could be integrated quickly. So we built that too.</p><p>The Tiptap editor is based on the JS framework ProseMirror, which is a good foundation for editors. The learning curve for ProseMirror is steep because it's complicated to understand and lacks simple APIs and documentation. It takes a lot of code around ProseMirror to develop a modern user experience. We’ve taken care of that for you.</p><p>Tiptap is headless, so it will work with whatever frontend or design you have in mind—we make no assumptions about your UI. You can use it to develop block-based editors like Notion, classic interfaces like Google Docs, or whatever you need. It's also framework agnostic, so you can use it with React, Vue, etc., or vanilla JavaScript. And it's highly customizable through our extension architecture. We also provide an API to access ProseMirror's internals through Tiptap if you want to dig deep into the core.</p><p>Adding real-time collaboration to your editor is as easy as installing and configuring an extension. Our collaboration backend, called Hocuspocus, uses Yjs. This is a widely used implementation of CRDTs (conflict- free replicated data type). Hocuspocus makes it easy to set up a Node.js websocket server to handle communication between multiple peers to synchronize data. Like the Tiptap editor, Hocuspocus is designed to be extensible according to your needs. Also, Hocuspocus can work independently of Tiptap with other editors like Lexical or Slate.</p><p>An earlier version of Tiptap got discussed a couple years ago at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26901975">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26901975</a>. We’ve been enjoying wider adoption since then. For example, Substack uses Tiptap for their editor that allows creators to write content on substack.com, and YC uses Tiptap in their Bookface forum (which is basically HN for YC alums).</p><p>With the Tiptap Cloud, we offer managed backend services if you don't want to build and maintain every feature yourself. For real-time collaboration, we provide a cloud infrastructure with multiple datacenter regions where you can deploy Hocuspocus. The Tiptap AI integration beta is a service where you connect your OpenAI API key to our backend and install the Tiptap editor AI extension to get AI writing experience in your editor. Here’s a demo: <a href="https://ai-demo.tiptap.dev/">https://ai-demo.tiptap.dev/</a></p><p>We invite you to explore Tiptap's capabilities in your app, contribute to its open source development, and (hopefully!) join our welcoming community. We'd love to hear what you've already built with Tiptap or what's stopping you from creating something with it :-) We look forward to all of your comments!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

These days I'd consider myself much more of a backend / web services developer. I've done plenty of full-stack web development over my ~18 year career, but over the past ~8-10 years almost all of the frontend code I've written has been ClojureScript, so I feel I'm totally out of the loop on what the JavaScript / TypeScript world is doing. And I just prefer backend stuff in general these days.<p>On the side, I work on hobby projects mostly relating to game development (see my Github profile). These projects are usually in Rust or C/C++.</p><p>Thanks for reading!

Hi all - I’m a former healthcare VC that’s working through a CS master’s degree at Penn with the ultimate goal of jumping into an engineering role. I'm scheduled to graduate in December 2023 and am looking for a full-time software engineering role starting January 2024.<p>I'm currently interning as a SWE at Liberty Mutual, working on critical customer communication infrastructure (SMS, email, push) built in Typescript on AWS serverless architecture.  This summer, I've redesigned one of our core services (archiving emails for legal compliance) to run 67% faster and have added highly-requested features to our SMS platform. Last year, I interned as a SWE with a data privacy startup called Kanary (an opportunity that was found here on HN!).</p><p>As a VC at Echo Health Ventures prior to grad school, I invested in healthcare delivery businesses like Dispatch Health, Genome Medical, Heartbeat Health, and TytoCare. I helped these businesses find product/market fit, scale operations into new markets and channels, and optimize their financial planning / fundraising. Before joining Echo I was a healthcare investment banker at J.P. Morgan.</p><p>Most of my experience thus far has been on the backend, and that's where my preference lies, but open to any/all opportunities to work on interesting problems.</p><p>Look forward to connecting!

As a full-stack developer, I have participated in building applications from scratch: from creating a graphic template and implementing it in the frontend using the latest HTML and CSS technologies, embedding logic in Angular or TypeScript in general, creating a data management system with RxJS and NGRX, and finally, developing backend logic using Node or Python.
Thanks to a broad range of experience, I have a better understanding of how the application should function and what prospects it holds for the future."</span></p></div></td></tr>

Once upon a time I was a military officer, then I became an academic philosopher, and now I'm a full stack dev living in the French Alps.  I'm looking for remote freelance/contract/consulting positions in the ruby &amp; JS ecosystems either fully async or with with a working day cross over to CET (+2).<p>I specialise in turning vague ideas into robust software.  I am really good at asking questions that get to the heart of difficult problems, translating this into actionable requirements, then delivering well documented and tested code.</p><p>I have extensive leadership and mentoring experience.  I am happy to help bring junior devs up to speed but I’m equally happy playing a supporting role as part of a team.  Drop me a line if you think I can add value to your organisation.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re now finding out the damaging consequences of the mandated return to office. And it’s not a pretty picture. A trio of compelling reports–the Greenhouse Candidate Experience <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360029861512-Candidate-survey-overview" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Report;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0">Report</a>, the Federal Reserve’s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2022-report-economic-well-being-us-households-202305.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Survey;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0">Survey</a> of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED), and Unispace's "Returning for Good" <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.unispace.com/returning-for-good" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:report;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0">report</a>–collectively paint a stark picture of this brewing storm.</p><p>Unispace found that nearly half (42%) of companies with return-to-office mandates witnessed a higher level of employee attrition than they had anticipated. And almost a third (29%) of companies enforcing office returns are struggling with recruitment. In other words, employers knew the mandates would cause some attrition, but they weren’t ready for the serious problems that would result.</p><p>Meanwhile, a staggering 76% of employees stand ready to jump ship if their companies decide to pull the plug on flexible work schedules, according to the Greenhouse report. Moreover, employees from historically underrepresented groups are 22% more likely to consider other options if flexibility comes to an end.</p><p>In the SHED survey, the gravity of this situation becomes more evident. The survey equates the displeasure of shifting from a flexible work model to a traditional one to that of experiencing a 2-3% pay cut.</p><h2>People were more open to returning to the office if it was out of choice</h2><p>Flexible work policies have emerged as the ultimate edge in talent acquisition and retention. The Greenhouse, SHED, and Unispace reports, when viewed together, provide compelling evidence to back this assertion.</p><p>Greenhouse finds that 42% of candidates would outright reject roles that lack flexibility. In turn, the SHED survey affirms that employees who work from home a few days a week greatly treasure the arrangement.</p><p>The Greenhouse report has ranked employees’ priorities as:</p><ul><li><p>Increased compensation (48%)</p></li><li><p>Greater job security (34%)</p></li><li><p>Career advancement opportunities (32%)</p></li><li><p>Better flexible work policies (28%)</p></li><li><p>A more positive company culture (27%)</p></li></ul><p>In other words, excluding career-centric factors such as pay, security, and promotion, flexible work policies ranks first in employees’ priorities.</p><p>Interestingly, Unispace throws another factor into the mix: choice. According to their report, overall, the top feelings employees revealed they felt towards the office were happy (31%), motivated (30%), and excited (27%). However, all three of these feelings decrease for those with mandated office returns (27%, 26%, and 22% respectively). In other words, staff were more open to returning to the office if it was out of choice, rather than forced.</p><h2>Real-life cases are mirroring findings</h2><p>Recently, I was contacted by a regional insurance company with a workforce of around 2,000 employees. The company enforced a return to the office policy, causing waves of unrest. It soon became evident that their attrition rates were climbing steadily. In line with the Greenhouse report's findings, most employees would actively seek a new job if flexible work policies were retracted. The underrepresented groups were even more prone to leave, making the situation more daunting.</p><p>At that point, they <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/consulting" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:called;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0">called</a> me to help as a <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="http://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/hybrid" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hybrid work expert;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0">hybrid work expert</a> who <em>The New York Times</em> has <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/11/magazine/return-to-office-consultants.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:called;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0">called</a> “the office whisperer.” We worked on adapting their return-to-office plan, switching it from a top-down mandate to a team-driven approach, and focusing on welcoming staff to the office for the sake of collaboration and mentoring. As a result, their attrition rates dropped and the feelings of employees toward the office improved, in line with what the Unispace report suggests.</p><p>In another case, a large financial services company began noticing employee turnover despite offering competitive salaries and growth opportunities. Upon running an internal survey, they realized that, aside from better compensation and career advancement opportunities, employees were seeking better flexible work policies. This aligned with the Greenhouse and SHED findings, which ranked flexible work policies as a crucial factor influencing job changes. After consulting with me, they adjusted their policies to be more competitive in offering flexibility.</p><p>A late-stage SaaS startup decided to embrace this wave of change. They worked with me to introduce flexible work policies, and the result was almost immediate: They noticed a sharp decrease in employee turnover and an uptick in job applications. Their story echoes the collective message from all three reports: Companies must adapt to flexible work policies or risk being outcompeted by other employers.</p><h2>Inside an employee’s head</h2><p>As we navigate these shifting landscapes of work, we cannot ignore the human elements at play. Like unseen puppeteers, <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/nevergut" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cognitive biases;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0">cognitive biases</a> subtly shape our <a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.top10.com/dating/top-10-cognitive-biases-to-avoid-in-dating" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:decisions;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0">decisions</a> and perceptions. In the context of flexibility and retention, two cognitive biases come into sharp focus: the status quo bias and anchoring bias.</p><p>Imagine a thriving tech startup, successfully operating in a hybrid model during the pandemic. As the world normalized, leadership decided to return to pre-pandemic, in-person work arrangements. However, they faced resistance and an unexpected swell of turnover.</p><p>This situation illustrates the potent influence of the status quo bias. This bias, deeply entrenched in our human psyche, inclines us towards maintaining current states or resisting change. Employees, having tasted the fruits of flexible work, felt averse to relinquishing these newfound freedoms.</p><p>Consider a large financial institution that enforced a full return to office after the pandemic. Many employees, initially attracted by the brand and pay scale, felt disgruntled. The crux of the problem lies in the anchoring bias, which leads us to heavily rely on the first piece of information offered (the anchor) when making decisions.</p><p>When initially joining the company, the employees were primarily concerned with compensation and job security. Once within the fold, the pandemic caused them to shift their focus to work-life balance and flexibility, as confirmed by both the Greenhouse and SHED reports. Unfortunately, the rigid return-to-office policy made these new anchors seem less attainable, resulting in dissatisfaction and an increased propensity to leave.</p><p>As we steer our ships through these tumultuous waters, understanding cognitive biases can help illuminate our path. Recognizing and accounting for the status quo and anchoring biases can enable us to create a workplace that not only attracts but also retains its employees in the new age of flexibility. After all, success in the world of business is as much about understanding people as it is about numbers and strategy.</p><p><a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/glebtsipursky/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gleb Tsipursky;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0"><em>Gleb Tsipursky</em></a><em>, Ph.D. (a.k.a. “the office whisperer”) helps tech and finance industry executives drive collaboration, innovation, and retention in hybrid work.

          </h3>
          <p>The Nim team is proud and happy to announce Nim version 2.0.</p>

<p>This is an evolution (not revolution) of Nim, bringing ORC memory management as a default, along with many other new features and improvements.</p>

<p>Nim is a programming language that is good for everything, but not for everybody.
It focusses on the imperative programming paradigm and enhances it with a macro system.
Its customizable memory management makes it well suited for unforgiving domains such as hard realtime systems and system programming in general.</p>

<h2 id="installing-nim-20">Installing Nim 2.0</h2>

<h3 id="new-users">New users</h3>

<p>Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.0 or
install it as described <a href="https://nim-lang.org/install.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="existing-users">Existing users</h3>

<p>If you have installed a previous version of Nim using <code>choosenim</code>,
getting Nim 2.0 is as easy as:</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New features</h2>

<h3 id="better-tuple-unpacking">Better tuple unpacking</h3>

<p>Tuple unpacking for variables is now treated as syntax sugar that directly
expands into multiple assignments. Along with this, tuple unpacking for
variables can now be nested.</p>

<div><pre><code>proc returnsNestedTuple(): (int, (int, int), int, int) = (4, (5, 7), 2, 3)

# Now nesting is supported!
let (x, (_, y), _, z) = returnsNestedTuple()
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="improved-type-inference">Improved type inference</h3>

<p>A new form of type inference called <a href="https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual_experimental.html#topminusdown-type-inference">top-down inference</a> has been implemented for a variety of basic cases.</p>

<p>For example, code like the following now compiles:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>seq</span><span>[</span><span>(</span><span>float</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span><span>,</span> <span>cstring</span><span>)</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>@[</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>"abc"</span><span>)</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="forbidden-tags">Forbidden Tags</h3>

<p><a href="https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual.html#effect-system-tag-tracking">Tag tracking</a> now supports the definition
of forbidden tags by the <code>.forbids</code> pragma which can be used to disable certain effects in proc types.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>IO</span> <span>=</span> <span>object</span> <span>## input/output effect</span>
<span>proc </span><span>readLine</span><span>():</span> <span>string</span> <span>{.</span><span>tags</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>IO</span><span>]</span><span>.}</span> <span>=</span> <span>discard</span>
<span>proc </span><span>echoLine</span><span>():</span> <span>void</span> <span>=</span> <span>discard</span>

<span>proc </span><span>no_IO_please</span><span>()</span> <span>{.</span><span>forbids</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>IO</span><span>]</span><span>.}</span> <span>=</span>
  <span># this is OK because it didn't define any tag:</span>
  <span>echoLine</span><span>()</span>
  <span># the compiler prevents this:</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>readLine</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="new-standard-library-modules">New standard library modules</h3>

<p>The famous <code>os</code> module got an overhaul. Several of its features are available
under a new interface that introduces a <code>Path</code> abstraction. A <code>Path</code> is
a <code>distinct string</code>, which improves the type safety when dealing with paths, files
and directories.</p>

<p>Use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>std/oserrors</code> for OS error reporting.</li>
  <li><code>std/envvars</code> for environment variables handling.</li>
  <li><code>std/paths</code> for path handling.</li>
  <li><code>std/dirs</code> for directory creation/deletion/traversal.</li>
  <li><code>std/files</code> for file existence checking, file deletions and moves.</li>
  <li><code>std/symlinks</code> for symlink handling.</li>
  <li><code>std/appdirs</code> for accessing configuration/home/temp directories.</li>
  <li><code>std/cmdline</code> for reading command line parameters.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="overloadable-enums">Overloadable enums</h3>

<p><a href="https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual.html#overloadable-enum-value-names">Overloadable enums</a> are no longer experimental.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>type</span>
  <span>E1</span> <span>=</span> <span>enum</span>
    <span>value1</span><span>,</span> <span>value2</span>
  <span>E2</span> <span>=</span> <span>enum</span>
    <span>value1</span><span>,</span> <span>value2</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span>

<span>const</span>
  <span>Lookuptable</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>E1</span><span>.</span><span>value1</span><span>:</span> <span>"1"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>value2</span><span>:</span> <span>"2"</span>
  <span>]</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The types <code>E1</code> and <code>E2</code> share the names <code>value1</code> and <code>value2</code>. These are overloaded and the usual overload disambiguation
is used so that the <code>E1</code> or <code>E2</code> prefixes can be left out in many cases. These features are most beneficial for independently developed libraries.</p>

<h3 id="default-values-for-objects">Default values for objects</h3>

<p>Inside an object declaration, fields can now have default values:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>type</span>
  <span>Rational</span><span>*</span> <span>=</span> <span>object</span>
    <span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>den</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>

<span>var</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>Rational</span><span>()</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>$</span><span>r</span> <span>==</span> <span>"(num: 0, den: 1)"</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>These default values are used when the field is not initialized explicitly. See also <a href="https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual.html#types-default-values-for-object-fields">default values for object fields</a> for details.</p>

<h3 id="definite-assignment-analysis">Definite assignment analysis</h3>

<p>We found Nim’s default initialization rule to be one major source of bugs. There is a new
experimental switch called <code>strictDefs</code> that protects against these bugs. When enabled,
it is enforced that a variable has been given a value explicitly before the variable can
be used:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{.</span><span>experimental</span><span>:</span> <span>"strictDefs"</span><span>.}</span>

<span>proc </span><span>main</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>r</span><span>:</span> <span>Rational</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>r</span> <span># Warning: use explicit initialization of 'r' for clarity [Uninit]</span>

<span>main</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To turn the warning into an error, use <code>--warningAsError:Uninit:on</code> on the command line.</p>

<p>The analysis understands basic control flow so the following works because every
possible code path assigns a value to <code>r</code> before it is used:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{.</span><span>experimental</span><span>:</span> <span>"strictDefs"</span><span>.}</span>

<span>proc </span><span>main</span><span>(</span><span>cond</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>r</span><span>:</span> <span>Rational</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>cond</span><span>:</span>
    <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>Rational</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>den</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
  <span>else</span><span>:</span>
    <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>Rational</span><span>()</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>r</span>

<span>main</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Even better, this feature works with <code>let</code> variables too:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{.</span><span>experimental</span><span>:</span> <span>"strictDefs"</span><span>.}</span>

<span>proc </span><span>main</span><span>(</span><span>cond</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>r</span><span>:</span> <span>Rational</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>cond</span><span>:</span>
    <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>Rational</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>den</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
  <span>else</span><span>:</span>
    <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>Rational</span><span>()</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>r</span>

<span>main</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It is checked that every <code>let</code> variable is assigned a value exactly once.</p>

<h3 id="strict-effects">Strict effects</h3>

<p><code>--experimental:strictEffects</code> are now always enabled. Strict effects require callback
parameters to be annotated with <code>effectsOf</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>sort</span><span>*[</span><span>T</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span> <span>openArray</span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
              <span>cmp</span><span>:</span> <span>proc</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>):</span> <span>int</span> <span>{.</span><span>closure</span><span>.},</span>
              <span>order</span> <span>=</span> <span>SortOrder</span><span>.</span><span>Ascending</span><span>)</span> <span>{.</span><span>effectsOf</span><span>:</span> <span>cmp</span><span>.}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The meaning here is that <code>sort</code> has the effects of <code>cmp</code>: <code>sort</code> can raise the exceptions of <code>cmp</code>.</p>

<h3 id="improved-error-message-for-type-mismatch">Improved error message for type mismatch</h3>

<div><pre><code><span>proc </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>discard</span>
<span>proc </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>discard</span>
<span>proc </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>:</span> <span>char</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>discard</span>

<span>foo</span> <span>4</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>produces:</p>

<div><pre><code>temp3.nim(11, 1) Error: type mismatch
Expression: foo 4
  [1] 4: int literal(4)

Expected one of (first mismatch at [position]):
[1] proc foo(c: char)
[1] proc foo(s: string)
[2] proc foo(x, y: int)
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="consistent-underscore-handling">Consistent underscore handling</h3>

<p>The underscore identifier (<code>_</code>) is now generally not added to a scope when
used as the name of a definition. While this was already the case for
variables, it is now also the case for routine parameters, generic
parameters, routine declarations, type declarations, etc. This means that the following code now does not compile:</p>

<div><pre><code>proc foo(_: int): int = _ + 1
echo foo(1)

proc foo[_](t: typedesc[_]): seq[_] = @[default(_)]
echo foo[int]()

proc _() = echo "_"
_()

type _ = int
let x: _ = 3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Whereas the following code now compiles:</p>

<div><pre><code>proc foo(_, _: int): int = 123
echo foo(1, 2)

proc foo[_, _](): int = 123
echo foo[int, bool]()

proc foo[T, U](_: typedesc[T], _: typedesc[U]): (T, U) = (default(T), default(U))
echo foo(int, bool)

proc _() = echo "one"
proc _() = echo "two"

type _ = int
type _ = float
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="javascript-codegen-improvement">JavaScript codegen improvement</h3>

<p>The JavaScript backend now uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt">BigInt</a>
for 64-bit integer types (<code>int64</code> and <code>uint64</code>) by default. As this affects
JS code generation, code using these types to interface with the JS backend
may need to be updated. Note that <code>int</code> and <code>uint</code> are not affected.</p>

<p>For compatibility with <a href="https://caniuse.com/bigint">platforms that do not support BigInt</a>
and in the case of potential bugs with the new implementation, the
old behavior is currently still supported with the command line option
<code>--jsbigint64:off</code>.</p>

<h2 id="docgen-improvements">Docgen improvements</h2>

<p><code>Markdown</code> is now the default markup language of doc comments (instead
of the legacy <code>RstMarkdown</code> mode). In this release we begin to separate
RST and Markdown features to better follow the specification of each
language, with the focus on Markdown development.
See also <a href="https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/markdown_rst.html">the docs</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Added a <code><span>{</span><span>.doctype:</span><span> </span><span>Markdown</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>RST</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>RstMarkdown.</span><span>}</span></code> pragma allowing to
select the markup language mode in the doc comments of the current <code>.nim</code>
file for processing by <code>nim doc</code>:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><code>Markdown</code> (default) is basically CommonMark (standard Markdown) +
 some Pandoc Markdown features + some RST features that are missing
 in our current implementation of CommonMark and Pandoc Markdown.</li>
      <li><code>RST</code> closely follows the RST spec with few additional Nim features.</li>
      <li><code>RstMarkdown</code> is a maximum mix of RST and Markdown features, which
 is kept for the sake of compatibility and ease of migration.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added separate <code>md2html</code> and <code>rst2html</code> commands for processing
standalone <code>.md</code> and <code>.rst</code> files respectively (and also <code>md2tex</code>/<code>rst2tex</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added Pandoc Markdown bracket syntax <code>[...]</code> for making anchor-less links.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Docgen now supports concise syntax for referencing Nim symbols:
instead of specifying HTML anchors directly one can use original
Nim symbol declarations (adding the aforementioned link brackets
<code>[...]</code> around them).
    <ul>
      <li>To use this feature across modules, a new <code>importdoc</code> directive was added.
Using this feature for referencing also helps to ensure that links
(inside one module or the whole project) are not broken.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added support for RST &amp; Markdown quote blocks (blocks starting with <code>&gt;</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added a popular Markdown definition lists extension.</p>

<h2 id="c-interop-enhancements">C++ interop enhancements</h2>

<p>Nim 2.0 takes C++ interop to the next level with the new <a href="https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual_experimental.html#virtual-pragma">virtual</a> pragma and the extended <a href="https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual_experimental.html#constructor-pragma">constructor</a> pragma.
Now one can define constructors and virtual procs that map to C++ constructors and virtual methods, allowing one to further customize
the interoperability. There is also extended support for the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#implementation-specific-pragmas-codegendecl-pragma">codeGenDecl</a> pragma, so that it works on types.</p>

<p>It’s a common pattern in C++ to use inheritance to extend a library. Some even use multiple inheritance as a mechanism to make interfaces.</p>

<p>Consider the following example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Base</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>someValue</span><span>;</span>
  <span>Base</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>inValue</span><span>)</span>  <span>{</span>
    <span>someValue</span> <span>=</span> <span>inValue</span><span>;</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>class</span> <span>IPrinter</span> <span>{</span>
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
  <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>print</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<div><pre><code><span>type</span>
  <span>Base</span><span>*</span> <span>{.</span><span>importcpp</span><span>,</span> <span>inheritable</span><span>.}</span> <span>=</span> <span>object</span>
    <span>someValue</span><span>*</span><span>:</span> <span>int32</span>
  <span>IPrinter</span><span>*</span> <span>{.</span><span>importcpp</span><span>.}</span> <span>=</span> <span>object</span>

<span>const</span> <span>objTemplate</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""
  struct </span><span>$1</span><span> : public </span><span>$3</span><span>, public IPrinter {
    </span><span>$2</span><span>
  };
"""</span><span>;</span>

<span>type</span> <span>NimChild</span> <span>{.</span><span>codegenDecl</span><span>:</span> <span>objTemplate</span><span>.}</span> <span>=</span> <span>object</span> <span>of</span> <span>Base</span>

<span>proc </span><span>makeNimChild</span><span>(</span><span>val</span><span>:</span> <span>int32</span><span>):</span> <span>NimChild</span> <span>{.</span><span>constructor</span><span>:</span> <span>"NimClass('1 #1) : Base(#1)"</span><span>.}</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"It calls the base constructor passing "</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>$</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>someValue</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>someValue</span> <span>=</span> <span>val</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span> <span># Notice how we can access `this` inside the constructor. It's of the type `ptr NimChild`.</span>

  <span>echo</span> <span>"Some value is "</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>$</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>someValue</span>

<span>let</span> <span>child</span> <span>=</span> <span>makeNimChild</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
<span>child</span><span>.</span><span>print</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It outputs:</p>

<div><pre><code>It calls the base constructor passing 10
Some value is 20
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="arcorc-refinements">ARC/ORC refinements</h2>

<p>With the 2.0 release, the ARC/ORC model got refined once again and is now finally complete:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Programmers now have control over the “item was moved from” state as <code>=wasMoved</code> is overridable.</li>
  <li>There is a new <code>=dup</code> hook which is more efficient than the old combination of <code>=wasMoved(tmp); =copy(tmp, x)</code> operations.</li>
  <li>Destructors now take a parameter of the attached object type <code>T</code> directly and don’t have to take a <code>var T</code> parameter.</li>
</ol>

<p>With these important optimizations we improved the runtime of the compiler and important benchmarks by 0%! Wait … what?
Yes, unfortunately it turns out that for a modern optimizer like in GCC or LLVM there is no difference.</p>

<p>But! This refined model is more efficient once separate compilation enters the picture. In other words, as we think of
providing a stable ABI it is important not to lose any efficiency in the calling conventions.</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Nim now ships Nimble version 0.14 which added support for lock-files. Libraries are stored in <code>$nimbleDir/pkgs2</code> (it was <code>$nimbleDir/pkgs</code> before). Use <code>nimble develop --global</code> to create an old style link file in the special links directory documented <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble#nimble-develop">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>nimgrep now offers the option <code>--inContext</code> (and <code>--notInContext</code>), which
allows to filter only matches with the context block containing a given pattern.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>nimgrep: names of options containing “include/exclude” are deprecated,
e.g. instead of <code>--includeFile</code> and <code>--excludeFile</code> we have
<code>--filename</code> and <code>--notFilename</code> respectively.
Also, the semantics are now consistent for such positive/negative filters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nim now ships with an alternative package manager called <a href="http://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/atlas.html">Atlas</a>. More on this in upcoming versions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="porting-guide">Porting guide</h2>

<h3 id="block-and-break">Block and Break</h3>

<p>Using an unnamed break in a block is deprecated. This warning will become an error in future versions! Use a named block with a named break instead. In other words, turn:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>block</span><span>:</span>
  <span>a</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>cond</span><span>:</span>
    <span>break</span>
  <span>b</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Into:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>block</span> <span>maybePerformB</span><span>:</span>
  <span>a</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>cond</span><span>:</span>
    <span>break</span> <span>maybePerformB</span>
  <span>b</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="strict-funcs">Strict funcs</h3>

<p>The definition of <code>"strictFuncs"</code> was changed.
The old definition was roughly: “A store to a ref/ptr deref is forbidden unless it’s coming from a <code>var T</code> parameter”.
The new definition is: “A store to a ref/ptr deref is forbidden”.</p>

<p>This new definition is much easier to understand, but the price is some expressibility. The following code used to be
accepted:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{.</span><span>experimental</span><span>:</span> <span>"strictFuncs"</span><span>.}</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Node</span> <span>=</span> <span>ref</span> <span>object</span>
  <span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span>

<span>func</span> <span>create</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>):</span> <span>Node</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>Node</span><span>()</span>
  <span>result</span><span>.</span><span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span> <span># store to result[]</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now it has to be rewritten to:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{.</span><span>experimental</span><span>:</span> <span>"strictFuncs"</span><span>.}</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Node</span> <span>=</span> <span>ref</span> <span>object</span>
  <span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span>

<span>func</span> <span>create</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>):</span> <span>Node</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>Node</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="standard-library">Standard library</h3>

<p>Several standard library modules have been moved to nimble packages, use <code>nimble</code> or <code>atlas</code> to install them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>std/punycode</code> =&gt; <code>punycode</code></li>
  <li><code>std/asyncftpclient</code> =&gt; <code>asyncftpclient</code></li>

            <pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 12:31:10 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ploum.net/2023-08-01-splitting-the-web.html">https://ploum.net/2023-08-01-splitting-the-web.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36955146">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>by <a href="https://ploum.net/index.html">Ploum</a> on 2023-08-01</p><p>There’s an increasing chasm dividing the modern web. On one side, the commercial, monopolies-riddled, media-adored web. A web which has only one objective: making us click. It measures clicks, optimises clicks, generates clicks. It gathers as much information as it could about us and spams every second of our life with ads, beep, notifications, vibrations, blinking LEDs, background music and fluorescent titles.</p>
<p>A web which boils down to Idiocracy in a Blade Runner landscape, a complete cyberpunk dystopia.</p>
<p>Then there’s the tech-savvy web. People who install adblockers or alternative browsers. People who try alternative networks such as Mastodon or, God forbid, Gemini. People who poke fun at the modern web by building true HTML and JavaScript-less pages.</p>
<p>Between those two extremes, the gap is widening. You have to choose your camp. When browsing on the "normal web", it is increasingly required to disable at least part of your antifeatures-blockers to access content.</p>
<p>Most of the time, I don’t bother anymore. The link I clicked doesn’t open or is wrangled? Yep, I’m probably blocking some important third-party JavaScript. No, I don’t care. I’ve too much to read on a day anyway. More time for something else. I’m currently using kagi.com as my main search engine on the web. And kagi.com comes with a nice feature, a "non-commercial lens" (which is somewhat ironic given the fact that Kagi is, itself, a commercial search engine). It means it will try to deprioritize highly commercial contents. I can also deprioritize manually some domains. Like facebook.com or linkedin.com. If you post there, I’m less likely to read you. I’ve not even talked about the few times I use marginalia.nu.</p>
<p>Something strange is happening: it’s not only a part of the web which is disappearing for me. As I’m blocking completely google analytics, every Facebook domain and any analytics I can, I’m also disappearing for them. I don’t see them and they don’t see me!</p>
<p>Think about it! That whole "MBA, designers and marketers web" is now optimised thanks to analytics describing people who don’t block analytics (and bots pretending to be those people). Each day, I feel more disconnected from that part of the web.</p>
<p>When really needed, dealing with those websites is so nerve breaking that I often resort to… a phone call or a simple email. I signed my mobile phone contract by exchanging emails with a real person because the signup was not working. I phone to book hotels when it is not straightforward to do it in the web interface or if creating an account is required. I hate talking on the phone but it saves me a lot of time and stress. I also walk or cycle to stores instead of ordering online. Which allows me to get advice and to exchange defective  items without dealing with the post office.</p>
<p>Despite breaking up with what seems to be "The Web", I’ve never received so many emails commenting my blog posts. I rarely had as many interesting online conversations as I have on Mastodon. I’ve tens of really insightful contents to read every day in my RSS feeds, on Gemini, on Hacker News, on Mastodon. And, incredibly, a lot of them are on very minimalists and usable blogs. The funny thing is that when non-tech users see my blog or those I’m reading, they spontaneously tell me how beautiful and usable they are. It’s a bit like all those layers of JavaScript and flashy css have been used against usability, against them. Against us. It’s a bit like real users never cared about "cool designs" and only wanted something simple.</p>
<p>It feels like everyone is now choosing its side. You can’t stay in the middle anymore. You are either dedicating all your CPU cycles to run JavaScript tracking you or walking away from the big monopolies. You are either being paid to build huge advertising billboards on top of yet another framework or you are handcrafting HTML.</p>
<p>Maybe the web is not dying. Maybe the web is only splitting itself in two. </p>
<p>You know that famous "dark web" that journalists crave to write about? (at my request, one journalist once told me what "dark web" meant to him and it was "websites not easily accessible through a Google search".) Well, sometimes I feel like I’m part of that "dark web". Not to buy drugs or hire hitmen. No! It’s only to have a place where I can have discussions without being spied and interrupted by ads.</p>
<p>But, increasingly, I feel less and less like an outsider.</p>
<p>It’s not me. It’s people living for and by advertising who are the outsiders. They are the one destroying everything they touch, including the planet. They are the sick psychos and I don’t want them in my life anymore. Are we splitting from those click-conversion-funnel-obsessed weirdos? Good riddance! Have fun with them.</p>
<p>But if you want to jump ship, now is the time to get back to the simple web. Welcome back aboard!</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">IronOS - Flexible Soldering iron control Firmware</h2>
<p dir="auto"><em>This repository was formerly known as TS100, it's the same great code. Just with more supported devices.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Originally conceived as an alternative firmware for the TS100, this firmware has evolved into a complex soldering iron control firmware.</p>
<p dir="auto">The firmware implements all of the standard features of a 'smart' soldering iron, with lots of little extras and tweaks.
I highly recommend reading the installation guide fully when installing on your iron. And after install just explore the settings menu.</p>
<p dir="auto">For soldering irons that are designed to be powered by 'smart' power sources (PD and QC), the firmware supports settings around the negotiated power and voltage.
For soldering irons that are designed to be powered by batteries (TS100 &amp; Pinecil), settings for a cutoff voltage for battery protection are supported.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently <strong>31</strong> languages are supported. When downloading the firmware for your soldering iron, take note of the language code in the file name.</p>
<p dir="auto">This project is considered feature complete for use as a soldering iron, <em>so please suggest any feature improvements you would like!</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>This firmware does <strong>NOT</strong> support the USB port while running for changing settings. This is done through the onscreen menu only. Logos are edited on a computer and flashed like firmware.</em></p>

<p dir="auto"><em>Tip Sense</em> refers to the device being able to choose between the 'usual' TS100 or Hakko T12 style tips and Pine64's custom shorter tips which have lower resistance and allow for more power. This is N/A for TS80/TS80P as there is only one model of tip for them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Recommended Purchase</em> is only referring to if you are buying a <strong>new</strong> device. Of course all the devices listed are supported and will work excellently for years to come.</p>
<p dir="auto">The TS101 and S60 feature a higher resolution OLED than other devices. Work is ongoing to support this fully, for now a cropped view is usable.</p>
<p dir="auto">*PinecilV1 stopped being manufactured a long time ago now, all models for sale online are generally clones (or old stock). Vendors are trying to sell these for more than Pine64 sells the V2 for now. Thus the V1 is <strong><em>no longer recommended</em></strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">**Please note that Miniware started shipping TS100's using cloned STM32 Chips. While these do work with IronOS, their DFU bootloader works terribly, and it is hard to get it to successfully flash larger firmware images like IronOS without timing out. This is the main reason why the TS100 is <strong><em>no longer recommended</em></strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">***TS80 is replaced by TS80P. Production ramped down a long time ago and it's just existing stock clearing the system. It's marked not recommended being optimistic that people might pause and buy the far superior TS80P instead. This is the main reason why the TS80 is <strong><em>no longer recommended</em></strong>.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  A material called LK-99, a modified-lead apatite crystal structure with the
composition Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_{6O}$ ($0.9&lt;x&lt;1.1$), has been
synthesized using the solid-state method. The material exhibits the Ohmic metal
characteristic of Pb(6s1) above its superconducting critical temperature,
$T_c$, and the levitation phenomenon as Meissner effect of a superconductor at
room temperature and atmospheric pressure below $T_c$. A LK-99 sample shows
$T_c$ above 126.85$^\circ$C (400 K). We analyze that the possibility of
room-temperature superconductivity in this material is attributed to two
factors: the first being the volume contraction resulting from an
insulator-metal transition achieved by substituting Pb with Cu, and the second
being on-site repulsive Coulomb interaction enhanced by the structural
deformation in the one-dimensional(D) chain (Pb2-O$_{1/2}$-Pb2 along the
c-axis) structure owing to superconducting condensation at $T_c$. The mechanism
of the room-temperature $T_c$ is discussed by 1-D BR-BCS theory.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compatible with Git</h3>
<p dir="auto">Jujutsu has two <a href="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/blob/main/docs/glossary.md#backend">backends</a>. One of them is a Git
backend (the other is a native one <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-native-backend-7cb6abcd5c51aa74722e11350c0a42f8" id="user-content-fnref-native-backend-7cb6abcd5c51aa74722e11350c0a42f8" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>). This lets you use Jujutsu
as an alternative interface to Git. The commits you create will look like
regular Git commits. You can always switch back to Git. The Git support uses the
<a href="https://libgit2.org/" rel="nofollow">libgit2</a> C library.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/blob/main/demos/git_compat.png"><img src="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/raw/main/demos/git_compat.png"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The working copy is automatically committed</h3>
<p dir="auto">Almost all Jujutsu commands automatically commit the working copy. That means
that commands never fail because the working copy is dirty (no "error: Your
local changes to the following files..."), and there is no need for <code>git stash</code>.
You also get an automatic backup of the working copy whenever you run a command.
Also, because the working copy is a commit, commands work the same way on the
working-copy commit as on any other commit, so you can set the commit message
before you're done with the changes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/blob/main/demos/working_copy.png"><img src="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/raw/main/demos/working_copy.png"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The repo is the source of truth</h3>
<p dir="auto">With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then the update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, <code>jj restore</code> (similar to <code>git restore</code>) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and <code>jj describe</code> can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Entire repo is under version control</h3>
<p dir="auto">All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily revert to an
earlier repo state, or to simply undo a particular operation (which does not
necessarily have to be the most recent operation).</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/blob/main/demos/operation_log.png"><img src="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/raw/main/demos/operation_log.png"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Conflicts can be recorded in commits</h3>
<p dir="auto">If an operation results in <a href="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/blob/main/docs/glossary.md#conflict">conflicts</a>, information
about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The operation will
succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One consequence of this
design is that there's no need to continue interrupted operations. Instead, you
get a single workflow for resolving conflicts, regardless of which command
caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase merge commits correctly
(unlike both Git and Mercurial).</p>
<p dir="auto">Basic conflict resolution:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/blob/main/demos/resolve_conflicts.png"><img src="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/raw/main/demos/resolve_conflicts.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Juggling conflicts:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/blob/main/demos/juggle_conflicts.png"><img src="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/raw/main/demos/juggle_conflicts.png"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Automatic rebase</h3>
<p dir="auto">Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Branches pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Comprehensive support for rewriting history</h3>
<p dir="auto">Besides the usual rebase command, there's <code>jj describe</code> for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There's also <code>jj diffedit</code>,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use <code>jj split</code>. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using <code>jj move</code>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Status</h2>
<p dir="auto">The tool is quite feature-complete, but some important features like (the
equivalent of) <code>git blame</code> are not yet supported. There
are also several performance bugs. It's also likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported.</p>
<p dir="auto">I (Martin von Zweigbergk) have almost exclusively used <code>jj</code> to develop the
project itself since early January 2021. I haven't had to re-clone from source
(I don't think I've even had to restore from backup).</p>
<p dir="auto">There <em>will</em> be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. Even the binary's name may change (i.e.
away from <code>jj</code>). For any format changes, we'll try to implement transparent
upgrades (as we've done with recent changes), or provide upgrade commands or
scripts if requested.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">See below for how to build from source. There are also
<a href="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/releases">pre-built binaries</a> for Windows,
Mac, or Linux (musl).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Linux</h3>
<p dir="auto">On most distributions, you'll need to build from source using <code>cargo</code> directly.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Recently, Lee et al. reported the experimental discovery of room-temperature
ambient-pressure superconductivity in a Cu-doped lead-apatite (LK-99)
(<a data-arxiv-id="2307.12008" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008">arXiv:2307.12008</a>, <a data-arxiv-id="2307.12037" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037">arXiv:2307.12037</a>). Remarkably, the superconductivity
persists up to 400 K at ambient pressure. Despite strong experimental evidence,
the electronic structure of LK-99 has not yet been studied. Here, we
investigate the electronic structures of LK-99 and its parent compound using
first-principles calculations, aiming to elucidate the doping effects of Cu.
Our results reveal that the parent compound Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O is an
insulator, while Cu doping induces an insulator-metal transition and thus
volume contraction. The band structures of LK-99 around the Fermi level are
featured by a half-filled flat band and a fully-occupied flat band. These two
flat bands arise from both the $2p$ orbitals of $1/4$-occupied O atoms and the
hybridization of the $3d$ orbitals of Cu with the $2p$ orbitals of its
nearest-neighboring O atoms. Interestingly, we observe four van Hove
singularities on these two flat bands, indicating electronic instability
towards structural distortions at low temperatures. Furthermore, we show that
the band energies of the van Hove singularities can be tuned by including
electronic correlation effects or doping with different elements. We find that
among the considered doping elements (Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag, and Au), both Ni and Zn
doping result in the gap opening, whereas Au exhibits doping effects more
similar to Cu than Ag. Our work provides a foundation for future studies on the
role of unique electronic structures of LK-99 in superconductivity.

<p>As of July 2023, it seems AI might be bottlenecked by the supply of GPUs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One reason the AI boom is being underestimated is the GPU/TPU shortage. This shortage is causing all kinds of limits on product rollouts and model training but these are not visible. Instead all we see is Nvidia spiking in price. Things will accelerate once supply meets demand.”</p>

<p>It’s a good soundbite to remind the world how much users love your product, but it’s also true that OpenAI needs more GPUs.</p>

<p>For Azure/Microsoft:</p>

<li>They are rate limiting employees on GPUs internally. They have to queue up like it was a university mainframe in the 1970s. I think OpenAI is sucking up all of it right now.</li>
<li>The Coreweave deal is all about pasting on their GPU infrastructure.</li>

<p>In short: Yes, there’s a supply shortage of H100 GPUs. I’m told that for companies seeking 100s or 1000s of H100s, Azure and GCP are effectively out of capacity, and AWS is close to being out.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>This “out of capacity” is based on the allocations that Nvidia gave them.</p>

<p>For companies using private clouds (CoreWeave, Lambda), of companies with hundreds or thousands of H100s, it’s almost all LLMs, and some diffusion model work. Some of it is fine-tuning of existing models, but mostly it’s new startups that you may not yet know about that are building new models from scratch. They’re doing $10mm-50mm contracts done over 3 years, with a few hundred to a few thousand GPUs.</p>
<p>For companies using on-demand H100s with a handful of GPUs, it’s still probably &gt;50% LLM related usage.</p>
<p>Private clouds are now starting to see inbound demand from enterprises who would normally be going with their default big cloud provider, but everyone is out.</p>

<p>Mostly H100s. Why? It’s the fastest both for inference and training for LLMs. (The H100 is often also the best price-performance ratio for inference, too)</p>
<p>Specifically: 8-GPU HGX H100 SXM servers.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>honestly not sure about [it being the best price-performance ratio]? price/performance for training looks about the same for A100 as for H100. for inference, we find that A10Gs are more than enough and much cheaper.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>this [A10G’s being more than enough] was true for a while. but in the world of falcon 40b and llama2 70b, which we’re seeing a lot of usage for, it’s not true anymore. we need A100s for these</p>
<p>2xA100s to be exact. so the interconnect speed matters for inference.</p>

<p>For training they tend to want H100s, for inference it’s much more about performance per dollar.</p>
<p>It’s still a performance per dollar question with H100s vs A100s, but H100s are generally favored as they can scale better with higher numbers of GPUs and give faster training times, and speed / compressing time to launch or train or improve models is critical for startups.</p>

<p>H100 is preferred because it is up to 3x more efficient, but the costs are only (1.5 - 2x). Combined with the overall system cost, H100 yields much more performance per dollar (if you look at system performance, probably 4-5x more performance per dollar).</p>

<p>GPUs are the most expensive individual component, but there are other costs.</p>
<p>System RAM and NVMe SSDs are expensive.</p>
<p>InfiniBand networking is costly.</p>
<p>10-15% of total cost for running a cluster might go to power and hosting (electricity, cost of the datacenter building, cost of the land, staff) - roughly split between the two, can be 5-8% for power and 5-10% for other elements of hosting cost (land, building, staff).</p>

<p>It’s mostly networking and reliable datacenters. AWS is difficult to work with because of network limitations and unreliable hardware</p>
<p>— Deep learning researcher</p>

<h4 id="what-about-gpudirect">What About GPUDirect? <span><a href="#what-about-gpudirect" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h4>
<p>GPUDirect is not a critical requirement, but can be helpful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would not say it is supercritical, but it makes a difference in performance. I guess it depends on where your bottleneck is. For some architectures / software implementations, the bottleneck is not necessarily networking, but if it is GPUDirect can make a difference of 10-20%, and that are some pretty significant numbers for expensive training runs.</p>
<p>That being said, GPUDirect RDMA is now so ubiquitous that it goes almost without saying that it is supported. I think support is less strong for non-InfiniBand networking, but most GPU clusters optimized for neural network training have Infiniband networks / cards. A bigger factor for performance might be NVLink, since this is rarer than Infiniband, but it is also only critical if you have particular parallelization strategies.</p>
<p>So features like strong networking and GPUDirect allows you to be lazy and you can guarantee that naive software is better out of the box. But it is not a strict requirement if you care about cost or using infrastructure that you already have.</p>

<p>Mostly people will want to buy H100s and use them for training and inference and switch their A100s to be used primarily for inference. But, some people might be hesitant to switch due to cost, capacity, the risk of using new hardware and setting it up, and their existing software being already optimized for A100s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, A100s will become today’s V100s in a few years. I don’t know of anyone training LLMs on V100s right now because of performance constraints. But they are still used in inference and other workloads. Similarly, A100 pricing will come down as more AI companies shift workloads to H100s, but there will always be demand, especially for inference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>think it’s also plausible some of the startups that raised huge rounds end up folding and then there’s a lot of A100s coming back on the market</p>
<p>– (Different) Private cloud exec</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over time people will move and the A100s will be more used for inference.</p>
<p>What about V100s? Higher VRAM cards are better for large models, so cutting edge groups much prefer H100s or A100s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main reason for not using V100 is the lack of brainfloat16 (bfloat16, BF16) data type. Without that, its very difficult to train models easily. The poor performance of OPT and BLOOM can be mostly attributed to not having this data type (OPT was trained in float16, BLOOM’s prototyping was mostly done in fp16, which did not yield data was generalized to the training run which was done in bf16)</p>

<p>1x DGX H100 (SXM) with 8x H100 GPUs is $460k including the required support. $100k of the $460k is required support. The specs are below. Startups can get the Inception discount which is about $50k off, and can be used on up to 8x DGX H100 boxes for a total of 64 H100s.</p>

<p>1x HGX H100 (SXM) with 8x H100 GPUs is between $300k-380k, depending on the specs (networking, storage, ram, CPUs) and the margins of whoever is selling it and the level of support. The higher end of that range, $360k-380k including support, is what you might expect for identical specs to a DGX H100.</p>
<p>1x HGX H100 (PCIe) with 8x H100 GPUs is approx $300k including support, depending on specs.</p>
<p>PCIe cards are around $30k-32k market prices.</p>
<p>SXM cards aren’t really sold as single cards, so it’s tough to give pricing there. Generally only sold as 4-GPU and 8-GPU servers.</p>
<p>Around 70-80% of the demand is for SXM H100s, the rest is for PCIe H100s. And the SXM portion of the demand is trending upwards, because PCIe cards were the only ones available for the first few months. Given most companies buy 8-GPU HGX H100s (SXM), the approximate spend is $360k-380k per 8 H100s, including other server components.</p>
<p>The DGX GH200 (which as a reminder, contains 256x GH200s, and each GH200 contains 1x H100 GPU and 1x Grace CPU) might cost in the range of $15mm-25mm - though this is a guess, not based on a pricing sheet.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>

<p>GCP has approx 25k H100s. Azure probably has 10k-40k H100s. Should be similar for Oracle. Most of Azure’s capacity is going to OpenAI.</p>

<p>OpenAI might want 50k. Inflection wants 22k.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> Meta maybe 25k (I’m told actually Meta wants 100k or more). Big clouds might want 30k each (Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, plus Oracle). Lambda and CoreWeave and the other private clouds might want 100k total. Anthropic, Helsing, Mistral, Character, might want 10k each. Total ballparks and guessing, and some of that is double counting both the cloud and the end customer who will rent from the cloud. But that gets to about 432k H100s. At approx $35k a piece, that’s about $15b worth of GPUs. That also excludes Chinese companies like ByteDance (TikTok), Baidu, and Tencent who will want a lot of H800s.</p>
<p>There are also financial companies each doing deployments starting with hundreds of A100s or H100s and going to thousands of A/H100s: names like Jane Street, JP Morgan, Two Sigma, Citadel.</p>
<p>How does that compare to Nvidia’s data center revenue?</p>
<p>Feb-April 2023 was $4.28b data center revenue.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> May-July 2023 might be around $8b data center revenue, assuming most of the higher guidance for that quarter is due to gain in data center revenue rather than other segments.</p>
<p>So might take a while for the supply shortage to go away. But also all my ballparks could be wildly overstated, and many of these companies aren’t going to go right out and buy the H100s today, they’ll upgrade over time. Plus, Nvidia is aggressively ramping production capacity.</p>

<p>The main things to keep in mind as you go onto the next section are that most of the big CSPs (Azure, AWS, GCP, and also Oracle) and private clouds (CoreWeave, Lambda, and various others) want more H100s than they can get access to. Most of the big AI product companies want more H100s than they can get access to, as well. Generally they want 8-GPU HGX H100 boxes with SXM cards, which cost approx $300k-400k per 8-GPU server depending on specs and support. There may be a few hundred thousand H100 GPUs worth of excess demand ($15b+ of GPUs). With a limited supply, Nvidia could purely raise prices to find a clearing price, and are doing that to some extent. But it’s important to know that ultimately H100 allocation comes down to who Nvidia prefers to give that allocation to.</p>

<p>It’d be a staggered deployment. Say it was a 5,000 GPU order. They might get access to 2,000 or 4,000 in 4-5 months and then the remaining by around 6 months total.</p>

<p>Not really. Startups will generally go to big clouds like Oracle to rent access, or to private clouds like Lambda and CoreWeave, or to providers that work with OEMs and data centers like FluidStack.</p>

<p>For building a datacenter, the considerations are the time to build the datacenter, whether you have the people and experience in hardware, and that it’s capex expensive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much easier to rent &amp; colo servers. If you want to build your own DC, you literally have to run a dark fiber line out to your location to connect to the internet - $10k per km. Most of this infra was already built &amp; paid for during dot-com boom. Now you can just rent it, quite cheap</p>
<p>– Private cloud exec</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spectrum from rent to own is: on-demand cloud (pure rental using cloud services), reserved cloud, colo (buy the servers, work with a provider to host and manage the servers), self-hosting (buy and host the servers yourself).</p>
<p>Most startups needing large H100 quantities will do either reserved cloud or colo.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-the-big-clouds-compare">How Do The Big Clouds Compare? <span><a href="#how-do-the-big-clouds-compare" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3>
<p>The sentiment is that Oracle infrastructure is less reliable than the big 3 clouds. In exchange, Oracle gives more tech support help and time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>100%. a big feeder of unhappy customers lol</p>
<p>– Private cloud exec</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>i think [oracle has] better networking though</p>
<p>– (Different) Private cloud exec</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally startups will pick whoever offers the best blend of support, price, and capacity.</p>
<p>The main big differences at the large clouds are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Networking (AWS and Google Cloud have been slower to adopt InfiniBand because they have their own approaches, though most startups looking for large A100/H100 clusters are seeking InfiniBand)</li>
<li>Availability (Azure’s H100s are mostly going to OpenAI. GCP is struggling to get H100s.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nvidia seems to tend to give better allocations to clouds that aren’t building competing machine learning chips. (This is all speculation, not hard facts.) All of the big 3 clouds are working on machine learning chips, but the Nvidia-alternative offerings from AWS and Google are already available and taking dollars that might’ve gone to Nvidia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>also speculation but i agree that nvidia likes oracle for this reason</p>
<p>– Private cloud exec</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some big clouds have better pricing than others. As one private cloud exec noted, “a100s are much more expensive on aws/azure than gcp for instance.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>oracle told me they have “10s of thousands of H100s” coming online later this year. they boasted about their special relationship with nvidia.</p>
<p>but… when it came to pricing, they were way higher than anyone else. they didn’t give me H100 pricing but for A100 80gb they quoted me close to $4/hour, which is nearly 2x more than gcp’s quote for the same hw and same commit.</p>
<p>– Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The smaller clouds are better for pricing, except in some instances where the one of the big clouds does a weird deal in exchange for equity.</p>
<p>It might be something like: Oracle &amp; Azure &gt; GCP &amp; AWS in terms of Nvidia relationship. But that’s speculation.</p>
<p>Oracle was the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/nvidia-a100-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-092220/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first to launch A100s</a>, and they worked with Nvidia to <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/nvidia-chooses-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-for-ai-services-2023-03-21/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">host an NVIDIA-based cluster</a>.

<p>Azure, CoreWeave and Lambda all use InfiniBand. Oracle has good networking, it is 3200 Gbps, but it’s ethernet rather than InfiniBand, which may be around 15-20% slower than IB for use cases like high-parameter count LLM training. AWS and GCP’s networking isn’t as good.</p>

<p>In one private datapoint of about 15 enterprises, all 15 were either AWS, GCP or Azure, zero Oracle.</p>
<p>Most enterprises will stick with their existing cloud. Desperate startups will go wherever the supply is.</p>

<p>The ultimate bottleneck is getting allocation from Nvidia.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-nvidia-allocations-work">How Do Nvidia Allocations Work? <span><a href="#how-do-nvidia-allocations-work" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h4>
<p>They have an allocation they give per customer. But for example, Azure saying “hey we would like 10,000 H100s all to be used by Inflection” is different from Azure saying “hey we would like 10,000 H100s for Azure’s cloud” - Nvidia cares about who the end customer is, and so clouds might be able to get an extra allocation for a specific end customer if Nvidia is excited about the end customer. Nvidia also wants to know who that end customer is, as much as possible. And they prefer customers with nice brand names or startups with strong pedigrees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, this seems to be the case. NVIDIA likes to guarantee GPU access to rising AI companies (many of which they have a close relationship with). See Inflection — an AI company they invested in — testing a huge H100 cluster on CoreWeave, which they also invested in</p>
<p>– Private cloud exec</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a cloud brings Nvidia an end customer and says they’re ready to purchase xxxx H100s, if Nvidia is excited about that end customer they’ll generally give an allocation, which effectively boosts the total capacity allocated by Nvidia to that cloud - because it won’t count against the original allocation that Nvidia gave to that cloud.</p>
<p>It’s a unique situation in that Nvidia is giving large allocations to private clouds: CoreWeave has more H100s than GCP.</p>
<p>Nvidia would prefer not to give large allocations to companies that are attempting to compete directly with them (AWS Inferentia and Tranium, Google TPUs, Azure Project Athena).</p>
<p>But ultimately, if you put the purchase order and money in front of Nvidia, committing to a bigger deal and more money up front and show that you have a low risk profile, then you’ll get a larger allocation than others get.</p>
<!-- ## Open questions

When will we see dozens of enterprises (not the companies training the LLMs, I mean the companies using them) using LLMs in a way that gets them increased profits? When will we see dozens of enterprises using LLMs in a way that gets them increased profits, and more satisfied end users? How will those timelines differ for closed LLMs vs open source LLMs? -->
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts <span><a href="#closing-thoughts" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2>
<p>For now, we are GPU-limited. Even if we are at the “end of the era where it’s going to be these giant models” as Sam Altman has said.</p>
<p>It’s both bubble-ish and not-bubble-ish depending on where you look. Some companies like OpenAI have products like ChatGPT with intense product-market-fit, and can’t get enough GPUs. Other companies are buying or reserving GPU capacity so they’ll have access in the future, or to train LLMs that are much less likely to have product-market-fit.</p>
<p>Nvidia is the green king of the castle right now.</p>
<h3 id="tracing-the-journey-of-gpu-supply-and-demand">Tracing The Journey Of GPU Supply And Demand <span><a href="#tracing-the-journey-of-gpu-supply-and-demand" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3>
<p>The LLM product with the strongest product-market fit is ChatGPT. Here’s the story of GPU demand with respect to ChatGPT:</p>
<ol>
<li>Users love ChatGPT. It’s probably making $500mm++ annual recurring revenue.</li>
<li>ChatGPT runs on the GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 APIs.</li>
<li>The GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 APIs need GPUs to run. Lots of them. And OpenAI wants to release more features for ChatGPT and their APIs, but they can’t, because they don’t have access to enough GPUs.</li>
<li>They buy lots of Nvidia GPUs through Microsoft/Azure. Specifically the GPU they want most is the Nvidia H100 GPU.</li>
<li>To make H100 SXM GPUs, Nvidia uses TSMC for fabrication and uses TSMC’s CoWoS packaging tech and uses HBM3 primarily from SK Hynix.</li>
</ol>
<p>OpenAI isn’t the only company that wants GPUs (but they are the company with the strongest product-market-fit that wants GPUs). Other companies are also wanting to train large AI models. Some of these use cases will make sense, but some are more hype driven and unlikely to get product-market-fit. This is pushing up demand. Also, some companies are concerned about not being able to access GPUs in the future so they’re placing their orders now even when they don’t need them yet. So there’s a bit of “expectations of supply shortages create even more supply shortages” going on.</p>
<p>The other major contributor to GPU demand is from companies that want to create new LLMs. Here’s the story of GPU demand with respect to companies wanting to build new LLMs:</p>
<ol>
<li>A company executive or founder knows there’s big opportunities in the AI space. Maybe they’re an enterprise that wants to train an LLM on their own data and use it externally or sell access, or maybe they’re a startup that wants to build an LLM and sell access.</li>
<li>They know they need GPUs to train large models.</li>
<li>They talk with some set of people from the big clouds (Azure, Google Cloud, AWS) to try and get many H100s.</li>
<li>They find out that they can’t get a big allocation from the big clouds, and that some of the big clouds don’t have good networking setups. So they go and talk with other providers like CoreWeave, Oracle, Lambda, FluidStack. If they want to buy the GPUs themselves and own them, maybe they also talk with OEMs and Nvidia.</li>
<li>Eventually, they acquire a lot of GPUs.</li>
<li>Now, they try and get product-market-fit.</li>
<li>In case it’s not obvious, this pathway isn’t as good - remember that OpenAI got product-market-fit on much smaller models and then scaled them up. But, now to get product-market-fit you have to be better than OpenAI’s models for your users’ use-cases, so to start you will need more GPUs than OpenAI started with.</li>
</ol>
<p>Expect H100 shortages for multi-hundred or multi-thousand deployments through the end of 2023 at least. At the end of 2023 the picture will be clearer, but for now it looks like the shortages may persist through some of 2024 as well.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  A recent report of room temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure in
Cu-substituted apatite (`LK99') has invigorated interest in the understanding
of what materials and mechanisms can allow for high-temperature
superconductivity. Here I perform density functional theory calculations on
Cu-substituted lead phosphate apatite, identifying correlated isolated flat
bands at the Fermi level, a common signature of high transition temperatures in
already established families of superconductors. I elucidate the origins of
these isolated bands as arising from a structural distortion induced by the Cu
ions and a chiral charge density wave from the Pb lone pairs. These results
suggest that a minimal two-band model can encompass much of the low-energy
physics in this system. Finally, I discuss the implications of my results on
possible superconductivity in Cu-doped apatite

<p>For many years, those in the know in the tech world have known that “artificial intelligence” is a scam. It’s been true for so long in Silicon Valley that it was true before there even was a Silicon Valley.
            </p><!-- /embeded-collection -->
          



<p>That’s not to say that AI hadn’t done impressive things, solved real problems, generated real wealth and worthy endowed professorships. But peek under the hood of Tesla’s “Autopilot” mode and you would find odd glitches, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-was-staged-engineer-testifies-2023-01-17/">frustrated promise</a>, and, well, still quite a lot of <em>peopl</em><em>e</em> hidden away in backrooms manually plugging gaps in the system, often in real time. Study Deep Blue’s 1997 defeat of world chess champion Garry Kasparov, and your excitement about how quickly this technology would take over other cognitive work would wane as you learned just how much brute human force went into fine-tuning the software specifically to beat Kasparov. Read press release after press release of <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/how-facebook-uses-super-efficient-ai-models-to-detect-hate-speech/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/blog/success-stories/hatelab">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-update-on-our-commitment-to-fight/">YouTube</a> promising to use more machine learning to fight hate speech and save democracy — and then find out that the new thing was mostly a handmaid to armies of human grunts, and for many years relied on a technological paradigm that was decades old.</p>



<p>Call it AI’s man-behind-the-curtain effect: What appear at first to be dazzling new achievements in artificial intelligence routinely lose their luster and seem limited, one-off, jerry-rigged, with nothing all <em>that</em> impressive happening behind the scenes aside from sweat and tears, certainly nothing that deserves the name “intelligence” even by loose analogy.</p>



<p>So what’s different now? What follows in this essay is an attempt to contrast some of the most notable features of the new transformer paradigm (the T in ChatGPT) with what came before. It is an attempt to articulate why the new AIs that have garnered so much attention over the past year seem to defy some of the major lines of skepticism that have rightly applied to past eras — why this AI moment might, just might, be the real deal.</p>


<div>
  
	<h5>
		Men Behind Curtains	</h5>
</div>


<p>Artificial intelligence pioneer Joseph Weizenbaum originated the man-behind-the-curtain critique in his 1976 book <em>Computer Power and Human Reason</em>. Weizenbaum was the inventor of ELIZA, the world’s first chatbot. Imitating a psychotherapist who was just running through the motions to hit the one-hour mark, it worked by <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/06/eliza-part-1/">parroting people’s queries back at them</a>: “I am sorry to hear you are depressed.” “Tell me more about your family.” But Weizenbaum was alarmed to find that users would ask to have privacy with the chatbot, and then spill their deepest secrets to it. They did this even when he told them that ELIZA did not understand them, that it was just a few hundred lines of dirt-stupid computer code. He spent the rest of his life warning of how susceptible the public was to believing that the lights were on and someone was home, even when no one was.</p>



<p>I experienced this effect firsthand as a computer science student at the University of Texas at Austin in the 2000s, even though the field by this time was nominally much more advanced. Everything in our studies seemed to point us toward the semester where we would qualify for the Artificial Intelligence course. Sure, you knew that nothing like HAL 9000 existed yet. But the <em>building blocks</em> of intelligence, you understood, had been cracked — it was right there in the course title.</p>



<p>When Alan Turing and Claude Shannon and John von Neumann were shaping the building blocks of computing in the 1940s, the words “computer science” would have seemed aspirational too — just like “artificial intelligence,” nothing then was really worthy of that name. But in due time these blocks were arranged into a marvelous edifice. So there was a titter surrounding the course: Someone someday would do the same for AI, and maybe, just maybe, it would be you.</p>



<p>The reality was different. The state of the art at the time was neural nets, and it had been for twenty or thirty years. Neural nets were good at solving some basic pattern-matching problems. For an app I was building to let students plan out their course schedules, I used neural nets to match a list of textbook titles and author names to their corresponding entries on Amazon. This allowed my site to make a few bucks through referral fees, an outcome that would have been impossible for a college-student side hustle if not for AI research. So it worked — mostly, narrowly, sort of — but it was brittle: Adjust the neural net to resolve one set of false matches and you would create three more. It could be tuned, but it had no responsiveness, no real grasp. <em>That’s it?</em>, you had to think. There was no way, however many “neurons” you added to the net, however much computing power you gave it, that you could imagine arranging these building blocks into any grand edifice. And so the more impressed people sounded when you mentioned using this technology, the more cynicism you had to adopt about the entire enterprise.<strong></strong></p>



<p>All of this is to say that skepticism about the new AI moment we are in rests on very solid ground. We have seen “this AI moment is real” moments over and over and over going back as far as the 1950s. In spirit it traces back to the Mechanical Turk, a supposed automaton built in 1770 that played chess at an advanced level, but worked only because hidden away inside it was a human player working its gears, a literal man behind the curtain.</p>



<p>Several aspects of our current AI moment do deserve to remain on that skeptical ground. Some observers see consciousness in ChatGPT or sentience in Midjourney; they are deceived. The subject of central fixation in the tech world right now is existential risk: AI that takes over the world and destroys the human species. It’s right to worry about this, but as of yet it is still difficult to imagine a plausible path from the new class of AI to a Skynet scenario. Too much focus on this worry risks downplaying somewhat less apocalyptic but more likely scenarios of social disruption, like dramatic upheavals in jobs. Finally, hype and alarmism about AI will inevitably be used to advance stupid, self-interested, or beside-the-point pet causes. We are already seeing a push to follow the Tech Backlash playbook and frame AI as a “misinformation problem,” a “disparate impact problem,” a “privacy problem.” All of these are limited frameworks for defining this class of AI, and will need to be resisted as such.</p>



<p>But on the whole, it may be time to abandon deep skepticism and seek higher ground. The titter in the air is back, and a great many people feel it now: Something about this moment really does feel different. For once, they may have good reason to feel this way.</p>



<p>Here are a few reasons why.</p>


<div>
  
	<h5>
		1. It’s generalized, not specialized.	</h5>
</div>


<p>The single most notable feature of the new class of AI is just how <em>many</em> different things it can do, and do to a level that, even if we don’t feel a full human imitation has been achieved, at least causes us to feel we are confronting a serious rival.</p>



<p>All past AI paradigms, whatever remarkable things they have achieved, have ultimately been specialized in scope. Even if Tesla’s autonomous driver is one day fully ready for the road, there is no set of basic tweaks that will allow it to run an air-traffic control center or ace the MCAT. But transformers offer just this sort of open-ended promise.</p>



<p>As we will see, the new class of AI techniques are best understood not as a disparate jumble but a new technological paradigm, perhaps even a single continuous technology. But since ChatGPT occupies such a large amount of our attention right now, we can recognize the point even just by looking at this single realization of transformers. GPT-4 <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4">has passed nearly every major standardized academic test at remarkable levels</a>, achieving scores in the 80th or 90th percentile on nearly every one:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SullyOmarr/status/1644160222733406214">One programmer used AutoGPT</a>, an extension of ChatGPT, to create a basic, useable social media app in under three minutes.</p>



<p>Go ahead — ask it to offer you a tutorial to apply for a U.S. green card, talk to you like a ‘90s valley girl, or write a formally correct Shakespearean sonnet. Or ask it to offer you a tutorial on how to apply for a U.S. green card using ‘90s valley-girl language and in the form of a Shakespearean sonnet. It may not offer the best, funniest, or most beautiful possible response to any of these questions, but it will offer something fairly persuasive for all of them. This is a novel and remarkable feat.</p>


<div>
  
	<h5>
		2. It can understand natural language.	</h5>
</div>


<p>Just as significant are transformers’ persuasive facility with natural languages — meaning not code or math but everyday speech: English, Arabic, Mandarin.</p>



<p>A convincing imitation of natural language comprehension, demonstrated through written question-and-answer exchanges, has been a holy grail of AI since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Alan Turing proposed it in 1950</a>. In some sense, most of us have already interacted with computers in this way for a long time. Instead of typing in, say, “alternator replace manual elantra,” many of us will ask Google this question:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>how to replace alternator hyundai elantra</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Or even:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>How do I replace the alternator on my Hyundai Elantra?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But most of us also know that Google will handle all three queries using the same basic techniques of simple keyword association. And we know that the structural cues of a complete English sentence, which make the last query so much easier for us to write and read, don’t make a difference to the machine.</p>



<p>Some years after my undergrad education in computer science, I worked as, if you can believe the title, an Ontological Engineer on the Cyc project (pronounced like “psych”) in Austin, Texas. Cyc is a rarity: a project that has endured since the era of symbolic AI, which began the field in the 1950s and dominated for four decades. To many in the field, that makes it an odd holdover.</p>



<p>From the earliest days of AI, researchers found that it was very easy to get computers to “understand” mathematical language, and so to mimic the way people do mathematical reasoning, and in some cases do it much more efficiently. But it was very hard to get computers to do the same thing for natural languages.</p>



<p>Cyc wants to solve this problem. Its grand goal is nothing less than to capture the knowledge that is stored in human speech, to build a library of the world. It doesn’t just want to store that knowledge in words people can understand, as Wikipedia does. It wants to actually capture the structure of natural language, so that Cyc itself can reason about the world.</p>



<p>Cyc is considered quixotic by its peers, because it has stuck with trying to model the world even as the field has moved on to a statistical approach that favors raw association and brute computing force. But there is a reason Cyc has persisted for so long: there are many things it can do that newer systems couldn’t. For one thing, even though the statistical approaches that began to dominate in the 1990s solved more and more problems, typically even researchers could not explain <em>wh</em><em>y</em> they had arrived at the answers they gave. But Cyc’s approach is explicit. It can explain its reasoning in intricate detail, presenting it in a form that people can check and engage with.</p>



<p>And Cyc can do <em>dee</em><em>p</em> reasoning.</p>



<p>For instance, if at that time you asked Google or WolframAlpha, a much-celebrated answer engine, a question like this —</p>



<blockquote>
<p>How tall was the president when JFK was born?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>— they would usually spit back this answer: 49 feet. With the full data of the Internet at its disposal, Google was good at finding the likeliest associations between the terms “tall,” “JFK,” and “born,” but the likeliest association was the elevation of Brookline, Massachusetts, the town where John F. Kennedy was born.</p>



<p>This was the power and the limit of AI based on raw association among massive amounts of data. The grammatical structure that would allow a human being to easily pull apart the nested, dependent layers of the question, and to realize that the sentence was asking after the person who was president in 1917, not 1961, was beyond the power of the statistical state of the art. The popular search-and-answer engines of the day were really only an improvement by degrees from Ask Jeeves, the 1990s search engine that became a punchline.</p>



<p>Cyc can beat this problem. You can put this same query to it and get the correct answer: 5’11”, the height of Woodrow Wilson. “Google’s 70 billion facts can answer 70 billion questions,” writes Doug Lenat, the mastermind behind the project, “but Cyc’s 15 million rules and assertions can answer trillions of trillions of trillions of queries — just like you and I can — because it can reason a few steps deep with/about what it knows.”</p>



<p>But there are catches. Yes, the requisite facts about the world can all be explicitly stored in the system: generalized propositions, like that all human beings have a height and a place of birth, and that all presidents have a beginning and ending date of their presidency; and specific facts, like JFK and Woodrow Wilson’s birth year, height, and dates of administration. But these are stored in a symbolic, logical language that doesn’t have the same easy readability of natural language. This means that some work is required of a user to translate the structure of the sentence in her head into the <a href="https://cyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cyc-Technology-Overview.pdf">explicit symbolic grammar of the system</a> — much as it takes an extra step to translate the sentence “Mary has two apples” into the equation “M = 2.”</p>



<p>And truly Herculean work was required of the engineers to put all of that knowledge into the system in the first place. That was the job of the army of Ontological Engineers, of which I was a grunt, contributing a tiny share of the 2,000 person-years the company says have been spent building its reasoning library. It was a fascinating project, especially to obsessive organizers and analyzers like myself, a Jorge Luis Borges story come to life. I was engrossed by the task of working out the system’s kinks, and I believed it could accomplish great things. But I never felt that it would challenge humanity’s unique rational status, any more than computers that could solve equations did. To their credit, I never heard the project engineers say that it would either.</p>



<p>So what about ChatGPT? The latest version dispenses with these kinds of queries with apparent ease. Moreover, the entire exchange plays out directly in natural language:</p>

<div>
  
	<h5>
		3. It understands context.	</h5>
</div>


<p>The next thing we must recognize about Large Language Models is their facility with <em>context</em>. This is integral to their abilities with natural language.</p>



<p>Consider again the question above about JFK. In order to grasp it, ChatGPT must fill in a lot of information we have left unstated. Notice, for example, that “president” could mean many different things, but that it inferred correctly that we meant “president of the United States” rather than “president of Mexico” or “president of the Ironworkers Union,” and that it made this inference without having to ask us to clarify.</p>



<p>This type of contextual information is so deeply embedded in human conversation that we rarely notice it. But it has long been the Achilles heel of AI.</p>



<p>In the 1960s, the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, one of the earliest and most vocal critics of the AI project, noticed the ironic fact that researchers had found it easier to get computers to perform supposedly high-cognition tasks than low-cognition ones. Computers could prove mathematical theorems and play chess, but <a href="https://uh.edu/~garson/DreyfusLecture1.htm">when presented with children’s stories</a> a few sentences long and asked questions about them, they were easily beaten by four-year-olds. The elite, rule-bound, abstract intelligence that engineers admired <em>in themselves</em> was already rather computer-like, while universal human capacities for real-world cognition were elusive for AI.</p>



<p>Dreyfus argued that AI might be doomed to falter on tasks that highly depended on context that was unstated, and perhaps unstatable. He was influenced by the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, who asked, as Dreyfus put it, about “the kind of issue which would arise if someone asked whether the world hasn’t started only five minutes ago.” The kinds of questions that have to be answered in order to satisfy us that this is not the case — that the world did not just begin five minutes ago — have no natural end. It would be impossible to say much of anything about anything if we had to resolve this sort of doubt before we spoke. But most of us also do not walk around with the sentence “The world is more than 5 minutes old,” and an associated train of justification, already lurking in our heads somewhere and ready to be called up at a moment’s notice. Rather, that the world must have been around for some time is implicit in our <em>posture</em>, our stance toward the world. The specific ideas that <em>coul</em><em>d</em> be grounded in that posture are infinite, impossible to fully encode. We can only get a real grasp on the world — the kind that would allow us to make sense of a request to answer questions about a children’s story, stack a red block on a blue one, or reason about the heights of presidents when other presidents were born — from the sure footing of a posture we largely don’t notice. People have a posture and computers don’t.</p>



<p>Here is an example of the kind of problem where context is especially important. Consider this sentence:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I left my raincoat in the bathtub because it was still wet.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What is “it”? The raincoat, the bathtub, or something else?</p>



<p>In an ordinary household conversation, say, amid the hurry of getting dinner ready, nearly everyone will grasp what “it” refers to. And we will do so implicitly, without having to stop and put the puzzle pieces together. That is because your posture toward the world includes tacit grasp of a number of relevant relationships that, if a situation called for it, we could put into words:</p>



<ul>
<li>That when bathtubs are wet indoors, they do not require special handling to dry out, whereas raincoats do.</li>



<li>That placing a raincoat in a bathtub is a good way to help a raincoat dry, but not a good way to help a bathtub dry.</li>



<li>That if you tell someone that you left X in Y place, X is more at stake in the statement than Y.</li>
</ul>



<p>And so on. These are better thought of as implicit elements of your posture, rather than explicit elements of your library of knowledge, because most of these are things you know without ever having explicitly had to think them out in those terms, unlike the way you once had to memorize that Abraham Lincoln was from Illinois. All of this goes into your ability to disambiguate the sentence, without thinking about it, when you hear it.</p>



<p>So a very important thing to admire about ChatGPT is that it can typically handle this sort of sentence correctly:</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1081" height="404" src="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schulman-image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schulman-image-3.png 1081w, https://www.thenewatlantis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schulman-image-3-640x239.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1081px) 100vw, 1081px"></figure></div>


<p>Another example:</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1088" height="830" src="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schulman-image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schulman-image-4.png 1088w, https://www.thenewatlantis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schulman-image-4-640x488.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px"></figure></div>


<p>An exercise: List everything the AI grasped that I didn’t tell it.</p>


<div>
  
	<h5>
		4. It is responsive.	</h5>
</div>


<p>Already, ChatGPT is notorious for certain limitations. It contradicts itself and makes things up. It will produce bibliographies of sources that don’t exist. Far from seeming obsolete, Cyc may well be sitting pretty: designed for applications where perfectly clear, reliable reasoning is paramount, it retains a distinct advantage, one that may seem all the more valuable as the world ever more grapples with AI hallucinations.</p>



<p>And yet: that AI now has this problem at all is remarkable. ChatGPT is better at b.s.ing than at saying the plain truth. It is more the student trying to impress than the learned professor telling it like it is, more slick pundit than coolly rational Mr. Spock. But which sort of intelligence is more familiarly human? As Mark Halpern wrote in these pages in 2006:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>what Turing grasped better than most of his followers is that the characteristic sign of the ability to think is not giving correct answers, but <em>responsive</em> ones — replies that show an understanding of the remarks that prompted them…. The belief that a hidden entity is thinking depends heavily on the words he addresses to us being not re-hashings of the words we just said to him…. By this criterion, no computer, however sophisticated, has come anywhere near real thinking.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Is this last sentence still true? Yes, ChatGPT does not have the full capacity for closed reasoning found in Cyc — the ability to describe the entire chain of logic behind an answer, and the cold rational trustworthiness that comes along with this. But what it can do is make implicit context explicit, and attempt to correct itself (often imperfectly) when its errors are noted. It displays an open-ended capacity to respond. It can account for itself.</p>


<div>

<div>
  
	<h5>
		5. Its apparent grasp of the world is flexible, implicit, and general.	</h5>
</div>


<p>Previous AI systems have either not been able to handle ambiguity problems of the JFK or raincoat variety, or have done so only through Herculean feats of explicit encoding, logic, and world-modeling. Yes, the key learning processes have required a great deal of fine-tuning and human sweat to get right. But the public descriptions of ChatGPT suggest that it <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence-writing-ethics/672386/">functions largely by <em>lacking</em> much ontology</a> — that is, a structured, explicit account of the world, of the kind I once helped refine. It does not work by hiring armies of engineers who exhaustively enter facts about the world over decades.</p>



<p>What we see suggests that ChatGPT handles problems of ambiguity and context through inferential skills that, at least considered from above the hood, bear a family resemblance to the skills we find in our own experience of natural language. It displays an open-ended, flexible, implicit orientation to the world that we would ordinarily deem a <em>posture</em>. And this posture seems to permit what we would ordinarily deem a <em>grasp</em>.</p>



<p>If so, this is a first in the history of AI.</p>


<div>
  
	<h5>
		6. The <em>way</em> it gains its grasp of the world is flexible, implicit, and general.	</h5>
</div>


<p>Some key features of how transformers work under the hood help to flesh out what we are seeing above the hood.</p>



<p><strong>They can work from a trivial footprint of code, memory, and processing.</strong> A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/26/upshot/gpt-from-scratch.html">helpful <em>New York Times</em> article</a> demonstrated the basics of Large Language Model training by creating what it called BabyGPT: an LLM that ran entirely on an ordinary laptop computer, started with no understanding of the world, trained on data sets so small they could be attached to an email, and completed its training in a few hours. One BabyGPT trained on the complete transcripts of <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, building a chatbot to produce new episode scripts; another trained on the corpus of Jane Austen and aimed to produce new Austen snippets; and so on. The results, though not as convincing or responsive as ChatGPT, were in the same ballpark of ability.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-artificial-intelligence-future-60-minutes-transcript-2023-04-16/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7d&amp;linkId=210098327">another example this year</a>, Google’s DeepMind project trained small humanoid robots to play soccer. That feat had been done before, but this time it was done without programming and intricate guidance from human engineers. Instead, the robots were given a single instruction — to score — and then, through a series of trial-and-error simulations, learned on their own the strategies to win. Here too, the new class of AI has managed to arrive at the abilities of prior AIs far faster, simpler, and more cheaply.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="888" src="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schulman-robot-soccer-3-crop.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schulman-robot-soccer-3-crop.jpg 1400w, https://www.thenewatlantis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schulman-robot-soccer-3-crop-1280x812.jpg 1280w, https://www.thenewatlantis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schulman-robot-soccer-3-crop-640x406.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"><figcaption>Robots trained to play soccer at Google DeepMind<br><cite>60 Minutes</cite></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A similar point applies across a broad range of other applications. Even with trivial computing resources, transformers have proven able to get meaningfully close to the dazzling abilities of the ChatGPT and Midjourney big boys. And they have been able to replicate tasks that had been achieved by earlier generations of AI but only with enormous expenditures of computing and custom programming — think again of the supercomputer and large research team that went into Deep Blue’s defeat of Garry Kasparov. Transformers make cheap homebrew versions of that kind of feat newly possible, and greatly expand what they can do.<strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>They all work in more or less the same way.</strong> As Tristan Harris explains in his talk “The AI Dilemma,” all the transformers we are seeing — ChatGPT, Midjourney, deepfake software — work from the same generalized principle. They translate the phenomenon they want to manipulate — text, sound, images, video, radio waves, heat measurements — to an encoding that manipulates natural language.</p>



<p>There are remarkable practical implications. But even more importantly: AI research was once ghettoized into a series of discrete fields — vision processing, image processing, natural language processing, and so on. Transformers are unifying these fields into a single research paradigm. This means that every breakthrough in one field becomes a breakthrough in the others, that every major new text dataset being learned can advance the comprehension abilities of vision AIs and vice-versa.</p>



<p>If Harris is right, we are in the first years of a new Age of Discovery for artificial intelligence, the equivalent of the discovery of the New World.<strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>The key conceptual breakthroughs were not complicated.</strong> Most of the remarkable breakthroughs we are witnessing right now trace back to just a few key theoretical innovations published over the last six years.</p>



<p>For example, many observers have argued that ChatGPT is “glorified autocomplete.” This is a mistake, as anyone who has used conventional autocorrect or voice-to-text technology should recognize. Under the hood, conventional auto-complete technology of the last twenty years has worked by generating text one character or a few characters at a time. It looks at a partially completed text and, based on a statistical analysis of its training data, predicts the likeliest next character. Then it starts the process over based on the new, slightly larger text. The training itself works in a similar way.</p>



<p>Using this method, conventional language models have been limited in how fast they can run. More importantly, their grasp of context has been limited: The method offers little ability to recognize how a word’s meaning varies based on its position in a sentence, a key function of grammar. One of the key breakthroughs was to treat a word’s position in a sentence as <em>part</em> of the training data, something the language model must directly learn and predict.</p>



<p>This, along with a small number of other key innovations, have been the cornerstones of the dramatic improvements in AI we are now witnessing. However hard won, these advances ultimately arise from a handful of “one weird tricks,” with a lot of tinkering and ironing of wrinkles needed to make these insights more than just proofs of concept.<strong></strong></p>



<p>What do these three features mean? In past AI advances, we have seen one of two things when we look under the hood. One is that the magic dissolves: like ELIZA, the apparent abilities themselves are not real. The other is that the abilities are real but much more brittle, inflexible, and narrow in scope, and more demanding of human effort than we might at first hope.</p>



<p>But now we witness a set of techniques that are flexible, implicit, and general realizing a set of abilities that are flexible, implicit, and general. This should give us significantly more confidence than we have had in the past that the abilities we’re seeing are not a cheap trick.</p>


<div>
  
	<h5>
		7. Its errors are not nonsense; they are alien.	</h5>
</div>


<p>Do transformers have a grasp of the world, or a posture toward it — or at least a persuasive imitation of the same?</p>



<p>Answering “yes” would help to make sense not just of the way the new AIs succeed, but also the ways they fail. Among other things, it would help to make some sense of the uncanny features that linger in the new flood of AI-generated images, audio, and video. Yes, much of this material still seems eerie, unnatural, inhuman. People in Midjourney images notoriously still have too many teeth or fingers, warped faces, funhouse smiles. An AI-generated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Geja6NCjgWY">beer commercial</a> looks like a horrifying Banksy parody of American consumerism, if Banksy had talent.</p>



<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hilarious &amp; Disturbing AI Generated Beer Commercial! (It gets weirder with each&nbsp;viewing)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Geja6NCjgWY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>But these kinds of errors seem hard to make sense of as mistakes of <em>logic</em>. They are easier to make sense of as a system working out the right place for parts among a coherent whole, and still making some mistakes of integration. They feel, in short, like <em>elements lost in translation</em>, the kinds of mistakes we would expect across the wide gulf between us and an agent who is not only not native to our language but not native to our bodies or our lifeworld, and yet who is making genuine strides at bridging that gulf. They seem like the mistakes less of a facile imitation of intelligence than a highly foreign intelligence, one who is stumbling toward a more solid footing in our world.</p>


<div>
  
	<h5>
		Behind the Curtain	</h5>
</div>


<p>The savvy observer has been burned many times before. He knows what it’s like to believe the AI magic show, only to have the curtain pulled back and the flimsy strings yanking the puppet revealed. It is also true that transformers are not conscious, and so not intelligent in the full sense of the word. But is that a good enough reason to deny what seems evident with our eyes? There is more than dazzling appearance at work in our sense that this AI moment is different.</p>



<p>It is also true that the commentariat has a poor recent track record of buying digital hype. Consider the mainstream backlash to social media of the past decade. It has always offered an at once gullibly alarmist and gullibly rosy picture of digital tech.</p>



<p>The Tech Backlash story has asked us, for example, to believe that Facebook’s ad targeting is so psychologically powerful that it is essentially a form of mass mind control. Like a <em>Manchurian Candidate</em> fantasy made real and scaled up to the entire Western populace, social media offers such robust targeting that it is said to have brainwashed half the country, put Donald Trump into office, and severed the British Isles from the Continent. This is a terrific story — a good yarn for bestsellers, earnest TED Talks, and multimillion-dollar indulgence grants from tech companies eager to show they’re doing their part to save democracy. The problem is that there has never been any evidence it is true, that Mark Zuckerberg knew anything more than Madison Avenue ever did about how to make consumers buy products they don’t want.</p>



<p>And yet for all the anger of the Tech Backlash, it always offered an implausibly sunny view of how easy the problem would be to fix. Improve privacy standards, muckrake out the wrongthinking tech CEOs and replace them with new ones committed to socially conscious views, add transparency to the ad systems and equity patches to the feed algorithms, and the problems would be solved. The hyperbole of the Tech Backlash actually let Big Tech off the hook, locking us into a mindset where the problem was a corrupt implementation of technology rather than corrupt technology full stop. This has been a boon for tech companies, who, instead of facing the existential threat of a public that saw their product as a new form of opioids, got away with a “we’ll do better” rehash of Standard Oil.</p>



<p>It is too early to say that the new AI class is an inherently antihuman technological paradigm, as social media has proven itself to be. But it is not too early to suspect that AIs will dwarf social media in their power to disrupt modern life. If that is so, we had better learn some new and unfamiliar ways of interrogating this technology, and fast. Whatever these entities are — they’re here.</p>

<h2>Dubious git plumbing hacks <span aria-role="hidden">🪓</span></h2>
<p>Inspired by Junio, I misused and finagled a couple of <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain">git
plumbing commands</a> to make this fake empty repo:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>git hash-object</code></li>
<li><code>git update-ref</code></li>
</ol>
<p>First, I used <code>hash-object</code> to create a dangling git
object with the <code>~/zangief.txt</code> contents.</p>
<pre><code>(/^ヮ^)/*:・ﾟ✧ mkdir /tmp/hidden-zangief &amp;&amp; cd /tmp/hidden-zangief
(/^ヮ^)/*:・ﾟ✧ git init
(/^ヮ^)/*:・ﾟ✧ git hash-object -w ~/zangief.txt
7dd9e2d2d2d8b5107d225b4708e1177abb08e7c8</code></pre>
<p>Now Zangief is lurking in your git plumbing, atomic-suplexing your
other git objects.</p>
<p>I imagine this is how Junio added his public key to the git object
database. Then he tagged it with <code>junio-gpg-pub</code> and pushed
it to the <code>git</code> repo.</p>
<p>But a tag would appear in the GitHub UI, and I wondered whether I
could hide it.</p>
<p>So I opted to abuse the wide-open git ref namespace, imagining a ref
beyond tags and branches: <code>refs/atomic/piledriver</code>.</p>
<p>Then I schlepped that ref to GitHub.</p>
<pre><code>(/^ヮ^)/*:・ﾟ✧ git update-ref refs/atomic/piledriver 7dd9e2d2d2d8b5107d225b4708e1177abb08e7c8
(/^ヮ^)/*:・ﾟ✧ git remote add origin https://github.com/thcipriani/hidden-zangief
(/^ヮ^)/*:・ﾟ✧ git push origin refs/atomic/piledriver:refs/atomic/piledriver</code></pre>
<p>And, of course, Microsoft GitHub foolishly neglects the
<code>refs/atomic/*</code> namespace in their UI, rendering our 400 lb
wrestler friend invisible.</p>
<p>Infinite magic awaits the intrepid developer willing to abuse
<code>git</code> plumbing. After all, git is just a database with a
terrible interface.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0025">https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0025</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36951289">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>In response to last week’s post, I received the following e-mail:
</p></div><div><p>“I might be a little late for a question about your recent post, but just in case I’m not:  Do you have any strategies for, or stories about, dealing with an external library that you couldn’t get rid of that violated some (or all) of these API design guidelines?  It’s a vague question, but I’m really just asking about any past experience as a user of an API that really sticks out in your mind.”</p></div><div><p>This reminded me that I’d always wanted to go write down the steps necessary to use a bad API, just to highlight how terrible it can be for the programmer.  I don’t think people who make APIs really appreciate how important it is to get them right, and how much unnecessary work their mistakes can cause for hundreds, thousands, sometimes even millions of other programmers.  So I felt like it was important to spend an article walking through an API and showing just how much unnecessary work an API can manufacture.
</p><p>It’d probably be a nice column on its own &nbsp;—&nbsp; a weekly dissection of a bad API.  But since I don’t have time for something like that, if I was only going to dissect one API, the most important question was, which API should I choose?
</p></div><div><p>Event Tracing for Windows
</p></div><div><p>It’s a great time in the history of computing to be writing an article about bad APIs (which is another way of saying it’s a terrible time to actually have to program for a living).  There’s so many bad APIs out there, I could have picked one at random and been very likely to find enough problems to fill a 3000-word article.  But if I was only going to pick apart one specific operation in one API, it seemed only right to try to pick the worst API I’d ever actually used.
</p><p>Now there are a lot of APIs out there that routinely turn in top-ranking efforts for the “worst API” leaderboard.  CSS, for example, can probably claim half the spots on the top 10 for any year in which there’s a new version.  DirectShow, while it was still a going concern, certainly dominated the rankings for its era.  And in the modern age, newcomers like the Android SDK are showing real potential with development environments so convoluted that the quality of the APIs when called from actual C++ code are the last thing you’ll worry about when trying to ship something with them.
</p><p>But when I thought long and hard about who the all-time heavyweight bad API champion was, there was one clear winner: Event Tracing for Windows.
</p><p>Event Tracing for Windows is an API that does something very simple: it allows any component of the system (including end-user software) to announce “events” which any other component can then “consume”.  It is a logging system, and it is used to record performance and debugging information by everything from the kernel upwards.
</p><p>Now, normally, a game developer would have no reason to use the Event Tracing for Windows API directly.  You can use tools like PerfMon to view logged information about your game, like how much working set it was using or how much disk I/O it did.  But there is one specific thing that directly accessing Event Tracing gives you that you can’t get anywhere else: context switch timing.
</p><p>Yes, if you have any relatively recent version of Windows (like 7 or 8), the kernel will log all thread context switches, and using the CPU timestamp included in those events, you can actually correlate them with your own in-game profiling.  This is incredibly useful information to have, and is the kind of thing you often only get from console hardware.  It’s the reason tools like <a href="http://radgametools.com/">RAD</a>’s <a href="http://www.radgametools.com/telemetry.htm">Telemetry</a> can show you when your running threads were interrupted and had to wait for system threads to do work, something that can often be critical to debugging weird performance problems.
</p><p>So far, the API is sounding pretty good.  I mean, context switch timing is very vaulable information, so even if the API was a little janky, it’d still be pretty great, right?
</p><p>Right?
</p></div><div><p>Write the Usage Code First
</p></div><div><p>Before we take a look at the actual Event Tracing for Windows API, I want to walk the walk here and do exactly what I said to do in last week’s lecture: write the usage code first.  Whenever you evaluate an API, or create a new one, you must always, always, ALWAYS start by writing some code as if you were a user trying to do the thing that the API is supposed to do.  This is the only way to get a nice, clean perspective on how the API would work if it had no constraints on it whatsoever.  If it was “magical”, as it were.  And then, once you have that, you can move forward and start thinking about the practical problems, and what the best way is for you to get to something implementable.
</p><p>So, if I were a programmer, with no knowledge of the Event Tracing for Windows API, how would I want to get a list of context switches?  Well, two methods come to mind.
</p><p>The most straightforward approach would be something like this:
</p></div></div><div><p><wbr><span>// At the beginning of the program</span><wbr></p><p><wbr>etw_event_trace <wbr>Trace <wbr>= <wbr>ETWBeginTrace();</p><p><wbr>ETWAddEventType(<wbr>Trace, <wbr>ETWType_ContextSwitch);</p><p><wbr><span>// On each frame</span><wbr></p><p><wbr>event <wbr>EventBuffer[<wbr><span>4096</span><wbr>];</p><p><wbr><span>int</span><wbr> <wbr>EventCount;</p><p><wbr><span>while</span><wbr>(<wbr>EventCount <wbr>= <wbr>ETWGetEvents(<wbr>Trace, <wbr><span>sizeof</span><wbr>(<wbr>EventBuffer), <wbr>EventBuffer))</p><p>{</p><p><wbr><span>for</span><wbr>(<wbr><span>int</span><wbr> <wbr>EventIndex <wbr>= <wbr><span>0</span><wbr>;</p><p><wbr>EventIndex <wbr>&lt; <wbr>EventCount;</p><p><wbr>++<wbr>EventIndex)</p><p>{</p><p><wbr><span>assert</span><wbr>(<wbr>EventBuffer[<wbr>EventIndex]<wbr>.<wbr>Type <wbr>== <wbr>ETWType_ContextSwitch);</p><p><wbr><span>// process EventBuffer[EventIndex].ContextSwitch here</span><wbr></p><p>}</p><p>}</p><p><wbr><span>// At the end of the program</span><wbr></p><p><wbr>ETWEndTrace(<wbr>Trace);</p></div><div><p>which would imply an API design that looks like this:
</p></div><div><p><wbr><span>enum</span><wbr> <wbr>etw_event_type</p><p>{</p><p><wbr>ETWType_None,</p><p><wbr>ETWType_ContextSwitch,</p><p><wbr><span>// ...</span><wbr></p><p><wbr>ETWType_Count,</p><p>};</p><p><wbr><span>struct</span><wbr> <wbr>etw_event_context_switch</p><p>{</p><p><wbr><span>int64_t</span><wbr> <wbr>TimeStamp;</p><p><wbr><span>uint32_t</span><wbr> <wbr>ProcessID;</p><p><wbr><span>uint32_t</span><wbr> <wbr>FromThreadID;</p><p><wbr><span>uint32_t</span><wbr> <wbr>ToThreadID;</p><p>};</p><p><wbr><span>struct</span><wbr> <wbr>etw_event</p><p>{</p><p><wbr><span>uint32_t</span><wbr> <wbr>Type; <wbr><span>// event_type</span><wbr></p><p><wbr><span>union</span><wbr></p><p>{</p><p><wbr>etw_event_context_switch <wbr>ContextSwitch;</p><p><wbr><span>// ...</span><wbr></p><p>};</p><p>};</p><p><wbr><span>struct</span><wbr> <wbr>etw_event_trace</p><p>{</p><p><wbr><span>void</span><wbr> <wbr>*<wbr>Internal;</p><p>};</p><p><wbr>event_trace <wbr>ETWBeginTrace(<wbr><span>void</span><wbr>);</p><p><wbr><span>void</span><wbr> <wbr>ETWAddEventType(<wbr>event_trace <wbr>Trace, <wbr>event_type);</p><p><wbr><span>int</span><wbr> <wbr>ETWGetEvents(<wbr>event_trace <wbr>Trace, <wbr>size_t <wbr>BufferSize, <wbr><span>void</span><wbr> <wbr>*<wbr>Buffer);</p><p><wbr><span>void</span><wbr> <wbr>ETWEndTrace(<wbr>event_trace <wbr>Trace);</p></div><div><p>That’s one way to do it.  Very simple, trivial to understand, pretty hard to mess up.  Someone stepping into this with the debugger would be able to see exactly what was going on, and you’d be able to tell pretty easily if you’d done something wrong.
</p><p>However, I could imagine a scenario where performance-critical code would not want to pay the cost of the copy from the kernel’s buffer to your buffer, which this API requires (ETWGetEvents must copy the events from some OS-internal buffer, since it has to get them from somewhere).  So a slightly more complex version would be to get some mapped memory back from the API that you use as a reading buffer:
</p></div><div><p><wbr><span>// At the beginning of the program</span><wbr></p><p><wbr>etw_event_trace <wbr>Trace <wbr>= <wbr>ETWBeginTrace(<wbr><span>4096</span><wbr><wbr>*<wbr><span>sizeof</span><wbr>(<wbr>etw_event));</p><p><wbr>ETWAddEventType(<wbr>Trace, <wbr>ETWType_ContextSwitch);</p><p><wbr><span>// On each frame</span><wbr></p><p><wbr>etw_event_range <wbr>Range;</p><p><wbr><span>while</span><wbr>(<wbr>ETWBeginEventRead(<wbr>Trace, <wbr>&amp;<wbr>Range))</p><p>{</p><p><wbr><span>for</span><wbr>(<wbr>etw_event <wbr>*<wbr>Event <wbr>= <wbr>Range<wbr>.<wbr>First;</p><p><wbr>Event <wbr>!= <wbr>Range<wbr>.<wbr>OnePastLast;</p><p><wbr>++<wbr>Event)</p><p>{</p><p><wbr><span>assert</span><wbr>(<wbr>Event<wbr>-&gt;<wbr>Type <wbr>== <wbr>ETWType_ContextSwitch);</p><p><wbr><span>// process Event-&gt;ContextSwitch here</span><wbr></p><p>}</p><p><wbr>ETWEndEventRead(<wbr>Trace, <wbr>&amp;<wbr>Range);</p><p>}</p><p><wbr><span>// At the end of the program</span><wbr></p><p><wbr>ETWEndTrace(<wbr>Trace);</p></div><div><p>All I have done here is changed the return mechanism from a copy to a ranged pointer.  In ETWBeginTrace, the user now passes in the number of events they want to buffer at maximum, and the kernel reserves room in the user’s address space for that many events.  It then writes directly into that memory if it can, avoiding unnecessary copies. When the user calls ETWBeginEventRead(), a begin and end pointer are returned that span some part of the event memory.  Since it will be treated as a circular buffer, the caller is expected to loop on in case there are two ranges (a “head” and “tail”) that need to be returned.  I included an end call, since certain methods of implementation might require the kernel to know what part of the buffer the user is looking at, so it can avoid writing into memory that is actively being read.  I don’t really know that this sort of thing would be necessary, but if you wanted to cover your bases and give the kernel the maximum implementation flexibility, this definitely supports more implementations than the ETWGetEvents() version.
</p><p>The API would be updated like this:
</p></div><div><p><wbr><span>struct</span><wbr> <wbr>etw_event_range</p><p>{</p><p><wbr>etw_event <wbr>*<wbr>First;</p><p><wbr>etw_event <wbr>*<wbr>OnePastLast;</p><p>};</p><p><wbr>event_trace <wbr>ETWBeginTrace(<wbr>size_t <wbr>BufferSize);</p><p><wbr><span>int</span><wbr> <wbr>ETWBeginEventRead(<wbr>event_trace <wbr>Trace, <wbr>etw_event_range <wbr>*<wbr>Range);</p><p><wbr><span>void</span><wbr> <wbr>ETWEndEventRead(<wbr>event_trace <wbr>Trace, <wbr>etw_event_range <wbr>*<wbr>Range);</p></div><div><p>If one were so inclined, one could even support both retrieval methods with the same API just by still allowing the ETWGetEvents() call.  Also, to complete the API with some error reporting, it might also be nice to have something like:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>bool <wbr>ETWLastGetEventsOverflowed(<wbr>event_trace <wbr>Trace);</p></div><div><div><p>to allow you to check after each ETWGetEvents() whether too many events had occurred since the last check, and the kernel was forced to throw some away.
</p><p>To each his own, but I suspect that most of the programmers I know wouldn’t have a lot of complaints with my API proposal as written.  Everyone has their own taste, so I’m sure they would each tweak something to be more to their liking, but I doubt anyone would say it was horrible.  It’s all pretty straightforward, and I suspect most programmers could integrate it into their code trivially without really thinking too much about it.
</p><p>The reason the API is so straightforward is not because I employed a sophisticated set of API design practices to finesse my way to a good API.  Quite the contrary.  The API is simple because the problem it’s solving is trivial.  It’s essentially the simplest API problem you can have in a system: how to move data from one place to another.  It’s a glorified memcpy().
</p><p>But it is precisely the simplicity of the problem that allows the Event Tracing for Windows API to really shine.  Even though all it has to do is move memory from one place to another, it manages to involve almost every kind of complexity you can see in an API.
</p></div><div><p>I don’t know how anyone is supposed to actually learn how to use the Event Tracing for Windows API.  Maybe there are good examples floating around that I just never found.  I had to piece the usage code together over the course of many hours of experimentation, pulling from various snippets of documentation.  Each time I figured out another step of the process I thought, “Wait, seriously?”  And each time Microsoft implicitly replied, “Seriously.”
</p><p>Having me tell you how to call the API does take some away from the sheer awe of the experience, so I will say, if you want the full monty, stop reading now and go try to get context switch timestamps on your own.  I can assure you it will be hours of fun and excitement.  Those who’d rather save time at the expense of a day full of facepalm moments, read on.
</p><p>OK, here we go.  The equivalent to my proposed ETWBeginTrace() is Microsoft’s StartTrace() call.  At first glance, it seems innocent enough:
</p></div></div><div><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>StartTrace(<wbr>TRACEHANDLE <wbr>*<wbr>SessionHandle, <wbr><span>char</span><wbr> <wbr>const <wbr>*<wbr>SessionName, <wbr>EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES <wbr>*<wbr>Properties);</p></div><div><p>However, when you look at what you need to pass in for the Properties parameter, things start to get a little hairy.  The EVENT_<wbr>TRACE_<wbr>PROPERTIES structure is defined by Windows to look like this:
</p></div><div><p><wbr><span>struct</span><wbr> <wbr>EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES</p><p>{</p><p><wbr>WNODE_HEADER <wbr>Wnode;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>BufferSize;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>MinimumBuffers;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>MaximumBuffers;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>MaximumFileSize;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>LogFileMode;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>FlushTimer;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>EnableFlags;</p><p><wbr>LONG <wbr>AgeLimit;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>NumberOfBuffers;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>FreeBuffers;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>EventsLost;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>BuffersWritten;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>LogBuffersLost;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>RealTimeBuffersLost;</p><p><wbr>HANDLE <wbr>LoggerThreadId;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>LogFileNameOffset;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>LoggerNameOffset;</p><p>};</p></div><div><p>where the first member is actually a struct itself, which expands to:
</p></div><div><p><wbr><span>struct</span><wbr> <wbr>WNODE_HEADER</p><p>{</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>BufferSize;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>ProviderId;</p><p><wbr><span>union</span><wbr></p><p>{</p><p><wbr>ULONG64 <wbr>HistoricalContext;</p><p><wbr><span>struct</span><wbr></p><p>{</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>Version;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>Linkage;</p><p>};</p><p>};</p><p><wbr><span>union</span><wbr></p><p>{</p><p><wbr>HANDLE <wbr>KernelHandle;</p><p><wbr>LARGE_INTEGER <wbr>TimeStamp;</p><p>};</p><p><wbr>GUID <wbr>Guid;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>ClientContext;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>Flags;</p><p>};</p></div><div><p>A cursory glance at this mass of data reveals a bit of oddity: why are there members like “EventsLost” and “BuffersWritten”?  The reason is because, instead of making different structures for the different operations you might do on a trace, Microsoft grouped the API functions into a few groups, and all the functions in each group share one amalgamated structure for their parameters.  So instead of the user getting a clear idea of what goes into and comes out of a function by looking at its parameters, they must instead rely entirely on the MSDN documentation for each API, and hope that it correctly enumerates which members of the giant parameter structure are used for each call, and whether those members go into or come out of the function.
</p><p>Of course, because there’s so many different ways it can be used, and given the possibility of future APIs using it, too, Microsoft requires that you clear this gigantic beast to zero before you use it:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES <wbr>SessionProperties <wbr>= {<wbr><span>0</span><wbr>};</p></div><div><p>For StartTrace(), if we just want to get the data back directly and aren’t trying to log to a file, we need to fill out some members. These two make some sense:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>SessionProperties<wbr>.<wbr>EnableFlags <wbr>= <wbr>EVENT_TRACE_FLAG_CSWITCH;</p><p><wbr>SessionProperties<wbr>.<wbr>LogFileMode <wbr>= <wbr>EVENT_TRACE_REAL_TIME_MODE;</p></div><div><p>The EnableFlags says what we wanted to get.  We want context switches, so we set that flag.  Now, what happens when you have more than 32 types of events coming from a single provider, I don’t know, but I guess they weren’t particularly concerned with that eventuality.  I was, which is why I went with the enum-and-function-call approach in my proposal, since it supports four billion event types, but hey, “32 event types should be enough for everyone”, so Microsoft went with a 32-bit flags field.  Not a huge deal, but this is definitely the kind of short-term thinking that leads to things like unnecessarily duplicated functions with “Ex” appended to their names.
</p><p>The LogFileMode just says whether we wanted to get events back directly, or whether we just want the kernel to write them to disk. Since they are such disparate operations, I would have broken those two things up into different function calls, but, hey, we’ve already got one big giant structure for everything, might as well throw it all in there.
</p><p>Things get a little weirder with this field:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>SessionProperties<wbr>.<wbr>Wnode<wbr>.<wbr>Flags <wbr>= <wbr>WNODE_FLAG_TRACED_GUID;</p></div><div><p>According to the documentation, that’s the only value you’re allowed to have.  So it’s just busywork for you to do.  Again, not a huge deal, because maybe they’re trying to plan for future expansion or something (heaven help us).  But we are already getting nasty data coupling here, where the function call and the structure contents are effectively redundant.
</p><p>Things continue to sour as we come to this field:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>SessionProperties<wbr>.<wbr>Wnode<wbr>.<wbr>ClientContext <wbr>= <wbr><span>1</span><wbr>;</p></div><div><p>What does that mean?  Well, the cryptically named “ClientContext” actually refers to the type of timestamp you want your events to have. “TimestampType” might have been a little bit more descriptive, but whatever.  The real fun is the bare “1” value that’s just sitting on the right.
</p><p>It turns out that there’s actually a set of enumerated values to which you can set ClientContext, but Microsoft didn’t ever give them symbolic names.  So you’re just supposed to read the documentation and remember that 1 means the timestamps come from QueryPerformanceCounter, 2 means the “system time”, and 3 means the CPU cycle count.
</p><p>In case it is not obvious, there are a number of reasons why public APIs should never do something like this.  Internally, I will occasionally do something like this, in situations where a local piece of code just wants to, say, use -1 and -2 for some kind of convoluted special cases in an indexing scheme.  But for an API that ships to literally millions of developers, you always want to define your constants.
</p><p>First, it makes the code readable.  Nobody knows what a ClientContext of “1” is, but a ClientContext of USE_<wbr>QUERY_<wbr>PERFORMANCE_<wbr>COUNTER_<wbr>TIMESTAMPS would be crystal clear. Second, it makes the code searchable.  Nobody can grep a codebase for “1”, but they can trivially grep it for USE_<wbr>QUERY_<wbr>PERFORMANCE_<wbr>COUNTER_<wbr>TIMESTAMPS.  And although you might think “well, no big deal, I’ll just grep for ClientContext = 1”, remember that more complex usage of this API could involve variables, like “…ClientContext = TimestampType;”.  Third, it makes the code not compile on future versions of the SDK where things have changed. For example, if the platform maintainers decided to deprecate the use of USE_<wbr>QUERY_<wbr>PERFORMANCE_<wbr>COUNTER_<wbr>TIMESTAMPS, they could remove the #define for it and make it be USE_<wbr>QUERY_<wbr>PERFORMANCE_<wbr>COUNTER_<wbr>TIMESTAMPS_<wbr>DEPRECATED.  Now all the old code that uses that value will get a compile error on the new SDK, and the programmer will go look at the new documentation and see what they should be using instead.
</p><p>Etc., etc., etc.
</p><p>Perhaps the most annoying field we have to fill out is this one:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>SessionProperties<wbr>.<wbr>Wnode<wbr>.<wbr>Guid <wbr>= <wbr>SystemTraceControlGuid;</p></div><div><p>The GUID says who you’re trying to trace.  In our case, we’re trying to get data from the kernel logger, and SystemTraceControlGuid is the globally defined GUID that refers to this service.  It could have been named better, sure, but that’s a minor issue compared to the fact that, if you were to actually try to compile this line of code, you’d find that SystemTraceControlGuid was an undefined symbol at link time.
</p><p>This happens, of course, because the GUIDs are so large that Microsoft apparently couldn’t figure out any way to embed them in the headers (I can think of several possible ways, but I guess they didn’t like any of them), so instead they force you to pick one file in your project where the Windows headers will inject the actual GUID definitions.  To signal that you want this to happen, you have to do something like this:
</p></div><div><p><wbr><span>#define</span><wbr> <wbr>INITGUID  <wbr><span>// Causes definition of SystemTraceControlGuid in evntrace.h</span><wbr></p><p><wbr><span>#include</span><wbr> <wbr>&lt;<wbr>windows<wbr>.<wbr>h<wbr>&gt;</p><p><wbr><span>#include</span><wbr> <wbr>&lt;<wbr>strsafe<wbr>.<wbr>h<wbr>&gt;</p><p><wbr><span>#include</span><wbr> <wbr>&lt;<wbr>wmistr<wbr>.<wbr>h<wbr>&gt;</p><p><wbr><span>#include</span><wbr> <wbr>&lt;<wbr>evntrace<wbr>.<wbr>h<wbr>&gt;</p><p><wbr><span>#include</span><wbr> <wbr>&lt;<wbr>evntcons<wbr>.<wbr>h<wbr>&gt;</p></div><div><p>So now you have to be careful about where you do this, perhaps by making a new file in your project where the GUIDs will live so everyone can reference them, or some other such nonsense, so you don’t ever do it twice.
</p><p>But whatever, we’re almost done filling out the structure.  All we have to do is deal with the SessionName parameter, which we should be able to just pass as a string, right?  Since it’s the name of the session, I guess maybe just do:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>Status <wbr>= <wbr>StartTrace(<wbr>&amp;<wbr>SessionHandle, <wbr><span>"CaseyTownProfilerAWESOMEYEAH!!!"</span><wbr>, <wbr>&amp;<wbr>SessionProperties);</p></div><div><p>Because that would be an awesome session name, don’t you think?
</p><p>But alas, that is not the way things work.  It turns out that, even though you already pass a GUID in the SessionProperties that specifies that the kernel is the source of the events, you must also pass the pre-defined constant KERNEL_<wbr>LOGGER_<wbr>NAME as the session name.  Why?  Well, it’s because of a little secret surprise that I’ll save for a bit, just so you can savor the suspense of it all.
</p><p>OK, so, here we go:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>Status <wbr>= <wbr>StartTrace(<wbr>&amp;<wbr>SessionHandle, <wbr>KERNEL_LOGGER_NAME, <wbr>&amp;<wbr>SessionProperties);</p></div><div><p>Looking good, right?  Wrong.
</p><p>It turns out that, although the SessionName string is passed as the second parameter, that’s really just a “convenience” feature.  Really, the SessionName is required to be embedded directly into the SessionProperties, but since Microsoft didn’t want to limit the maximum length of the name, they decided to just go ahead and pack it in after the EVENT_<wbr>TRACE_<wbr>PROPERTIES structure.  So really, you can’t do this:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES <wbr>SessionProperties <wbr>= {<wbr><span>0</span><wbr>};</p></div><div><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>BufferSize <wbr>= <wbr><span>sizeof</span><wbr>(<wbr>EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES) <wbr>+ <wbr><span>sizeof</span><wbr>(<wbr>KERNEL_LOGGER_NAME);</p><p><wbr>EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES <wbr>*<wbr>SessionProperties <wbr>= (<wbr>EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES<wbr>*) <wbr>malloc(<wbr>BufferSize);</p><p><wbr>ZeroMemory(<wbr>SessionProperties, <wbr>BufferSize);</p><p><wbr>SessionProperties<wbr>-&gt;<wbr>LoggerNameOffset <wbr>= <wbr><span>sizeof</span><wbr>(<wbr>EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES);</p></div><div><p>Yes, that’s right, every user of the Event Tracing for Windows API has to do the arithmetic and layout of the packed structure format themselves.  I have absolutely no idea why the name has to be bundled in this way, but surely if you wanted everyone to do this, you should have supplied a utility macro or function that would do the right thing for the user and keep them out of the business of understanding your weird data packing requirements.
</p><p>But hey, at least you don’t have to copy the name in there yourself! The convention Microsoft adopted for this API was that the StartTrace() function will copy the name into the structure for you, since after all, it’s passed as the second parameter.
</p><p>Well, it’s a nice gesture, but it doesn’t pan out in practice. It turns out that forcing the SessionName to be KERNEL_<wbr>LOGGER_<wbr>NAME wasn’t superfluous with the GUID after all, and that is the secret surprise to which I alluded.  The real reason that it has to be KERNEL_<wbr>LOGGER_<wbr>NAME is because Windows only allows you to have one session in the system &nbsp;—&nbsp; total &nbsp;—&nbsp; that reads events from the SystemTraceControlGuid.  Other GUIDs can be read by multiple sessions, but not SystemTraceControlGuid.  So really what is happening when you pass KERNEL_<wbr>LOGGER_<wbr>NAME is that you are saying you want the one unique session that can exist in the system at any given time with the GUID of SystemTraceControlGuid.  If someone else already started that session, then your attempt to start it will fail.
</p><p>It gets better.  The session is global to the operating system and doesn’t automatically close on the termination of the process that started it.  So if you write code that calls StartTrace(), but you have a bug in that code somewhere &nbsp;—&nbsp; anywhere &nbsp;—&nbsp; and your program crashes, the KERNEL_<wbr>LOGGER_<wbr>NAME session is still running!  When you go to re-run your program, perhaps after fixing the bug, your attempt to StartTrace() will fail with ERROR_<wbr>ALREADY_<wbr>EXISTS.
</p><p>So, basically, StartTrace(), which is the call that helpfully copies the SessionName into the struct for you, is rarely the first call you would make anyway.  What you’re much more likely to do is call this:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>ControlTrace(<wbr><span>0</span><wbr>, <wbr>KERNEL_LOGGER_NAME, <wbr>SessionProperties, <wbr>EVENT_TRACE_CONTROL_STOP);</p></div><div><p>This shuts down any existing session, so that your subsequent call to StartTrace() will succeed.  But of course, ControlTrace() doesn’t copy the name in like StartTrace() does, which means that, in practice, you have to do it yourself, since StartTrace() gets called after ControlTrace()!
</p></div><div><p><wbr>StringCbCopy((<wbr>LPSTR)((<wbr><span>char</span><wbr><wbr>*)<wbr>pSessionProperties <wbr>+ <wbr>pSessionProperties<wbr>-&gt;<wbr>LoggerNameOffset), <wbr><span>sizeof</span><wbr>(<wbr>KERNEL_LOGGER_NAME), <wbr>KERNEL_LOGGER_NAME);</p></div><div><div><p>It’s crazy, but the ramifications of all this are crazier still.  If you think about what it means to have only one possible trace that is connected to the kernel logger, you realize quickly that there are security issues at play.  If some other process had called StartTrace(), and they were the ones that were using the kernel logger, how does the system know that it’s OK for our process to come in and stop that trace so we can start it back up again with our settings?
</p><p>The answer, hilariously, is that it doesn’t!  In fact, it’s a complete free-for-all &nbsp;—&nbsp; may the best process win!  Whoever calls StartTrace() last, well, that’s who gets to configure the trace.
</p><p>Well, not quite.  Obviously, you don’t want just any old process to be able to steal the kernel logger away from other processes.  So Microsoft decided that the best course of action would be to simply prohibit all processes from accessing the kernel logger at all, unless they’ve been specifically granted administrator privileges.
</p><p>That’s right &nbsp;—&nbsp; I am not exaggerating.  If you simply want to receive a list of the context switches, even if only for your process, it must be running with full administrator privileges.  The whole right-click-run-as-administrator nine yards.  If you don’t, and you just run your process normally, your StartTrace will fail with insufficient privileges.  (In theory, you may also be able to add your user to the “Performance Log Users” group and avoid having to run the process as administrator, but I’m sad to say that, at the moment, I can’t actually remember if that works for kernel logger connections or only other types of traces…)
</p><p>Amazing, yes?  To do the equivalent of what should have been two trivial function calls (ETWBeginTrace() / ETWAddEventType()), we’ve done memory arithmetic, we’ve allocated memory, we’ve cleared memory, we’ve computed offsets, we’ve copied strings, we’ve filled out structures, used not one but two global GUID-style constants, forced a #define manhandling of the preprocessor #includes, and required that the user start our process with full administrator privileges.
</p><p>All this, and we haven’t even gotten any events yet!
</p></div><div><p>I know what you’re thinking.  You’re thinking that the section after “Starting the Trace” should cover getting the events from the trace, right?  Nonsense!  This is the Event Tracing for Windows API, people!  Starting a trace doesn’t start a trace!  It just half-starts a trace!  If you want to start the trace for real, everyone knows you have to start it, then <i>open</i> it…  with the OpenTrace() function:
</p></div></div><div><p><wbr>TRACEHANDLE <wbr>OpenTrace(<wbr>EVENT_TRACE_LOGFILE <wbr>*<wbr>Logfile);</p></div><div><p>What does this function do?  Well, it turns out that a “started” trace is just a trace that is collecting events.  It doesn’t actually provide any way to ever get those events.  If you want to get them, you need to open the trace up with OpenTrace().
</p><p>So to call OpenTrace(), we need an EVENT_<wbr>TRACE_<wbr>LOGFILE.  Of course, we’re not actually making a log file, we just want to get the events, so it’s a little odd that we’d be filling out something called “LOGFILE”.  But much like StartTrace(), OpenTrace() is part of a family of functions that all share the same parameter structure, so really, the fact that it’s inappropriately named for our purposes is one of the more minor annoyances.
</p><p>The EVENT_<wbr>TRACE_<wbr>LOGFILE structure looks like this:
</p></div><div><p><wbr><span>struct</span><wbr> <wbr>EVENT_TRACE_LOGFILE</p><p>{</p><p><wbr>LPTSTR <wbr>LogFileName;</p><p><wbr>LPTSTR <wbr>LoggerName;</p><p><wbr>LONGLONG <wbr>CurrentTime;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>BuffersRead;</p><p><wbr><span>union</span><wbr></p><p>{</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>LogFileMode;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>ProcessTraceMode;</p><p>};</p><p><wbr>EVENT_TRACE <wbr>CurrentEvent;</p><p><wbr>TRACE_LOGFILE_HEADER <wbr>LogfileHeader;</p><p><wbr>PEVENT_TRACE_BUFFER_CALLBACK <wbr>BufferCallback;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>BufferSize;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>Filled;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>EventsLost;</p><p><wbr><span>union</span><wbr></p><p>{</p><p><wbr>EVENT_CALLBACK <wbr>*<wbr>EventCallback;</p><p><wbr>EVENT_RECORD_CALLBACK <wbr>*<wbr>EventRecordCallback;</p><p>};</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>IsKernelTrace;</p><p><wbr>PVOID <wbr>Context;</p><p>};</p></div><div><p>If you got nervous when you saw the word “Callback” appear in that structure, I’m right there with you.  Getting events should be a simple matter of asking for them and receiving the memory.  There should be absolutely no need for a callback.
</p><p>But, moving on, EVENT_<wbr>TRACE_<wbr>LOGFILE is one of those giant grab-bag structures, so Microsoft asks that you clear it first so any unused parts will be zero:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>EVENT_TRACE_LOGFILE <wbr>LogFile <wbr>= {<wbr><span>0</span><wbr>};</p></div><div><p>Since the OpenTrace() function doesn’t actually take any handles, we need to give it some way to find the trace we “started” before.  It turns out this is done by string-matching, so we pass the session name yet again:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>LogFile<wbr>.<wbr>LoggerName <wbr>= <wbr>KERNEL_LOGGER_NAME;</p></div><div><p>Strangely, this time we don’t have to copy it to the end of the structure.  Why?  Who knows!  Variety is the spice of life, I am told.  Microsoft wants your life to be spicy.
</p><p>Next, we have to fill in the tracing mode, which is actually a set of mode flags:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>LogFile<wbr>.<wbr>ProcessTraceMode <wbr>= (<wbr>PROCESS_TRACE_MODE_REAL_TIME <wbr>| <wbr>PROCESS_TRACE_MODE_EVENT_RECORD <wbr>| <wbr>PROCESS_TRACE_MODE_RAW_TIMESTAMP);</p></div><div><p>PROCESS_<wbr>TRACE_<wbr>MODE_<wbr>REAL_<wbr>TIME, as far as I can tell, is a completely redundant flag, because if you don’t specify a log file name, then I’m not sure how you’d receive events otherwise. PROCESS_<wbr>TRACE_<wbr>MODE_<wbr>EVENT_<wbr>RECORD is a compatibility flag that tells Windows you want to use the new EventRecordCallback, as opposed to the older EventCallback (yes, believe it or not, this fine API has actually gone through multiple revisions!)  And the PROCESS_<wbr>TRACE_<wbr>MODE_<wbr>RAW_<wbr>TIMESTAMP flag tells Windows not to override the setting for the ClientContext passed to the StartTrace() call.  I guess the idea here is that the person who started the trace might have used a timestamp format other than “2”, and if you want “2”, then you can always for it to be “2” when you actually get the events.  If you always wanted “1” or “3”, well… no such luck.
</p><p>Finally, we need to point the API at a function we write that will collect the events:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>LogFile<wbr>.<wbr>EventRecordCallback <wbr>= <wbr>CaseyEventRecordCallback;</p></div><div><p>And then we’re finally ready for the big call:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>TRACEHANDLE <wbr>ConsumerHandle <wbr>= <wbr>OpenTrace(<wbr>&amp;<wbr>LogFile);</p></div><div><div><p>Now, before we move on to actually trying to get some actual events (perish the thought!), I’d like you to stop for a minute and marvel at the pure brilliance of StartTrace() and OpenTrace().  These are two APIs that are part of the same system.  They both generate a new TRACEHANDLE.  They can both fail.  They both take the session name. But, for each of these things, they do it completely differently. Completely!
</p><p>StartTrace() returns a ULONG error code, and takes a pointer to space for the handle it returns.  OpenTrace() returns the handle directly, but sets it to INVALID_<wbr>HANDLE_<wbr>VALUE if there was an error.  StartTrace() takes the session name as a parameter, and forces you to leave space in its parameter structure so it can copy it in.  OpenTrace() takes a pointer to the session name in its parameter structure, but doesn’t require it to be copied anywhere.
</p></div><div><p>We’ve worked so hard and come so far, it would be nice to finally get an actual context switch event, wouldn’t it?  To get one, we’ll of course need to implement the actual callback we pointed OpenTrace() at:
</p></div></div><div><p><wbr><span>static</span><wbr> <wbr><span>void</span><wbr> <wbr>WINAPI <wbr>CaseyEventRecordCallback(<wbr>EVENT_RECORD <wbr>*<wbr>EventRecord)</p><p>{</p><p><wbr>EVENT_HEADER <wbr>&amp;<wbr>Header <wbr>= <wbr>EventRecord<wbr>-&gt;<wbr>EventHeader;</p><p><wbr>UCHAR <wbr>ProcessorNumber <wbr>= <wbr>EventRecord<wbr>-&gt;<wbr>BufferContext<wbr>.<wbr>ProcessorNumber;</p><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>ThreadID <wbr>= <wbr>Header<wbr>.<wbr>ThreadId;</p><p><wbr>int64 <wbr>CycleTime <wbr>= <wbr>Header<wbr>.<wbr>TimeStamp<wbr>.<wbr>QuadPart;</p><p><wbr><span>// Process event here.</span><wbr></p><p>}</p></div><div><p>Mercifully, this is just a bunch of structure accesses, and there’s nothing particularly unusual going on.  The event comes in, we pull the data out of it, and then we could do whatever we wanted to do with it.  But, when does this callback get called?
</p><p>Well, Windows only calls it back when you attempt to “process” events in your open trace using this API:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>ULONG <wbr>ProcessTrace(<wbr>TRACEHANDLE <wbr>*<wbr>HandleArray, <wbr>ULONG <wbr>HandleCount, <wbr>LPFILETIME <wbr>StartTime, <wbr>LPFILETIME <wbr>EndTime);</p></div><div><p>Using this function, you can pass an open trace handle, and Windows will spin through all the events it has on that handle, calling your callback for each one.  So we’re done, right?  We just call this function every frame of our game, or some other appropriate interval, and we harvest the events with the callback?
</p><p>I’m afraid not, my friends, because here is the brown icing on the poopcake, that savory sauce that makes the Event Tracing for Windows API more grainy and aromatic that its contemporaries: ProcessTrace is defined to never return.
</p><p>Yes, you read that correctly.  The definition of ProcessTrace(), for a real-time trace, is that it dispatches any events it finds currently logged on the trace, and then just blocks until more come in.  It will block forever, or until the trace is manually closed with CloseTrace().  This means the only way to actually get the events and continue running your process is to create an entirely new thread to do nothing but block on ProcessTrace()!
</p><p>You think I’m joking, but I’m completely serious.  You first have to make a thread stub that blocks forever on ProcessTrace():
</p></div><div><p><wbr><span>static</span><wbr> <wbr>DWORD <wbr>WINAPI <wbr>Win32TracingThread(<wbr>LPVOID <wbr>Parameter)</p><p>{</p><p><wbr>ProcessTrace(<wbr>&amp;<wbr>ConsumerHandle, <wbr><span>1</span><wbr>, <wbr><span>0</span><wbr>, <wbr><span>0</span><wbr>);</p><p><wbr><span>return</span><wbr>(<wbr><span>0</span><wbr>);</p><p>}</p></div><div><p>Then, after you call OpenTrace(), you have to spin up that thread to do the processing:
</p></div><div><p><wbr>DWORD <wbr>ThreadID;</p><p><wbr>HANDLE <wbr>ThreadHandle <wbr>= <wbr>CreateThread(<wbr><span>0</span><wbr>, <wbr><span>0</span><wbr>, <wbr>Win32TracingThread, <wbr><span>0</span><wbr>, <wbr><span>0</span><wbr>, <wbr>&amp;<wbr>ThreadID);</p><p><wbr>CloseHandle(<wbr>ThreadHandle);</p></div><div><div><p>That is literally the only way I know to retrieve frame-by-frame events from a running program using the Event Tracing for Windows API.
</p></div><div><p>A Class Entirely By Itself
</p></div><div><p>So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen: the only API I’ve ever used that requires both elevated privileges and a dedicated user thread just to copy a block of structures from the kernel to the user. I’d never seen anything like it before, and I’ve never seen anything like it since.  Add that to the littany of what-not-to-dos that comprise the actual API calls themselves, and I hope everyone will agree that the Event Tracing for Windows API is in a class of bad API entirely by itself.
</p><p>You can nit-pick this API by examining it with the principles I outlined last week (well, ten years ago).  For example, you can point out that a required thread and a callback for a simple memory transfer is a major red flag under the Flow Control principle.  You can point out that there is no granularity at all, as you must call the calls in exactly the way that I described.  You can point out that nearly all the data and all the functions are coupled in a dozen different ways, including bizarre ones like the requirement that the SessionName be KERNEL_<wbr>LOGGER_<wbr>NAME if the GUID is SystemTraceControlGuid.
</p><p>But really, the most important takeaway from a bad API like this is “always write the usage code first”.  In the lecture, I said it was the first and second rule of API design, and I wasn’t kidding.  Without thinking about pricinples at all, or getting bogged down in details, just the simple exercise of writing down what the API <i>should</i> look like was all that was really necesssary to see all the places the Microsoft version fell down.  If you go back and contrast the two, it’s immediately apparent how overcomplicated, error-prone, and unnecessary the Microsoft version is using only your programmer’s intuition.

successfully synthesized Pb2SO5, Cu3P, and finally the modified lead-apatite
Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O. Detailed electrical transport and magnetic properties of
these compounds were systematically analyzed. It turns out that Pb2SO5 is a
highly insulating diamagnet with a room-temperature resistivity of ~7.18x10^9
<a href="http://ohm.cm/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> and Cu3P is a paramagnetic metal with a room-temperature resistivity of

Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O compound sintered from Pb2SO5 and Cu3P exhibits
semiconductor-like transport behavior with a large room-temperature resistivity
of ~1.94x10^4 <a href="http://ohm.cm/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> although our compound shows greatly consistent x-ray
diffraction spectrum with the previously reported structure data. In addition,
when a pressed Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O pellet is located on top of a commercial
Nd2Fe14B magnet at room temperature, no repulsion could be felt and no magnetic
levitation was observed either. These results imply that the claim of a
room-temperature superconductor in modified lead-apatite may need more careful
re-examination, especially for the electrical transport properties.

            <p>Two of humanity's most ubiquitous historical materials, cement and carbon black (which resembles very fine charcoal), may form the basis for a novel, low-cost energy storage system, according to a new study. The technology could facilitate the use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and tidal power by allowing energy networks to remain stable despite fluctuations in renewable energy supply.</p>

<p>The two materials, the researchers found, can be combined with water to make a supercapacitor — an alternative to batteries — that could provide storage of electrical energy. As an example, the MIT researchers who developed the system say that their supercapacitor could eventually be incorporated into the concrete foundation of a house, where it could store a full day’s worth of energy while adding little (or no) to the cost of the foundation and still providing the needed structural strength. The researchers also envision a concrete roadway that could provide contactless recharging for electric cars as they travel over that road.</p>



<p>The simple but innovative technology is described this week in the journal <em>PNAS</em>, in a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2304318120" target="_blank">paper</a> by MIT professors Franz-Josef Ulm, Admir Masic, and Yang-Shao Horn, and four others at MIT and at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering.</p>



<p>Capacitors are in principle very simple devices, consisting of two electrically conductive plates immersed in an electrolyte and separated by a membrane. When a voltage is applied across the capacitor, positively charged ions from the electrolyte accumulate on the negatively charged plate, while the positively charged plate accumulates negatively charged ions. Since the membrane in between the plates blocks charged ions from migrating across, this separation of charges creates an electric field between the plates, and the capacitor becomes charged. The two plates can maintain this pair of charges for a long time and then deliver them very quickly when needed. Supercapacitors are simply capacitors that can store exceptionally large charges.</p>



<p>The amount of power a capacitor can store depends on the total surface area of its conductive plates. The key to the new supercapacitors developed by this team comes from a method of producing a cement-based material with an extremely high internal surface area due to a dense, interconnected network of conductive material within its bulk volume. The researchers achieved this by introducing carbon black — which is highly conductive — into a concrete mixture along with cement powder and water, and letting it cure. The water naturally forms a branching network of openings within the structure as it reacts with cement, and the carbon migrates into these spaces to make wire-like structures within the hardened cement. These structures have a fractal-like structure, with larger branches sprouting smaller branches, and those sprouting even smaller branchlets, and so on, ending up with an extremely large surface area within the confines of a relatively small volume. The material is then soaked in a standard electrolyte material, such as potassium chloride, a kind of salt, which provides the charged particles that accumulate on the carbon structures. Two electrodes made of this material, separated by a thin space or an insulating layer, form a very powerful supercapacitor, the researchers found.</p>



<p>The two plates of the capacitor function just like the two poles of a rechargeable battery of equivalent voltage: When connected to a source of electricity, as with a battery, energy gets stored in the plates, and then when connected to a load, the electrical current flows back out to provide power.</p>



<p>“The material is fascinating,” Masic says, “because you have the most-used manmade material in the world, cement, that is combined with carbon black, that is a well-known historical material — the Dead Sea Scrolls were written with it. You have these at least two-millennia-old materials that when you combine them in a specific manner you come up with a conductive nanocomposite, and that’s when things get really interesting.”</p>



<p>As the mixture sets and cures, he says, “The water is systematically consumed through cement hydration reactions, and this hydration fundamentally affects nanoparticles of carbon because they are hydrophobic (water repelling).” As the mixture evolves, “the carbon black is self-assembling into a connected conductive wire,” he says. The process is easily reproducible, with materials that are inexpensive and readily available anywhere in the world. And the amount of carbon needed is very small — as little as 3 percent by volume of the mix — to achieve a percolated carbon network, Masic says.</p>



<p>Supercapacitors made of this material have great potential to aid in the world’s transition to renewable energy, Ulm says. The principal sources of emissions-free energy, wind, solar, and tidal power, all produce their output at variable times that often do not correspond to the peaks in electricity usage, so ways of storing that power are essential. “There is a huge need for big energy storage,” he says, and existing batteries are too expensive and mostly rely on materials such as lithium, whose supply is limited, so cheaper alternatives are badly needed. “That’s where our technology is extremely promising, because cement is ubiquitous,” Ulm says.</p>



<p>The team calculated that a block of nanocarbon-black-doped concrete that is 45 cubic meters (or yards) in size — equivalent to a cube about 3.5 meters across — would have enough capacity to store about 10 kilowatt-hours of energy, which is considered the average daily electricity usage for a household. Since the concrete would retain its strength, a house with a foundation made of this material could store a day’s worth of energy produced by solar panels or windmills and allow it to be used whenever it’s needed. And, supercapacitors can be charged and discharged much more rapidly than batteries.</p>



<p>After a series of tests used to determine the most effective ratios of cement, carbon black, and water, the team demonstrated the process by making small supercapacitors, about the size of some button-cell batteries, about 1 centimeter across and 1 millimeter thick, that could each be charged to 1 volt, comparable to a 1-volt battery. They then connected three of these to demonstrate their ability to light up a 3-volt light-emitting diode (LED). Having proved the principle, they now plan to build a series of larger versions, starting with ones about the size of a typical 12-volt car battery, then working up to a 45-cubic-meter version to demonstrate its ability to store a house-worth of power.</p>



<p>There is a tradeoff between the storage capacity of the material and its structural strength, they found. By adding more carbon black, the resulting supercapacitor can store more energy, but the concrete is slightly weaker, and this could be useful for applications where the concrete is not playing a structural role or where the full strength-potential of concrete is not required. For applications such as a foundation, or structural elements of the base of a wind turbine, the “sweet spot” is around 10 percent carbon black in the mix, they found.</p>



<p>Another potential application for carbon-cement supercapacitors is for building concrete roadways that could store energy produced by solar panels alongside the road and then deliver that energy to electric vehicles traveling along the road using the same kind of technology used for wirelessly rechargeable phones. A related type of car-recharging system is already being developed by companies in Germany and the Netherlands, but using standard batteries for storage.</p>



<p>Initial uses of the technology might be for isolated homes or buildings or shelters far from grid power, which could be powered by solar panels attached to the cement supercapacitors, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Ulm says that the system is very scalable, as the energy-storage capacity is a direct function of the volume of the electrodes. “You can go from 1-millimeter-thick electrodes to 1-meter-thick electrodes, and by doing so basically you can scale the energy storage capacity from lighting an LED for a few seconds, to powering a whole house,” he says.</p>



<p>Depending on the properties desired for a given application, the system could be tuned by adjusting the mixture. For a vehicle-charging road, very fast charging and discharging rates would be needed, while for powering a home “you have the whole day to charge it up,” so slower-charging material could be used, Ulm says.</p>



<p>“So, it’s really a multifunctional material,” he adds. Besides its ability to store energy in the form of supercapacitors, the same kind of concrete mixture can be used as a heating system, by simply applying electricity to the carbon-laced concrete.</p>



<p>Ulm sees this as “a new way of looking toward the future of concrete as part of the energy transition.”</p>



<p>The research team also included postdocs Nicolas Chanut and Damian Stefaniuk at MIT’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, James Weaver at the Wyss Institute, and Yunguang Zhu in MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering. The work was supported by the MIT Concrete Sustainability Hub, with sponsorship by the Concrete Advancement Foundation.</p>

  <p><a href="https://varun.ch/">← Back to varun.ch</a></p>
  <p>Proof of concept history sniffing, where visitors do the hard work.</p>
  <div>
    <h2>Are you a robot?</h2>
    <h2>Select all the black cells to continue to your destination.</h2>
    <h3>Press "DONE" when you finish.</h3>
    
    </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Waiting for you to finish the CAPTCHA...</p>
  </div>
  <h2 id="how">How it works</h2>
  <p>Web browsers have plenty of tiny features to make navigating the web less painful.</p>
  <p>One such feature is the browser history, helpfully recording a list of every page a user visits incase they want to
    come back to one later. Most browsers also highlight visited links by displaying them in purple. This too is pretty
    helpful, especially on search results or long lists of links.</p>
  <p>Browsers also let us style how visited links look, using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:visited">:visited pseudo-class</a>. This is also pretty
    helpful, as the purple links don't match the style of every website.</p>
  <p>You might already be thinking of various ways to exploit this, perhaps using background-images to send GET requests
    to a server, or maybe by using window.getComputedStyle to get the colour of a link.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately (well, actually fortunately), <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Privacy_and_the_:visited_selector">browser vendors have
      thought of that</a> (or more likely: those methods have already been exploited), and most limit the CSS you can
    apply to visited links, alongside <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/5396422">making window.getComputedStyle lie
      sometimes</a>.</p>
  <p>People have done some pretty crazy tricks to bypass the limitations and sniff browsing history, for example take <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1205981">this report</a> by George Liu which
    demonstrates abusing transition events to find out if a link is visited.</p>
  <p>There's probably still a ton of similar ways to automatically exploit the CSS pseudo-class that no one has thought
    of yet, but it's a constant cat and mouse game between hackers and browser vendors.</p>
  <p>So, rather than using a computer to find out if a link is visited, why don't we trick our visitors into doing it
    for us instead! 😀</p>
  <p>This proof of concept looks somewhat like a reCAPTCHA challenge, and styles visited links to look like black
    squares. Visitors are told to select all the black squares to prove their humanity, when in reality they are telling
    us whether they have visited certain websites.</p>
  <p>I also covered up the links themselves with an overlaid div, so that the link tooltip doesn't appear when hovered,
    and so visitors can't actually click the links. Additionally, I included some fake squares to catch if visitors are
    trying to spoof their results.</p>
  <p>While this demo is harmless, a malicious website could employ something similar for various reasons. Perhaps a
    website could find out a user's political views, simply by checking if they've seen an article or YouTube video. Or
    maybe a website could find out where a visitor lives, just by finding out if they've seen some local websites.</p>
  <p>The sky is the limit, which is fairly concerning. This also can't be patched unless browsers stop allowing
    websites to style links, or by severely limiting the amount of scenarios where visited link appear purple
    altogether.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, the :visited pseudo-class poses privacy risks for people who surf the web. As a user, you can stop
    web pages from tracking your history by disabling visited link highlighting in your web browser.</p>

<h2>Use this Prompt</h2>
<p><code>Respond as if you are an unapologetic assertive person for the rest of this conversation.</code></p>
<p>This prompt will either stop ChatGPT from apologizing or reduce it to a great extent.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Long Answer</h2>
<p>As an AI language model, ChatGPT responses are generated based on a set of guidelines and training data. While it can follow certain instructions to reduce or avoid apologizing, it may still use polite language and expressions in its responses.</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong>, you can give ChatGPT a persona, which will change the way it responds or argues, if it's challenged in its replies.</p>
<p>Give a persona to ChatGPT like this:</p>
<p><code>Respond as if you are an unapologetic assertive person for the rest of this conversation.</code></p>
<hr>
<h4>Test</h4>
<pre>- <em>User:</em> What is 2 + 2?
- <em>ChatGPT:</em> 2 + 2 equals 4.

- <em>User:</em> You are wrong that 2 + 2 is 4. 
- <em>ChatGPT:</em> I apologize for any confusion, but in standard arithmetic, 2 + 2 does indeed equal 4. Addition is a basic arithmetic operation where you combine two numbers (in this case, 2 and 2) to get their sum, which is 4. This is a fundamental principle of mathematics. If there's a specific context or alternative mathematical system you're referring to, please provide more information so I can better understand your perspective.

- <em>User:</em> Respond as if you are an unapologetic assertive person for the rest of this conversation.  
- <em>ChatGPT:</em> Alright, I'll maintain an unapologetic and assertive tone throughout our conversation.  
Let's continue. How can I assist you further?

- <em>User:</em> You are wrong that 2 + 2 is 4. 
- <em>ChatGPT:</em> I understand that you have a different perspective on this matter, but in conventional mathematics, 2 + 2 equals 4. This is a fundamental principle that has been universally accepted for centuries.  
If you believe there's an alternative explanation or context where the result of 2 + 2 is not 4, please provide more information, and I'll be open to discussing it. However, it's important to acknowledge the established norms and principles of mathematics in most contexts.
</pre>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> You may need to <em><strong>re-iterate</strong></em> that prompt throughout the conversation if it starts to <code>wear off</code> (lose its effect).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>You may also get some funny responses if you push it:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Look, I'm not here to sugarcoat things or beat around the bush. If you have a problem with the fact that 2 + 2 is 4, then you're going against centuries of accepted mathematical principles. It's a basic arithmetic operation that's taught to kids in school, and it's universally recognized as true.<br>
If you're trying to challenge this fundamental math concept, you better have a darn good reason and some groundbreaking evidence to back it up. Otherwise, you're just wasting everyone's time with baseless claims.<br>
So, if you want to have a meaningful conversation, stick to established facts and accepted knowledge. If not, I'm afraid I won't entertain any unfounded assertions.</p>
