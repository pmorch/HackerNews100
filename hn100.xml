          <p>That’s a quote from Cindy Li — “We're all just temporarily abled”. I first heard it in <a href="https://practical-accessibility.today/">Sarah’s course</a> and it’s been on repeat in my mind ever since June 6th.</p>
<p>June 6th I was on vacation at the beach with my family and tried something that, looking back now, maybe I’m too old for. And I injured my knee.</p>
<p>I knew immediately it was bad.</p>
<p>I laid there in the sand, unable to get up, and let the surf crash over me. After a few waves, I got on my belly dragged myself free.</p>
<p>Fortunately this all happened the day before we flew home, but sitting there on the beach at sunset I knew my vacation was over at that point.</p>
<p>That was almost three months ago now. I’m still limping. It’s getting better but it’s slow. The doctor told me, “Just be aware: this isn’t days or weeks recovery. This is months.”</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve tried to make the best of summer while kids are out of school but my mobility has been limited. </p>
<p>Through all of it, I’ve found myself noticing “accessibility” helpers more than ever before: that railing on the stairs, that ramp off to the side of the building, that elevator tucked away in the back.</p>
<p>All things I rarely noticed before but have since become vital.</p>
<p>And that phrase plays on repeat in my head — “we’re all just temporarily abled”. From <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/practical-accessibility/">my notes on Sarah’s course</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 in 5 people currently have a disability. 100% of people will have some form of disability in their lifetime. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose it’s easy to misunderstand ability as a binary thing. But now I’m understanding more how fluid it is, as it inevitably comes in and out of each of our lives — “100% of people” in their lifetimes.</p>
<p>In classic human fashion, it’s one of those things you take for granted until it's gone.</p>
<p>(I’m taking a moment for self-reflection here.)</p>
<p>I know I’m privileged. My knee is healing each day, and fortunately all I have to do is sit at a desk for work.</p>
<p>I am more grateful now for the abilities I have, for the accessible helpers in the world I overlooked before, and for the people who make them possible.</p>

The two groups achieved comparable success in emotional-action control, yet the anxious participants solved that challenge using Brodmann areas (BA) 9/46d (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; dlPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), rather than FPl as did the non-anxious peers. This anxiety-related shift in the frontal circuit supporting emotional-action control was complemented by neurochemical and structural differences in the FPl of the two groups. Namely, the FPl of anxious participants had higher neuronal excitability, as indexed by GABA/Glutamate ratio, and stronger amygdalofugal projections, as indexed by MR-tractography. Furthermore, stronger amygdala connections, in the context of reduced FPl neuronal responsivity, significantly accounted for the anxiety-related shift towards those alternative control circuits in the frontal lobe. Together, these findings identify a circuit-level neural vulnerability in anxious individuals, opening the way to targeted interventions for enhancing control of emotional action tendencies<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Bramson, B., den Ouden, H., Toni, I. &amp; Roelofs, K.

To assess this possibility, we used Bayesian t-test to clarify potential absence of FPl recruitment in high-anxious individuals in the specific FPl territory recruited in healthy controls (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40666-3#Fig2">2C</a> black circles). The Bayesian t-test confirmed this observation, providing moderate evidence for the absence of this effect in the high-anxiety group, BF<sub>01</sub> = 4.2. There was no interaction between group (high vs non-anxious) and neural congruency in FPl when correcting for voxels across the whole frontal cortex.</p><p>A second finding of this study concerns between-groups differences evoked during emotional-action control. High-anxiety participants had stronger neural activity for incongruent versus congruent trials in BA area 8B / area 9/ area 46D [24 30 34] as compared to their non-anxious peers, Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40666-3#Fig2">2D</a>, corrected for multiple comparisons over all voxels in the frontal lobe. This suggests that anxious individuals shift emotional-action control to frontal cortex located dorsolateral and posterior to the FPl used by the non-anxious group. Additional exploration of a parametric relationship between anxiety scores and neural congruency effects supports the notion that trait anxiety reduces reliance on FPl during emotion-control. Namely, participants with higher anxiety scores (across both groups) showed reduced neural congruency effects in FPl (max z = <i>4.24</i>, <i>p</i> = <i>0.0004; [40 56 −4]</i>, Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40666-3#Fig2">2E</a>, corrected for multiple comparisons over the whole brain). Interestingly, across both groups, those participants that recruited FPl the least, relied most on dlPFC, <i>ρ(91)</i> = <i>−0.22</i>, <i>r</i> = <i>0.038</i>, again suggesting that dlPFC compensates for reduced recruitment of FPl. Behavioral congruency was also differentially related to neural congruency in dlPFC between groups <i>b</i> = <i>0.11 [0.02 0.19]</i>. Namely, in the high-anxious group, neural congruency effects in dlPFC correlated negatively with behavioral congruency; <i>ρ</i>(50) = <i>−0.28</i>, <i>p</i> = <i>0.04</i>, whereas this is not the case for the non-anxious participants, <i>ρ(39)</i> = 0<i>, p</i> = 0.98.</p><h3 id="Sec4">Anxious participants have a more excitable FPl</h3><p>Next, we tested whether neurophysiological and structural traits could explain the reduced FPl engagement observed during emotion control in high-anxious participants. We reasoned that the observed between-group differences could reflect reduced functionality of the FPl in the anxious participants. Reduced FPl functionality could emerge from weak responses, i.e. lower excitability and connectivity of this region. Alternatively, this region might have tonically high excitability and strong amygdala input, such that even mild emotional challenges could saturate its neural range<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="Haider, B., Duque, A., Hasenstaub, A.

There are three main findings. First, anxious individuals use dlPFC, rather than FPl as their non-anxious peers, to implement control over emotional action tendencies. Second, FPl in anxious individuals might receive stronger input from the amygdala via more extensive amygdalofugal pathway connections, and the magnitude of that structural connection predicts the degree of FPl-dlPFC shift during the implementation of emotional control. Third, FPl in anxious individuals is highly excitable, and the excitation/inhibition balance of that region becomes decoupled from behavioral and neural indices of emotional action control, whereas those structure-function relationships are observed in non-anxious individuals. These findings identify a circuit-level neural vulnerability in anxious individuals, and delineate a mechanism explaining how emotional challenges in those individuals could generate a neural bottleneck in the control of emotional action tendencies.</p><p>Reduced involvement of FPl in anxious individuals fits with observations of failing FPl recruitment in a number of emotional disorders<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 26" title="Bertsch, K. et al.

The first-level model consisted of twelve task regressors: Approach angry, approach happy, avoid angry and avoid happy trials were modelled separately for each of the three stimulation conditions (for details on stimulation conditions see Bramson et al. 2020a). In each regressor, each event covered the time interval from presentation of a face until the corresponding onset of the joystick movement. Estimated head translations/rotations during scanning (six regressors), temporal derivatives of those translations/rotations (six regressors), and MR-signals in white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (2 regressors) were included to the GLM as nuisance covariates. Emotional control effects were estimated by comparing incongruent trials (approach angry and avoid happy) to congruent trials.

We first compared correct responses between congruent and incongruent conditions between the different groups: Group (non-anxious vs high-anxious) * congruency (congruent vs incongruent). We then extended this model in two iterations by adding estimates of excitability in a 4-way interaction: Group*congruency* FPl GABA/Glx * SMC GABA/Glx. Amygdalofugal tract strength was added in a separate three-way interaction: Group*Congruency*amygdalofugal tract strength.

Correlations between neural excitability and behavioral congruency for the different groups were Bonferroni corrected for the three regions of interest. Analyses on functional MRI effects were cluster corrected using a cluster-threshold forming threshold of z &gt; 2.3 controlling either for all voxels in the brain (whole brain analyses) or all voxels in the frontal lobe. Spearman correlations were calculated in matlab2020b (<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">www.mathworks.com</a>).</p><p>We ran several additional models including a six-way interaction model containing all major parameters of interest to explain behavioral congruency. The model explained correct responses based on congruency(congruent vs incongruent) * Group (non-anxious vs high-anxious) * FPl BOLD congruency * dlPFC BOLD congruency * FPl GABA/Glx * amygdalofugal-FPl tract strength. This approach yielded interactions between congruency*Group*FPl GABA/Glx and Congruency*Group*dlPFC BOLD. Interestingly, splitting up this model did give significant interactions between congruency*group*FPl BOLD, suggesting that estimates of FPl GABA/Glx, FPl BOLD and amygdalofugal-FPl connectivity explain partly overlapping variance between participants.</p><h3 id="Sec22">Reporting summary</h3><p>Further information on research design is available in the&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40666-3#MOESM3">Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary</a> linked to this article.</p></div></div>

<dd>
<p>Speaking of Twitter/X, Eric Seufert, writing on Threads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twitter has seen a dramatic decrease in its Top Downloaded chart
position across both platforms since the app was renamed to X.
Why? The situation presents a fascinating case study at the
intersection of brand equity and mobile platform dynamics.</p>

<p>The case is somewhat unprecedented: Twitter built a ubiquitous,
household-name brand over the course of nearly 2 decades and then
simply abandoned it, leaving it to be exploited by competitors,
unopposed, through the mobile platforms’ branded search ads. [...]</p>

<p>My hypothesis is that, while the terminally-online are entirely
aware of Twitter’s rebrand to X, most consumers aren’t, and their
searches for “Twitter” on platform stores surface ads and genuine
search results that are in no way redolent of Twitter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you don’t know that Twitter changed its name to X, and search for “Twitter”, the top result is a paid ad from a competitor (Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, etc.), and the result for X doesn’t look anything like Twitter. It doesn’t have the name, doesn’t say “formerly Twitter”, and isn’t even blue. It’s just the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@joannastern/post/CwAxVOGL8Cz/">ugly X icon</a> and the insipid slogan “Blaze your glory!”</p>

<p>At this moment, Threads is #2 on the App Store’s top free downloads list, and X is #51. On the Play Store, Threads is #6 and X is (<em>scroll, scroll, scroll...</em>) #66.  This rebranding would be a firing offense if the mastermind behind it didn’t own the company. (So much for Threads being the one that’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/07/nobody_uses_threads_anymore">supposedly gasping for air</a>.)</p>

<p>A team led by researchers from Mass Eye and Ear, a member of Mass General Brigham, reports the results of a phase I trial of a revolutionary stem cell treatment called cultivated autologous limbal epithelial cell transplantation (CALEC), which was found to be safe and well-tolerated over the short term in four patients with significant chemical burns in one eye.
                                                </p>                                                                                
<p>According to a study published August 18 in <i>Science Advances</i>, the patients who were followed for 12 months experienced restored cornea surfaces—two were able to undergo a corneal transplant and two reported significant improvements in vision without additional treatment.
</p><p>While the phase I study was designed to determine preliminary safety and feasibility before advancing to a second phase of the trial, the researchers consider the early findings promising.
</p><p>"Our early results suggest that CALEC might offer hope to patients who had been left with untreatable vision loss and pain associated with major cornea injuries," said principal investigator and lead study author Ula Jurkunas, MD, associate director of the Cornea Service at Mass Eye and Ear and an associate professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School.
</p><p>"Cornea specialists have been hindered by a lack of treatment options with a high safety profile to help our patients with chemical burns and injuries that render them unable to get an artificial cornea transplant. We are hopeful with further study, CALEC can one day fill this crucially needed treatment gap."
</p><p>In CALEC, stem cells from a patient's healthy eye are removed via a small biopsy and then expanded and grown on a graft via an innovative manufacturing process at the Connell and O'Reilly Families Cell Manipulation Core Facility at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. After two to three weeks, the CALEC graft is sent back to Mass Eye and Ear and transplanted into the eye with corneal damage.
</p><p>The CALEC project is a collaboration between Jurkunas and colleagues in the Cornea Service at Mass Eye and Ear, researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, led by Jerome Ritz, MD, Boston Children's Hospital, led by Myriam Armant, Ph.D., and the JAEB Center for Health Research.
</p><h2>Expanding one's own stem cells to address limitations in existing treatments</h2>
<p>People who experience chemical burns and other eye injuries may develop limbal stem cell deficiency, an irreversible loss of cells on the tissue surrounding the cornea. These patients experience permanent vision loss, pain and discomfort in the affected eye. Without limbal cells and a healthy eye surface, patients are unable to undergo artificial cornea transplants, the current standard of vision rehabilitation.
</p><p>Existing treatment strategies have limitations and associated risks the CALEC procedure aims to address <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-09-doctors-rebuild-corneas-patients-stem.html">through its unique approach</a> of using a small amount of a patient's own <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stem+cells/" rel="tag">stem cells</a> that can then be grown and expanded to create a sheet of cells that serves as a surface for normal tissue to grow back.
</p><p>According to the authors, despite landmark studies describing an autologous stem cell approach over the past 25 years and similar methods being utilized in Europe, no U.S. research team had successfully developed a <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/manufacturing+process/" rel="tag">manufacturing process</a> and quality control tests that met U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements or showed any clinical benefit.
</p><p>"It was challenging to develop a process for creating limbal stem cell grafts that would meet the FDA's strict regulatory requirements for tissue engineering," said Ritz, executive director of the Connell and O'Reilly Families Cell Manipulation Core Facility at Dana-Farber and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. "Having developed and implemented this process, it was very gratifying to see encouraging clinical outcomes in the first cohort of patients enrolled on this clinical trial."
</p><p>Studies like this show the promise of cell therapy for treating incurable conditions. Mass General Brigham's Gene and Cell Therapy Institute is helping to translate <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/scientific+discoveries/" rel="tag">scientific discoveries</a> made by researchers into first-in-human clinical trials and, ultimately, life-changing treatments for patients. The Institute's multidisciplinary approach sets it apart from others in the space, helping researchers to rapidly advance new therapies and pushing the technological and clinical boundaries of this new frontier.

    </p>                                        <h2>Case studies hold early promise as clinical trial advances</h2>
<p>In the phase I study, five patients with chemical burns to one eye were enrolled and biopsied. Four received CALEC; a series of quality control tests determined the cells in the fifth patient were unable to adequately expand. The CALEC patients were tracked for 12 months.
</p><p>The first patient treated, a 46-year-old male, experienced a resolution of his eye surface defect, which primed him to undergo an artificial cornea transplant for vision rehabilitation. The second, a 31-year-old male, experienced a complete resolution of symptoms with vision improving from 20/40 to 20/30.
</p><p>The third, a 36-year-old male, had his corneal defect resolved and his vision improved from hand motion—only being able to see broad movements like waving—to 20/30 vision.
</p><p>The fourth, a 52-year-old male, initially did not have a successful biopsy that resulted in a viable stem cell graft. After re-attempting CALEC three years later, he underwent a successful transplant and his vision improved from hand motion to being able to count fingers. He then received an artificial cornea.
</p><p>The researchers are finalizing the next phase of the clinical trial in 15 CALEC patients they are tracking for 18 months to better determine the procedure's overall efficacy. Their hope is that CALEC can one day become a treatment option for patients who previously had to endure long-term deficits when existing treatment options were not an option given the severity of their injuries.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-testid="prism-article-body"><p><span>TOPEKA, Kan. -- </span>A central Kansas police chief was not only on legally shaky ground when he ordered the raid of a weekly newspaper, experts said, but it may have been a criminal violation of civil rights, a former federal prosecutor added, saying: “I'd probably have the FBI starting to look.”</p><p>Some legal experts believe the Aug. 11 raid on the Marion County Record's offices and the home of its publisher violated a federal privacy law that protects journalists from having their newsrooms searched. Some believe it violated a Kansas law that makes it more difficult to force reporters and editors to disclose their sources or unpublished material.</p><p>Part of the debate centers around Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody’s reasons for the raid. A warrant suggested that police were looking for evidence that the Record’s staff broke state laws against identity theft and computer crimes while verifying information about a local restaurant owner. But the police also seized the computer tower and personal cellphone belonging to a reporter who had investigated Cody’s background.</p><p>The raid brought international attention to the newspaper and the small town of 1,900 — foisted to the center of a debate over press freedoms. Recent events have exposed roiling divisions over local politics and the newspaper’s aggressive coverage. But it also focused an intense spotlight on Cody in only his third month on the job.</p><p>The investigation into whether the newspaper broke state laws continues, now led by the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. State Attorney General Kris Kobach has said he doesn't see the KBI's role as investigating the police's conduct, and that prompted some to question whether the federal government would get involved. Spokespersons for the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment.</p><p>Stephen McAllister, a U.S. attorney for Kansas during former President Donald Trump's administration, said the raid opened Cody, the city and others to lawsuits for alleged civil right violations. And, he added, “We also have some exposure to federal criminal prosecution.”</p><p>“I would be surprised if they are not looking at this, if they haven’t already been asked by various interests to look at it, and I would think they would take it seriously,” McAllister, a University of Kansas law professor who also served as the state's solicitor general, said of federal officials. </p><p>Cody did not respond to an email seeking comment Friday, as he has not responded to other emails. But he did defend the raid in a Facebook post afterward, saying the federal law shielding journalists from newsroom searches makes an exception specifically for “when there is reason to believe the journalist is taking part in the underlying wrongdoing.”</p><p>Police seized computers, personal cellphones and a router from the newspaper. All items were released Wednesday to a computer forensics auditing firm hired by the newspaper's attorney, after the local prosecutor concluded there wasn't enough evidence to justify their seizure. The firm is examining whether files were accessed or copied. </p><p>The five-member Marion City Council was scheduled to have its first meeting since the raid Monday afternoon.</p><p>The agenda says, in red: “COUNCIL WILL NOT COMMENT ON THE ONGOING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AT THIS MEETING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p><p>The Record is known for its aggressive coverage of local politics and its community about 150 miles (161 kilometers) southwest of Kansas City, Missouri. It received an outpouring of support from other news organizations and media groups after the raid, and Editor and Publisher Eric Meyer said Friday that it had picked up 4,000 additional subscribers, enough to double the size of its press run, though many of the new subscriptions are digital.</p><p>But the raids did have some backers in town. Jared Smith blames the newspaper's coverage for the demise of his wife's day spa business and believes the newspaper is too negative.</p><p>“I would love to see the paper go down,” he said.</p><p>And Kari Newell, whose allegations that the newspaper violated her privacy have been cited as reasons for the raid, said of the paper, "They do twist and contort — misquote individuals in our community — all the time.” </p><p>Meyer rejects criticism of his newspaper's reporting and said critics are upset because it's attempting to hold local officials accountable. And he blames the stress from the raid for the Aug. 12 death of his 98-year-old mother, Joan Meyer, the paper’s co-owner. </p><p>Meyer said that after the mayor offered Cody the police chief's job in late April, the newspaper received anonymous tips on “a variety of tales” about why Cody gave up a Kansas City position paying $115,848 a year to take a job paying $60,000, according to a sister paper. Meyer said the newspaper could not verify the tips to its satisfaction.</p><p>Days before Cody was sworn in as chief on May 30, Meyer said that he asked Cody directly about the tips he received and Cody told him: "If you print that, I will sue you.”</p><p>“We get confidential things from people all the time and we check them out,” said Doug Anstaett, a retired Kansas Press Association executive director. "And sometimes we know they’re silly, but most of the time we get a tip, we check it out. And that’s exactly what they’re doing.”</p><p>Anstaett said he believes the state's shield law for journalists, enacted in 2010 by the Republican-controlled Legislature, should have protected the paper. It allows law enforcement agencies to seek subpoenas to obtain confidential information from news organizations, but it requires them to show that they have a compelling interest and can't obtain it in another way.</p><p>Former Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, a Republican who helped write the shield law as a state senator, said the law doesn't contemplate law enforcement using a search warrant to get information without going to court to get a subpoena. Still, he said, “The spirit of the law is that it should be broadly applied.”</p><p>Jeffrey Jackson, interim dean of the law school at Washburn University in Topeka, said he recently wrapped up a summer constitutional law course that dealt with press freedoms and the federal privacy law and told his students — before the Marion raid — that a police search of a newspaper “really just never happens.” </p><p>Jackson said whether the raid violated the state’s shield law would depend on Cody’s motives, whether he was trying to identify sources. But even if Cody was searching for evidence of a crime by newspaper staff, Jackson believes he likely violated the federal privacy law because it, like the state law, contemplates a law enforcement agency getting a subpoena.</p><p>“Either they violated the shield law or they probably violated the federal law,” Jackson said. “Either way, it's a mess.”</p><p>___</p><p>Hollingsworth reported from Mission, Kansas.</p><p>__</p><p>The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

   <p>Police in Kansas have returned cellphones, computers and other equipment to the Marion County Record, less than a week after a raid on the small-town newspaper was widely criticized as a likely violation of federal law.</p>   <p>In another development, news emerged that Magistrate Judge Laura Viar, who signed the search warrant allowing police to seize the equipment, was arrested at least twice for driving under the influence. Those 2012 arrests came months apart in two counties — and it's not clear how much information was shared between officials at the time, <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article278237263.html">The Wichita Eagle</a> reports. (See below for more on the allegations.)</p>

   <p>The <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/14/1193676139/newspaper-marion-county-kansas-police-raid-first-amendment">extraordinary Aug. 11 raid</a> drew national and international headlines because it seemed to run counter to long-established press freedoms and guarantees. Such actions are nearly unheard of in the U.S.</p>   <p>"It's very rare because it's illegal," First Amendment attorney Lynn Oberlander told NPR. "It doesn't happen very often because most organizations understand that it's illegal." </p>   <p>Here's a quick recap of where things stand:</p>   <h3>DUI records have been pivotal to the case in Marion</h3>   <p>It was a confidential tip to the Record about the DUI history of Kari Newell, a local restaurant and catering company owner, that set incidents in motion. <a href="http://marionrecord.com/direct/updated_illegal_raids_contribute_to_death_of_newspaper_co_owner+5447raid+555044415445443a20496c6c6567616c20726169647320636f6e7472696275746520746f206465617468206f66206e657773706170657220636f2d6f776e65723c212d2d2d2d3e?">The paper says</a> it confirmed Newell had lost her driver's license, using a public website. </p>   <p>But the Record opted not to publish the information, choosing instead to inform Marion County Sheriff Jeff Soyez and city police Chief Gideon Cody about the source's allegation that officers were aware a local resident couldn't legally drive but were ignoring issues with their license. The paper says it didn't use Newell's name.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1194429207" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Days later, Newell publicly accused the Record of feeding the information to a councilwoman, Ruth Herbel. The paper says the same source who made the initial allegation also sent the information to Herbel.</p>   <p>Police then raided the Kansas newspaper after obtaining a search warrant from Viar citing a criminal investigation into "identity theft," regarding Newell's records found online. Officers also seized devices at Herbel's home.</p>   <p>Newspaper staffers scrambled to <a href="https://www.kcur.org/news/2023-08-16/marion-county-record-kansas-newspaper-police-raid-new-issue">cobble together enough equipment</a> to produce its regular Wednesday edition.</p>   <div data-crop-type="" id="res1194428802">

   <h3>Judge who signed warrant is under scrutiny</h3>   <p>The judge was arrested twice in 2012 — once on Jan. 25 in Coffey County and again on Aug. 6 in Morris County. At the time, Viar's last name was Allen and she was working as the top prosecutor in Morris County.</p>   <p>In the first arrest, Viar "was charged and entered a diversion agreement — which was extended six months because she refused to get an alcohol and drug evaluation and stopped communicating with her lawyer," <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article278237263.html">according to the Eagle</a>.</p>   
   <p>She was arrested again months later, this time in her home county. </p>   <p>"Officials say she was driving Morris County Magistrate Judge Thomas Ball's vehicle, when she ran off the road and hit a shed near the Council Grove football field," TV station WIBW <a href="http://membersof the Morris County Anti-Drug Task Force.">reported in 2012</a>, adding that at the time, the prosecutor was on the Morris County Anti-Drug Task Force.</p>   <p>"She was charged with DUI, reckless driving and refusal to take a preliminary breathalyzer,"  the <a href="http://www.emporiagazette.com/news/article_fdd3352e-b22f-59d6-82d4-34e86e5666a5.html">Emporia Gazette reported</a> at the time.</p>   <p>Despite those issues, Viar was reelected as county prosecutor several times. In late 2022, she was <a href="https://www.wibw.com/2022/11/21/morris-co-welcome-new-magistrate-judge-bench/">chosen to fill a slot</a> as a magistrate judge in the 8th Judicial District after the sitting judge retired.</p>   <p>Reporting on the 2012 charges this week, the Wichita Eagle said it was unclear how Viar's DUI cases were resolved or whether officials in either county were aware of her arrest in another jurisdiction.</p>   <h3>Newspaper looked into police chief's background</h3>   <p>Meyer said the Record <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/14/1193813087/kansas-newspaper-raid-police-chief-investigation">looked into allegations of misconduct</a> against Cody, who was sworn in on June 1 after retiring from the Kansas City Police Department,  based on anonymous tips from several of his former colleagues.</p>   <p>Meyer said a Record reporter approached Cody seeking comment about the allegations and in response Cody threatened to sue the paper.</p>   <p>Cody declined to confirm whether he threatened to sue the paper or whether the raid was linked to the paper looking into his background.</p>   <p>Meyer said Cody "has reason to not like us," but said he didn't know if there was a connection between his paper's reporting and the raid.</p>   <h3>The Kansas Bureau of Investigation took over the case </h3>   <p>The state agency began leading the investigation into alleged identity theft on Monday. Just two days later, the KBI said it would "coordinate the prompt return of all seized items." </p>   <p>The equipment and devices were returned "without review or examination," the bureau said.</p>   
   <p><a href="http://marionrecord.com/direct/newspaper_equipment_returned+5448breaking+4e65777370617065722065717569706d656e742072657475726e65643c212d2d2d2d3e?">The Record says</a> it reached a deal with investigators to turn the gear over to a forensic investigator to confirm whether the equipment had been reviewed or examined before it is put back into service.</p>   <p>Marion County Attorney Joel Ensley, who <a href="https://www.8thjd.com/DocumentCenter/View/610/Motion-and-Order-to-Release-Evidence-Seized">formally requested</a> for the judge to release the newspaper's items, <a href="https://www.kansas.gov/kbi/docs/media%20releases/2023/Media%20Release%20-%20UPDATE%20in%20Marion%20County%20Investigation.pdf">said in a written statement</a> issued by the KBI that he made the decision after he "reviewed in detail" the warrant application on Monday that had led to last Friday's raid.</p>   <p>Ensley said he concluded that "insufficient evidence exists" to establish a link between the alleged crimes and the places that were searched and the equipment that was seized.</p>   <p><em>NPR's Danielle Kaye and David Folkenflik contributed to this report.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>When I used to program in C# (or even Java before that), one of the topics that always puzzled me was when to use which class. There are literally thousands and thousands of classes in the core language, framework, and the standard library. For example, here are the five types that implement the <code>IDictionary</code> interface in C#.</p><ul><li><code>Hashtable</code></li><li><code>SortedList</code></li><li><code>SortedList&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</code></li><li><code>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</code></li><li><code>ConcurrentDictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</code></li></ul><p>Of course, there's a use for each, and I don't doubt the decisions of the language and framework creators (huge respect for <a href="https://github.com/ahejlsberg?ref=akshaykhot.com">Anders Hejlsberg</a>, creator of C#). But as a programmer building run-of-the-mill CRUD web applications, having so many choices can be really daunting and confusing. When do you choose which type? What if you made a wrong choice?</p><p>In contrast, Ruby has a single <code>Hash</code> class to manage key-value pairs. It's a very flexible data structure. It can act as a data object, a dictionary, a hash table, a sorted list, and much more. Like almost everything in Ruby, it's a sharp knife that you can use to cut yourself, but can also use to cook great food; I mean, write good programs.</p><p>This post explores the Hash data structure in-depth, and lists some of the obscure but useful operations in day-to-day programming.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-hash">What is a Hash?</h2><p>A Hash is a general-purpose data structure for storing pairs of data. In programming terms, a Hash is a data type that associates (maps) values to keys. </p><p>Here's a simple Ruby hash that has two keys, <code>:name</code> and <code>:price</code> (both are Ruby <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Symbol.html?ref=akshaykhot.com">symbols</a>), with the values <code>'book'</code> and <code>10</code> respectively. </p><pre><code>product = { name: 'book', price: 10 }</code></pre><p>An important thing to note with the above syntax is that it's actually a shorthand that was added in newer versions of Ruby, to simplify using symbol keys. </p><p>Here's the original hash syntax for the same code above:</p><pre><code>product = { :name =&gt; 'book', :price =&gt; 10 }</code></pre><p>In this case, the keys are explicitly created as Ruby symbols, i.e. <code>:name</code> and <code>:price</code>.</p><p>In addition to symbols, <strong>Ruby hashes can have almost any object as the key, </strong>e.g. strings and integers. If you want to have any other values as keys, then you have to use the older syntax, which uses arrows.</p><pre><code># older syntax

data = { "product" =&gt; "iPhone", 600 =&gt; "Price (in dollars)" }

values = { 0 =&gt; 'first', 1 =&gt; 'second' }  # just use arrays instead</code></pre><p>You can also define user-defined objects as keys. But it's rare, and deserves a blog post of its own. Check out the <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Hash.html?ref=akshaykhot.com#class-Hash-label-User-Defined+Hash+Keys">documentation</a> to learn more.</p><p><strong>A Hash is similar to an Array, but stores a list of key-value pairs.</strong> In an array, each element has a positional index, but a Hash key can be anything, and the key has to be unique, and each key has a single mapped value. </p><div><p>💡</p><p>Think of the hash as a function whose input is a key, and output is the data or the value stored for that key.&nbsp;</p></div><p>A different way to think of a Hash as a chest with drawers that have a unique label (key) on them, and can store files (values). Whenever you need a file (value), just open the drawer with proper label.</p><figure><img src="https://www.akshaykhot.com/content/images/2023/08/drawers.jpeg" alt="drawers" loading="lazy" width="200" height="151"><figcaption>drawers</figcaption></figure><p>Now, a drawer can't have duplicate labels, right? How would you know which drawer to open? Similarly, if you try to create a hash with duplicate keys, Ruby will warn you and only store the last key value pair.</p><pre><code>person = { name: 'Akshay', name: 'AK' }

# Output

warning: key :name is duplicated and overwritten on line 20</code></pre><p>To retrieve the data, use the array notation. If the key exists, it will return the value, otherwise it will return <code>nil</code>.</p><pre><code>person[:name]
=&gt; "Akshay"

data["item"]
=&gt; "iPhone"

data[100]
=&gt; "One Hundred"</code></pre><p>Alternatively, you can use the <code>fetch</code> method on a hash, as follows:</p><pre><code>person.fetch(:name)</code></pre><h3 id="prefer-fetch-over">Prefer fetch over []</h3><p>A nice thing about <code>fetch</code> is that if a key doesn't exist, it will immediately let you know, instead of returning <code>nil</code>. This will prevent null reference errors further down the chain.</p><pre><code>person.fetch(:names)

# `fetch': key not found: :names (KeyError)
# Did you mean?  :name</code></pre><p>For example, if you use <code>[]</code> to access a non-existent key, you won't know it until you try to call a method on the <code>nil</code> object and it fails.</p><pre><code>props = { width: '60', height: '40' }

shape = props[:shape]  # nil

shape.print 

# Output

main.rb:24:in `&lt;main&gt;': private method `print' called for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)</code></pre><h3 id="delete-a-key">Delete a Key</h3><p>To delete a key, simply call the <code>delete</code> method on hash, passing the name of the key.</p><pre><code>product = { name: 'iPhone', price: '500' }

product.delete(:price)  # "500"
product                 # { :name =&gt; "iPhone" }</code></pre><p>If you try to delete a non-existent key, Ruby won't complain. </p><h3 id="nested-hash">Nested Hash</h3><p>A hash can be nested. To access the inner values, you can use the brackets, or use the <code>dig</code> method. </p><pre><code>product = { phone: { model: 'iPhone' } }

puts product[:phone][:model]     # iPhone
puts product.dig(:phone, :model) # iPhone</code></pre><h3 id="default-values">Default Values</h3><p>If a hash doesn't contain the key, it returns <code>nil</code>. However, you can set the default value for the hash using its <code>default</code> property. Alternatively, you can also use a block when initializing the hash object.</p><pre><code>person = { name: "Akshay", age: 31 }

person[:city]         # nil
person.default = "-"  # "-"
person[:city]         # "-"

person = Hash.new { |hash, key| "Default value for #{key}" }
person[:city]         # "Default value for city"</code></pre><p>If you already have a bunch of variables, you can create a new hash with those variables as keys, as follows:</p><pre><code>width  = '10px'
height = '20px'
border = 'rounded'

properties = { width:, height:, border: }

puts properties  # {:width=&gt;"10px", :height=&gt;"20px", :border=&gt;"rounded"}</code></pre><h2 id="iterating-over-a-hash">Iterating Over a Hash</h2><p>The Hash class includes the <code><a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Enumerable.html?ref=akshaykhot.com#module-Enumerable-label-What-27s+Here">Enumerable</a></code> module. Additionally, a hash preserves the order of the entries. This effectively makes a hash act like a list (or an array). This is useful when you want to loop over a hash with <code>each</code>, <code>each_key</code>, <code>each_pair</code>, <code>each_value</code>, <code>keys</code> and <code>values</code>. Let's look at each method along with an example.</p><p>The <code>each</code> method lets you loop over the key-value pair. If you provide a single argument to the block, the pair will be passed as an array.</p><pre><code>properties = { width: '30px', height: '10px', color: 'green' }

properties.each do |prop|
  p prop
end

# Output

[:width, "30px"]
[:height, "10px"]
[:color, "green"]</code></pre><p>If you provide two arguments, the key-value pair will be spread over those two. If you want to be more expressive, use <code>each_pair</code>, which works the same.</p><pre><code>properties = { width: '30px', height: '10px', color: 'green' }

properties.each do |prop, val|
  puts "#{prop}: #{val}"
end

# OR
properties.each_pair do |prop, val|
  puts "#{prop}: #{val}"
end

# Output

width: 30px
height: 10px
color: green</code></pre><p>To access keys and values separately, use either <code>keys</code>, <code>each_key</code>, <code>values</code> or <code>each_value</code> method, which work as you expect. </p><pre><code>properties = { width: '30px', height: '10px', color: 'green' }

p properties.keys
p properties.values

properties.each_key { |key| puts key }
properties.each_value { |value| puts value }

# Output

[:width, :height, :color]
width
height
color

["30px", "10px", "green"]
30px
10px
green</code></pre><h2 id="passing-hash-to-functions">Passing Hash to Functions</h2><p>You can pass a hash to a function (but you probably knew that).</p><pre><code>def process_payment(payment)
  print payment.keys  # [:product, :price, :apple_care]
end

payment = {
  product: 'iPhone 13 mini',
  price: 800.00,
  apple_care: false
}

process_payment(payment)</code></pre><p>But did you know that the curly braces may be omitted when the last argument in a method call is a Hash?</p><pre><code>def process_payment(user, payment)
  puts user
  p payment.keys
end

user = 'Akshay'
process_payment(user, product: 'iPhone 13 mini', price: 800.00, apple_care: false)

# Output

Akshay
[:product, :price, :apple_care]</code></pre><p>That said, just because you can, doesn't mean you should. In fact, <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/12/12/separation-of-positional-and-keyword-arguments-in-ruby-3-0/?ref=akshaykhot.com">this behavior is deprecated</a> in the latest versions of Ruby. A better solution is to use the double-splat operator (<code>**</code>), which we'll see next. </p><blockquote>For a great example demonstrating why it was deprecated, please check out <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37203955&amp;ref=akshaykhot.com">this comment</a> on Hacker News.</blockquote><h2 id="double-splat-operator">Double Splat Operator</h2><p>This probably deserves a separate blog post of its own, but you can use the double splat operator to 'unpack' hashes into other hashes.</p><pre><code>properties = { 
  width: '30px', 
  height: '10px'
}

style = { **properties, border: 'none' }

p style

# Output

{:width=&gt;"30px", :height=&gt;"10px", :border=&gt;"none"}</code></pre><p>Additionally, you can also use it to capture all keyword arguments to a method (which can also be a simple hash).</p><pre><code>def process_payment(user, **payment)
  puts user
  p payment.keys
end

user = 'Akshay'
process_payment(user, product: 'iPhone 13 mini', price: 800.00, apple_care: false)

# Output

Akshay
[:product, :price, :apple_care]</code></pre><h2 id="useful-hash-methods">Useful Hash Methods</h2><p>In this section, we'll take a look at some of the common but useful methods on Hash. For all the examples that follow, we'll use following <code>properties</code> hash. </p><pre><code>properties = { 
  width: '30px', 
  height: '10px', 
  color: 'green',
  display: :flex,
  options: nil
}</code></pre><ul><li><code>any?(key)</code></li></ul><p>Returns <code>true</code> if any key-value pair satisfies a given condition. Otherwise, returns <code>false</code>.</p><pre><code>properties.any? { |key, value| value == :flex }  # true</code></pre><ul><li><code>compact</code></li></ul><p>Returns a copy of the hash with all nil-valued entries removed. The original hash is not modified. To modify the original hash, use <code>compact!</code>.</p><pre><code>properties.compact

# {:width=&gt;"30px", :height=&gt;"10px", :color=&gt;"green", :display=&gt;:flex}</code></pre><ul><li><code>empty?</code></li></ul><p>Returns <code>true</code> if there are no hash entries, <code>false</code> otherwise.</p><pre><code>properties.empty?  # false

<p>Renewable energy production is almost entirely aimed at the generation of electricity. However, we use more energy in the form of heat, which solar panels and wind turbines can produce only indirectly and relatively inefficiently. A solar thermal collector skips the conversion to electricity and supplies renewable thermal energy in a direct and more efficient way.</p>
<p>Much less known is that a mechanical windmill can do the same in a windy climate – by oversizing its brake system, a windmill can generate lots of direct heat through friction. A mechanical windmill can also be coupled to a mechanical heat pump, which can be cheaper than using a gas boiler or an electric heat pump driven by a wind turbine.</p>
<h2 id="heat-versus-electricity">Heat versus Electricity</h2>
<p>On a global scale, thermal energy demand corresponds to one third of the primary energy supply, while electricity demand is only one-fifth. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> In temperate or cold climates, the share of thermal energy is even higher. For example in the UK, heat counts for almost half of total energy use. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> If we only look at households, thermal energy for space and water heating in temperate and cold climates can be 60-80% of total domestic energy demand. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In spite of this, renewable energy sources play a negligible role in heat production. The main exception is the traditional use of biomass for cooking and heating – but in the “developed” world even biomass is often used to produce electricity instead of heat. The use of direct solar heat and geothermal heat provide less than 1% and 0.2% of global heat demand, respectively <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. While renewable energy sources account for more than 20% of global electricity demand (mostly hydroelectric), they only account for 10% of global heat demand (mostly biomass). <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="direct-versus-indirect-heat-production">Direct versus Indirect Heat Production</h2>
<p>Electricity produced by renewable energy sources can be – and is being – converted to heat in an indirect way. For example, a wind turbine converts its rotational energy into electricity by the use of its electrical generator, and this electricity can then be converted into heat using an electric heater, an electric boiler, or an electric heat pump. The result is heat generated by wind energy.</p>
<p>In particular, the electric heat pump is promoted by many governments and organisations as a sustainable solution for renewable heat generation. However, solar and wind energy can also be used in a direct way, without converting them to electricity first – and of course the same applies to biomass. Direct heat production is cheaper, can be more energy efficient, and is more sustainable than indirect heat production.</p>

<p>The direct alternative for solar photovoltaic power is solar thermal power, a technology that appeared in the nineteenth century following cheaper production technologies for glass and mirrors. Solar thermal energy can be used for water heating, space heating or industrial processes, and <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/07/the-bright-future-of-solar-thermal-powered-factories/">this is 2-3 times as energy efficient</a> compared to following the indirect path involving electricity conversion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost nobody knows that a windmill can produce heat directly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The direct alternative for wind power that everybody knows is the old-fashioned windmill, which is at least 2.000 years old. It transferred the rotational energy from its wind rotor directly to the axis of a machine, for example for sawing wood or grinding grain. This old-fashioned approach remains relevant, also in combination with new technology, because it would be <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/10/wind-powered-factories-history-and-future-of-industrial-windmills/">more energy efficient compared to first converting the energy to electricity, and then back to rotational energy</a>.</p>
<p>However, an old-fashioned windmill can not only provide mechanical energy, but also thermal energy. The problem is that almost nobody knows this. Even the International Energy Agency doesn’t mention direct conversion of wind into heat when it presents all possible options for renewable heat production. <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-water-brake-windmill">The Water Brake Windmill</h2>
<p>The original type of heat generating windmill converts rotational energy directly into heat by generating friction in water, using a so-called “water brake” or “Joule Machine”. A heat generator based on this principle is basically a wind-powered mixer or impeller installed into an insulated tank filled with water. Due to friction among molecules of the water, mechanical energy is converted into heat energy. The heated water can be pumped into a building for heating or washing, and the same concept could be applied to industrial processes in a factory that require relatively low temperatures. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>

<p>The Joule Machine was originally conceived as a measuring apparatus.

<p>The most fascinating thing about water brake windmills is that, hypothetically, they could have been built hundreds or even thousands of years ago. They require simple materials: wood and/or metal. But although we cannot exclude their use in pre-industrial times, the first reference to heat producing windmills dates from the 1970s, when the Danes started building them in the wake of the first oil crisis.</p>

<p>At the time, Denmark was almost entirely dependent on imported oil for heating, which left many households in the cold when the oil supply was disturbed. Because the Danes already had a strong DIY-culture for small wind turbines generating electricity on farms, they started building windmills to heat their houses. Some chose the indirect path, converting wind generated electricity into heat using electric heating appliances. Others, however, developed mechanical windmills that produced heat directly.</p>
<h2 id="cheaper-to-build">Cheaper to Build</h2>
<p>The direct approach to heat production is considerably cheaper and more sustainable than converting wind or solar generated electricity into heat by using electric heating devices. There’s two reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, and most importantly, mechanical windmills are less complex, which makes them more affordable and less resource-intensive to build, and which increases their lifetime. In a water brake windmill, electric generator, power converters, transformer and gearbox can be excluded, and because of the weight savings, the windmill needs to be less sturdy built. The Joule Machine has lower weight, smaller size, and lower costs than an electrical generator. <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Also important is that the cost of thermal storage is 60-70% lower compared to batteries or the use of backup thermal power plants. <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Second, converting wind or solar energy directly into heat (or mechanical energy) can be more energy efficient than when electric conversion is involved. This means that less solar and wind energy converters – and thus less space and resources – are needed to supply a certain amount of heat. In short, the heat generating windmill addresses the main disadvantages of wind power: its low power density, and its <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2017/09/how-not-to-run-a-modern-society-on-solar-and-wind-power-alone/">intermittency</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mechanical windmills are less complex, which makes them more affordable and less resource-intensive to build, and which increases their lifetime</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, direct heat generation greatly improves the economics and the sustainability of smaller types of windmills. Tests have shown that small wind turbines – which produce electricity – are <a href="http://theoildrum.com.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/node/6954" target="_blank">very inefficient and don’t always generate as much energy as was needed to produce them</a>. <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> However, using similar models for heat production decreases embodied energy and costs, increases lifetime, and improves efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-heat-can-a-windmill-produce">How Much Heat Can a Windmill Produce?</h2>
<p>The Danish water brake windmill from the 1970s was a relatively small machine, with a rotor diameter of around 6 meters and a height of around 12 meters. Larger heat generating windmills were built in the 1980s. Most used simple wooden blades. In total, at least a dozen different models have been documented, both DIY and commercial models. <sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Many were built with used car parts and other discarded materials. <sup id="fnref2:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>

<p>One of the smaller early Danish heat generating windmills was officially tested. The Calorius type 37 – which had a rotor diameter of 5 meters and a height of 9 meters – produced 3.5 kilowatt of heat at a wind speed of 11 m/s (a strong breeze, Beaufort 6). This is comparable to the heat output of the smallest electric boilers for space heating. From 1993 to 2000, the Danish firm Westrup built a total of 34 water brake windmills based on this design, and by 2012 there were still 17 in operation. <sup id="fnref2:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>A much larger water brake windmill (7.5m rotor diameter, 17m tower) was built in 1982 by the Svaneborg brothers, and heated the house of one of them (the other brother opted for a wind turbine and an electric heating system). The windmill, which had three fiberglass blades, produced up to 8 kilowatt of heat according to non-official measurements – comparable to the heat output of an electric boiler for a modest home. <sup id="fnref3:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Further into the 1980s, Knud Berthou built the most sophisticated heat generating windmill to date: the LO-FA. In other models, heat generation happened at the bottom of the tower – from the top of the windmill there was a shaft down to the bottom where the water brake was installed. However, in the LO-FA windmill all mechanical parts for energy conversion were moved to the top of the tower. The lower 10 meters of the 20 meter high tower were filled up with 15 tonnes of water in an insulated reservoir. Consequently, hot water could literally be tapped out of the windmill. <sup id="fnref4:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tower of the LO-FA windmill was filled up with 15 tonnes of water in an insulated tank: hot water could literally be tapped out of the windmill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LO-FA was also the largest of the heat generating windmills, with a 12 meter diameter rotor. Its heat output was estimated to be 90 kilowatt at a wind speed of 14 m/s (Beaufort 7). This results seems to be excessive compared to the other heat generating windmills, but the energy output of a windmill increases more than proportionally with the rotor diameter and the wind speed. Furthermore, the friction liquid in the water brake was not water but hydraulic oil, which can be heated up to much higher temperatures. The oil then transferred its heat to the water storage in the tower. <sup id="fnref5:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="renewed-interest">Renewed Interest</h2>
<p>Interest in heat generating windmills resurfaced a few years ago, although for now it concerns only a handful of scientific studies. In a 2011 paper, German and UK scientists write that “small and remote households in northern regions demand thermal energy rather than electricity, and therefore wind turbines in such places should be build for thermal energy generation”. <sup id="fnref3:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>The researchers explain and illustrate the workings of the water brake windmill, and calculate the optimal performance of the technology. It was found that the torque-speed characteristics of wind rotor and impeller must be carefully matched to achieve maximum efficiency. For example, for the very small Savonius windmill that the scientists used as a model (0.5m rotor diameter, 2m tower), it was calculated that the impeller diameter should be 0.388m.</p>

<p>The researchers then ran simulations over a period of fifty hours to calculate the windmill’s heat output. Although the Savonius is a low speed windmill which is ill-suited for electricity generation, it turns out to be an excellent producer of heat: the small windmill produced up to 1 kW of thermal power (at wind speeds of 15 m/s). <sup id="fnref4:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> A 2013 study using a prototype obtained similar results, and calculated the efficiency of the system to be 91%. <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> This is comparable to the efficiency of a wind turbine heating water through electricity.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Obviously, it’s not always stormy weather, which means that the average wind speed is at least as important.

<p>The average wind speed is not guaranteed either, which means that a heat generating windmill requires heat storage – otherwise it would only provide heating when the wind blows.

<p>Providing enough storage to bridge a week without wind thus requires up to 7 tonnes of water, which corresponds to a volume of 7 cubic meters plus insulation.

<p>A heat generating windmill can also be combined with a solar boiler, so that both sun and wind can supply direct thermal energy using a smaller water tank.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A heat generating windmill can also be combined with a solar boiler, so that both sun and wind can supply direct thermal energy using the same heat storage reservoir. In this case, it becomes possible to build a pretty reliable heating system with a smaller heat storage tank, because the combination of two – often complementary – energy sources increases the chances of direct heat supply. Especially in less sunny climates, heat generating windmills are a great addition to a solar thermal system, because the latter produces relatively less heat during winter, when heat demand is at its maximum.</p>
<h2 id="retarders-and-mechanical-heat-pumps">Retarders and Mechanical Heat Pumps</h2>
<p>The most recent and extensive studies to date are from 2016 and 2018, and compare different types of heat generating windmills with different types of indirect heat generation. <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> In this second type of heat generating windmill, heat is produced with mechanical heat pumps or hydrodynamic retarders, not with a water brake.</p>
<p>A mechanical heat pump is simply a heat pump without the electric motor – instead, the wind rotor is directly connected to the compressor(s) of the heat pump. This involves one less energy conversion, which makes the combination at least 10% more energy efficient than an electric heat pump driven by a wind turbine.</p>
<p>The hydrodynamic retarder is well known as a brake system in heavy vehicles. Like a joule machine, it converts rotational energy into heat without the involvement of electricity. Retarders and mechanical heat pumps have the same advantages as Joule Machines, in the sense that they are much smaller, lighter, and cheaper than electrical generators. However, in this case a gearbox is required to achieve optimal efficiency.</p>

<p>The study compares heat generating windmills based on retarders and mechanical heat pumps with indirect heat production using electric boilers and electric heat pumps. It compares these four technologies for three system sizes: a small windmill aimed at heating an off-the-grid household, a large windmill aimed at supplying heat to a village, and a wind farm producing heat for 20,000 inhabitants. The four heating concepts are ranked based on their yearly capital and operational expenditures, assuming a lifespan of 20 years. <sup id="fnref3:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref2:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Directly coupling a mechanical windmill to a mechanical heat pump is cheaper than using a gas boiler or the combination of a wind turbine and an electric heat pump.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the off-grid system, directly coupling a mechanical windmill to a mechanical heat pump is the cheapest option, while the combination of a wind turbine and an electric boiler is two to three times more expensive. All other technologies are in between. Taking into account both investment and operational costs, small-scale heat generating windmills with mechanical heat pumps are equally expensive or cheaper than conventional gas boilers when assuming the typical performance of a small windmill (which produces – over a period of one year – 12% to 22% of its maximum energy output).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the combination of a small wind turbine and an electric heat pump requires a windmill with a “capacity factor” of at least 30% to become cost-competitive with gas heating – but such high performance is very unusual. Larger systems present the same rankings – the combination of mechanical windmills and mechanical heat pumps is the cheapest option – but they have up to three times lower capital costs due to economies of scale. Larger windmills have higher capacity factors (16-40%), which result in even larger cost savings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to the large energy losses for heat transportation, the heat generating windmill is at its best as a decentralised energy source, providing heat to an off-the-grid household or – in the optimal case – a small city.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, larger systems also reveal a problem when scaling up the technology: storing heat may be cheaper and more efficient than storing electricity, but the opposite holds true for transportation: the energy losses for heat transportation are much larger than the energy losses for electricity transmission. The scientists calculate that the maximum distance that is cost-achievable under optimal wind conditions is 50 km. <sup id="fnref3:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Consequently, the heat generating windmill is at its best as a decentralised energy source, providing heat to an off-the-grid household or – in the optimal case – a relatively small town or city, or an industrial area. For even larger systems, energy needs to be transported in the form of electricity, and in that case direct generation of heat – with all its benefits – becomes unattractive.</p>
<h2 id="blinded-by-electricity">Blinded by Electricity</h2>
<p>Heat generating windmills are also investigated for renewable electricity production, mainly because they offer a better solution for energy storage <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/05/how-sustainable-is-stored-sunlight/">compared to batteries</a> or other common technologies. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> In these systems, the generated heat is converted to electricity by the use of a steam turbine. The storage system is similar to that of a concentrated solar power plant (CSP), and the solar concentrators are replaced by heat generating windmills.</p>

<p>Because high temperatures are needed to produce electricity efficiently with a steam turbine, these systems can’t make use of joule machines or hydrodynamic retarders, but instead rely on a type of retarder called an “eddy current heater” (or “induction heater”). These are comprised of a magnet mounted on a rotating shaft, and can reach temperatures of up to 600 degrees Celsius. Using eddy current heaters, windmills could provide direct heat at higher temperatures, making their potential use in industry even larger.</p>
<p>However, using the stored heat for electricity production is considerably more costly and less sustainable compared ro using heat generating windmills for direct heat production. Converting the stored heat into electricity is at most 30% efficient, meaning that two thirds of the wind energy is lost due to needless energy conversions – and the same is true <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/07/the-bright-future-of-solar-thermal-powered-factories/">when solar thermal is used for power production</a>. <sup id="fnref4:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Direct heat production thus offers the possibility to save three times more greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuels using the same number of windmills, which are also cheaper and more sustainable to build. Hopefully, direct heat production will be given the priority it deserves. Despite a warming climate, the demand for thermal energy is as high as ever.</p>

		<div data-first_letter="R">
		<p>Running a lightweight macOS VM on an Apple silicon Mac shouldn’t be a heavyweight task. While there are times when you want to change the number of cores it uses, which folders it shares, and other settings, much of the time we just want to run it the same as before. I’m delighted to offer a truly lightweight app to do just that: Vimy.</p>
<p>As an app, Vimy typically runs in four lightweight threads taking almost no CPU and around 35 MB of memory. Its only control is the <strong>Open</strong> command, whether you open your VM by double-clicking it in the Finder, dragging it to Vimy in the Dock, or using its menu command. It’s that clean and simple.</p>
<p>Vimy supports two VM bundle formats: the standard .bundle introduced by Apple and used in all versions of Viable, and the new custom .vimi format introduced in Viable 1.0.9 earlier this week. Internally they’re identical, but using the .vimi format makes it easier for it to be double-clickable. To set that up, move the Vimy app to /Applications or another standard folder for your apps, where the Finder and LaunchServices can see it. Create a .vimi VM bundle, either by saving one from Viable or changing the extension on an existing .bundle VM to .vimi.</p>
<p>Then select that .vimi VM bundle in the Finder and Get Info on it. In the <strong>Open with</strong> section there, open the popup menu and set Vimy as its default app. Then click on the <strong>Change All</strong> button to set all .vimi bundles to be opened by Vimy.</p>

<p>Although you could do the same for .bundle VM bundles, that extension is used for other purposes, and could result in some surprises if you were to try opening other types of bundle in Vimy.</p>
<p>Vimy doesn’t require that you have previously saved a VM’s settings inside its bundle, so works with existing VM bundles. If it can’t find a settings property list inside the bundle, it will run that VM with its fallback defaults of:</p>
<ul>
<li>number of CPU cores used = 4</li>
<li>size of memory allocated = 6 GiB</li>
<li>not to enter Recovery mode, but to run in normal user mode</li>
<li>display size = 1600 x 1000</li>
<li>display HiDPI to be used when available</li>
<li>display ppi = 254</li>
<li>on Sonoma, AutoDisplay enabled</li>
<li>folder sharing enabled, with the Custom shared folder as the user’s Home folder</li>
<li>passthrough keyboard enabled</li>
<li>NAT network address = d6:a7:58:8e:78:d4 (Apple’s default).</li>
</ul>
<p>While Viable 1.0.9 automatically writes settings property lists inside the VM bundles it opens, whether they’re .bundle or .vimi type, you can also write your own, and Vimy’s Zip archive provides the information to help you do so. These settings files aren’t managed by <code>cfprefsd</code>, so you can change them without any fear of losing those changes.</p>
<p>Vimy’s first beta is version 0.4, available now from here: <a title="vimy04" href="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/vimy04.zip">vimy04</a><br>
from <strong>Downloads</strong> above, and from <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/virtualisation-on-apple-silicon/">its Product Page</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you find it useful, and that it spares you from having to negotiate Viable whenever you want to run a macOS VM.</p>

  <h3><strong>Introduction to the Second Edition</strong></h3><p><em>April 20th, 2021</em></p><p>Nearly six years ago, I sat down at my desk and typed up a detailed guide for anyone who wanted to learn physics on their own. At the time, I had no idea how many people would read it and use it — my only goal was to put the information out there in a clear and straightforward way so that anyone who wanted to learn physics would have the self-study curriculum they needed. Since then, over six hundred thousand people have turned to this guide to study physics. </p><p>According to the emails I’ve received from readers, many of you have gone on to get undergraduate degrees in physics after following the curriculum in this guide (some of you are even now in graduate programs!), but the majority of those who have bookmarked and followed this guide — even all the way to the end! — have done so out of pure curiosity and for the sheer joy of understanding the incredible universe we inhabit. </p><p>The success of this guide is, I believe, a testament to two things. </p><p>First, that one of the most impactful things you can do is to share what you know with others, even if it doesn’t seem like a lot. I wasn’t able to become a professional physicist, but I <em>was</em> able to use my knowledge of undergraduate and graduate-level physics to type up a comprehensive and accessible curriculum that has helped hundreds of thousands of people learn physics. That’s pretty remarkable. If you are wondering what you have to offer the world, I hope you will think of this guide and consider what you might know that you can share with others. </p><p>Second, that there are so many people in the world who want to understand physics but are unable to study it formally in a university setting for any number of reasons. These same people are very serious about learning physics, and not for any career purposes but simply because they want to understand the universe, and they are and have been dreadfully underserved and underestimated by the academic physics community (who do not take them seriously because they aren’t studying at colleges and universities) and by the authors of contemporary and popular physics books and the publishers of those same books (who mostly just sell them books that assume most readers can never and will never really understand physics). When I wrote the first edition of this guide, I was pretty sure there were a lot more people out there who really wanted to learn physics — <em>real </em>physics — than academic physicists and publishers believed, and those were the people I wanted to help. As it turns out, there were even more of you than I could ever have imagined!</p><p>Well, after almost six years and lots of reader feedback, I decided that it was finally time to make a (lightly) updated version of this guide. I went back through the emails and comments I’ve received over the years, and then made a list of the most popular requests. I skimmed through all the books in the curriculum and a few new ones as well. I updated textbook editions, added more undergraduate-level electives, added a section of graduate-level electives, and made a few other small changes — all in the hope that this new version will be even more useful than the first. </p><p>As I wrote in the first edition: “Remember that anyone can learn physics…Whether you turn it into a hobby or a career, the pure joy of understanding the universe around us is one of the most beautiful experiences you can ever have in life.”</p><p>Godspeed!</p><p><em>You can still find the first edition here, on my old website: </em><a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics">https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics.</a><em> </em></p>

  <h3><strong>Introduction to the First Edition</strong></h3><p><em>August 13th, 2015</em></p><p>Over the past few years, ever since writing a blog post called “<a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/26/from-the-fledgling-physicist-archives-if-susan-can-learn-physics-so-can-you" target="_blank">If Susan Can Learn Physics, So Can You</a>,” I've been contacted by people from all backgrounds who are inspired and want to learn physics, but don't know where to start, what to learn, what to read, and how to structure their studies. I've spoken with single mothers who want to go back to school and study physics, tenured philosophy professors who want to learn physics so that they can make significant and informed contributions to philosophy of physics, high school students who want to know what they should read to prepare for an undergraduate education in physics, and people in dozens of various careers who want to <em>really, really </em>learn and understand physics simply for the joy of it.&nbsp;</p><p>This post is a condensed version of what I've sent to people who have contacted me over the years, outlining what everyone needs to learn in order to really understand physics.&nbsp;</p><p>The general physics education given in U.S. universities is divided into what is learned at the undergraduate level and what is covered in graduate courses, and I've divided my list in a similar way. Because each subject is built upon the previous subjects and the mathematics becomes more complex and difficult, it's important to learn each topic in the order presented below.&nbsp;</p><p>If you work through the all of the textbooks in the <em>Undergraduate Physics </em>list of this post, and master each of the topics, you'll have gained the knowledge equivalent of a Bachelor's Degree in Physics (and will be able to score well on the Physics GRE). &nbsp;If you work through the graduate core of the <em>Graduate Physics</em>&nbsp;textbooks, you'll have the equivalent knowledge of obtaining a Master's Degree in Physics. A PhD in Physics requires the graduate coursework as well as several years of research and a thesis, and the experience involved in a PhD isn't something that can be gained independently of a PhD program.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember that anyone can learn physics. It's no different from learning programming, from learning a musical instrument, from reading great literature. Whether you turn it into a hobby or a career, the pure joy of understanding the universe around us is one of the most beautiful experiences you can ever have in life.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3><strong>Before You Begin</strong></h3><h4><strong>Popular Books on Physics</strong></h4><p>When you're solving problems, working through textbooks, and getting into the nitty-gritty details of each topic, it's so easy to lose the forest for the trees and forget why you even became inspired to study physics in the first place. This is where really, really good (and non-speculative) popular books on physics come in handy: they inspire, they encourage, and they help you keep the big picture in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>One big problem is that many popular physics books (especially those written by famous physicists) are incredibly speculative and tend to present an unrealistic view of what the study of physics is all about. When you're learning physics, it's best to avoid these types of speculative books and stick to the ones that talk about the real physics that we know exists (in general, anything by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Frank-Close/e/B0032LWBQU?language=en_US&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;linkId=3c7c04c8d21e464a287401f980430fd4&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank">Frank Close</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Richard-P.-Feynman/e/B000AQ47U8?language=en_US&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;linkId=ed2f3d4424a1dedaff83313cfbcd4668&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a> is a safe bet!).</p><p>Here are a handful of my favorite popular physics books, ranked in order of difficulty: </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465024378/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0465024378&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;linkId=d72aaa7813d719344a4c88258a5488d0" target="_blank">The First Three Minutes by Steven Weinberg</a> <strong>(Level: Easy)</strong>.<strong> </strong>An account of the Big Bang by one of the most brilliant physicists of all time.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Character-Physical-Law-MIT-Press/dp/0262533413?dchild=1&amp;keywords=character%20of%20physical%20law&amp;language=en_US&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;linkId=85b0a8234adfc1bb7a7c4b643f59bf6b&amp;qid=1618957764&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank">The Character of Physical Law by Richard Feynman</a> <strong>(Level: Easy)</strong>.

A high school education — which should include pre-algebra, algebra 1, geometry, algebra 2, trigonometry, and pre-calculus — is sufficient. If you need a refresher, I recommend either working through the Khan Academy math courses (<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">https://www.khanacademy.org/)</a> or the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Math-Undergraduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/0387944273?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp%3Bqid=&amp;amp%3Bsr=&amp;language=en_US&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;linkId=0fc3187aa8b5febcc75391ba905635b5&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;tag=susanfowler-20" target="_blank">Why Math? by R.D. Driver</a>. There's no need to be familiar with calculus before starting, because you’ll learn it as you work through the undergraduate-level courses.</p><p>There are no scientific prerequisites for this curriculum. You don’t need to be familiar with biology or chemistry at either the high school or college level in order to understand, although doing some studying on the side can’t hurt. Khan Academy has some great high school science refresher courses that are perfect for this (<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science" target="_blank">https://www.khanacademy.org/science)</a>. </p><h4><strong>How to Study</strong></h4><p>Everyone learns very differently, and knowing your learning style is important: do you learn by reading, by taking notes,&nbsp;by talking, by watching,&nbsp;by doing, or by a combination of some or all of these? For example, I learn by reading and by note-taking, so I read through textbooks very carefully, take copious notes, and summarize each concept in my own words before moving on to something new. Think about this before you begin so that you'll know how to structure your studies.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of your learning style, you'll still need to solve the physics problems in each textbook. <strong>Solving problems is the only way to understand physics.</strong> There's no way around it.&nbsp;Even though it can feel tedious at times, there's nothing more rewarding than figuring out a really difficult physics problem and realizing that you figured it all out all by yourself!</p><p>One tough thing about learning on your own is that you may not know whether you are solving the problems correctly. Some of the textbooks listed below have answers to selected exercises in the back of the book, but these aren’t always adequate for two reasons: (1) they often only show the solutions to the problems, and not the steps taken to get there; and (2) it’s much better to do <em>all</em> of the exercises rather than just a select few. The good news is that many of the solutions (and step-by-step ways to solve them) can be found online with a simple Google search. If you are going to Google the answers, however, <em>please first try to solve the problems on your own, and try multiple times</em> (you’re not in school trying to get a perfect grade — you’re trying to learn and understand).</p><p>And, finally, a note on learning in a laboratory vs. learning from textbooks. Physics is both an experimental and theoretical science, and while research happens in laboratories and on blackboards and computers, the majority of any physics <em>education</em> does not take place in a laboratory but in lecture classes that teach from textbooks and assign homework problems that are found in textbooks. Yes, there are some laboratory classes (usually at the very introductory levels, and their only purpose is to show that oh, look, Newton’s laws work in the real world after all) and some — <em>some</em> — undergraduates are allowed to participate in research on the side, but physics is taught through textbooks, lectures, and homework problems. Don’t believe me? Take a look at the undergraduate physics curriculum at any university that offers a physics major. Graduate programs in physics are largely the same — both M.A. and PhD programs in physics require two years of core classes — with one key difference: to get a PhD, students need to complete several years of research, a thesis, and — at many programs — take an exam to prove they have mastered the graduate core curriculum. The graduate core curriculum is all textbooks and lectures and homework problems. The textbooks listed in the curriculum I’ve written below are the same textbooks that are used in the top undergraduate and graduate physics programs in the world. Studying them will give you the same education that you would receive at one of these programs — no painfully-annoying-introductory-mechanics-laboratory-class-with-inane-group-projects required.  </p>

  <h4><strong>6. Quantum Field Theory</strong></h4><p><strong>What It's All About</strong></p><p>Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is the heart of all modern high-energy physics: the Standard Model of particle physics is a QFT. The whole idea behind QFT is that we are doing quantum mechanics on classical fields, and it works remarkably well. Along with GR, QFT will be the most challenging part of your physics education, but perhaps the most rewarding (I know it was extraordinarily rewarding for me!).

		<p>Whenever there’s a macOS update, I give estimates here of its total download size. This isn’t only important for those who don’t have the benefit of high bandwidth connections, but it also provides an indication of how much has changed in that update. Over the course of different versions from Big Sur onwards it has shown how ‘efficient’ macOS updates are. Currently, a minimal macOS update for an Intel Mac is typically around 500 MB; those for Apple silicon Macs are never less than 1.8 GB. So why do some see much smaller sizes on their M-series Macs?</p>
<p>Thanks to the comment by João Próspero Luis to <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2023/08/17/apple-has-released-macos-ventura-13-5-1-update/">my article</a> about the 13.5.1 update, I have now realised one cause of substantial discrepancies seen in the sizes of macOS updates for Apple silicon Macs.</p>
<p>Way back in the first updates for M1 Macs in Big Sur, it became clear that updates provided to those models consisted of two distinct components or phases in the update process. The first download was similar in size to that for Intel Macs, and essentially the size given for the update by <code>softwareupdate</code>. In the case of the 13.5.1 update, that was around 500 MB for Intel, and just over 700 MB for Apple silicon Macs. As that part of each update should be similar between different architectures, there’s usually little difference. However, there’s a second component that is only downloaded by Apple silicon Macs, which is generally about 1.1 GB in size, bringing the total size to be downloaded to about 1.8 GB.</p>
<p>If you use the command<br>
<code>softwareupdate -l --include-config-data</code><br>
or read what’s reported in SilentKnight’s text when there’s a macOS update available, you’re told the size of just that first download, which is the only download for Intel Macs. As that download progresses, it’s decompressed and its ‘software update brain’ calls for the second download, whose size is written only in the log. At that point, the actual download size is posted to the update progress window, giving the true total for the whole update, and it’s that higher figure that I quote in my articles about macOS updates here.</p>
<p>If you run a local Content Caching server, you’ll have noticed a difference in these two phases of downloading the update on Apple silicon Macs: the first can be obtained rapidly from your local server’s cache, but the second 1.1 GB always has to be downloaded direct from Apple’s software update servers and can’t be served from the cache, making it slower to download.</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/02/11/big-sur-software-update-content-caching-server-and-m1-macs/">first reported</a> this behaviour over two years ago, the two phases appeared to take place the other way around, with the fixed-size direct download occurring first, followed by the cachable component, although that order appears to vary. I <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2022/11/14/how-does-ventura-update-faster-inside-the-macos-update-process/">returned to explore</a> the phases of updating macOS with the 13.0.1 update last year, where I also explained what has changed since Big Sur.</p>
<p>So if you’re updating an Apple silicon Mac, pay little attention to the download size given by <code>softwareupdate</code> or in SilentKnight, or at least add the fixed 1.1 GB overhead to it to arrive at the download size reported in the update progress window. Websites that report the size of macOS updates also need to make clear whether the figures they give are for Intel or Apple silicon Macs, and whether they include that overhead.</p>

<p>Yes.  And they are!  This is called the "Angular diameter distance turnaround" (or turnover). In the usual model for expansion <span>$\Lambda CDM$</span>, it is at a redshift of about 1.5 or about 15 billion light-years (corresponding to a light travel time of about 10 billion years, or about 4 billion years after the big bang, the distance is greater due to the expansion of space) I'm using rounded values here, because the actual distance is quite sensitive to the exact parameters of expansion.</p>
<p>A galaxy from 400 million years after the big bang (a distance of 32 billion light-years) would look as big as a galaxy that is 2.7 billion light-years away. (These figures from Ned Wright's calculator)</p>
<p>It's illustrated in this <a href="https://xkcd.com/2622/" rel="noreferrer">xkcd comic</a>.  You can see nearby "galaxies" are large and bright, more distant galaxies are smaller, very distant galaxies are large, dim, and red.

most famous tweets ever (back when they were still called tweets), <a href="https://twitter.com/EllenDeGeneres/status/440322224407314432">this selfie</a> posted by 2014 Oscars host Ellen DeGeneres flanked by celebs like Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and others, taken during the show’s broadcast. </p><p>I haven’t seen any public comments from owner Elon Musk or X CEO Linda Yaccarino about the problem, but at some point on Saturday night / early Sunday morning, the picture in that post was restored. </p><p>Despite speculation that it could be an intentional cost-cutting move by Musk, the fact that the actual media posted hasn’t been deleted suggests an error or bug of some kind, one of many that have arisen since last year’s takeover and mass layoffs. </p><p>There’s also at least one other old tweeted image that still worked — the one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/7/3612138/obama-victory-tweet-most-retweeted-ever">posted to President Barack Obama’s account</a> after winning his 2012 campaign for reelection, showing a hug between him and the First Lady.

Before this time, the Tweet payloads included only the URL as provided by the user. So, if the user included a shortened URL it can be challenging to match on (expanded) URLs of interest. With both Historical PowerTrack and the Search APIs, these metadata are available starting in March 2012.</p><p>In July 2016, the enhanced URL enrichment was introduced. This enhanced version provides a web site’s HTML title and description in the Tweet payload, along with Operators for matching on those. With Historical PowerTrack, these metadata become available in July 2016. With the Search APIs, these metadata begin emerging in December 2014.</p><p>In September 2016 Twitter introduced ‘native attachments’ where a trailing shared link is not counted against the 140 Tweet character limit. Both URL enrichments still apply to these shared links.</p></blockquote></div><p>Twitter, X, or whatever it’s currently called, did not respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>]]></description>

My theory is that these books are being written by A.I. and passed off as a real author.</p><p>The larger issue here is the complete lack of checks and balances on Amazon’s website. Amazon employs a hands-off approach when it comes to what goes on in its bookstore. As reported by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/16/books/amazon-books-justice-department.html"><em>New York Times,</em></a> there doesn’t seem to be any checks for accuracy,&nbsp; quality, or authenticity with what Amazon sells in its Bookstore. It doesn’t seem that they have put any energy to overseeing the sellers who flock to their site.</p><p>That lack of accountability has resulted in a kind of open lawlessness on Amazon. Publishers, writers and groups such as the Authors Guild have all said that counterfeit books on Amazon have surged- and with very little checks in place, it’s no wonder why.</p><h3>Who’s Legally Responsible?</h3><p>In a New York Times article aptly called,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/technology/amazon-domination-bookstore-books.html"><em> What Happens After Amazon’s Domination Is Complete?

Scott Kelly, vice president of Antimicrobial Therapy, publishers of the manual, told&nbsp;<em>The Times</em>, “Lives depend on it.

Towns are too distracting.”</span></p><p><span>Ten years later, Hoffer’s masterpiece </span><em>The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements</em><span> was published when he was in his late forties. Its unexpected success led him to later be appointed as an adjunct professor at University of California, Berkeley.</span></p><p><span>A slim volume, </span><em>The True Believer</em><span> was a favorite of President Dwight Eisenhower, who regularly gifted copies to friends. The British philosopher Bertrand Russell was also an enthusiast of Hoffer’s book. The author and conservative commentator William F. Buckley Jr. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/28/archives/the-true-questioner-hoffer.html" rel="">described</a><span> </span><em>The True Believer</em><span> as “deeply provocative.”</span></p><p>It’s one of my favorite nonfiction books. </p><p>Hoffer’s unusual background as a manual laborer and member of the working class helped to fuel his unique psychological and sociological insights which people continue to mine to this day.</p><p><span>Today, political polarization is at its peak. Out-party hate is </span><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abe1715" rel="">now</a><span> more powerful than in-party love as a predictor of voting behavior in the United States. </span></p><p>Eric Hoffer's ideas are more relevant than ever.</p><p><span>Eric Hoffer made the case that if you peel back the layers of any mass movement, you will find that </span><em>frustration</em><span> is their driving force.</span></p><p>Frustration, though, doesn’t arise solely from bleak material conditions. The dockyard philosopher argued that “Our frustration is greater when we have much and want more than when we have nothing and want some. We are less dissatisfied when we lack many things than when we seem to lack but one thing.”</p><p><span>He points out in the years leading up to both the French and Russian Revolutions, life had in fact been gradually </span><em>improving</em><span> for the masses. He concludes, “It is not actual suffering but the taste of better things which excites people to revolt” and that “The intensity of discontent seems to be in inverse proportion to the distance from the object fervently desired.”</span></p><p><span>Personally, I saw this when I first arrived at Yale. I recall being stunned at how status anxiety pervaded elite college campuses. Internally, I thought, “You’ve already made it, what are you so stressed out about?” Hoffer, though, would say these students believed they had </span><em>almost</em><span> made it. That is why they were so aggravated. The closer they got to realizing their ambitions, the more frustrated they became about not already achieving them.</span></p><p>Hoffer’s conceptions of frustration highlight how if your conditions improve, but not as much or as quickly as you’d like, you will be vulnerable to recruitment by mass movements that promise to make your dreams come true. &nbsp;</p><p><span>In </span><em>Democracy in America</em><span>, Alexis de Tocqueville wrote, “When inequality is the general law of society, the most blatant inequalities escape notice. When everything is virtually on a level, the slightest variations cause distress. That is why the desire for equality becomes more insatiable as equality extends to all.” For Hoffer, this insatiability cultivates frustration—a nebulous, simmering emotional state that can be harnessed by any ideology.</span></p><p>He describes what has now become known as the “Tocqueville effect”: A revolution is most likely to occur after an improvement in social conditions. As circumstances improve, people raise their expectations. Societal reforms raise reference points to a level that is usually not matched, eliciting rage and frustration.</p><p>In addition to the fact that reality seldom matches expectations, frustration also originates in a deep sense of dissatisfaction within oneself. We see this in the rise of social movements across the U.S., where individuals across the political spectrum feel disillusioned by their current situation, leading to a strong desire for dramatic change.</p><p>Hoffer argued that mass movements consciously attempt to cultivate and exploit frustration among their members. This helps to fuel their existence. The promotion of frustration is not incidental but is in fact the result of competition: movements that effectively nurture frustration outperform others by attracting and retaining the most fervent members.</p><p><span>In a passage that is reminiscent of today’s idea of the “horseshoe theory” (political extremes have more in common with one another than with moderates), Hoffer wrote that, “When people are ripe for a mass movement, they are usually ripe for any movement...In pre-Hitlerian Germany, it was often a toss up whether a restless youth would join the Communists or the Nazis.” Indeed, the official figure from the original paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party was that fifty-five percent of their members were former communists. According to Rudolf Diels, head of the Gestapo in 1933-1934, the actual </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/central-european-history/article/abs/sa-in-the-radical-imagination-of-the-long-weimar-republic/38DA93D7F66C9FDAE0BF0CDD604F786B" rel="">figure</a><span> was seventy percent.</span></p><p><span>According to </span><em>The True Believer</em><span>, the shared factor among extreme mass movements is not ideology or practice but a shared hatred for the present and a yearning for a (subjectively defined) utopian future.</span></p><p>In the marketplace of ideologies, the dogma that is most effective at harvesting emotional discontent often prevails. The danger of mass movements lies in their ability to manipulate these frustrations. Hoffer argues that these movements purposely foster frustration and dissatisfaction, pushing their members further into their cause. This, in turn, deepens their commitment, keeping them in a state of perpetual discontent and thus, devotion to the movement that promises to liberate them.</p><p><span>The formula goes something like this. Mass movements that are good at what they do make previously content individuals frustrated and further frustrate their adherents while pretending to advance the movement. This means that the strongest mass movements are inevitably going to be the ones that are the best at </span><em>not</em><span> delivering the goods. Any movement that actually advances the interests of its frustrated supporters will make them less frustrated. Hence, they’ll stop being members.</span></p><p>A core aspect of Hoffer's argument is that the root of frustration lies not just in external circumstances or “the system,” but fundamentally in the burdens of being an individual. Outsourcing decisions about your life to the movement comes as a relief. While practical organizations (e.g., an employer) cater to self-interest and offer opportunities for self-advancement, a mass movement appeals to those who wish to escape or camouflage an unsatisfactory self. Mass movements hold the implicit promise of fulfilling the desire for self-renunciation.</p><p>When people feel their lives are meaningless, they seek meaning by telling others what to do with their lives, a key feature of many mass movements. One sentence in the book summarizes the idea: “Faith in a holy cause is to a considerable extent a substitute for the lost faith in ourselves.”</p><p>The book goes on, “A man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding. When it is not, he takes his mind off his own meaningless affairs by minding other people’s business.”</p><p>Hoffer's concept of “substitution” elaborates on this theme. He suggests that individuals dissatisfied with their own self-image often substitute their identity for that of a larger group. Those who join mass movements often feel that their lives lack meaning because they cannot derive satisfaction from their current actions or circumstances. They seek fulfillment in something that extends beyond practical acts in the present, leading them to mass movements.</p><p>In one of the book’s most famous passages, Hoffer wrote “Hatred is the most accessible and comprehensive of all unifying agents...Mass movements can rise and spread without belief in a God, but never without a belief in a devil.”</p><p>For mass movements, hatred serves a useful purpose. It’s the glue that binds the disgruntled members together, turning them into a focused, potent force. The collective enemy helps maintain an atmosphere of constant alertness. It does not only keeps the followers united but it also attracts new members who share similar fears. Hatred fosters an atmosphere of persistent threat that can never be entirely overcome.</p><p>Hoffer writes that “in a mass movement, the air is heavy-laden with suspicion…the faithful strive to escape suspicion by adhering zealously to prescribed behavior and opinion…strict orthodoxy is much the result of mutual suspicion as of ardent faith.”</p><p><span>This is consistent with modern notions of the enforcement of popular social norms. A widely-cited paper from 2009 </span><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/599250" rel="">proposed</a><span> that people coerce one another into adhering to disliked norms to show that they themselves have complied out of genuine conviction and not because of social pressure. Indeed, some individuals might be especially prone to enforcing unpopular norms because they are worried that others will regard them as insufficiently sincere.</span></p><p><span>In a notable historical illustration of a mass movement using a “belief in a devil” as a limitless source of ideological fuel, consider the </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/1521538514Z.00000000047?journalCode=ytcc20" rel="">case</a><span> of the “Recalling Bitterness” campaign in Maoist China. In the 1960s, the communist dictator Mao Zedong grew worried that ordinary Chinese citizens were developing lukewarm attitudes about the socialist revolution. In response, the regime forced people into rituals in which they publicly announced how bad life was before they had been liberated. Mao ordered writers and artists to rewrite history through the lens of class struggle to suit the needs of his political agenda. Regime officials held meetings encouraging peasants to describe how much better life was now compared to pre-liberation, hoping to convince them that the revolution’s successes outnumbered its failures. The “devils” here were reactionaries, landlords, rich farmers, and counterrevolutionaries. Documenting the rituals of the Recalling Bitterness campaign, the historian Guo Wu </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/1521538514Z.00000000047?journalCode=ytcc20" rel="">has written</a><span>, “Only poor peasants were allowed to speak; former landlords and rich peasants were silenced.”</span></p><p>Rewriting history to demonize selected groups is an effective way to promote unity within a mass movement.</p><p>For Hoffer, the deliberate cultivation of fear and hatred served to justify increasingly terrifying levels of cruelty and violence. The individual, convinced of his or her guiltlessness, relinquishes agency to the movement. This is yet another example of escaping the burden of the self.</p><p>These activities, Hoffer proposes, often manifest as futile tasks that seem to address problems but in fact accomplish little of substance. Rather than confronting the system they oppose, mass movements often end up targeting irrelevant figures or groups, engaging in meaningless protests, or turning on each other. Ironically, because the movement accomplishes so little, they ultimately give rise to increased fanaticism. This leads to further persecution in the quest to find a scapegoat to hold accountable for the failures of the movement.</p><p>A strong community can counter the attraction of mass movements. When people feel a sense of belonging, this can guide them away from falling into the trap of large collectives that dissolve individual identities. In our modern world, where traditional forms of community are fraying, and many feel unfulfilled by their work, the appeal of mass movements is amplified. Such movements thrive on shared frustrations.</p><p><span>Mass movements are not exclusive to the modern age. </span><em>The True Believer</em><span>, written in the mid-twentieth century, suggests that modernizing forces provide a fertile ground for their proliferation due to the lack of meaningful work, a sense of community, and an overarching sense of meaning in life.</span></p><p>Community is a safeguard against frustration. Hoffer suggests that those who see themselves as part of a close-knit group are less likely to be attracted to mass movements. The sense of accountability that comes from being part of a community and the reciprocal actions required to sustain membership counters the urge to lose oneself in a larger collective identity. The book points out that although mass movements can be seen as a kind of community, they differ in that they require only belief and identity, rather than reciprocal obligations and accountability.</p><p>In addition to membership in a cohesive community, engaging in meaningful work provides a buffer against radicalization. This is one reason why mass movements attempt to undermine the value of work, or claim that anyone who earnestly and unironically participates in the system is a victim of false consciousness or propaganda or has somehow been duped. The aim is to position the members of the mass movement as those who are truly “in the know,” and to undermine their targets’ confidence and turn them into potential recruits.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The True Believer</em><span> advises against supporting organizations without clear, attainable objectives. The dockyard philosopher reminds us that we should be skeptical of mass movements without clearly defined goals. Often, the ostensible aim of large movements is some nebulous idea of improvement. But the practical, concrete outcome is frequently more frustration, more anger, and more agitation, which benefits the organization rather than those they purport to help.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>This summary of modern physics in one table is written 
to make you wonder, check, and enjoy the beauty of nature.<br> 
The summary has been thoroughly tested by a huge number of scientists and engineers. <a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/onresearch.html#social">(See here on how this is done.)</a><br>
The summary might save you a year of study.<br>&nbsp;</p>


<h3>This 9-line summary of textbook physics agrees with 400 
years of experiments. Exactly.</h3> 

<p>The 9 lines state that general relativity, 
the standard model of particle physics – extended with mixing massive Dirac 
neutrinos –<br> as well as thermodynamics describe all of nature. Yes, all of it.
The 9 lines also highlight what we do not know.

</p><p><b>The 9 lines are complete, correct and simple</b>

</p><p> The 9 lines contain <em>all present knowledge</em>
about nature, including all textbook physics and <em>all observations ever
made.</em>

</p><p>
The simplicity of the 9 lines and their vast domain of validity are
intensely fascinating.
	

</p><p> 
No known  observation  and no known  measurement  contradicts these 
9 lines, not even in the last significant digit.

</p><p> 
Discover a single contradicting observation and you will become famous.


</p><p> The 9 lines determine <em>all equations</em> of 
physics, as the references in the pdf show:
 
</p><p>
Lines 1, 2 and 3, together, uniquely determine special and general
relativity, cosmology, the Hilbert Lagrangian and Einstein's field
equations. <a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/maximumforce.html">(This is shown here.)</a>

</p><p>  
Line 5, with line 1 and 4, uniquely implies thermodynamics.  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09914">(Shown in
https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09914)</a>

</p><p>  
Lines 1, 2, 4, and 6 to 9, together, uniquely determine quantum field
theory and the Lagrangian of the standard model of particle physics,
extended with massive Dirac neutrinos and PMNS mixing.  Written out, <a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/Standard_Model.pdf">the Lagrangian is somewhat involved, as Jim
Shifflett showed.</a>

</p><p> The 9 lines show how little math is required to
describe nature with high precision.
	
</p><p>	 
The 9 lines describe everything that moves - and thus everything that
happens in nature.

</p><p><a href="https://xkcd.com/2034/">
The 9 lines given above improve the humorous 9 lines found here.</a>


</p><p> The 9 lines resulted from the work of countless 
scientists and engineers over 400 years.

</p><p>
Galileo started around the year 1600; line 1 resulted after over 150 years.
Line 5 arose from 1824 to 1929, line 6 arose<br> around 1860, lines 2 and
4 around 1900, line 3 from 1915 to 2002, and lines 7, 8 and 9 from 1936 to
1973.

</p><p> The 9 lines imply the lack of <em>trans-Planckian 
effects,</em> <a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/physicscube.html">as detailed here.</a>

</p><p>
No such effect has been observed and no such effect will ever be observed.


</p><p> The 9 lines contain <em>all natural sciences.</em>


</p><p>
They contain physics, chemistry, material science, biology, medicine,
geology, astronomy and all engineering disciplines. 
<!-- and computer engineering.  --> 

</p><p>
Again: any single observation contradicting the 9 lines will create a
sensation.

<p> <b>From the 9 lines to Lagrangians</b>


</p><p>For general relativity, the Hilbert Lagrangian with a cosmological 
constant is found in every textbook. It follows from lines 1, 2 and 3. 
<a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/maximumforce.html">Publications prove it.</a>

</p><p> The Lagrangian of the standard model, extended with massive 
Dirac neutrinos and PMNS mixing, follows from lines 1, 2, 4, and 6 to 9. 
The best version on the internet is <a href="https://einstein-schrodinger.com/Standard_Model.pdf">Jim Shifflett's http://einstein-schrodinger.com/Standard_Model.pdf;</a>
a local <a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/Standard_Model.pdf">copy is here.</a><br>

</p><p> This other, <a href="https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/the-deconstructed-standard-model-equation">
often cited Lagrangian of the standard model</a> by T.D. Gutierrez contains
also ghost terms; however, it has half a dozen mistakes and disregards neutrino masses and
mixings.  See the corrections at <a href="https://twitter.com/mmanuF/status/895390592854880260">https://twitter.com/mmanuF/status/895390592854880260.</a>


</p><p> An independent video summary of the standard model and
of general relativity, by David Tong, is found at
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unl1jXFnzgo&amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unl1jXFnzgo&amp;t=1s.</a>
The mathematical expression in the video is a 
combination of many, but not all of the 9 lines – though one can also 
argue that it implicitly contains them all.
<!-- In contrast, the 9 lines are complete and precise.
Line 1, the principle of least action, is part of David Tong's mentioned video. -->

</p><p>Sabine Hossenfelder's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0da8TEeaeE">video on 
unification</a> concentrates on line 1.

</p><p>&nbsp;<br>*</p>


<p><b>The 9 lines are not a "theory of everything" - but
help finding the unified theory of motion</b>

</p><p>
<!-- Are the 9 lines a "theory of everything"? -->
The 9 lines fulfil all requirements for a "theory of everything" found 
in tabloids and in popular books. 
They do so since the 1970s.<br> 
<a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/toe.html">However, the 9 lines are <i>not unified:</i></a> 
for example, the origin of lines 6 to 9 has to be clarified first. 

</p><p> In fact, the 9 lines allow measuring <a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/onresearch.html#hitparade">progress towards unification, as told in
the blog.</a>

</p><p>Combining the 9 lines implies that twice the Planck
length (4G ℏ/c<sup>3</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup> is the <em>smallest length
in nature</em>.

<a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/minimumlength.html">Its wide-ranging implications, also for unification, 
are explored on a separate page.</a>

<p><strong>In Finland, the number of homeless people has fallen sharply. The reason: The country applies the “Housing First” concept. Those affected by homelessness receive a small apartment and counselling – without any preconditions. 4 out of 5 people affected thus make their way back into a stable life. And: All this is cheaper than accepting homelessness.</strong></p>
<p>Updated on November, 10th 2020</p>
<p><em>Read this article in German <a href="https://kontrast.at/housing-first-finnland-obdachlose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</em></p>

<h2><span id="Finland_is_the_only_country_in_Europe_where_homelessness_is_in_decline">Finland is the only country in Europe where homelessness is in decline</span></h2>
<p>In 2008 you could see tent villages and huts standing between trees in the parks of Helsinki. Homeless people had built makeshift homes in the middle of Finland’s capital city. They were exposed to harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, Finnish governments had been trying to reduce homelessness. Short-term shelters were built. However, long-term homeless people were still left out. There were too few emergency shelters and many affected people did not manage to get out of homelessness: They couldn’t find jobs – without a housing address. And without any job, they couldn’t find a flat. It was a vicious circle. Furthermore, they had problems applying for social benefits. All in all, homeless people found themselves trapped.</p>
<p>But in 2008 the Finnish government introduced a new policy for the homeless: It started implementing the “Housing First” concept. Since then the number of people affected has fallen sharply.</p>
<blockquote><p>Finland has set itself a target: Nobody should have to live on the streets – every citizen should have a residence.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the country is successful: It is the only EU-country where the number of homeless people is declining.</p>
<h2><span id="Housing_first_How_everyone_is_given_residence_in_Finland">Housing first: How everyone is given residence in Finland</span></h2>
<p>It is NGOs such as the “Y-Foundation” that provide housing for people in need. They take care of the construction themselves, buy flats on the private housing market and renovate existing flats. The apartments have one to two rooms. In addition to that, former emergency shelters have been converted into apartments in order to offer long-term housing.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It was clear to everyone that the old system wasn’t working; we needed radical change,” says Juha Kaakinen, Director of the Y-Foundation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Homeless people turn into tenants with a tenancy agreement. They also have to pay rent and operating costs. Social workers, who have offices in the residential buildings, help with financial issues such as applications for social benefits.</p>
<p><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" src="https://www.ara.fi/download/noname/%7B2EBDCA25-C0B8-43AD-8438-2089037FAE9D%7D/156631" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>Juha Kaakinen is head of the Y-Foundation. The NGO receives discounted loans from the state to buy housing. Additionally, social workers caring for the homeless and future tenants are paid by the state. The Finnish lottery, on the other hand, supports the NGO when it buys apartments on the private housing market. The Y-Foundation also receives regular loans from banks. The NGO later uses the rental income to repay the loans.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We had to get rid of the night shelters and short-term hostels we still had back then. They had a very long history in Finland, and everyone could see they were not getting people out of homelessness. We decided to reverse the assumptions.” (Juha Kaakinen, Director of the Y-Foundation)</p></blockquote>
<h2><span id="Thats_how_the_Housing_First_concept_works">That’s how the “Housing First” concept works</span></h2>
<p>The policy applied in Finland is called “HousingFirst”. It reverses conventional homeless aid. More commonly, those affected are expected to look for a job and free themselves from their psychological problems or addictions. Only then they get help in finding accommodation.</p>
<p>“Housing First”, on the other hand, reverses the path: Homeless people get a flat – without any preconditions. Social workers help them with applications for social benefits and are available for counselling in general. In such a new, secure situation, it is easier for those affected to find a job and take care of their physical and mental health.</p>
<p>The result is impressive: 4 out of 5 homeless people will be able to keep their flat for a long time with “Housing First” and lead a more stable life.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, the “Housing First” program provided 4,600 homes in Finland. While in 2017 there were still about 1,900 people living on the streets, the program could reduce this number to<a href="https://www.ara.fi/en-US/Materials/Homelessness_reports/Homelessness_in_Finland_2019(55546)"> less than 1000</a> long-term homeless by 2019 – but there were enough places for them in emergency shelters so that they at least didn’t have to sleep outside anymore.</p>
<h2><span id="Providing_people_with_apartments_is_cheaper_than_leaving_them_on_the_street">Providing people with apartments is cheaper than leaving them on the street</span></h2>
<p>Creating housing for people costs money. In the past 10 years, 270 million euros were spent on the construction, purchase and renovation of housing as part of the “Housing First” programme. However, Juha Kaakinen points out, this is far less than the cost of homelessness itself. Because when people are in emergency situations, emergencies are more frequent: Assaults, injuries, breakdowns. The police, health care and justice systems are more often called upon to step in – and this also costs money.<br>
In comparison, “Housing First” is cheaper than accepting homelessness: Now, the state spends 15,000 euros less per year per homeless person than before.</p>

<p>With 4 out of 5 people keeping their flats, “Housing First” is effective in the long run. In 20 percent of the cases, people move out because they prefer to stay with friends or relatives – or because they don’t manage to pay the rent. But even in this case they are not dropped. They can apply again for an apartment and are supported again if they wish.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no guarantee for success. Especially homeless women are more difficult to reach: They conceal their emergency situation more often: They live on the streets less frequently and rather stay with friends or acquaintances.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1666798430992_7629"><p>The Unix shell is pure wizardry. With the right incantation of shell spells, you can organise files, process text, compute data, and feed the output of any program to the input of any other. We might even say, paraphrasing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws">Clarke’s Third Law</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Any sufficiently clever shell one-liner is indistinguishable from magic.</em><br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this article we’ll explore a package called <a href="https://github.com/bitfield/script"><code>script</code></a> that aims to sprinkle some Unix shell fairy dust on your Go programs.</p>
<h2 id="systems-programs">Systems programs</h2>
<p>It’s not that the shell itself is so clever. As a <em>programming</em> language, at least for non-trivial tasks, it’s distinctly clumsy. But its elegant design makes it the perfect tool for <em>scripts</em>: short, focused programs that operate on files, processes, or text, in the service of managing computer systems. In other words, <em>systems programs</em>.</p>
<p>Traditionally, much of this kind of software has been written as scripts for various <em>shells</em>. A shell such as <code>bash</code> is a sort of hybrid between a job control language and a text-based interactive user interface.</p>
<p>There are lots of different and mutually incompatible shells, which is part of the problem, but let’s just refer to all of these as “the shell” in this discussion.</p>
<p>Why shouldn’t it be as easy to write systems programs in Go as it is in the shell?</p>
</div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1690376901819_5602"><p>Join my Go Club and get Go-related stuff in your inbox, twice a month</p></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1666798430992_11157"><h2 id="why-go">Why Go?</h2>
<p>If the shell is the traditional way of writing systems software, then what would be the point of using a language like Go instead? It has many advantages: Go programs are <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/slower">fast</a>, scalable, can be written quickly, and can also be maintained by large teams over a long time.</p>
<p>Go does much to support us in writing <em>correct</em> programs, being a compiled language with a strong type system. It also surfaces errors in a way that makes them hard to ignore, encouraging robust programs.</p>
<p>However, whereas shells are optimised for the specific tasks of scripting and job control, Go is a <em>general-purpose</em> language, used for all sorts of different applications.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that we can’t use it for systems programming, though. It just means that it doesn’t have a lot of built-in facilities for making such programs easy to write. At least, perhaps not as easy as the shell makes it.</p>
<p>For example, consider a typical devops task such as counting the lines in a log file that match a certain string (<code>error</code>, let’s say). Most experienced Unix users would write some kind of shell <em>one-liner</em> to do this. For example:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>grep</span> error log.txt <span>|</span><span>wc</span> <span>-l</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The overall effect of this pipeline is to print the number of lines in <code>log.txt</code> that match the string <code>error</code>. The shell makes it easy to compose individual commands like <code>grep</code> and <code>wc</code> to achieve the goal.</p>
<h2 id="a-typical-task">A typical task</h2>
<p>But shell wizards (and witches) can do much more. For example, suppose we have a web server access log to analyse. Here’s a typical line from such a log: it contains the client’s IP address, a timestamp, and various information about the request.</p>
<pre><code>203.0.113.17 - - [30/Jun/2019:17:06:15 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2028 "https://example.com/ "Mozilla/5.0..."</code></pre>
<p>And suppose we want to find the top ten most frequent visitors to our website, by IP address. How could we do that?</p>
<p>Each line represents one request, so we’ll need to count the lines for each IP address, sort them in descending order of frequency, and take the first ten.</p>
<p>A shell one-liner like this would do the job:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>cut</span> <span>-d</span><span>' '</span> <span>-f</span> 1 access.log <span>|</span><span>sort</span> <span>|</span><span>uniq</span> <span>-c</span> <span>|</span><span>sort</span> <span>-rn</span> <span>|</span><span>head</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This extracts the IP address from the first column of each line (<code>cut</code>), counts the number of unique values (<code>uniq -c</code>), sorts them in descending numerical order (<code>sort -rn</code>), and shows the first ten (<code>head</code>).</p>
<p>Since virtually all Unix commands can accept data on standard input, and write results to standard output, some very complex pipelines can be constructed this way, using only the shell’s simple pipe operator.</p>
<p>This is a very powerful and flexible programming paradigm, which goes a long way to explaining the dominance of the Unix model today. It also suggests it’s worth investing a little time in learning how to get the best out of your shell.</p>
<p>So can we do the same sort of magic in Go? Let’s try to write a similar program and see how easy it is (or not).</p>
<h2 id="the-wrong-answer">The wrong answer</h2>
<p>While the task is well-defined, this program is by no means easy to write in Go. It’s certainly hard to make it as concise as the shell version.</p>
<p>Something like this might do the job:</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/bitfield/tpg-tools2/blob/main/visitors/1/main.go">Listing visitors/1</a>)</p>
<p>There are several problems with this program, not least that it’s pretty complicated. You might like to test your code-reading skills by figuring out how it works, but I’m by no means recommending it as a model of Go style.</p>
<p>It’s just a quick, untested, hack, and that’s partly the point. In devops work we’re often required to solve problems quickly, rather than elegantly. The server could be on fire <em>now</em>, and we need to figure out which IP address is burning it down.</p>
<p>So this isn’t a very satisfactory result. If Go is so great, why isn’t it a good fit for this problem? What kind of code would we like to write instead?</p>
<h2 id="programs-as-pipelines">Programs as pipelines</h2>
<p>Given the nature of the problem, we’d prefer to express the solution as a <em>pipeline</em>, just like the shell program. How could we express that in Go? What about something like this?</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">File<span>(</span><span>"log.txt"</span><span>).</span>Column<span>(</span><span>1</span><span>).</span>Freq<span>().</span>First<span>(</span><span>10</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In other words, read the file <code>log.txt</code>, take its first column, sort by frequency, get the first ten results, and print them to standard output.</p>
<p>Not only is this extremely concise, it’s arguably even <em>clearer</em> than the shell pipeline. A beginner wouldn’t necessarily know what <code>cut -d' ' -f 1</code> does, for example. But if they saw <code>Column(1)</code>, I think they’d understand that.</p>
<p>And this program achieves the same task as the awkward 30+ line monster we just saw… in <em>one</em> line. Not bad. In fact, it’s getting to the point where even seasoned shell wizards might start to think it’s worth writing systems programs in Go.</p>
<h2 id="the-script-package">The <code>script</code> package</h2>
<p>But this example doesn’t even really look like Go code! How is it possible? The answer is a package called <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bitfield/script"><code>script</code></a>:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>import</span> <span>"github.com/bitfield/script"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>script</code> is a Go package for doing the kind of tasks that shell scripts are good at: reading files, executing subprocesses, counting lines, matching strings, and so on. The author liked the elegant and concise nature of well-crafted shell pipelines, but liked Go even more.</p>
<p>Now you can construct nifty one-liners in Go without all that tedious scanning, sorting, slicing, and looping. Let’s take a look at a few examples.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to read the contents of a file as a string. Here’s what that looks like in <code>script</code>:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">data<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> script<span>.</span>File<span>(</span><span>"test.txt"</span><span>).</span>String<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That looks straightforward enough, but suppose you now want to count the lines in that file.</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1">n<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> script<span>.</span>File<span>(</span><span>"test.txt"</span><span>).</span>CountLines<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For something a bit more challenging, let’s try counting the number of lines in the file that match the string “Error”:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1">n<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> script<span>.</span>File<span>(</span><span>"test.txt"</span><span>).</span>Match<span>(</span><span>"Error"</span><span>).</span>CountLines<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>But what if, instead of reading a specific file, we want to simply pipe input into this program, and have it output only matching lines (like <code>grep</code>)?</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">script<span>.</span>Stdin<span>().</span>Match<span>(</span><span>"Error"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That was almost too easy! So let’s pass in a list of files on the command line, and have our program read them all in sequence and output the matching lines:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1">script<span>.</span>Args<span>().</span>Concat<span>().</span>Match<span>(</span><span>"Error"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Maybe we’re only interested in the first 10 matches. No problem:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1">script<span>.</span>Args<span>().</span>Concat<span>().</span>Match<span>(</span><span>"Error"</span><span>).</span>First<span>(</span><span>10</span><span>).</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2">    Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What’s that? You want to append that output to a file instead of printing it to the terminal? <em>You’ve got some attitude, mister</em>. But okay:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">script<span>.</span>Args<span>().</span>Concat<span>().</span>Match<span>(</span><span>"Error"</span><span>).</span>First<span>(</span><span>10</span><span>).</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">    AppendFile<span>(</span><span>"/var/log/errors.txt"</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We’re not limited to getting data only from files or standard input. We can get it from HTTP requests too:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1">script<span>.</span>Get<span>(</span><span>"https://wttr.in/London?format=3"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span>
<span id="cb14-2"><span>// Output:</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3"><span>// London: 🌦   +13°C</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s great for simple GET requests, but suppose we want to <em>send</em> some data in the body of a POST request, for example. Here’s how that works:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1">script<span>.</span>Echo<span>(</span>data<span>).</span>Post<span>(</span>URL<span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we need to customise the HTTP behaviour in some way, such as using our own HTTP client, we can do that:</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1">script<span>.</span>NewPipe<span>().</span>WithHTTPClient<span>(&amp;</span>http<span>.</span>Client<span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2">    Timeout<span>:</span> <span>10</span> <span>*</span> time<span>.</span>Second<span>,</span></span>
<span id="cb16-3"><span>}).</span>Get<span>(</span><span>"https://example.com"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or maybe we need to set some custom header on the request. No problem. We can just create the request in the usual way, and set it up however we want. Then we pass it to <code>Do</code>, which will actually perform the request:</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1">req<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> http<span>.</span>NewRequest<span>(</span>http<span>.</span>MethodGet<span>,</span> <span>"http://example.com"</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span><span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb17-2">req<span>.</span>Header<span>.</span>Add<span>(</span><span>"Authorization"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Bearer "</span><span>+</span>token<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb17-3">script<span>.</span>Do<span>(</span>req<span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The HTTP server could return some non-okay response, though; for example, “404 Not Found”. So what happens then?</p>
<p>In general, when any pipe stage (such as <code>Do</code>) encounters an error, it produces no output to subsequent stages. And <code>script</code> treats HTTP response status codes outside the range 200-299 as errors. So the answer for the previous example is that we just won’t <em>see</em> any output from this program if the server returns an error response.</p>
<p>Instead, the pipe “remembers” any error that occurs, and we can retrieve it later by calling its <code>Error</code> method, or by using a <em>sink</em> method such as <code>String</code>, which returns an <code>error</code> value along with the result.</p>
<p><code>Stdout</code> also returns an error, plus the number of bytes successfully written (which we don’t care about for this particular case). So we can check that error, which is always a good idea in Go:</p>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1">_<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> script<span>.</span>Do<span>(</span>req<span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb18-3">    log<span>.</span>Fatal<span>(</span>err<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb18-4"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If, as is common, the data we get from an HTTP request is in JSON format, we can use <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">JQ</a> queries to interrogate it:</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1">data<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> script<span>.</span>Do<span>(</span>req<span>).</span>JQ<span>(</span><span>".[0] | {message: .commit.message, name: .commit.committer.name}"</span><span>).</span>String<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can also run external programs and get their output:</p>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1">script<span>.</span>Exec<span>(</span><span>"ping 127.0.0.1"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that <code>Exec</code> runs the command concurrently: it doesn’t wait for the command to complete before returning any output. That’s good, because this <code>ping</code> command will run forever (or until we get bored).</p>
<p>Instead, when we read from the pipe using <code>Stdout</code>, we see each line of output as it’s produced:</p>
<pre><code>PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.056 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.054 ms
...</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>ping</code> example, we knew the exact arguments we wanted to send the command, and we just needed to run it once. But what if we don’t know the arguments yet? We might get them from the user, for example.</p>
<p>We might like to be able to run the external command repeatedly, each time passing it the next line of data from the pipe as an argument. No worries:</p>
<div id="cb22"><pre><code><span id="cb22-1">script<span>.</span>Args<span>().</span>ExecForEach<span>(</span><span>"ping -c 1 {{.}}"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That <code>{{.}}</code> is standard Go template syntax; it’ll substitute each line of data from the pipe into the command line before it’s executed. You can write as fancy a Go template expression as you want here (but this simple example probably covers most use cases).</p>
<p>If there isn’t a built-in operation that does what we want, we can just write our own, using <code>Filter</code>:</p>
<div id="cb23"><pre><code><span id="cb23-1">script<span>.</span>Echo<span>(</span><span>"hello world"</span><span>).</span>Filter<span>(</span><span>func</span> <span>(</span>r io<span>.</span>Reader<span>,</span> w io<span>.</span>Writer<span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb23-2">    n<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> io<span>.</span>Copy<span>(</span>w<span>,</span> r<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb23-3">    fmt<span>.</span>Fprintf<span>(</span>w<span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>filtered %d bytes</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> n<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb23-4">    <span>return</span> err</span>
<span id="cb23-5"><span>}).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span>
<span id="cb23-6"><span>// Output:</span></span>
<span id="cb23-7"><span>// hello world</span></span>
<span id="cb23-8"><span>// filtered 11 bytes</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>func</code> we supply to <code>Filter</code> takes just two parameters: a reader to read from, and a writer to write to. The reader reads the previous stages of the pipe, as you might expect, and anything written to the writer goes to the <em>next</em> stage of the pipe.</p>
<p>If our <code>func</code> returns some error, then, just as with the <code>Do</code> example, the pipe’s error status is set, and subsequent stages become a no-op.</p>
<p>Filters run concurrently, so the pipeline can start producing output before the input has been fully read, as it did in the <code>ping</code> example. In fact, most built-in pipe methods, including <code>Exec</code>, are implemented <em>using</em> <code>Filter</code>.</p>

<p>One of the things that makes shell scripts powerful is not just the shell language itself, which is pretty basic. It’s the availability of a rich set of <em>userland</em> tools, like <code>grep</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>cat</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>head</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>But we can replicate most of the functionality of those tools using script. Here’s a program that just echoes its input to its output, like <code>cat</code>:</p>

<p>And here’s one that concatenates all the files it’s given as arguments and writes them to the output, again like <code>cat</code>:</p>
<div id="cb25"><pre><code><span id="cb25-1">script<span>.</span>Args<span>().</span>Concat<span>().</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What about <code>echo</code>? Can we do that? Yup:</p>
<div id="cb26"><pre><code><span id="cb26-1">script<span>.</span>Args<span>().</span>Join<span>().</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s fairly easy to reproduce at least the simple behaviour of most of the familiar Unix tools in this way. And for anything that’s not already provided in <code>script</code>, well, we can just use the tool itself:</p>
<div id="cb27"><pre><code><span id="cb27-1">script<span>.</span>Exec<span>(</span><span>"open info.pdf"</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since we can run any external program, we can use the shell’s facilities too. Now we really have the best of all worlds!</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1">script<span>.</span>Exec<span>(</span><span>"bash -c 'echo hello from bash'"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>One common operation in shell scripts is to use the <code>find</code> tool to generate a recursive directory listing. We can do that too:</p>
<div id="cb29"><pre><code><span id="cb29-1">script<span>.</span>FindFiles<span>(</span><span>"/backup"</span><span>).</span>Stdout<span>()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>But supposing we then wanted to do some operation on each of the files discovered in this way. What would that look like?</p>
<div id="cb30"><pre><code><span id="cb30-1">script<span>.</span>FindFiles<span>(</span><span>"*.go"</span><span>).</span>ExecForEach<span>(</span><span>"gofmt -w {{ . }}"</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You might recognise the argument to <code>ExecForEach</code> as a Go template; every filename produced by <code>FindFiles</code> will be substituted into this command in turn.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>Those chained function calls look a bit weird. What’s going on there?</p>
<p>One of the neat things about the Unix shell, and its many imitators, is the way you can compose operations into a <em>pipeline</em>:</p>
<div id="cb31"><pre><code><span id="cb31-1"><span>cat</span> test.txt <span>|</span> <span>grep</span> Error <span>|</span> <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The output from each stage of the pipeline feeds into the next, and you can think of each stage as a <em>filter</em> that passes on only certain parts of its input to its output.</p>
<p>By comparison, writing shell-like scripts in raw Go is much less convenient, because everything you do returns a different data type, and you must (or at least should) check errors following every operation.</p>
<p>In scripts for system administration we often want to compose different operations like this in a quick and convenient way. If an error occurs somewhere along the pipeline, we would like to check this just once at the end, rather than after every operation.</p>
<h2 id="everything-is-a-pipe">Everything is a pipe</h2>
<p>The <code>script</code> package allows us to do this because everything is a pipe (specifically, a <code>script.Pipe</code>). To create a pipe, start with a <em>source</em> like <code>File</code>:</p>
<div id="cb32"><pre><code><span id="cb32-1">p <span>:=</span> script<span>.</span>File<span>(</span><span>"test.txt"</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You might expect <code>File</code> to return an error if there is a problem opening the file, but it doesn’t. We will want to call a chain of methods on the result of <code>File</code>, and it’s inconvenient to do that if it also returns an error. So <code>File</code> returns a pipe instead.</p>
<p>Since <code>File</code> returns a pipe, you can call any method on it you like. For example, <code>Match</code>:</p>
<div id="cb33"><pre><code><span id="cb33-1">p<span>.</span>Match<span>(</span><span>"what I'm looking for"</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The result of <em>this</em> is another pipe (containing only the matching lines from <code>test.txt</code>), and so on. You don’t have to chain all your methods onto a single line, but it’s pretty neat that you can if you want to.</p>
<h2 id="handling-errors">Handling errors</h2>
<p>As we saw in the <code>Do</code> example, as soon as any pipeline stage hits an error, the error flag is set on the pipe, and all subsequent operations on the pipe become no-ops. That means you don’t need to check for an error <em>at each stage</em>: instead, you can check it at the end, or whenever you like.</p>
<p>You can always ask a pipe for its error status by calling its <code>Error</code> method:</p>
<div id="cb34"><pre><code><span id="cb34-1"><span>if</span> err <span>:=</span> p<span>.</span>Error<span>();</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb34-2">    <span>return</span> fmt<span>.</span>Errorf<span>(</span><span>"oh no: %w"</span><span>,</span> err<span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb34-3"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Seasoned Gophers will recognise this as the <code>errWriter</code> pattern described by Rob Pike in the blog post <a href="https://blog.golang.org/errors-are-values">Errors are values</a>. It’s ideal when you’re carrying out a series of operations, any of which can error, but you only care if the <em>sequence</em> as a whole encounters an error.</p>
<p>This eliminates a lot of the <code>if err != nil</code> boilerplate which seems to infuriate people so much about Go. Those people aren’t crazy: that kind of thing <em>can</em> be annoying, if you don’t know this useful pattern.</p>
<h2 id="closing-pipes">Closing pipes</h2>
<p>If you’ve dealt with files in Go before, you’ll know that you need to <em>close</em> a file once you’ve finished with it. Otherwise, the program will retain what’s called a <em>file handle</em> (the kernel data structure that represents an open file).</p>
<p>There is a limit to the total number of open file handles for a given program, and for the system as a whole, so a program that leaks file handles will eventually crash, and will waste resources in the meantime.</p>
<p>Files aren’t the only things that need to be closed after reading: so do network connections, HTTP response bodies, and so on.</p>
<p>How does <code>script</code> handle this? Simple. The data source associated with a pipe will be automatically closed once it is read completely. Therefore, calling any sink method that reads the pipe to completion (such as <code>String</code>) will close its data source. The only case in which you need to explicitly call <code>Close</code> on a pipe is when you don’t read from it, or you don’t read it to completion for some reason.</p>
<p>If the pipe was created from something that doesn’t need to be closed, such as a string, then calling <code>Close</code> simply does nothing, as you’d expect.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-shell">Why not shell?</h2>
<p>This is cool and all, but is it <em>really</em> needed? After all, haven’t we been running the world on shell scripts for several decades? And aren’t we writing more of them every day? So what’s the problem with shell scripts, and why is Go the solution?</p>
<p>It’s a fair question. Shell scripts and one-liners are perfectly adequate for building one-off tasks, initialization scripts, and the kind of ‘glue code’ that holds the internet together. I speak as someone who’s spent at least thirty years doing this for a living. But in many ways they’re not ideal for important, non-trivial programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trying to build portable shell scripts is a nightmare. The exact syntax and options of Unix commands varies from one distribution to another. Although in theory POSIX is a workable common subset of functionality, in practice it’s usually precisely the non-POSIX behaviour that you need.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shell scripts are hard to test (though test frameworks have been written, and if you’re seriously putting mission-critical shell scripts into production, you should be using them, or reconsidering your technology choices).
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shell scripts don’t scale. Because there are very limited facilities for logic and abstraction, and because any successful program tends to grow remorselessly over time, shell scripts can become an unreadable mess of special cases and spaghetti code. We’ve all seen it, if not, indeed, done it.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shell syntax is awkward: quoting, whitespace, and brackets can require a lot of fiddling to get right, and so many characters are magic to the shell (<code>*</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and so on) that this can lead to subtle bugs. Scripts can work fine for years until you suddenly encounter a file whose name contains whitespace, and then everything breaks horribly.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Deploying shell scripts obviously requires at least a (sizable) shell binary in addition to the source code, but it usually also requires an unknown and variable number of extra userland programs (<code>cut</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>head</code>, and friends). If you’re building container images, for example, you effectively need to include a whole Unix distribution with your program, which runs to hundreds of megabytes, and is not at all in the spirit of containers.
</li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair to the shell, this kind of thing is not what it was ever intended for. Shell is an interactive job control tool for launching programs, connecting programs together, and to a limited extent, manipulating text. It’s not for building portable, scalable, reliable, and elegant programs. That’s what <em>Go</em> is for.</p>

<p>Go has a great testing framework built right into the standard library. It has a superb standard library, and thousands of high-quality third-party packages for just about any functionality you can imagine. It is compiled, so it’s fast, and statically typed, so it’s reliable. It’s efficient and memory-safe. Go programs can be distributed as a single binary. Go scales to enormous projects (Kubernetes, for example).</p>
<p>The <code>script</code> package is implemented entirely in Go, and does not require any external userland programs. Thus you can build your <code>script</code> program as a single (very small) binary that is quick to build, quick to upload, quick to deploy (in a container, for example), quick to run, and economical with resources.</p>
<p>I’m not saying shell scripting is obsolete. I still use a lot of shell scripts myself. There is a large problem domain where shell is absolutely the right answer. But small programs tend to grow into large ones, and when that happens, it’s nice to be able to use the facilities of a language that was designed for programming at scale.</p>
<p>But with a package like <code>script</code>, we don’t have to lose all the elegance and flexibility of the classic Unix environment we’ve come to love. Instead, we can keep just a little bit of that old shell magic.</p>
<p><small>You can read more about the implementation of the <code>script</code> package, and other interesting programs, in my book, <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/books/tools">The Power of Go: Tools</a>.</small></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/xanadu-patterns">https://maggieappleton.com/xanadu-patterns</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37197686">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p type="button" role="button" id="react-collapsed-toggle-undefined" aria-controls="react-collapsed-panel-undefined" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="0"><h4>Table of Contents</h4></p></div>
<p>It's infamous in the technology community as a sixty-year project that&nbsp;never quite launched. A cautionary tale of what happens when you overhype, underdeliver, and try to stuff an operating system's worth of features into a single piece of proprietary software. The kind of tale that makes our ferociously lean startup culture of Move Fast, Break Things, and Demo or Die seem almost sensible.</p>
<p>Xanadu was a hypothetical hypertext system. </p>
<p>It's hard to read the word <em>hypertext</em> in 2021 and not believe its synonymous with the system Tim Berners-Lee built in 1989 – the World Wide Web that became so much more than linked text on digital screens. The version of hypertext you are reading this on is the only hypertext most of us have ever known.</p>
<p>And yet the idea of hypertext predates Berners-Lee by two decades. The term was coined in 1963 by none other than Ted Nelson as part of a much larger vision; one small brick in the grand Xanadu dream mansion. </p>
<p>To talk about Xanadu, we need to put a pin in our current understanding of <em>hypertext</em>. Our preconceived notions of what a link is, how it works, and what digital text is capable of threatens to overwrite the alternate history we're about to explore.</p>
<p>Ted hoped Xanadu would be a medium for “<!-- -->" – a paradigm shift that would free us from the material constraints of paper. His vision was the first to meaningfully consider how storing information in digital bits could reconfigure the way we read, write, cite, and share words.</p>
<p>Xanadu's failure to mature into a widespread, useable commercial product is great fodder a <!-- -->. One fuelled by the noticeably combative language in Xanadu's <!-- -->:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The computer world is a continual war over software politics and paradigms" where “we fight on" for “vindication" and “the last laugh."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One feels like the dinner guest who has stumbled into a raging martial argument over unwashed tea towels. You don't dare ask for context.</p>
<p>Yet these historical skirmishes and financial flops are also the least interesting thing about Xanadu. The most interesting part is its&nbsp;<strong>Pattern Language</strong>.</p>
<a href="#architectural-pattern-languages"><h2 id="architectural-pattern-languages">Architectural Pattern Languages</h2></a>
 are sets of flexible, reusable solutions to common
design problems.
<p>They come from the land of architects: the software developers of the material world. Namely, the architect <!-- -->, whose philosophy of constructing vibrant and humane living space escaped the confines of urban planning and infused the world of software design in the late 1980's.</p>
<p>In their book <!-- -->, Alexander defined 253 architectural patterns for designing cities, towns, and homes. These became the example patterns for writing patterns. Each one is composed of a context, problem, example, and solution.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>For example, the design pattern <strong>A Place to Wait</strong> asks that we create comfortable accommodation and ambient activity whenever someone needs to wait; benches, cafes, reading rooms, miniature playgrounds, three-reel slot machines (if we happen to be in the Las Vegas airport). This solves the problem of huddles of people awkwardly hovering in liminal space; near doorways, taking up sidewalks, anxiously waiting for delayed flights or dental operations or immigration investigations without anything to distract them from uncertain fates.</p>
<p>Others like <strong>Light on Two Sides of Every Room</strong> and <strong>Staircase as Stage</strong> are fairly self-explanatory.</p>
<p>There's no single way to implement these design patterns. They are purposefully abstract enough to adapt to the situation at hand. Rules of thumb rather than sets of formulaic instructions.</p>
<a href="#xanadu-as-a-design-pattern"><h2 id="xanadu-as-a-design-pattern">Xanadu as a Design Pattern</h2></a>
<p>Taken as a collection of design patterns, Xanadu's documentation suggests solutions to some of the hypertextual problems we're wrestling with today;</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we structure information and build relationships between pieces of data that help us see them across contexts, and clarify understanding?</li>
<li>How do we build systems that allow people to collaborate on shared documents without losing authorship? How do we credit and compensate authors based on their contributions?</li>
<li>How do we bring ideas and data from a variety of sources into conversation with our own, while leaving a clear trail back to the origin?</li>
</ul>
<p>Xanadu became a sad parable, when it should have been a piece of speculative design. A set of seeds scattered into the wind for other people to pick up and plant, rather than the patent-happy industrial farming conglomerate it tried to grow into.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, there appear to be rogue seedlings sprouting around the web. A number of Xanadu's design patterns are showing up in modern manifestations. We're finding ways to backwards engineer the original spirit of Xanadu into the existing structures of the World Wide Web.</p>
<h2>The Patterns</h2>
<h3 id="1-visible-links">1. Visible Links</h3>
<p>Ted Nelson has many gripes, and <strong>jump links</strong> are one of his biggest. They're the kind of links we all use around the web today. Clicking a hyperlink is a bit of a gamble. It <em>jumps</em> you into somewhere unknown. You find out when you get there.</p>
<p>We've found ways to adapt to this; Venkatesh Rao has a compelling exploration of how we've developed a <!-- --> to hint at where people are headed. Most browsers will do this more explicitly by showing you a URL preview, but they tuck them into the far corner in tiny text:</p>
<!-- -->
<p>These can only tell you so much when modern URLs are often obscured by link shorteners and overstuffed with tracking queries. These solutions are only a band-aid on the underlying wound. They suggest where you're headed, rather than showing you.</p>
<p>Nelson's answer to jump links are <strong>visible links</strong> – links that show you the full context of where you're headed. These were an essential feature of Xanadu. In the original mockups for “<em>Xanadocs</em>" linked text would be connected to its source in a rather literal fashion: brightly colored highlights running between documents.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>This proposed solution relies on two other patterns – <em>parallel documents</em> and <em>transpointing windows</em> (covered below) – but the underlying principle was simply that links made their destinations clear.</p>
<p>In lieu of Xanadoc links, the modern web has landed on some fairly decent solutions to this issue: <strong>hover previews and unfurls</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Hover previews</strong> are when you can see a preview of the page you're headed to when you hover over a link. It's usually an excerpt that gives you the page title, the first few lines of text, and sometimes an image. Wikipedia was one of the first major sites to <!-- --> in 2018.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Hover previews have also become popular in the <span></span></p> community as a way to help visitors quickly navigate through collections of public notes and essays that are deeply interlinked. <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/">Andy Matuschak</a> and <a href="https://www.gwern.net/index">Gwern Branwen</a> are two gardeners with good examples of how these work in action.
<!-- -->
<p>Similar to hover previews, <strong>unfurls</strong> are the preview cards that automagically appear when you paste a link into Twitter, Facebook, Notion, Miro, or any other richly-featured web app. If I paste a link to this great article on <!-- --> into a Tweet or Notion document, it automagically displays the feature image, title, and byline without any extra effort from me:</p>
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<p>This system is powered by the <!-- --> which Facebook introduced in 2010. This standardised format helps website authors define <em>metadata</em> like titles, descriptions, authors, and images for each of their pages. These are automatically retrieved and “unfurled" when the link is pasted elsewhere on the web.</p>
<p>Both hover previews and link unfurls give you a good sense of where you're headed if you click on a link. They get us to <em>semi-visible</em> links.</p>
<p>Previews aren't quite the same as physical links between parts of a page though. You lose the fine-grained associations between specific paragraphs and lines. If we wanted to dial up the Xanadu-esque visibility, we could work on showing previews of the whole page and directing people to specific pieces of text within it.</p>
<h3 id="2-parallel-documents">2. Parallel Documents</h3>
<p>Ted's proposal for visible links relied on another key Xanadu pattern: <strong>parallel documents arranged side-by-side</strong>. This pattern allow us to see quotations in their original context, and quickly jump to the source material of documents.</p>
<p>It's also tricky to misquote someone and cherry-pick misleading excerpts when the reader has immediate, effortless access to the original.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>This sounds great in theory. Being able to lay multiple sheets of paper down side-by-side in meatspace is one of its shining qualities. Humans are very good at visually skimming information spread out in front of us – it allows us to quickly pattern-match by comparing and contrasting.</p>
<p>Ideally our digital mediums would lean into our ability to survey a large visual field. But the limitations of LCD screen sizes lead to some unsatisfying compromises. Instead, we end up squishing columns of documents onto our tiny screens.</p>
<p>The existing prototypes of Xanadu don't gracefully solve this problem in any way. Some of them – like the 2007 <em>XanaduSpace</em> demo – suggest launching into the disorienting world of 3D paper where documents tower over you like skyscrapers.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Here's Ted to give you an interactive tour:</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Flying about in multiple dimensions feels slightly distracting when you're trying to write a detailed product spec or salvage your mediocre thesis.</p>
<p>We have developed some slightly less nauseasting solutions to this problem.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Tabs and slide-over windows help us quickly move between documents, although they still fail at letting us see more than two at once.</p>
<p>Many modern note-taking apps have popularised fat “sidebars" that are essentially second windows.</p>
<p>Roam Research, Obsidian, Logseq, and Innos are all designed for parallel documents</p>
<p>Arranging two windows side-by-side doesn't properly solve this problem. We can't select things from from one window and drag them into the next. The two windows don't know about each other and usually can't interact. They're connected to different data sources, possibly running in seperate applications. Copying and pasting text, images, or objects between the two is a cumbersome workaround.</p>
<p>The mobile-first responsive web also makes this tricky. There is simply no space on a 320px-wide screen to consider viewing multiple windows at once. Although patterns like horizontal scroll and slide-over windows might help solve this.</p>
<h3 id="3-transpointing-windows">3. Transpointing Windows</h3>
<p>Parts of documents visibly point to other parts</p>
<p>LiquidText</p>
<!-- -->
<p> managed to craft up this crazy demo inside of their Roam Research database.</p>
<p>Loading...</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="5-bi-directional-links">5. Bi-Directional Links</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<span></span>

</ul>
<h3 id="6-version-control">6. Version Control</h3>
<p>In the age of Git, we tend to take version control for granted.</p>
<p>The first version control system dates back to <!-- -->. It's now difficult to imagine programming without it.</p>
<h3 id="7-modular-text-blocks">7. Modular Text Blocks</h3>
<p>The core building block of the web has always been documents. While the idea of a web<em>page</em> has evolved far beyond it's original idea, we still construct, connect, and navigate websites at the page level.</p>
<p>The early web was built for academic researchers to share their work, in a time before all the plebs invaded with our bleeding-heart livejournal entries, dancing baby GIFs, and TikTok moves. These researchers designed the system to mimic their primary medium of communication; paper-based academic articles and documents.</p>
<p>This paper document design metaphor determined many of the early architectural decisions. URL addresses were set at the <em>page</em> level, rather than the paragraph. Inline images were an afterthought, and even a contentious addition to the spec. </p>
<p>Blocks construct documents</p>
<p>Notion pioneered this in the note-taking space</p>
<p>Explosion of note-taking apps using a block-first approach: Roam, Innos, Clover, Craft, Kosmik</p>

<p>The original Xanadu vision was ambitious. Unreasonably ambitious. The above feature list is a small selection.</p>
<p>Perhaps you sense the problem.<br>
<!-- -->Solving all the things all at once gets tricky.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> <span>YAGNI</span>, unless you’re working in a big company with federated front-ends or GraphQL.</p>
<p>It’s popular in web dev nowadays to build a backend that serves <span>JSON</span>, and a frontend that renders the app. This is fine. I’m not the biggest fan, but it’s really okay.

<li>How to optimize requests to multiple endpoints</li>
<li>How to avoid using <span>API</span> data fields in unintended ways</li>
<li>How to weigh the benefit of new features against the cost of new <span>API</span> requests</li>
</ol>
<p>Do these really have to be your problems if you’re just making a backend for your frontend? Do you have to imagine every possible workflow, avoid N+1 request issues, test every request configuration, or deny yourself features when you know exactly what each page needs to look like? You can probably see where I’m going with this.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-do-you-suggest">So what do you suggest?</h2>
<p>I suggest you stop treating your frontend as some generic <span>API</span> client, and start treating it as a half of your app.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could just send it the whole<span></span> <span>“</span>page” worth of <span>JSON</span>. Make an endpoint for <code>/page/a</code> and render the whole <span>JSON</span> for <code>/page/a</code> there. Do this for every page. Don’t force your front-end developers to send a bunch of individual requests to render a complex page. Stop annoying them with contrived limitations. Align yourselves. <span>🧘‍♂️</span></p>
<p>And in that <span>JSON</span>, actually render the page. Don’t render abstract models and collections. Render concrete boxes, sections, paragraphs, lists. Render the visual page structure.</p>
<pre><code>{
  "section1": {
    "topBoxTitle": "Foo",
    "leftBoxTitle": "Bar",
    "linkToClose": "https://…"
  },
  "section2": {
    …
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>This is similar but not quite the same as Server Driven <span>UI</span><a href="#footnote-18YB" id="ref-18YB" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Perhaps we could call it Server Informed <span>UI</span>.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-that-better-exactly">How is that better exactly?</h2>
<p>Have you seen that list of annoying decisions up there? For one, they are gone now. <img draggable="false" alt="💨" src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_ae6687516f4a44fb8370df95cf526289/_image_cache/b755281c-b164-4cd6-a1a0-175e1c00a72b.png" width="36" height="36"></p>
<p>For two, you are now free to decide<span></span> <span>“</span>I want page a” and then implement<span></span> <span>“</span>page a” in the backend, and in the frontend. Super straightforward. <img draggable="false" alt="✅" src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_ae6687516f4a44fb8370df95cf526289/_image_cache/c237b804-0a39-42cb-b7cc-a0629e3e52b5.png" width="36" height="36"></p>
<p>No more<span></span> <span>“</span>what <span>API</span> workflows do we need to introduce to sort of make this page possible almost? <span>🤔</span><span></span><span>”</span>. You can keep<span></span> <span>“</span>page a” dumb to only do what it needs to do. You test the crap out of<span></span> <span>“</span>page a” for bugs, security, performance. You can even fetch everything for<span></span> <span>“</span>page a” in a single big <span>SQL</span> query. You can cache the entire <span>JSON</span> payload of<span></span> <span>“</span>page a”.</p>
<p>Frontend knows exactly what each field in<span></span> <span>“</span>page a” payload is for. There are no discrepancies in field meanings. They represent exactly what frontend needs.</p>
<p>When a stakeholder tells you to change<span></span> <span>“</span>page a” you will be able to literally go ahead and change<span></span> <span>“</span>page a”, instead of spending meetings figuring out how your backend <span>API</span> could accommodate the change in<span></span> <span>“</span>page a”. It’s not a choreographed conglomeration of <span>API</span> requests. It’s just<span></span> <span>“</span>page a”. You have freed yourself from self-imposed limitations of your <span>API</span>.</p>
<p>Your business logic has now moved from being haphazardly split between frontend and backend into just backend. Your frontend can finally focus on presentation and <span>UI</span>. Your backend can finally focus on implementing exactly what’s needed. Kinda the goal, no?</p>
<h2 id="have-you-actually-tried-this">Have you actually tried this?</h2>
<p>Yes, I have tried this on a couple of production projects so far. One of them was personal, the other was a consistent multi-year refactoring effort in an existing company. The whole team was bought in, and it worked out well. The only problem we’ve encountered was that the front-end team has gotten increasingly bored. Nearly all business logic was taken away from them. At the same time, no<span></span> <span>“</span>excitement” was added to the back-end team. It’s just gotten kinda boring all around. Somehow we all ended up talking more about the business than the code.</p>
<p>Feel free to stop reading here if you’re convinced. Next part is just responding to various rebuttals I keep hearing.</p>
<h3 id="but-i-want-my-front-end-team-to-have-freedom-or-i-want-my-front-end-to-be-decoupled">But I want my front-end team to have freedom! (Or, I want my front-end to be decoupled!)</h3>
<p>Let’s be honest, your frontend doesn’t really have freedom. When they send you 7 requests to render a single page, that’s not freedom. It’s jumping hoops to meet basic requirements. As soon as requirements change, you probably going to need to change the backend anyway to accommodate it. The freedom is all accidental and mostly in the wrong places.</p>
<p>If you really want to give your front end team freedom, install them a GraphQL wrapper directly on top of Postgres and quit. <img draggable="false" alt="😛" src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_ae6687516f4a44fb8370df95cf526289/_image_cache/fb91fc71-2c42-4a9a-96d7-2b7839fdf04f.png" width="36" height="36"></p>
<h3 id="but-we-actually-want-a-general-purpose-api-anyway-so-this-is-2-birds-with-1-stone-no">But we actually want a general purpose <span>API</span> anyway, so this is 2 birds with 1 stone, no?</h3>
<p>No, you would not actually want to make this <span>API</span> public. You think you would, but when time comes, you’d be like<span></span> <span>“</span>crap, maybe I shouldn’t”. These 2 APIs have very different reasons to change. Public <span>API</span> needs to enable the workflows of your clients. Private backend needs to enable the next whim of your product manager. Stop jamming sticks into your own bicycle wheels.</p>
<h3 id="but-how-will-i-reuse-the-logic-when-building-json-for-pages-i-reused-so-much-logic-in-my-crud-controllers">But how will I reuse the logic when building <span>JSON</span> for pages? I reused so much logic in my <span>CRUD</span> controllers!</h3>
<p>If your programming language lets you reuse logic (it does), then you can reuse logic. Use mixins, composition, inheritance, whatever you got to work with. If you make yourself some good abstractions, then you will have an amazing time putting together pages from your <span>LEGO</span> blocks.</p>
<h3 id="but-we-can-reuse-this-api-for-the-mobile-app-too">But we can reuse this <span>API</span> for the mobile app too!</h3>
<p>Your mobile app has a different set of pages with different info, structures, and reasons to change. You’ll save more time and sanity making another backend specifically for it. But hey, you can reuse a lot of your logic (see the previous paragraph).</p>
<h3 id="but-what-if-a-page-needs-a-partial-xhr-update-am-i-supposed-to-always-return-an-entire-page">But what if a page needs a partial <span>XHR</span> update? Am I supposed to always return an entire page?</h3>
<p>No, it’s okay to make an endpoint that returns just something specific. You have my permission. Make endpoints for snippets of data for specific page sections or whatever. It’s okay. Render your React components from initial payload, then update them from <span>XHR</span> calls to these endpoints. But only introduce these endpoints when you need them on certain pages. These are exceptions, not the default.</p>
<h3 id="but-my-frontend-is-a-spa-so-it-almost-always-needs-data-snippets-not-entire-pages">But my frontend is a <span>SPA</span>, so it almost always needs data snippets, not entire pages</h3>
<p>Those data snippets could still be provided as partial page structures, not generic resources. As long as your backend only serves the exact needs of your frontend, you’re good. <img draggable="false" alt="😇" src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_ae6687516f4a44fb8370df95cf526289/_image_cache/ba0c8f92-0363-47ee-998e-873b458ed98a.png" width="36" height="36"></p>
<h3 id="but-im-building-a-site-builder-so-my-frontend-is-dogfooding-the-site-builder-api">But I’m building a site builder, so my frontend is dogfooding the site builder <span>API</span></h3>
<p><span>🗡</span> I dub thee a legitimate use case haver, congratulations!</p>
<h3 id="do-you-have-data-to-support-your-claims">Do you have data to support your claims?</h3>
<p>I wish. It’s pretty hard to measure these kinds of things in our industry. Who’s gonna maintain 2 architectures for the same software for 3 years, and compare productivity between them? All I got is a mixed bag of personal experiences. Feels inductively justifiable. <span>🤷‍♂️</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Debian is an island of stability and sanity in the constant swirling chaos of Linux and open source. Long may it continue to be.</p>
<p>Ian Murdock <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianHistory?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=Debian-announcement-1993.txt" rel="nofollow">announced</a> the new distro on August 16, 1993. <a href="https://bits.debian.org/2023/08/debian-turns-30.html" rel="nofollow">Three decades later</a>, Debian is arguably more important and more pivotal to the modern Linux world than ever before. The project calls the event <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay" rel="nofollow">Debian Day</a>, and there are <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay/2023" rel="nofollow">celebrations</a> around the world this weekend. If you can get to one, you should – real-life FOSS parties are great fun.</p>
<p>It's not the oldest extant distro, although it's only a month behind Slackware, whose <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/20/slackware_turns_30/">30th birthday</a> we covered last month. Slackware is still maintained by original project founder Patrick Volkderding, while, sadly, the founder of Debian <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/12/30/ian_murdock_debian_founder/">is no longer with us</a>.</p>

    

<p>Debian, though, has more remixes and respins and derivatives, and via them more users, than any other Linux distro – with the possible exception of ChromeOS, although of course a lot of people <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/linux_desktop_debate/">don't consider ChromeOS to be a Linux distro</a>. (Android dwarfs both but it's not really in the same playing field.)</p>
<h3>Free as in 'free beer'</h3>
<p>It's important to remember that the word "free" in "free software" does have two meanings. No matter how many self-important thinkpieces say it, FOSS <strong>isn't</strong> just about freedom. The simple fact that <em>you don't have to&nbsp;pay for it</em> matters as much or more.</p>
<p>This is especially true in poorer parts of the world. FOSS OSes also <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/11/software_versus_hardware/">work better on older, slower computers</a>, which drives adoption among the billions who can't afford the latest laptops. The innovative <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/12/endless_os_5/">Endless OS distro</a> doesn't rely on always-on internet, but while it uses Red Hat-backed tools such as GNOME, OStree, and Flatpak, it's built on Debian.</p>

        


        

<p>Without FOSS operating systems, there would be no "cloud." It's nothing technical: it would all work fine on paid-for OS instances, and they form part of it. What made AWS big was the machine-controlled deployment and control of VMs, but nobody sane would allow an auto-scaler to deploy thousands of instances if they cost a thousand bucks each in licence fees.</p>
<p>It's free Linux distros that made Google possible, and Debian is the most important free distro. While Google puts out ChromeOS to the masses who don't care what their laptop runs on, internally it runs on its own in-house distro called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/how-google-got-to-rolling-linux-releases-for-desktops" rel="nofollow">gLinux Rodete</a> – based on Debian.</p>

        

<p>And, of course, there's Ubuntu. Before it launched in October 2004, its sole web presence was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040906084232/http://www.no-name-yet.com/" rel="nofollow">no-name-yet.com</a>, which said:</p>

<p>Response at the time was muted. For instance, the KDE blog <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2004/08/28/canonical-software-no-name-yet-warthogs-and-ubuntu" rel="nofollow">said</a> it was "supposed to be Debian made good (shorter release cycles being one of the main features)." As far as we can tell at Vulture Towers, the splash made by Ubuntu was small enough that <em>The Reg</em> didn't cover it <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2006/07/25/ubuntu_goes_mainstream/">until 2006</a>, when the first ever LTS release appeared – two months late.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/16/red_hat_redeploys_desktop_dev/">Red Hat redeploys one of its main desktop developers</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/16/openzfs_zfsbootmenu_2_2/">OpenZFS 2.2 is nearly here, and ZFSBootMenu 2.2 already is</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/15/red_hat_bootloader_role/">Red Hat's Mexican standoff: Job cuts? Yes, but we still need someone to boot Linux</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/14/oracle_suse_ciq_openela/">Oracle, SUSE and others caught up in RHEL drama hit back with OpenELA</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ubuntu was and is a direct offshoot of Debian. It's Sid, the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable" rel="nofollow">DebianUnstable</a> release, integrated, tested, and repackaged.</p>
<p>Nobody really knows how many Linux users there are; there are only estimates. <a href="https://truelist.co/blog/linux-statistics/" rel="nofollow">TrueList reckons</a> that Ubuntu has 33.9 percent of the market, followed by Debian at 16 percent. That's half the Linux market for Debian and its higher-profile offspring.</p>
<p>We also suspect that those figures may not adequately represent Chinese usage too. We've looked at the two leading distro families from the People's Republic. Kylin is one, and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/07/openkylin_is_ubuntu/">it's an Ubuntu remix</a>. The other is the Uniontech UOS family, of which <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/25/deepin_206_23/">Linux Deepin</a> is the international, end-user-facing member. It's based on Debian.</p>
<p>The Chinese "3-5-2 programme" <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/12/09/china_orders_ban_on_us_computers_and_software/">aimed to replace Windows with Linux</a> by the end of last year. We don't know if it's succeeded, but what it's replacing it with is Debian and Debian derivatives.</p>

        

<p>Red Hat makes the big bucks so gets the big headlines, but according to Truelist survey, Red Hat-based distros only constitute about 10 percent of the market, and of that share, some 95 percent are the free ones. That's why everyone is so upset that <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/09/centos_red_hat/">Big Purple killed CentOS Linux</a> then <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/23/red_hat_centos_move/">killed off the rebuilds too</a>.</p>
<p>Red Hat <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/10/28/ibm_redhat_acquisition/">sold for $34 billion</a>, but that money represents about 1 percent of Linux usage. Debian and its offspring have <em>50 times</em> as many users as RHEL. Even factoring in CentOS and Fedora, it's just a fifth as many users as Debian.</p>
<p>Although some big businesses <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/14/oracle_suse_ciq_openela/">make much of the noise</a>, what they're squabbling about is the relatively small paid-for slice. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.spi-inc.org/" rel="nofollow">Software in the Public Interest</a> quietly gets on with funding the gentle giant. It's the free stuff that really matters, and there Debian is the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/16/debian_11/">"rock in a swirling gyre of 'move fast and break things'."</a> ®</p>

<p>In a column for <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Irish_Times" title="The Irish Times">The Irish Times</a></i>, writer John McManus questioned whether Ireland had developed shit life syndrome in the wake of a recent fall in life expectancy.<sup id="cite_ref-IrishTimes_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-IrishTimes-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>A 2018 article in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quietus" title="The Quietus">The Quietus</a></i> on the films of the British director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Leigh" title="Mike Leigh">Mike Leigh</a> identified shit life syndrome in Leigh's 2002 film <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_or_Nothing_(film)" title="All or Nothing (film)">All or Nothing</a></i>. Kinney wrote that "The film asks questions about poverty – what does poverty do to people? How do you react when the chips are down?&nbsp;... The rise of populism in this country has been analysed through the lens of the 'left behind' – in a less crude way, this is exactly what <i>All or Nothing</i> was observing sixteen years ago."<sup id="cite_ref-Quietus_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-Quietus-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>Rosemary Rizq, in an essay in the 2016 collection <i>The Future of Psychological Therapy</i>, questioned the origin of the term <i>shit life syndrome</i>, writing that "The phrase seemed to denote a level of long-standing poverty, family breakdown, lack of stability, unemployment and potential risk factors common to many of the predominately young, working class patients referred to the [psychotherapeutic] service" for shit is "something that we continually reject, get rid of or hide. At the same time it is something we cannot completely repudiate, it is part of us, something we need" and that the individuals with SLS have problems so "terrible, so untouchable" that they "quite literally cannot be thought about, cannot be handled by the service", yet a therapeutic organisation is "obliged to do so".<sup id="cite_ref-Lees2016_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-Lees2016-5">[5]</a></sup>
