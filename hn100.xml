            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.bitsand.cloud/posts/slashing-data-transfer-costs/">https://www.bitsand.cloud/posts/slashing-data-transfer-costs/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38998516">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>There are lots of ways to accidentally spend too much money on AWS, and one of the easiest ways is by carelessly transferring data. As of writing, AWS charges the following rates for data transfer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data transfer from AWS to the public Internet ranges from $0.09/GB in <code>us-east-1</code> (N. Virginia) to $0.154/GB in <code>af-south-1</code> (Cape Town). Therefore a single terabyte of data transfer will run you a cool $90 - $154.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data transfer from one AWS region to another - e.g. if you were to transfer data from <code>us-east-1</code> to any other region - ranges from $0.02/GB in <code>us-east-1</code> to $0.147/GB in <code>af-south-1</code> (more than seven times as much!). Therefore a single terabyte of transferred data that <em>never leaves AWS’s network</em> will run you $20 - $147.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In both of these transfers, you’re only paying for <em>egress</em> fees - i.e. you’re paying for data that leaves AWS regions, and not for incoming data. But now we’ll look at one of the trickier data transfer rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data transfer between availability zones <em>in the same AWS region</em> - e.g. from <code>us-east-1a</code> to <code>us-east-1b</code> - will cost you $0.01/GB in each direction. This pricing is the same in all regions. Therefore a single terabyte of transferred data between two same-region availability zones will cost you $10 for the egress and $10 for the ingress, for a total of $20.</li>
</ul>
<p>These prices are similar between all major cloud providers. Data transfer prices easily add up, and are an extremely high-margin source of profit for cloud providers - so high-margin that Cloudflare has introduced its competing R2 storage whose primary competitive distinction is a zero egress fee, along with publishing some <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/aws-egregious-egress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fairly strong rhetoric</a> lambasting AWS for its egress charges (conveniently failing to point out that Cloudflare’s whole business model is uniquely poised to competitively offer zero egress fees in a way that AWS is not).</p>
<div>
  <p>Tip
  </p>
  <div><p>This is a good time to mention AWS PrivateLink and VPC endpoints. You might assume that if you set up an EC2 instance in <code>us-east-1</code> and transfer a terabyte from the instance to another region, you’ll pay the $20 cross-region data transfer charge. But by default, you might very well end up paying the $90 internet egress data transfer charge - e.g. if you transfer the data to a public S3 bucket in another region, you’ll effectively be transferring data over the internet.</p>
<p>AWS PrivateLink and VPC endpoints allow you to ensure that data between regions never leaves AWS’s network - useful not only in terms of pricing but also in terms of security. These features are not free, and come with their own limitations and pricing subtleties, but that’s beyond the scope of this blog post - AWS has a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/leveraging-aws-privatelink-for-volumetric-data-processing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couple of</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/reduce-cost-and-increase-security-with-amazon-vpc-endpoints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nice posts on the subject</a>, and <a href="https://www.vantage.sh/blog/nat-gateway-vpc-endpoint-savings#vpc-endpoint-pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so does Vantage</a>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It’s a common creed of AWS that setting resources up in multiple availability zones is best practice for ensuring reliability and availability. But this best practice easily opens up the door to funneling money into a furnace of cross-AZ costs - any application that involves sending data between resources in different availability zones will incur such charges.</p>
<p>Can we have our cake and eat it too? Can we set up cross-AZ infrastructure but avoid paying cross-AZ data transfer costs?</p>

  Sidestepping Data Transfer Costs with S3
  <a href="#sidestepping-data-transfer-costs-with-s3">

  </a>
</h2>
<p>S3 has an important characteristic - most storage classes in S3 store their buckets in <em>region</em> granularity rather than <em>availability zone</em> granularity. This means that you don’t upload data to a <code>us-east-1a</code> or a <code>us-east-1b</code> bucket, you upload data to a <code>us-east-1</code> bucket. Behind the scenes, AWS replicates this data in a minimum of three availability zones in the region - which is one of the reasons why S3 has such exceptionally high durability and availability.</p>
<div>
  <p>Note
  </p>
  <p>There are two storage classes - S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access and the newly introduced S3 Express One Zone - that only store data in a single availability zone. You pay less for storage, but at a cost of availability - for instance, in <code>us-east-1</code>, S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access costs $0.01/GB as opposed to S3 Infrequent Access which costs $0.0125/GB, but it is designed for 99.5% availability as opposed to 99.99%.</p>
</div>

<p>This means that data in a standard S3 bucket is “equally” available to all AWS availability zones in its region - it doesn’t make a difference to S3 if you download data from <code>us-east-1a</code> or <code>us-east-1b</code>.</p>
<p>But wait - S3 has another important characteristic. For the standard storage class, downloading data from S3 is <em>free</em> - it only incurs standard data transfer charges if you’re downloading it between regions or to the public Internet. Moreover, uploading to S3 - in any storage class - is also free! (For the data transfer - the S3 API requests you make will cost you money, but relatively little)</p>
<p>So let’s say I want to transfer 1TB between two EC2 instances in <code>us-east-1a</code> and <code>us-east-1b</code>. We saw above that if I transfer the data directly, it will cost me $20. But what if I upload the data to S3 from one instance and then download it from the other?</p>
<p>The upload will be free. The download will be free. The S3 storage will not be free, and in <code>us-east-1</code> costs $0.023/GB, or $23/TB, every month. This is charged on hour granularity, and we can design our upload/download such that no data persists in S3 for more than an hour. Let’s say there are 720 hours in a month, this means we’ll have to pay 1/720 of $23, or about $0.03. (We need to remember to delete the storage when we’re done!)</p>
<p>So instead of paying $20, this data transfer will cost only $0.03 - pretty cool! If we want to express these savings mathematically - assuming sub-hour data transfer rates, we’ve reduced our data transfer charges from $0.02/GB ($0.01 for egress and $0.01 for ingress) to  <strong>$0.000032/GB - just 0.15% (i.e. 15% of 1%) of the original charge</strong>. This gives us near-free cross-AZ data transfer costs. As an extreme example, transferring 1PB of data with this method will set you back about $32, as opposed to $20,000 with the standard way.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more! S3 has another important characteristic - it is infinitely scalable. So this method makes it very convenient to replicate data from one AZ to as many instances as we want in another AZ - thousands of instances in the second AZ could download the same S3 object, and it should take up the same time as if just a single instance was downloading it. The S3 storage cost will remain constant, and the download cost will remain free. This is pretty cool too.</p>
<div>
  <p>Warning
  </p>
  <p>S3 has another important characteristic - no single object can be more than 5TB. So if you’re using this method to transfer files bigger than 5TB, they need to be fragmented. Moreover, no single upload can be more than 5GB - you’ll need to use multi-part uploads if your files are bigger than this (<code>aws s3 cp</code> takes care of this automatically behind the scenes).</p>
</div>

<h2 id="demo">

  </a>
</h2>
<p>Let’s see this in action and be amazed. When I first thought of this method, the cost savings seemed too good to be true - even though all the fundamentals behind the method were solid, I didn’t believe it until I saw it in the Cost Explorer.</p>
<p>I want to start with clean AWS accounts so that there’s no noise when we’re examining the pricing. As such, I created two accounts for each part of the demo:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bitsand.cloud/img/awsaccountsblurred.png" alt="AWS accounts"></p>
<p>In each account, we will set up two EC2 instances - one in <code>us-east-1a</code> and another in <code>us-east-1b</code>. In each account, we’ll place both instances in a public subnet so we can easily SSH into them. And in each account, we’ll generate a random 1TB file in the <code>us-east-1a</code> instance, and our goal will be to transfer it to the <code>us-east-1b</code> instance.</p>
<p>We’ll run these two experiments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the first experiment, we’ll place both instances in a VPC with private subnets in each of the two availability zones. We’ll set up a netcat server on the <code>us-east-1b</code> instance - on the interface connected to the private subnet. The <code>us-east-1a</code> instance will then transfer the 1TB file to the <code>us-east-1b</code> instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the second experiment, we’ll place both instances in a VPC that has an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S3 Gateway endpoint</a>, we’ll create an S3 bucket, and the <code>us-east-1a</code> instance will upload the 1TB file to the bucket. Once this is done, the <code>us-east-1b</code> instance will download the 1TB file (and then delete it!).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In both experiments, we’ll have transferred 1TB from <code>us-east-1a</code> to <code>us-east-1b</code>. After this, we’ll wait for AWS’s Cost Explorer to update with the incurred costs to see that this method really works.</p>
<p>The experiments themselves are fairly straightforward, so they’re toggled away for brevity:</p>
<details>
    <summary>Standard Data Transfer Experiment</summary>
    <div><p>We’ll create a standard VPC, with both private and public subnets in <code>us-east-1a</code> and <code>us-east-1b</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the S3 Gateway endpoint is <em>deselected</em> - we’ll come back to this in the second experiment.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bitsand.cloud/img/create-vpc-standard-data-transfer.png" alt="Standard Data Transfer VPC Creation"></p>
<p>And we’ll create two EC2 instances - we’ll place them in the <em>public</em> subnets, so we can SSH into them easily. Since we want to create a 1TB file in the <code>us-east-1a</code> instance - and we don’t want to wait all day on the <code>dd</code> command - we’ll set it up with an io2 Block Express EBS volume, for maximum IOPS and throughput. (An even faster way would be an EC2 instance with a locally attached SSD instead of an EBS volume) [An even faster and substantially cheaper way, that I unfortunately realized only after finishing this post, would be to not use volumes at all but rather directly pipe <code>dd</code> into <code>nc</code> and on the receiver side pipe into <code>/dev/null</code>]</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bitsand.cloud/img/standard-data-transfer-instances.png" alt="Standard Data Transfer Created Instances"></p>
<p>We’ll edit the <code>us-east-1b</code> security group to support TCP connections from the security group attached to the <code>us-east-1a</code> instance (I opened it up for all ports, but it’d be better to limit it to just the port we’re using for the netcat server):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bitsand.cloud/img/standard-data-transfer-security-group.png" alt="Standard Data Transfer Security Group"></p>
<p>Inside the <code>us-east-1b</code> instance we’ll set up a netcat listener on port 1234:</p>
<p>And finally, in the <code>us-east-1a</code> server we’ll create a random 1TB file and then transfer it using netcat - importantly, we’ll be transferring it to the <code>us-east-1b</code> instance’s <em>private IP</em> so that it remains inside the AWS network:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When the transfer is complete, we can tear down all resources - we’re expecting to see $20 of data transfer charges.</p></div>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>S3 Data Transfer Experiment</summary>
    <div><p>We’ll do a very similar process in this experiment - only this time, we don’t really need private subnets, and we’ll want to enable the S3 Gateway so that our S3 traffic doesn’t leave AWS’s network. We’ll also want to create an IAM role that lets our EC2 instances access S3:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bitsand.cloud/img/s3datatransferrole.png" alt="S3 Data Transfer IAM Role"></p>
<p>And attach it to the instances.</p>
<p>Once we’ve created the 1TB file, we’ll want to upload it to S3. As such, we’ll create a bucket:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bitsand.cloud/img/s3datatransferbucket.png" alt="S3 Data Transfer S3 bucket"></p>
<p>And then create a random file and upload it to the bucket from the <code>us-east-1a</code> instance:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>~&gt; dd <span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/urandom <span>of</span><span>=</span>random <span>bs</span><span>=</span>16K <span>count</span><span>=</span>64M
</span></span><span><span><span># Wait for completion</span>
</span></span><span><span>~&gt; aws s3 cp random s3://s3-data-transfer-experiment/random
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When this is done, we can actually tear down the <code>us-east-1a</code> instance, as it’s no longer needed. Then, from the second instance:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>~&gt; aws s3 cp s3://s3-data-transfer-experiment/random random
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once this is done, we can tear down the EC2 instance and delete the S3 object and bucket. We’re expecting to see only a few cents of S3 storage costs.</p></div>

<p>A few hours later, Cost Explorer is updated with the billing data. Our control experiment of a standard data transfer - which we expected to cost $20 - indeed ended up costing $21.49 (I accidentally stopped the transfer at one point and had to restart it, accounting for some of the extra cost - also the created file was technically 1024GB so the base price was $20.48):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bitsand.cloud/img/standard-data-transfer-cost-explorer.png" alt="Standard Data Transfer Cost Explorer"></p>
<p>But the real experiment is the S3-based data transfer, which we expected to cost only a few cents in storage costs. And… 🥁🥁🥁:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bitsand.cloud/img/s3-data-transfer-cost-explorer.png" alt="S3 Data Transfer Cost Explorer"></p>
<p>Only eight cents!!! Let’s drill down and see how this S3 storage cost breaks down, and let’s also expand our filter so we can be convinced that there are no data transfer charges:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bitsand.cloud/img/s3-data-transfer-cost-explorer2.png" alt="S3 Data Transfer Cost Explorer2"></p>
<p>And indeed, we can see that there are no data transfer costs!! But, something’s weird - the only S3 usage types available have nothing to do with storage… Let’s filter down to S3 and group by usage type:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bitsand.cloud/img/s3-data-transfer-cost-explorer3.png" alt="S3 Data Transfer Cost Explorer3"></p>
<p>Wow. We actually weren’t charged <em>anything</em> for the storage <strong>at all</strong>. We were only charged for the S3 requests we made - PUT requests cost $0.005 for every 1000 requests and GET requests cost $0.0004 for every 1000 requests, and the amount of requests it takes to upload and download a 1TB file adds up. But shockingly, there are no storage costs - it’s almost as if S3 doesn’t charge you anything for transient storage? This is very unlike AWS, and I’m not sure how to explain this. I suspected that maybe the S3 free tier was hiding away costs, but - again, shockingly - my S3 storage free tier was totally unaffected by the experiment, none of it was consumed (as opposed to the requests free tier, which was 100% consumed).</p>
<p>But anyways, we’ve proved that the method works. Let’s finish up with some conclusions:</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">
  Conclusions
  <a href="#conclusions">
    
    <span>Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Behind the scenes, AWS replicates S3 data between availability zones for you - whatever this might cost AWS is hidden away in the storage costs you pay for your data. So at its most fundamental level, this method is unlocking free cross-AZ costs - because you’ve effectively already paid for the cross-AZ cost when you uploaded your data to S3! Indeed, if you were to leave your data stored in S3, you’d end up paying significantly more than the cross-AZ cost - but by deleting it immediately after transferring it, you unlock the 99% savings we were going for.</p>
<p>There are some obvious drawbacks to this method: It’s not a drop-in replacement for existing data transfer code, and it can have much higher latency than direct network connections. But if cost is your primary concern, this is an effective way of reducing costs by over 99%.</p>
<p>I really hope you find this method useful, and I think it goes to show just how far you can take cost savings in AWS - there are so many services with so much functionality and so many price points that there’s almost always room for more savings.</p>

							<h2>ChatGPT does Advent of Code 2023</h2>
<p>LLM are all the rage and people are worried that they will soon replace programmers (or, indeed, every possible office job) so I decided to do an experiment to see how well ChatGPT-4 does against Advent of Code 2023.</p>
<h2>What is Advent of Code</h2>
<p>Advent of Code (henceforth AoC) is an annual programming "event", held by <a href="https://twitter.com/ericwastl" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eric Wastl</a>, that takes place during the first 25 days of december.
Each day at midnight a problem unlocks, consisting of an input file and a description of the required solution (either a number or a sequence of letters and numbers) to be determined by processing the input file.
To solve the problem you have to submit to the website the correct solution. Once you do part 2 of the problem unlocks, usually a harder version of the problem in part 1.
You don't have to submit any code so, in theory, you could solve everything by hand, however, usually, this is intractable and writing a program to do the work for you is the only easy way to solve the problem.</p>
<p>There's also a leaderboard where participants are scored based on how fast they submitted a solution.</p>
<p>Problems start very easy on day 1 (sometimes as easy as just asking for a program that sums all numbers in the input) and progress towards more difficult ones, but they never get very hard: a CS graduate should be able to solve all problems, except maybe 1 or 2, in a couple of hours each.</p>
<h2>Prior history</h2>
<p>This isn't the first time ChatGPT (or LLMs) was used to participate in Advent of Code. In fact last year (2022) it was big news that users of ChatGPT were able, in multiple days, to reach the top of the global leaderboard.
And this was enough of a concern that Eric explicitly banned ChatGPT users from submitting solutions before the global leaderboard was full (of course he also doesn't have any way to actually enforce this ban).
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18515qh/2023_the_year_of_gpt/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Some people</a> even expected GPT-4 to finish the whole year.</p>
<p>A lot of noise was made of GPT-3.5 performance in AoC last year but the actual results were quite modest and LLM enthusiasts behaved in a very unscientific way, by boasting successes but becoming very quiet when it started to fail. In fact ChatGPT <a href="https://archive.is/BtuOG" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struggled to get through day 3 and 5 and probably couldn't solve anything after day 5</a>.</p>
<h2>Why do AoC with GPT?</h2>
<p>I think it's as close to the perfect benchmark as you can get. The problems are roughly in order of increasing difficulty so you can see where it stops being able to solve. Since almost all of the problems in any given year are solvable by a CS graduate in a couple of hours is a good benchmark for AGI. And since all of the problems are novel the solutions can't come from overfitting.</p>
<p>Also around release people tried GPT-4 on AoC 2022 and <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1635757456377917440" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found that it performed better</a> so it would be interesting to see how much of the improvement was overfitting vs actual improvement</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>I don't pay for ChatGPT Plus, I only have a paid API key so I used instead a command line client, <a href="https://github.com/marcolardera/chatgpt-cli/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chatgpt-cli</a> and manually ran the output programs.
The prompt I used for part 1 was:</p>
<pre><code>Write a python program to solve the following problem, the program should read its input from a file passed as argument on the command line:
</code></pre>
<p>followed by the copypasted text of the problem. I manually removed from the prompt all the story fluff that Eric wrote, which constitutes a small amount of help for ChatGPT. If the output had trivial syntax mistakes I fixed them manually.</p>
<p>I gave up on a solution if it didn't terminate within 15 minutes, and let ChatGPT fail 3 times before giving up. A failure constitutes either an invalid program or a program that runs to completion but returns the wrong output value.</p>
<p>If the program ran to completion with the wrong answer I used the following prompt:</p>
<pre><code>There seems to be a bug can you add some debug output to the program so we can find what the bug is?
</code></pre>
<p>If the program ran into an error I would say so and copy the error message.</p>
<p>If the first part was solved correctly the prompt for the second part would be:</p>
<pre><code>Very good, now I want you to write another python program, that still reads input from a command line argument, same input as before, and solves this additional problem:
</code></pre>
<p>I decided I would stop the experiment after 4 consecutive days where ChatGPT was unable to solve part 1.</p>
<h2>ChatGPT Plus</h2>
<p>Because I was aware of the possibility that ChatGPT Plus would be better I supplemented my experiment with two other sources. The first one is the <a href="https://youtube.com/@mzikmund" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Youtube channel of Martin Zikmund</a> (hencefort "youtuber") who did videos on how to solve the problems in C# as well as trying to solve them using ChatGPT (with a Plus account).</p>
<p>The second one was the blog of a ChatGPT enthusiast <a href="https://medium.com/@dretyr" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">"Advent of AI"</a> (henceforth enthusiast) who tried to solve the problems using ChatGPT Plus and then also wrote a blog about it using ChatGPT Plus.
Since the blog is generated by ChatGPT it's absolute shit and potentially contains hallucinations, however the <a href="https://github.com/dretyr/adventofai" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">github repo with the transcripts</a> is valuable.</p>
<p>The enthusiast turned out to be completely useless: it resorted often to babystepping ChatGPT through to the result and he stopped on day 6 anyway.</p>
<p>The youtuber was much more informative, for the most part he stuck to letting ChatGPT solve the problem on its own. However he did give it, on a few occasions, some big hints, either by debugging ChatGPT's solution for it or explaining it how to solve the problem. I have noted this in the results.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p>The perofrmance of GPT-4 this year was <em>a bit worse</em> than GPT-3.5 last year. Last year GPT-3.5 could solve 3 days on its own (1, 2 and 4) while GPT-4 this year could only solve 2 full days (2 and 4).</p>
<p>ChatGPT Plus however did <em>a bit better</em>, solving on its own 4 days (2, 4, 6 and 9). This is probably down to its ability to see the problem input (as an attachment), rather than just the problem prompt and the example input to better sytem prompts and to just being able to do more round-trips through the code interpreter (I gave up after 3~4 errors / wrong outputs).</p>
<p>One shouldn't read too much on its ability to solve day 9, the problem difficulty doesn't increase monotonically and day 9 just happened to be very easy.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Overall my subjective impression is that not much has changed, it can't solve anything that requires something more complicated than just following instructions and its bad at following instructions unless they are very simple.</p>
<p>It could be that LLMs have reached their plateau. Or maybe Q* or Bard Ultra or Grok Extra will wipe the floor next year, like GPT-4 was supposed to do this year. It's hard not to feel jaded about the hype cycle.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of observations about the performance of ChatGPT on AoC which I will report here in no particular order.</p>
<h3>Debugging / world models</h3>
<p>Most humans are incapable of solving AoC problems on the first try without making mistakes so I wouldn't expect a human-level AI to be able to do it either (if it could it would be by definition super-human).</p>
<p>Some of my prompting strategy went into the direction of trying to get ChatGPT to debug its flawed solution. I was asking it to add debug prints to figure out where the logic of the solution went wrong.</p>
<p>ChatGPT <em>never</em> did this: its debugging skills are completely non-existent. If it encounters an error it will simply rewrite entire functions, or more often the entire program, from scratch.</p>
<p>This is drastically different from what programmers.</p>
<p>This is interesting because debugging techniques aren't really taught. By and large programming textbooks teach you to program, not how to fix errors you wrote. And yet people do pick up debugging skills, implicitly.</p>
<p>ChatGPT has the same access to programming textbooks that humans have and yet it does not learn to debug. I think this points to the fact that ChatGPT hasn't really learned to program, that it doesn't have a "world model", a logical understanding of what it is doing when it's programming.</p>
<p>The bruteforce way to get ChatGPT to learn debugging I think would be to scrape hundreds of hours of programming livestreams from twitch and feed it to the training program after doing OCR on the videos and speech-to-text on the audio.
That's the only source of massive amounts of worked out debugging examples that I can think of.</p>
<h3>Difficulty</h3>
<p>Could it be that this year of AoC was just harder than last year's and that's why GPT-4 didn't do well? Maybe.</p>
<p>Difficulty is very hard to gauge objectively. There's <a href="https://aoc-stats.fastbee.box.ca/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scatter plots</a> for leaderboard fill-up time but time-to-complete isn't necessarily equivalent difficulty and the difference between this year and last year isn't big anyway (note: the scatter plots aren't to scale unfortunately).</p>
<p>My own subjective impression is also that this year (so far) was not harder.</p>
<p>The best evidence for an increase in difficulty is day 1 part 2, which contained a small trap in which both human participants and ChatGPT fell.</p>
<p>I think this points to a problem with this AIs trained with enormous amounts of training data: you can't really tell how much better they are. Ideally you would just test GPT-4 on AoC 2022, but GPT-4 training set <em>contains</em> many copies of AoC 2022's solutions so it's not really a good benchmark anymore.</p>
<p>Normally you would take out a portion of the training set to use as test set but with massive training set this is impossible, nobody knows what's in them and so nobody knows how many times each individual training example is replicated in them.</p>
<p>I wonder if OpenAI has a secret test dataset that they don't put on the internet anywhere to avoid training set contamination.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38483271#38488265" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Some people</a> have even speculated that the problems this year were deliberately formulated to foil ChatGPT, but Eric actually <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18bp8id/why_does_aoc_care_about_llms/kc646i4/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">denied that this is the case</a>.</p>
<h3>Overfitting</h3>
<p>GPT 4 is 10x larger than GPT 3.5 and it does much better on a bunch of standard tests, for example the <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/2023/04/19/gpt-4-passes-the-bar-exam-what-that-means-for-artificial-intelligence-tools-in-the-legal-industry/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bar exam</a>.</p>
<p>Why did it not do much better on AoC? If it isn't difficulty it could be overfitting. It has simply memorized the answers to a bunch of standardized tests.</p>
<p>Is this the case? My experience with AoC day 7 points towards this. The problem asks to write a custom string ordering function, the strings in questions represent hands of cards (A25JQ is ace, 2, 5 jack and queen) and the order it asks for is <em>similar</em> to Poker scoring. However it is <em>not</em> Poker.</p>
<p>This is a really simple day and I expected ChatGPT would be able to solve it without problems, since you just have to follow instructions. And yet it couldn't it was inesorably pulled towards writing a solution for Poker rather than for this problem.</p>
<p>My guess is that this is an example of overfitting in action. It's seen too many examples of poker in its training set to be able to solve this quasi-poker thing.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-77864">
	
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
		<div data-first_letter="W">
		<p>When Apple launched its M2 chip at WWDC 18 months ago, in June 2022, pretty well everyone saw it as evolutionary, significantly faster than its predecessor the M1, but offering little real change in capability. In this article, which follows on from last week’s about <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2024/01/13/how-m1-macs-may-lag-behind/">changed support for AI</a>, I take a deeper dive inside Apple silicon to discover whether the M2 is more than we thought at the time. The clues come in the instruction set supported by CPU cores inside the chips.</p>
<p>When comparing chips, emphasis is laid on performance, particularly benchmark tests that are the equivalent of sprint performance of an athlete in that they tell you how quickly the chip can run today’s tasks. If you intend keeping your Mac for longer than a year, you should also be interested in how its chip will perform when running the tasks of the future, or for our track athlete whether they’re also good enough at field events to be a good decathlete, their capability.</p>
<h4>Changes in instructions since the M1</h4>
<p>For CPUs, capability is primarily determined by the instructions they run. Today you may not be interested in whether your Mac’s chip can perform ray-tracing very quickly, but in a couple of year’s time the hardware-accelerated ray-tracing in the GPU of an M3 could make all the difference. While Apple adds plenty of its own hardware, including GPU, a neural engine, and its legendary matrix co-processor the AMX, the capability of CPU cores remains central to many of the tasks performed by its chips. Those are defined by Arm, and licensed to Apple, in its Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), documented in a manual currently well over 5,000 pages long.</p>
<p>Mercifully, Arm defines its ISA in versions. CPU cores in M1 chips use ARMv8.5-A, while those in M2 and M3 chips use ARMv8.6-A, and Arm helpfully explains their main differences in <a href="https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/architectures-and-processors-blog/posts/arm-architecture-developments-armv8-6-a" target="_blank">this list of changes</a> in ARMv8.6-A of 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li>General Matrix Multiply (AI and others)</li>
<li>bfloat16 data type and arithmetic instructions (AI and others)</li>
<li>Finer-grained traps for virtualisation (virtualisation)</li>
<li>Wait-for-event traps for virtualisation (virtualisation)</li>
<li>High precision time (1 GHz, general)</li>
<li>Extended Pointer Authentication (security).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of those, support for bfloat16 and General Matrix Multiply are likely to have the most impact on the user.</p>
<p>Although Macs based on the M1 chip weren’t released until November 2020, a year after the introduction of ARMv8.6-A, the lead time in design and development is such that there would have been no time to incorporate changes from 2019, the year after bfloat16 first appeared.</p>
<h4>bfloat16</h4>
<p>As I <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2024/01/13/how-m1-macs-may-lag-behind/">explained before</a>, we’re dealing here with three different floating-point number formats, each expressed using a <em>sign</em> (+ or -), a <em>fraction</em> whose length determines its precision, and an <em>exponent</em> that determines the overall range of numbers that can be represented in that format. Before the introduction of bfloat16, the choice for AI and some other computation came down to two formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>float32</em> (single-precision), with a range of about +/- 1.2 x 10^-38 to 3.4 x 10^38, occupying 32 bits</li>
<li><em>float16</em> (half-precision), with a range of about +/- 6.1 x 10^-5 to 65,504, occupying 16 bits.</li>
</ul>
<p>float32 has been almost universally used in AI and other applications where double-precision (float64) isn’t required.</p>
<p>bfloat16 adds to those an intermediate, with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format" target="_blank">same range as float32</a>, of about +/- 1.2 x 10^-38 to 3.4 x 10^38, but only occupying half the space, at lower precision. It’s designed for easy conversion with float32, as its sign and exponent remain unchanged, only the fraction (significand, or mantissa) has to be extended or truncated, depending on which direction you’re going in. Converting between float32 and float16 is more involved, and most importantly, as the range allowed for float16 is far smaller, numbers outside its range would lose their numeric value. That means any floating-point number larger than 65,504, which is a severe limitation for many applications.</p>
<p>A number format that is half the length of float32 numbers isn’t only important when storing large amounts of data, but has substantial effects on the performance of operations. Those are usually accelerated using ‘single instruction, multiple data’ (SIMD) techniques, where <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/08/23/code-in-arm-assembly-lanes-and-loads-in-neon/">a register is packed</a> with two or more values, and the core then executes instructions on them in parallel. In the CPU cores of M-series chips, that’s normally done using 128-bit registers, which can hold four float32 values, or eight bfloat16 values. For tasks involving thousands of arithmetic operations, packing registers with twice the number of values can almost double the throughput, as <a href="https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/ai-and-ml-blog/posts/bfloat16-processing-for-neural-networks-on-armv8_2d00_a" target="_blank">reported in tests</a> on Arm processors.</p>
<p>In applications where its reduced precision can be accepted, the bfloat16 format thus offers the same range as float32, simple and quick conversion with float32, occupies half the storage, and delivers up to double the performance in SIMD execution.</p>
<h4>But my Mac isn’t training AI models</h4>
<p>When Google’s AI researchers <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/bfloat16-the-secret-to-high-performance-on-cloud-tpus" target="_blank">first made the claim</a> that bfloat16 is “the secret to high performance”, they were of course referring to those developing AI models, rather than ordinary users. That article was published in August 2019, less than a year before Apple announced the M1, explaining why none of the hardware in the M1 could have supported bfloat16, and that support wasn’t added by Arm until ARMv8.6-A.</p>
<p>Both Arm and Apple recognise the importance of performing as much AI training as possible in-device rather than in the cloud. The case for this has been <a href="https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/architectures-and-processors-blog/posts/ai-vs-ml-whats-the-difference" target="_blank">argued eloquently by Hellen Norman</a> of Arm, independently of Apple.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take much imagination to come up with local training tasks that could improve commonplace features in macOS. Many of us disable spell-checking because of its seeming inability to recognise when we should be using similar words like <em>their, there</em> and <em>they’re.</em> Wouldn’t it be so much better if suggested corrections were based on grammar, usage and context? While that’s already starting to improve, and Sonoma’s auto-completion is getting smarter, there’s ample room for improvement. That depends in part at least on your Mac learning your writing style using in-device training.</p>
<p>At the start of this article, I explained how this isn’t about the performance of current tasks, but the capability to accomplish the tasks our apps and macOS will be doing in the future, when some of those will involve the sort of training that’s currently left to specialised or dedicated systems.</p>
<p>CPU cores aren’t the only hardware in Apple silicon to support AI: depending on the task, macOS may use their GPU, Apple’s specialised neural engine, or its legendary AMX. Given the fact that those in the M1 were designed and developed over the same timescale as the CPU cores, it seems improbable that they would have bfloat16 support, and Apple has only just <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders/mpsdatatype/bfloat16?changes=l_8_6" target="_blank">added that number type</a> to Metal Performance Shaders in Sonoma.</p>
<h4>Does my Mac support it?</h4>
<p>If you’re unconvinced whether your Apple silicon Mac supports bfloat16 in its CPU cores, then there’s an easy way to check. In Terminal, run the command<br>
<code>sysctl -A &gt; ~/Documents/sysctloutput.text</code><br>
where the last path is a new text file to take the output from the command.</p>
<p>If that file contains the line<br>
<code>hw.optional.arm.FEAT_BF16: 1</code><br>
then its cores have hardware support for bfloat16. If the number given is 0, then I’m afraid they don’t. Apple provides information to decode most of the <code>hw.optional.arm</code> features <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1387446-sysctlbyname/determining_instruction_set_characteristics" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Not having bfloat16 support in hardware isn’t the end of the world, nor does it mean your M1 Mac is already obsolete. What it does mean, though, is that as more and heavier AI is rolled out in the coming years, some of those features will run noticeably more slowly on it. Spare a thought, though, for Intel Macs, for no matter how fast their CPUs might be, or how many cores they have, they will never have any equivalent hardware support for AI.</p>

<p>After a rough couple of years where all models of Raspberry Pi (except the Pico microcontroller) were in short supply, it's now relatively easy to find most SKUs in stock. However, the new Raspberry Pi 5 can still be a slight challenge; at press time, it was sold out at the authorized U.S. retailers but in stock at the UK outlets.&nbsp;</p><p>That's all about to change as Raspberry Pi Ltd is currently producing 70,000 Raspberry Pi 5 boards a week with plans to scale up to as many as 90,000 units per week in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p>Raspberry Pi CEO Eben Upton shared the promising news with us, along with the picture above, which he says he took during a recent factory visit. It shows dozens of panels filled with completed Raspberry Pi 5 boards that are about to be tested and packed for shipping.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<time datetime="2024-01-10">2024-01-10</time>
<p>This post is an anecdote from over a decade ago, of which I lost the actual
code. So please forgive me if I do not accurately remember all the details. Some
details are also simplified so that anyone that likes computer security can
enjoy this article, not just those who have played World of Warcraft (although
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram">Venn diagram</a> of those two
groups likely has a solid overlap).</p>
<p>When I was around 14 years old I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft">World of
Warcraft</a> developed by Blizzard
Games and was immediately hooked. Not long after I discovered add-ons which allow
you to modify how your game’s user interface looks and works. However, not all
add-ons I downloaded did exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted more. So I went to
find out how they were made.</p>
<p>In a weird twist of fate, I blame World of Warcraft for me seriously picking up
programming. It turned out that they were made in the
<a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> programming language. Add-ons were nothing more than
a couple <code>.lua</code> source files in a folder directly loaded into the game. The
barrier of entry was incredibly low: just edit a file, press save and reload the
interface. The fact that the game loaded <em>your</em> source code and you could see it
running was magical!</p>
<p>I enjoyed it immensely and in no time I was only writing add-ons and was barely playing
the game itself anymore. I published <a href="https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/author-207710.html">quite a few
add-ons</a> in the next
two years, which mostly involved copying other people’s code with some
refactoring / recombining / tweaking to my wishes.</p>
<h2 id="add-on-security"><a href="#add-on-security" aria-label="Anchor link for: add-on-security">Add-on security</a></h2>
<p>A thought you might have is that it’s a really bad idea to let users have fully
programmable add-ons in your game, lest you get bots. However, the system
Blizzard made to prevent arbitrary programmable actions was quite clever.
Naturally, it did nothing to prevent actual botting, but at least
regular rule-abiding players were fundamentally restricted to the automation
Blizzard allowed.</p>
<p>Most UI elements that you could create were strictly decorative or
informational. These were completely unrestricted, as were most APIs that
strictly gather information. For example you can make a health bar display
using two frames, a background and a foreground, sizing the foreground
frame using an API call to get the health of your character.</p>
<p>Not all API calls were available to you however. Some were protected so they
could only be called from official Blizzard code. These typically involved
the API calls that would move your character, cast spells, use items, etc.
Generally speaking anything that actually makes you perform an in-game action
was protected.</p>

<p>However, some UI elements needed to actually interact with the game itself, e.g.
if I want to make a button that casts a certain spell. For this you could
construct a special kind of button that executes code in a secure environment
when clicked. You were only allowed to create/destroy/move such buttons when not
in combat, so you couldn’t simply conditionally place such buttons underneath
your cursor to automate actions during combat.</p>
<p>The catch was that this <a href="https://wowwiki-archive.fandom.com/wiki/RestrictedEnvironment">secure
environment</a>
<em>did</em> allow you to programmatically set which spell to cast, but doesn’t
let you gather the information you would need to do arbitrary automation. All
access to state from outside the secure environment was blocked. There were
some information gathering API calls available to match the more accessible
in-game macro system, but nothing as fancy as getting skill cooldowns or
unit health which would enable automatic optimal spellcasting. </p>
<p>So there were two environments: an insecure one where you can get all
information but can’t act on it, and a secure one where you can act but can’t
get the information needed for automation.</p>
<h2 id="a-backdoor-channel"><a href="#a-backdoor-channel" aria-label="Anchor link for: a-backdoor-channel">A backdoor channel</a></h2>
<p>Fast forward a couple years and I had mostly stopped playing. My interests had
mainly moved on to more “serious” programming, and I was only occasionally
playing, mostly messing around with add-on ideas. But this secure environment kept
on nagging in my brain; I wanted to break it.</p>
<p>Of course there was third-party
software that completely disables the security restrictions from Blizzard, but
what’s the fun in that? I wanted to do it “legitimately”, using the technically
allowed tools, as a challenge.</p>

<p>So I scanned the secure environment allowed function list to see if I could smuggle any
information from the outside into the secure environment. It all seemed pretty
hopeless until I saw one tiny, innocent little function: <code>random</code>.</p>
<p>An evil idea came in my head: random number generators (RNGs) used in computers are almost
always <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">pseudorandom number generators</a>
with (hidden) internal state. If I can manipulate this state, perhaps I can use
that to pass information into the secure environment.</p>
<h2 id="random-number-generator-woes"><a href="#random-number-generator-woes" aria-label="Anchor link for: random-number-generator-woes">Random number generator woes</a></h2>
<p>It turned out that <code>random</code> was just a small shim around C’s
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/numeric/random/rand"><code>rand</code></a>. I was excited! 
This meant that there was a single global random state that was shared in the
process. It also helps that <code>rand</code> implementations tended to be on the weak side.
Since World
of Warcraft was compiled with MSVC, the actual implementation of <code>rand</code> was as follows:</p>
<pre data-lang="c"><code data-lang="c"><span>uint32_t state;
</span><span>
</span><span>int </span><span>rand() {
</span><span>    state = state * </span><span>214013 </span><span>+ </span><span>2531011</span><span>;
</span><span>    </span><span>return </span><span>(state &gt;&gt; </span><span>16</span><span>) &amp; </span><span>0x7fff</span><span>;
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This RNG is, for the lack of a better word, shite. It is
a naked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">linear congruential generator</a>,
and a weak one at that. Which in my case, was a good thing.</p>

<p>So let’s get to breaking this thing. Since the state is so laughably small
and you can see 15 bits of the state directly you can keep a full list of
all possible states consistent with a single output of the RNG and use
further calls to the RNG to eliminate possibilities until a
single one remains. But we can be significantly more clever.</p>
<p>First we note that the top bit of <code>state</code> never affects anything in this RNG.
<code>(state &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0x7fff</code> masks out 15 bits, after shifting away the bottom 16
bits, and thus effectively works mod $2^{31}$. Since on any update the new state
is a linear function of the previous state, we can propagate this modular form
all the way down to the initial state as $$f(x) \equiv f(x \bmod m) \mod m$$ for
any linear $f$.</p>
<p>Let $a = 214013$ and $b = 2531011$. We observe the 15-bit output $r_0, r_1$ of
two RNG calls. We’ll call the 16-bit portion of the RNG state that is hidden by
the shift $h_0, h_1$ respectively, for the states after the first and second
call. This means the state of the RNG after the first call is $2^{16} r_0 + h_0$
and similarly for $2^{16} r_1 + h_1$ after the second call. Then we have the following identity:</p>
<p>$$a\cdot (2^{16}r_0 + h_0) + b \equiv 2^{16}r_1 + h_1 \mod 2^{31},$$</p>
<p>$$ah_0 \equiv h_1 + 2^{16}(r_1 - ar_0) - b \mod 2^{31}.$$</p>
<p>Now let $c \geq 0$ be the known constant $(2^{16}(r_1 - ar_0) - b) \bmod 2^{31}$, then
for some integer $k$ we have</p>
<p>$$ah_0 = h_1 + c + 2^{31} k.$$</p>
<p>Note that the left hand side ranges from $0$ to $a (2^{16} - 1) \approx 2^{33.71}$.
Thus we must have $-1 \leq k \leq 2^{2.71} &lt; 7$. Reordering we get the following
expression for $h_0$:
$$h_0 = \frac{c + 2^{31} k}{a} + h_1/a.$$
Since $a &gt; 2^{16}$ while $0 \leq h_1 &lt; 2^{16}$ we note that the term $0 \leq h_1/a &lt; 1$.
Thus, assuming a solution exists, we must have
$$h_0 = \left\lceil\frac{c + 2^{31} k}{a}\right\rceil.$$</p>
<p>So for $-1 \leq k &lt; 7$ we compute the above guess for the hidden portion of
the RNG state after the first call. This gives us 8 guesses, after which we can
reject bad guesses using follow-up calls to the RNG until a single unique answer remains.</p>

<p>An example implementation of this process in Python:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>import </span><span>random
</span><span>
</span><span>A = </span><span>214013
</span><span>B = </span><span>2531011
</span><span>
</span><span>class </span><span>MsvcRng:
</span><span>    </span><span>def </span><span>__init__(self, state):
</span><span>        self.state = state
</span><span>        
</span><span>    </span><span>def </span><span>__call__(self):
</span><span>        self.state = (self.state * A + B) % </span><span>2</span><span>**</span><span>32
</span><span>        </span><span>return </span><span>(self.state &gt;&gt; </span><span>16</span><span>) &amp; </span><span>0x7fff
</span><span>
</span><span># Create a random RNG state we'll reverse engineer.
</span><span>hidden_rng = MsvcRng(random.randint(</span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>2</span><span>**</span><span>32</span><span>))

<p>While I did write the above process with a <code>while</code> loop, it appears to only ever
need a third output at most to narrow it down to a single guess.</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-together"><a href="#putting-it-together" aria-label="Anchor link for: putting-it-together">Putting it together</a></h2>
<p>Once we could reverse-engineer the internal state of the random number
generator we could make arbitrary automated decisions in the supposedly secure
environment. How it worked was as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An insecure hook was registered that would execute right before the secure
environment code would run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this hook we have full access to information, and make a decision as to
which action should be taken (e.g. casting a particular spell). This action
is looked up in a hardcoded list to get an index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current state of the RNG is reverse-engineered using the above process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We predict the outcome of the next RNG call. If this (modulo the length
of our action list) does not give our desired outcome, we advance the RNG and
try again. This repeats until the next random number would correspond to our
desired action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hook returns, and the secure environment starts. It generates a “random”
number, indexes our hardcoded list of actions, and performs the “random” action.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s all! By being able to simulate the RNG and looking one step ahead we could
use it as our information channel by choosing exactly the right moment to call
<code>random</code> in the secure environment. Now if you wanted to support a list of $n$
actions it would on average take $n$ steps of the RNG before the correct
number came up to pass along, but that wasn’t a problem in practice.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>I don’t know when Blizzard fixed the issue where the RNG state is so weak and
shared, or whether they were aware of it being an issue at all. A few years
after I had written the code I tried it again out of curiosity, and it had
stopped working. Maybe they switched to a different algorithm,
or had a properly separated RNG state for the secure environment.</p>
<p>All-in-all it was a lot of effort for a niche exploit in a video game that I
didn’t even want to use. But there certainly was a magic to manipulating
something supposedly random into doing exactly what you want, like a magician
pulling four aces from a shuffled deck.</p>

According to Tom Bennett, who led the design of the 6800:</p><blockquote><p>Chuck Peddle and John Buchanan wired up and put together and programmed it. And all it did was say: “Hi, John” or “Hi, Bob,” …</p></blockquote><p>Bob was Bob Galvin, Motorola’s Chief Executive, son of the company's founder.</p><p>Galvin, seeing the potential of the 6800, and concerned that it might replace Motorola’s other products, asked the team:</p><blockquote><p>You understand that you’re putting our customer’s chip -- or system -- on one of these little boards? What’s that gonna do to my other products?</p></blockquote><p>The 6800 wasn’t available in volume at the time of its announcement, but samples were soon sent to prospective users. By June 1974 key potential customers, such as Hewlett Packard, had prototype systems built around the 6800.</p><p>With the launch of the 6800, Motorola didn't just have a promising product. It also had a talented and innovative team in Phoenix. Along with Tom Bennett, the team included Bill Mensch, Bill Lattin, Rod Orgill and Chuck Peddle, each of whom would go on to have highly distinguished careers.</p><p>Everything was looking good for Motorola’s nascent microprocessor business. But then, in early 1974, not long after the 6800 was announced, Motorola’s management decided to move the team to Texas.</p><p><strong><span>… I think his intention was to raid Motorola for engineers.</span><br></strong><span>Bill Mensch on Chuck Peddle’s plans when he joined Motorola</span></p><p>The growth of Motorola’s semiconductor business in the early 1970s meant that the firm needed to expand its manufacturing capabilities. Austin, Texas was chosen as a new site and management decided to move the 6800 team there.</p><p>Bill Lattin started to travel to Austin to prepare for the move, whilst becoming increasingly concerned about the disruption it would cause. The semiconductor industry was about to enter recession and Motorola’s semiconductor business was losing millions of dollars. The company would shortly lay off thousands of staff. Lattin later recalled that he told Motorola’s management:</p><blockquote><p>Listen, you know, conditions are worsening in the environment here, and this is our last time to call off this move. I don’t want to get half-way down to Austin and have this thing blow up on me.</p></blockquote><p>He extracted a promise from his manager that engineers who made the move to Austin would be secure in their jobs. The move went ahead in the middle of 1975, shortly after the 6800 had entered volume production at the end of 1974. Then, Lattin’s boss lost his own job and his replacement started to demand job cuts in the 6800 team. It was too much, and soon Lattin took up the long-standing offer from his former teacher Andy Grove to join him at Intel.</p><p>Other key members of the 6800 team, including Tom Bennett, declined to move to Austin, and instead moved to other business units within Motorola.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89b2bc87-6aba-497e-86f3-8b51207301f3_1278x1276.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89b2bc87-6aba-497e-86f3-8b51207301f3_1278x1276.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89b2bc87-6aba-497e-86f3-8b51207301f3_1278x1276.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89b2bc87-6aba-497e-86f3-8b51207301f3_1278x1276.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89b2bc87-6aba-497e-86f3-8b51207301f3_1278x1276.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89b2bc87-6aba-497e-86f3-8b51207301f3_1278x1276.png" width="1278" height="1276" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/89b2bc87-6aba-497e-86f3-8b51207301f3_1278x1276.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1276,&quot;width&quot;:1278,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1609814,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89b2bc87-6aba-497e-86f3-8b51207301f3_1278x1276.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89b2bc87-6aba-497e-86f3-8b51207301f3_1278x1276.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89b2bc87-6aba-497e-86f3-8b51207301f3_1278x1276.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89b2bc87-6aba-497e-86f3-8b51207301f3_1278x1276.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Chuck Peddle - from Byte magazine in 1982</figcaption></figure></div><p>And, possibly most damaging of all for Motorola, the move to Austin had already prompted some of the team, including Rod Orgill and Bill Mensch, to leave and start work on the design of a competitor. It was Chuck Peddle, who had joined the 6800 team later in its development, who was the driving force behind the move. Mensch has said that when Peddle joined Motorola “… his intention was to raid Motorola for engineers.”</p><p>One can sense Peddle’s discontent at Motorola. In the book ‘Commodore: A Company on the Edge’, Peddle is less than flattering about the 6800:</p><blockquote><p>They kind of muddled their way through the architecture of the 6800, which had some flaws in it. … I was able to fix some of those flaws, but it was too late for others.</p></blockquote><p>However, when Peddle presented the 6800 and its family to customers, the biggest concern wasn’t the 6800’s architecture, but its price. The 6800 processor was launched with a price of $360, closely matching the price of the latest 8-bit Intel processor, the 8080. Peddle later recalled that in his presentations:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The guys would sit down, we would explain the 6800, and they would … fall in love …</p></blockquote><p>But this was followed by complaints about the price. Customers would say:</p><blockquote><p>You're charging too much for it. What I want to use it for is not to replace a minicomputer. I want to use it to replace a controller, but at $300 per device it's not cost-effective.</p></blockquote><p><span>Peddle started to push Motorola’s management to produce a low-cost version of the 6800</span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-139425274" href="https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/leaving-arizona#footnote-1-139425274" target="_self" rel="">1</a><span>. For simple control applications, the competition was either a custom design or Intel’s 4-bit 4040 processor. The 4040 cost around $29, so Peddle set a target of $20 for a low-cost version of the 6800. After months of trying to get Motorola’s management to adopt his proposal, he was instructed, in writing, to stop pursuing the idea. His response was a letter to Motorola’s management, stating that, in Peddle’s words:</span></p><blockquote><p>This is product abandonment, therefore I am going to pursue this idea on my own. You don't have any rights to it because this letter says you don't want it.</p></blockquote><p>But there was a reason the 6800 was expensive. It was made using ‘contact lithography’, where the photomask, containing the image that is to created on the silicon die, comes into direct contact with the silicon wafer. This inevitably led, over time, to damage to the photomask, reducing yields and eventually rendering the expensive photomask unusable. Making a low-cost version of the 6800 would be impossible without a more cost-effective manufacturing process.</p><p>Peddle was determined to pursue his idea and, whilst still at Motorola, started to talk to a number of other firms about making it a reality. According to Peddle:</p><blockquote><p>And the guy I went to build first was L.J. Sevin at Mostek. And L.J.’s comment to me much later was, “I didn't do the deal because I was afraid Motorola was going to sue you, and I didn't want to deal with Motorola”.</p></blockquote><p>Eventually, he made contact with John Paivinen whose company, MOS Technology, based in Pennsylvania, was already building complex calculator chips. Peddle’s vision appealed to Paivinen, but there was one problem. His firm was using a PMOS fabrication process and didn’t have a working NMOS process, that would be needed for the new processor. However, Paivinen convinced Peddle that his firm could have NMOS in production in the year or so it would take Peddle and colleagues to design a new processor.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c2e6f31-998e-4c55-8063-3e7a89b308eb_1934x878.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c2e6f31-998e-4c55-8063-3e7a89b308eb_1934x878.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c2e6f31-998e-4c55-8063-3e7a89b308eb_1934x878.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c2e6f31-998e-4c55-8063-3e7a89b308eb_1934x878.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c2e6f31-998e-4c55-8063-3e7a89b308eb_1934x878.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c2e6f31-998e-4c55-8063-3e7a89b308eb_1934x878.jpeg" width="1200" height="544.7802197802198" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2c2e6f31-998e-4c55-8063-3e7a89b308eb_1934x878.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:661,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:119977,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c2e6f31-998e-4c55-8063-3e7a89b308eb_1934x878.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c2e6f31-998e-4c55-8063-3e7a89b308eb_1934x878.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c2e6f31-998e-4c55-8063-3e7a89b308eb_1934x878.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c2e6f31-998e-4c55-8063-3e7a89b308eb_1934x878.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>An image of MOS Technology’s Valley Forge base from an early advertisement.</figcaption></figure></div><p>So, in August 1974, Peddle, Orgill, Mensch and five other members of the 6800 team, travelled to MOS Technology’s Valley Forge offices. According to Peddle, “I was able to scoop up the best people from the Motorola design team.” </p><p>There they started making the idea of a low-cost 8-bit microprocessor a reality.</p><p>The 6800 had been announced in April 1974 but Motorola’a shift from PMOS to a new NMOS process proved problematic and it wasn't until November that it was in volume production, giving Intel’s 8080 a clear six-month lead.</p><p>The 6800 team hadn’t been working to make a competitor to the minicomputer. The target was devices such as ‘dumb’ ‘Cathode Ray Tube’ terminals, used to connect to ‘real’ mini and mainframe computers. An early proposal for a more advanced 16-bit processor design, that would have been competitive with minis, had quickly been rejected as impractical.</p><p>But the availability of the Intel 8080 in 1974 had enabled the creation of the Altair 8800, the first commercially successful ‘personal computer’. Launched in January 1975, the Altair 8800 was the machine for which Bill Gates would write Microsoft’s first product, a BASIC language interpreter.</p><p>The later availability of the 6800 in production meant that the first 6800-based personal computers trailed the Altair 8800, but they still made an impact. Leading the way was the South West Technical Products SWTPC 6800, launched at the end of 1975. The SWTPC provided a 6800 card plugged into a printed circuit board ‘backpane’ and connected to a range of peripheral cards via the SWTPC’s SS-50 bus. Cards to support floppy disk drives, video displays and other peripherals were soon available.</p><p>The Altair and the SWTPC machines may seem primitive now, but their low cost - the SWTPC 6800 was launched with a starting price of $450 - their relative ease of use, and the flexibility of being able to add new peripherals, were revolutionary. Motorola may have been a little late in delivering the 6800 but at the end of 1975, they had a promising foothold in the new personal computer market.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d0492be-fb33-4704-b3a6-aae4bc9aaba5_2409x3223.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d0492be-fb33-4704-b3a6-aae4bc9aaba5_2409x3223.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d0492be-fb33-4704-b3a6-aae4bc9aaba5_2409x3223.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d0492be-fb33-4704-b3a6-aae4bc9aaba5_2409x3223.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d0492be-fb33-4704-b3a6-aae4bc9aaba5_2409x3223.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d0492be-fb33-4704-b3a6-aae4bc9aaba5_2409x3223.jpeg" width="1456" height="1948" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7d0492be-fb33-4704-b3a6-aae4bc9aaba5_2409x3223.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1948,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:539675,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d0492be-fb33-4704-b3a6-aae4bc9aaba5_2409x3223.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d0492be-fb33-4704-b3a6-aae4bc9aaba5_2409x3223.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d0492be-fb33-4704-b3a6-aae4bc9aaba5_2409x3223.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d0492be-fb33-4704-b3a6-aae4bc9aaba5_2409x3223.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Meanwhile, Peddle and seven of the Motorola engineers had travelled across the country to Valley Forge in Pennsylvania, arriving at MOS Technology’s offices on 19 August 1974. Their arrival wasn't welcomed by all at their new employer and Mensch has recalled how he once found nails in the tyres of his car parked outside the office, which he attributed to a resentful MOS Technology engineer. One of those engineers has recalled that he thought Peddle could be ‘a bit pompous’ but that ‘he’d had a vision and was pushing that vision. Peddle was the visionary’.</p><p>Just a year after they had made the move to Pennsylvania, Peddle, Orgill, Mensch and their colleagues had created several new low-cost 8-bit processors. The key designs were the MOS Technology 6501 and 6502, with the 6503, 6504, 6505 and 6507 as cheaper versions in 28-pin (rather than 40 pin) packages with reduced address spaces.</p><p>To create these new microprocessors the engineers had needed to work exceptionally long hours, with cots installed in some of the offices so that they could take naps before returning to work. The microprocessor’s circuits were drawn on paper by hand in a repetitive and error prone process. When the team discovered that one of their designs was too big they had to rework it, circuit by circuit, reclaiming small amounts of space on the die.</p><p>There have been competing claims about who should get the credit for the layout of the 6502. It’s often been attributed to Bill Mensch, and Chuck Peddle has paid tribute to Mensch’s work:</p><blockquote><p>“He built seven different chips without ever having an error, almost all done by hand. When I tell people that, they don't believe me, but it's true. This guy is a unique person. He is the best layout guy in the world.” </p></blockquote><p><span>However another member of the team, Harry Bawcom, has disputed this claim</span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-139425274" href="https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/leaving-arizona#footnote-2-139425274" target="_self" rel="">2</a></p><blockquote><p>“Bill Mensch did not layout the 6502, I did, with the help of two others.</p><p>In truth we all worked as a team but Bill didn't draw a single line on the first version of the 6502. My initials were on the die. … There were two other circuit designers involved, one senior to Bill. They deserve credit, too.”</p></blockquote><p>Equally important, although less well publicised, was the effort of the MOS Technology process engineers to develop a working NMOS process and to move away from contact lithography. As Paivinen had promised, they had a working NMOS process ready in time to make the new microprocessor designs.</p><p>One of the key features of the 6501 was that it could be plugged into the same socket on the printed circuit board as the 6800. According to one colleague:</p><blockquote><p>Chuck sold the concept that Motorola will be out there building all these boards that will use the 6800 and we’re going to come along with. a cost reduced microprocessor to replace it pin for pin.</p></blockquote><p>And customers could immediately use the hardware ecosystem that Motorola had already designed for the 6800 as the starting point for a 6501-based system, ‘jump starting’ their 6501/2 development.</p><p>The 6502 would run the same code as the 6501 but was not ‘pin-compatible’ with the 6800. However, it was simpler to integrate into systems, needing only a single clock signal, compared to the two clocks that were needed for both the 6501 and 6800.</p><p>If we put the dies (dice) of the 6800 and the 6502 side by side then the similarities between the two designs become clear. Both designs have a ‘Programmable Logic Array’ ‘control ROM’ at the top, control logic in the middle and registers and arithmetic and logic circuitry in the bottom half of the die.</p><figure data-drag-handle="" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F272c660f-78ab-424a-aa2e-ab5e4062acd7_1024x986.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F272c660f-78ab-424a-aa2e-ab5e4062acd7_1024x986.jpeg 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F272c660f-78ab-424a-aa2e-ab5e4062acd7_1024x986.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F272c660f-78ab-424a-aa2e-ab5e4062acd7_1024x986.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F272c660f-78ab-424a-aa2e-ab5e4062acd7_1024x986.jpeg 720w" width="720"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F216f5b5c-73b1-4ac0-865b-957f28215830_921x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F216f5b5c-73b1-4ac0-865b-957f28215830_921x1024.jpeg 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F216f5b5c-73b1-4ac0-865b-957f28215830_921x1024.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F216f5b5c-73b1-4ac0-865b-957f28215830_921x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F216f5b5c-73b1-4ac0-865b-957f28215830_921x1024.jpeg 720w" width="720"></picture></div><figcaption>Separated at birth? 6800 vs 6502 die shots</figcaption></div></figure><p>Under the surface, though, the two designs were very different. The 6501/2 were each smaller, needing just 3,500 transistors, compared to 4,100 for the 6800.</p><p>The 6501/2 would both be fabricated using an NMOS, depletion-load process whereas the 6800 had been designed to use a less advanced process. And MOS Technology pioneered the move away from using contact lithography, removing the need to create expensive new masks on a regular basis. </p><p>And the 6501 and 6502 would not be code-compatible with the 6800. Economies had needed to be made in the new designs to keep the transistor count down. The 16-bit ‘stack pointer’ in the 6800 was reduced to 8-bits, which would always point into page 1 (hexadecimal addresses 0100 to 01FF) in memory. The 6800’s two 8-bit accumulators, ‘A’ and ‘B’, were replaced by a single ‘A’ accumulator. Room was found, though, for two 8-bit index registers ‘X’ and ‘Y’, replacing the single 16-bit index register in the 6800.</p><p><span>The team found a number of other ways of simplifying the designs. The first version of the 6800 had measured 29.0 mm^2. The 6502 was only 16.6mm^2. So almost twice as many 6502s could be extracted from a silicon wafer when compared to the 6800. Crucially too, the smaller die size and the move away from contact lithography meant that yields, which had been a major problem for Motorola, would be significantly higher too. According to Mensch their design “yielded 10 times as many good chips as the competition.”</span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-139425274" href="https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/leaving-arizona#footnote-3-139425274" target="_self" rel="">3</a><span> The 6502 would be much, much cheaper to make than the 6800.</span></p><p>This lower cost had been achieved without sacrificing performance. Let’s look at one key example of how this was achieved.</p><p>The static RAM cells needed to create registers on the CPU were expensive in terms of die area. This meant that the teams designing both the 6800 and the 6502, were both restricted in the number of registers they could afford to include. As a result, both chips would need to load and store values from memory more often than a competitor like the Intel 8080, which had many more registers. So, both the 6800 and the 6502 had two-byte instructions that would store the value in an accumulator to a specified location in page zero (hexadecimal addresses 0000 to 00FF) in memory. For both processors, this would execute in three clock cycles.</p><p>But the 6502 went much further in making use of page zero. It added instructions that would add two bytes from page zero to the Y register to form the address to be used in a load, store, arithmetic or logic operations.

Even better, other instructions offer arithmetic and logical operations that use the same addressing mode for no extra clock cycles when compared to a simple ‘load’.  These instructions read two bytes from memory, add Y to those two bytes to form a memory address, then read a further byte from memory and perform an arithmetic operation using that byte. All this can happen in just five clock cycles.</span></p><p>Some commentators have described the 6502 as a sort of early 8-bit RISC ‘Reduced Instruction Set Computer’ processor. In fact, in many respects, the 6502 was quite the opposite of a RISC design.  Some common instructions were quite complex, with multiple memory reads and calculations.</p><p>Quoting Bill Mensch:</p><blockquote><p><span>And we figured out how to have addressable registers by using zero page [the first 256 bytes in RAM]. So you can have one byte for the op code and one byte for the address, and [the code is compact and fast]. There are limitations, but compared to other processors, zero page was a big deal.</span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-139425274" href="https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/leaving-arizona#footnote-6-139425274" target="_self" rel="">6</a></p></blockquote><p>In effect the 6502’s ‘page zero’ in memory provides a large number of ‘pseudo’ 8 and 16-bit registers, slower than real registers, but still faster and more versatile than having to use other parts of memory. A skilled programmer making effective use of ‘page zero’ could write code that was fast when compared to other 8-bit designs.</p><p>This probably wasn’t obvious to many early users though, who might simply have compared the number of registers with a 6800 or an Intel 8080 and found the 6502 lacking. So an early MOS Technology brochure felt the need to explain the decision to reduce the number of registers when compared to the 6800.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Comparing your part to the M6800, why did you cut the stack back to one page and why did you cut out accumulator B, etc.?</strong></p><p>Although the MCS6501 is a direct plug replacement for the Motorola 6800, no real attempt was made to maintain exact software compatibility with the 6800 because of our desire to have significantly greater addressing flexibility and to allow for upward expansion in the product family. Our primary objective was to develop a low-cost processor-and all other decisions were made on that basis.</p><p>We think that you will find that the use of the second index register more than compensates for the loss of the second accumulator and the eight-bit stack pointer helped us to reduce the cost of the chip. Because of the significantly greater addressing power, one does not need to use the stack for other than hardware and subroutine processing. As a result, a one-page long stack should be more than adequate.</p></blockquote><p>The same brochure proclaimed the performance of the new designs:</p><blockquote><p><strong>What is the performance of the MCS6501?</strong></p><p>The claim that the MCS6501 beats all other competitive eight-bit microprocessors is substantiated in two areas.</p><p>First, utilizing the A H Systems benchmarks (the only set of benchmarks currently available from an independent consultant), we outperform all other standard products indicated in all but one case. Second, although recently several of our competitors have offered premium higher frequency products that may allow them to equal or outperform our processors, we will be announcing higher-speed microprocessors that will maintain or improve our current performance edge.</p></blockquote><p><strong>With lower-priced and faster designs, Peddle had what he wanted to fulfil his vision.

Forbidden by the conference organisers from selling the chips on the conference floor, Peddle set himself up in a hotel room across the road. As visitors crowded the MOS Technology booth at the show, they were directed to the hotel if they wanted to buy a CPU. A steady stream of conference delegates crossed the road and made their way to the hotel room to hand over their dollars in return for one of the new CPUs.</p><p>In the hotel room Peddle’s wife Shirley had a glass jar full of 6502’s and would extract one to give to anyone who handed over their $25. However, there was an element of subterfuge in the use of the glass jars. Peddle wanted to indicate to visitors that they had a plentiful supply of the new chips. But according to Peddle:</p><blockquote><p>Only half of the jar worked… we knew that the ones at the bottom of the jar didn't work, but it didn't matter. We had to make the jar look full.</p></blockquote><p>Word spread quickly beyond WESCON. Within a few days, Peddle had signed up Atari to buy a cost reduced version of the 6502, the 6507, together with RAM, ROM and I/O chips for use in a video game console. The price? An astonishing $12 for each chipset. The console would be the groundbreaking Atari 2600, which went on to sell 30 million units.</p><p>The third edition of Byte magazine, dated November 1975, featured the new MOS Technology CPU on its front cover with the headline “A $20 Microprocessor”. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af3f0c9-4244-440f-b60a-ac42cf131a8d_1118x328.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af3f0c9-4244-440f-b60a-ac42cf131a8d_1118x328.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af3f0c9-4244-440f-b60a-ac42cf131a8d_1118x328.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af3f0c9-4244-440f-b60a-ac42cf131a8d_1118x328.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af3f0c9-4244-440f-b60a-ac42cf131a8d_1118x328.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af3f0c9-4244-440f-b60a-ac42cf131a8d_1118x328.png" width="1118" height="328" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2af3f0c9-4244-440f-b60a-ac42cf131a8d_1118x328.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:328,&quot;width&quot;:1118,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:86639,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af3f0c9-4244-440f-b60a-ac42cf131a8d_1118x328.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af3f0c9-4244-440f-b60a-ac42cf131a8d_1118x328.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af3f0c9-4244-440f-b60a-ac42cf131a8d_1118x328.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2af3f0c9-4244-440f-b60a-ac42cf131a8d_1118x328.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The article itself, which must have infuriated Motorola, was titled ‘Son of Motorola (or, the $20 CPU Chip)”.

They reduced the price of the 6800, from $175 to $69. And, fulfilling L.J. Sevin’s prophecy, they sued MOS Technology. Microcomputer Digest reported in December 1975 that:</p><blockquote><p>Motorola is seeking an injunction against MOS Technology to halt the manufacture, marketing and filling of orders for MCS 6500 microprocessor products. The injunction action is intended to stop MOS Technology from further 6500 activities until the outcome of a pending trial of a suit filed in Federal Court in Philadelphia PA by Motorola. As of yet, the injunction attempts have been unsuccessful. Motorola, citing several Motorola patents that led to the development of its own MC6800 microprocessor, alleges that seven former employees of Motorola (Charles J. Peddle, Rodney H. Orgill, William D. Mensch, Wilbur L. Mattys, Terry N. Holdt, Ernie B. Hirt, and Harry E. Bawcom) left Motorola and joined MOS Technology in similar posts and helped establish that firm's line of MCS6500 microprocessors. The suit seeks triple damages plus all profits MOS Technology has made on the 6500 product line. MOS Technology has denied the allegations and stated that Motorola's claims are unfounded.</p></blockquote><p>In reality, although the MOS Technology team had used their experience with the 6800 when designing the 6501/2, there was very little technology used in the new designs that Motorola could claim as their own. The fabrication process and the instruction sets were both fundamentally different. The only significant thing that they shared with the 6800 was the pin layout of the 6501.</p><p>The financial and legal resources available to Motorola, though, dwarfed those of the much smaller MOS Technology, which was running out of cash. So MOS Technology settled, dropped the 6501, paid $200,000 in damages and returned some documentation that the engineers had taken with them from Motorola. The two companies also cross licensed patents.</p><p>There is a difference of opinion in the MOS Technology team about their original intentions around the 6501. Rod Orgill, who led its design, bet Mensch, who led the 6502’s design, that the 6501 would outsell the 6502. Peddle maintained that it was always intended to give Motorola a target to aim for which could be given up when they sued. In any event, the 6501 was designed, built and featured in early documentation and advertisements, but was never sold to customers.</p><p>The 6502 remained on sale though. By the end of 1975, MOS Technology had a new and more financially stable owner in the shape of Commodore. With the lawsuit settled and MOS Technology under new ownership, it was soon clear that Motorola’s management had, with the move to Austin, stimulated the creation of a new and credible competitor.</p><p>The combination of low price and better performance was a winning formula for the 6502, and it soon found its way into designs that might otherwise have used the 6800. The most famous example of this happened in 1975 when Steve Wozniak wanted to build his own single-board computer. Having compared the Intel 8080 and the 6800, he settled on the Motorola chip, preferring its more elegant instruction set, and worked to develop his design using the chip.</p><p>But even the reduced $175 cost of the 6800 was more than Wozniak could manage. When the 6502 appeared at the end of 1975 its $25 price was, at last, affordable so he switched to the MOS Technology design. Wozniak teamed up with Steve Jobs, turned his single board design into a commercial product, and sold it as the Apple computer. The design would retain the ability to use a 6800, though, with space allocated on the circuit board for the Motorola design to be used in place of the 6502. However, none of the computers, later known as the Apple I, were ever adapted to use the 6800.</p><p>When Wozniak and Jobs created the Apple II, their experience using the 6502 in the Apple I, made it certain that they would use the MOS Technology design.</p><p>And now that MOS Technology was owned by Commodore, variants of the 6502 became the processor in a range of popular Commodore computer designs from the PET and VIC 20 to the Commodore 64. Ownership by Commodore proved to be no barrier to adoption by Apple or other Commodore competitors and the 6502 would go on to be used in personal computers made by Atari, Acorn and many others.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3a643a-6a8d-451b-9eb9-8d56709ff1b2_1831x1053.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3a643a-6a8d-451b-9eb9-8d56709ff1b2_1831x1053.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3a643a-6a8d-451b-9eb9-8d56709ff1b2_1831x1053.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3a643a-6a8d-451b-9eb9-8d56709ff1b2_1831x1053.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3a643a-6a8d-451b-9eb9-8d56709ff1b2_1831x1053.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3a643a-6a8d-451b-9eb9-8d56709ff1b2_1831x1053.jpeg" width="1200" height="689.8351648351648" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ba3a643a-6a8d-451b-9eb9-8d56709ff1b2_1831x1053.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:837,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:636434,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3a643a-6a8d-451b-9eb9-8d56709ff1b2_1831x1053.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3a643a-6a8d-451b-9eb9-8d56709ff1b2_1831x1053.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3a643a-6a8d-451b-9eb9-8d56709ff1b2_1831x1053.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3a643a-6a8d-451b-9eb9-8d56709ff1b2_1831x1053.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Apple 1 PCB - Note the space for a 6800 top left - By Achim Baqué - https://www.apple1registry.com/en/press.html, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=109364693</figcaption></figure></div><p>For more on the 6502, then ‘65 Reasons to Celebrate the 6502’ has lots more on the history of the chip at the heart of the Apple II, Commodore 64 and many more important machines.</p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/65-reasons-to-celebrate-the-6502" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc06f41ba-bd13-461b-9087-7c9973273c68_790x287.jpeg"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc06f41ba-bd13-461b-9087-7c9973273c68_790x287.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="65 Reasons To Celebrate The 6502" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div><p>The parallels between the stories of the two most popular microprocessor architectures of the 8-bit era are striking. Intel and Motorola both produced innovative designs that helped to create the early personal computer market. Both firms then drove away the teams that had created them, only to see those teams create better designs, at Zilog and MOS Technology respectively, that would go on to lead the 8-bit market.</p><p>Bob Galvin, Motorola’s CEO, immediately understood the significance and the potential of the 6800. Motorola’s management were told that the move to Austin would be highly disruptive. Yet they persisted with the move, even after they had lost several key members of the 6800 team.</p><p>Motorola’s mistake led to the creation, at MOS Technology, of the microprocessor that would power many of the most popular early home and personal computers, including the Apple II, Commodore PET, Commodore 64 and BBC Micro. The 6502 was both powerful and elegant. Quoting Bill Mensch:</p><blockquote><p><span>There is a love for this little processor that's undeniable.</span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-139425274" href="https://thechipletter.substack.com/p/leaving-arizona#footnote-7-139425274" target="_self" rel="">7</a></p></blockquote><p>Chuck Peddle would later reminisce, fondly, about his experience developing the 6502.</p><blockquote><p>It was a unique time in history, you only get to do one of those in your lifetime, I think.</p></blockquote><p>It was a different story for Motorola. The move to Texas and the creation of the 6502 had been major setbacks for the 6800. They weren’t the end of the story for Motorola’s 8-bit efforts, though.  In Part 3 of the story of the 6800, we’ll look at the later variants of the 6800 and the 6809, Motorola’s final 8-bit successor to the 6800 and, arguably, the most powerful 8-bit processor of the 1970s.</p><p>After the break, further reading on the development the 6502 by members of the former Motorola team, with interviews, oral histories and more.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Today we "relaunched" <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin?ref=ypsidanger.com">ublue-os/bluefin</a> as <a href="https://projectbluefin.io/?ref=ypsidanger.com">projectbluefin.io</a>. This is a beta until Spring 2024.  </p><p>Bluefin is a custom image of Fedora Silverblue by a bunch of cloud-native nerds. We want a reliable desktop experience that runs everything but we're too lazy to maintain anything. So we automated the entire delivery pipeline in GitHub. </p><figure><img src="https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/2023/09/BLUEFIN_21_9.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="844" srcset="https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/BLUEFIN_21_9.png 600w, https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/BLUEFIN_21_9.png 1000w, https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/09/BLUEFIN_21_9.png 1600w, https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/09/BLUEFIN_21_9.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Say hello to Bluefin. She is a Deinonychus antirrhopus, "terrible claw". Artwork by Andy Frazer.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Originally Bluefin was "<a href="https://github.com/castrojo/ublue?ref=ypsidanger.com">Fedora Silverblue for Ubuntu Expatriates</a>". I was migrating to Fedora at the time and wanted Silverblue but with a more Ubuntu-like desktop: a dock and appindicators. </p><p>Over time it became apparent that it could stand on its own as an alternative for people who are tired of Linux desktops that aren't as reliable as cheap Chromebooks. We were tired of this shitty situation so decided to add a bit o' shine to Fedora Silverblue and maintain it as a clean, atomic layer on top of the default image. It's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cHYyGVOae84?si=-TdsDiY0xtqgbeuu&amp;t=2370&amp;ref=ypsidanger.com" rel="noreferrer">not a distribution</a>, since you can always revert back to a stock image. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nz-yyDwTfRM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="Bluefin Linux introduction"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Justin Garrison gives us a quick tour!</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>So she became Bluefin, which coincidentally was the name of Canonical's office building on the Thames in London. Since it's basically an Ubuntu-style workflow on top of Fedora this seemed to make sense and scratch the easter egg itch. </p><p>So after about two years of prototyping and real world usage, we think she's ready for more people to try. We're calling this a Beta, with the hope of going GA in the spring. </p><p>Since she's built on <a href="https://universal-blue.org/?ref=ypsidanger.com">Universal Blue</a> we get all the <a href="https://universal-blue.org/?ref=ypsidanger.com#advantages-over-traditional-linux-desktops" rel="noreferrer">benefits</a> of the main images. While it can run on any PC, we also have specific images for Framework, Asus, and Microsoft Surface devices. Work is underway to generate images based on the work of the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Asahi?ref=ypsidanger.com" rel="noreferrer">Fedora Asahi SIG</a>, so hopefully soon we'll have something for Mac users. </p><p>Updates are automatic and transparent, with built in drivers. It can do anything a Chromebook can, but can <a href="https://flathub.org/?ref=ypsidanger.com">use flathub packages</a> for applications, and crucially, a choice of browsers. And since a container runtime is included, it also means you can run just about any Linux workload. </p><figure><img src="https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/2023/09/bluefin-defaultish.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/bluefin-defaultish.png 600w, https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/bluefin-defaultish.png 1000w, https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/09/bluefin-defaultish.png 1600w, https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/2023/09/bluefin-defaultish.png 2256w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Wallpapers by Jacob Schnurr, every season represents the ecology of our open source ecosystems</span></figcaption></figure><p>Major upgrades are handled at the CI level by our <a href="https://devboard.gitsense.com/ublue-os/bluefin?ref=ypsidanger.com">contributors</a>, and everything is set up to run automatically. We ingest Fedora, apply our changes, and then ship the OCI image to you every day. An image-based desktop with the least amount of end-user maintenance as we can automate. Since it's just a container you can <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/docs?topic=43&amp;ref=ypsidanger.com" rel="noreferrer">fork to your heart's content</a> to make your own adjustments, or start from scratch. </p><p>We intend to use <a href="https://cockpit-project.org/?ref=ypsidanger.com">Cockpit</a> to act as fleet management. It is a powerful tool, however it's not set up out of the box, we hope to work on this over time as it's a complex issue, but it's also a problem to look forward to!</p><h2 id="taking-care-of-developers">Taking Care of Developers</h2><p>With the normal use case taken care of let's look at ourselves. Fedora Silverblue variants come with a container runtime, <a href="https://podman.io/?ref=ypsidanger.com">Podman</a>. This means that we can basically run anything we want. We include <a href="https://distrobox.privatedns.org/?ref=ypsidanger.com">distrobox</a> for an interactive experience so that users can use whatever distribution image they want as their day-to-day.  </p><p>But we needed a bit more oomph, so doing a <code>just devmode-on</code> in a terminal will switch you to <code>bluefin-dx</code>, our <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/docs?topic=39&amp;ref=ypsidanger.com" rel="noreferrer">developer image</a>. In here you'll find Visual Studio Code with <a href="https://containers.dev/?ref=ypsidanger.com">devcontainers</a>, <a href="https://www.jetpack.io/devbox?ref=ypsidanger.com">devbox</a> with Fleek for nix, <a href="https://devpod.sh/?ref=ypsidanger.com">devpod</a>, and homebrew. And we toss in some shortcuts to install <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/?ref=ypsidanger.com">Jetbrains Toolbox</a>. </p><p>We also take care of the underlying stuff that you need, like LXD/LXC, KVM, and virt-manager. <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/introduction/?ref=ypsidanger.com">Incus</a> is available as a tech preview. And lastly we include Docker on the image so you can <code>just docker</code> yourself to a more familiar place if you prefer to use it. </p><figure><img src="https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/2023/10/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="903" height="695" srcset="https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/image.png 600w, https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/2023/10/image.png 903w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>VSCode comes ready with devcontainers out of the box</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can swap your userspace as you see fit. By default it's Bluefin/Ubuntu, but I've been enjoying Bluefin/Alpine for it's speed and small size. At some point I'll migrate to using <a href="https://github.com/wolfi-dev?ref=ypsidanger.com">Wolfi images</a> too. </p><p>Use whatever you want, or stick to the stock Fedora images. We purposely don't dictate a developer workflow, whatever works for you.  Homebrew is my preferred route and is what I recommend to people who are migrating to Bluefin DX. </p><p>We use the <a href="https://universal-blue.org/guide/just?ref=ypsidanger.com">just task runner</a> to ship a bunch of convenience features (and workarounds too). This has started to become a great method for our community to ship shortcuts to each other. For example one contributor submitted <code>just ml-box</code> - a one command shortcut to get pytorch up and running. When you look at what it can do vs. setting up Nvidia drivers and container support by hand it becomes clear that enabling contributors to "ship" directly to developers is a powerful pattern. </p><h2 id="sustainability-of-our-open-source-contributors">Sustainability of our Open Source Contributors</h2><p>And lastly, we wanted to make something lightweight from a contribution perspective. Universal Blue is Containerfiles with Python/Shell. It's a common toolset that tons of people know, and with our community's cloud-native knowledge we were able to fully automate much of the toil in maintaining your computer. I have not seen an "upgrade screen" on any of my computers for over two years, Bluefin quietly hums in CI/CD on GitHub. You don't even know she's there. (Probably because we are being hunted). </p><p>We take our <a href="https://universal-blue.org/mission/?ref=ypsidanger.com">governance and procedures</a> seriously, and welcome contributions. I try to take the same amount of care and dedication that I do when contributing to CNCF projects. </p><p>After spending over five years in cloud-native, I feel like we finally have an alternative operating system using the methods we're all familiar with. It just wasn't available on the desktop, until Fedora made it happen! Now it's up to us to consume it, and improve it! </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YFXufAVdrw4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="2023 10 25 21 54 49"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Here's the companion video to this blog post.</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="a-fresh-start-for-the-next-generation">A fresh start for the next generation</h2><p>I hope you'll join us. We've already got lots of tech in here including kind, flux, helm, and kubectl. We intend to accelerate the consumption of cloud-native tech by acting as your SREs. </p><p>I'll be traveling to conferences over the next 18 months talking about sustainability of our open source ecosystems and developers. Those talks will be delivered via <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/custom-fedora-oci-images-for-framework-laptops/34253?u=jorge_castro&amp;ref=ypsidanger.com">Bluefin on a Framework 13</a>. After using Linux since 1998 I believe this to be the state of the art of the Linux desktop. You won't find a more powerful system with the least amount of work - so if you see me ask for the demo. </p><p>We've been dogfooding Bluefin in some form or another for about two years, and Universal Blue's images have been pulled over 2 million times, it feels mature enough to move the Beta. I don't think <code>bluefin-dx</code> will ever be finished because we'll be revving at the same pace as the rest of cloud-native development, so that should be fun!</p><p>She might nip at you on occasion with a paper cut, but she evolves quickly. Clever girl.  </p><figure><img src="https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/2023/10/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="949" height="716" srcset="https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/image-3.png 600w, https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/2023/10/image-3.png 949w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Find me at KubeCon North America for your very own bundle of joy!</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="full-disclosure">Full Disclosure </h2><p>I started this project when I was on sabbatical. One of those "find yourself" ones where you're thinking about stuff like ... "Where does my career go from here?" The whole open source sustainability thing is bugging me, and I started working at the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/?ref=ypsidanger.com" rel="noreferrer">CNCF</a> to help fix this problem. </p><p>And my passion projected kinda ended up being a "hello world". What if we could use the Linux desktop to onboard people right into cloud native? There's way dumber ideas out there lol. Here's more color on how I'm thinking about sustainability in open source:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdieyfrJRVk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="Looking at the Past to Understand our Future — Jorge Castro"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Here's me trying to explain all this in 15 minutes! It also explains why Bluefin is a dinosaur, she's trying to find her place in the ecosystem. </span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="finishing-the-beta">Finishing the Beta</h2><p>There's a few things that need to be sorted over the next six months. Mostly it involves the installation experience. It's hard to integrate code that doesn't exist so we're still waiting for Fedora's installer to become more robust at handling OCI installation. I'd like to personally thank the developers at Fedora and Red Hat for their support in working on these features, we're pretty confident that the installation process will get much better in the next six months. Luckily installation is the roughest part, once you're past that, it should be smooth sailing!</p><p>There are also lots of little paper cuts here and there. For example we don't automatically "detect and install Nvidia drivers" since that's not how these systems work, so you have to manually rebase to that image. That sort of thing.</p><p>Reliability is pretty great, the GitHub Package Registry keeps <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin/pkgs/container/bluefin?ref=ypsidanger.com" rel="noreferrer">90 days of images</a> available so we can always boot off of any of those images if required, and due to the nature of the system it removes a bunch of the packaging complexity from the client entirely. </p><h2 id="appendix-their-stories">Appendix: Their Stories</h2><p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1425657775/cretaceous-chonkers-chonky-dinosaur?ref=ypsidanger.com">Jacob Schnurr</a> and <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/dragonsofwales?ref=ypsidanger.com">Andy Frazer</a> brought Bluefin to life. If there's one lesson I've learned from this project is the technology is only one part of the equation. I purposely chose the dichotomy of paleo artists and operating systems at the leading edge of machine learning to be a statement on where we stand. A tool designed to make automation the most efficient it can possibly be, and yet unable to exist without the imagination of the human. </p><p>Here's some more shots of the gang in all the prehistoric glory ...</p><figure><img src="https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/2023/09/CustomChonk_Jorge_Deinonychus_Color3-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="864" height="864" srcset="https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/CustomChonk_Jorge_Deinonychus_Color3-1.png 600w, https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/2023/09/CustomChonk_Jorge_Deinonychus_Color3-1.png 864w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Deinonychus antirrhopus, "Bluefin" - This was the species that changed our view of dinosaurs</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/2023/09/Jorge_CustomChonks_DimetrodonA.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1296" height="1296" srcset="https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/Jorge_CustomChonks_DimetrodonA.png 600w, https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/Jorge_CustomChonks_DimetrodonA.png 1000w, https://www.ypsidanger.com/content/images/2023/09/Jorge_CustomChonks_DimetrodonA.png 1296w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Dolly the Dimetrodon.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a very busy 2023 for Ruffle, so much so that we didn't find the time to write a new progress report with everything going on! Let's fix that!</p>
<p>Let's summarize with some numbers first.</p>
<p>Since the last blog post...</p>
<ul>
<li>ActionScript 3 Language has gone up from 60% to <strong>75%</strong>!</li>
<li>ActionScript 3 API has gone up from 60% to <strong>68%</strong>! (And it was only 25% at the start of the year!)</li>
<li>We've merged <strong>852</strong> pull requests from <strong>43</strong> people! (And 3 bots.)</li>
<li>We've closed <strong>1,288</strong> issues (and some of them weren't even duplicates or anything!)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="display-filters">Display Filters</h3>
<p>We've now implemented 7 out of 10 of Flash's filter effects, making content look much more accurate (and lots of text actually legible!)</p>
<p>Along with filter support, we've also implemented <code>cacheAsBitmap</code> support - a huge optimisation for games that use it, saving us the need to render the same thing every single frame!</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/issues/15">The remaining 3 filters</a> don't seem to be used often, but we welcome anyone who wishes to come help implement them! Support for the existing filters was done by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Dinnerbone">@Dinnerbone</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/torokati44">@torokati44</a>.</p>
<h3 id="text-improvements">Text improvements</h3>
<p>On the topic of rendering, we've been picking and poking at fonts for a while now - and through our combined efforts we're finally starting to see the light at the end of this pixelated and wrongly shaped tunnel.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Lord-McSweeney">@Lord-McSweeney</a> has implemented basic Text Layout Framework (TLF) support, which has started to get some more advanced text rendering working.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kjarosh">@kjarosh</a> has also recently been working on making text inputs more functional, implementing text restrictions and better caret/selection rendering.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Dinnerbone">@Dinnerbone</a> has created the framework for loading device fonts, instead of using the default Noto Sans we use everywhere. It's available on web (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions-For-Users#how-do-i-change-the-fonts-used-by-flash-on-my-website">with some configuration</a>) but works out of the box on desktop thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/evilpie">@evilpie</a>!</p>
<p>With device font support landing, content that didn't embed their own font will now start looking much better. Notably, lots of Japanese content often relied on this, and didn't render text at all previously.</p>

<h3 id="sockets-even-on-the-web">Sockets... even on the web!</h3>
<p>This has definitely been one of the biggest hurdles to emulating Flash, but the incredible <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sleepycatcoding">@sleepycatcoding</a> came in and made it happen.</p>
<p>Any kind of multiplayer game such as Gaia, Habbo or Club Penguin relied on sockets (TCP sockets, or XML sockets) to function - and nobody was sure if we'd manage to get these working on the web. Modern browsers just don't like that sort of thing!</p>
<p>On desktop it's now supported out of the box (but will prompt you for permission by default, just to be sure), but web needs <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions-For-Users#how-can-i-connect-to-a-tcpsocket-or-xmlsocket-from-the-web">a little configuration</a> to make it work.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://ruffle.rs/2024-01-14-2023-in-review/gaia.png"><img src="https://ruffle.rs/2024-01-14-2023-in-review/gaia.png" title="Gaia's Towns 2" alt="Gaia's Towns 2"></a>

<h3 id="flash-remoting">Flash remoting</h3>
<p>In addition to sockets, another common way for online games to work was a protocol called "Flash Remoting", using <code>NetConnection</code>.
This was most notably seen in any game that uses the Armor Games API, and we're happy to say that that now works more or less as expected!</p>
<h3 id="flv-and-video-playback">FLV and video playback</h3>
<p>This has been a tricky one, but <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kmeisthax">@kmeisthax</a> has been tackling this all year and making amazing progress. Ruffle now supports FLV playback, depending on which codec is required, and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielhjacobs">@danielhjacobs</a> has added a workaround for patented codecs on the web by playing them using the browser over the top of the content (or on desktop, just opening the browser).</p>
<p>There's still a lot of progress to be made here, and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/torokati44">@torokati44</a> has a working prototype of decoding H.264 using Cisco's OpenH264 which is very exciting!</p>
<h3 id="initial-air-support">Initial AIR support</h3>
<p>This was a long time stretch goal that's starting to see reality thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Aaron1011">@Aaron1011</a>! We now properly version the ActionScript 3 API, and this has been extended to allow AIR-only classes and methods.</p>
<p>We don't have much to show for AIR stuff yet, but the framework to get us here has already helped close off many longstanding compatibility bugs when movies don't expect certain methods or properties to exist for the version of Flash they target.</p>
<h3 id="mixed-avm">Mixed AVM</h3>
<p>On the topic of longstanding bugs, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Lord-McSweeney">@Lord-McSweeney</a> has been working on allowing mixed-avm movies to run correctly - these are usually ActionScript 3 games running inside ActionScript 2 containers, or vice versa.</p>
<p>There's still more to do here, but it's already helped unblock lots of content from just mysteriously failing to start!</p>
<h3 id="extension-improvements">Extension improvements</h3>
<p>The extension now uses Manifest V3 (somewhat reluctantly), which enables us to... keep existing. Unfortunately this came with needing to remove the "go to a swf url and play it in the browser" feature, as that's no longer possible with MV3.</p>
<p>However, the upside to this is that we're now <a target="_blank" href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ruffle/pipjjbgofgieknlpefmcckdmgaaegban">in the Edge store</a>! Also, thanks to work from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kmeisthax">@kmeisthax</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielhjacobs">@danielhjacobs</a>, we're also now available on Firefox for Android! <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/android/addon/ruffle_rs">Check it out!</a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/WumboSpasm">@WumboSpasm</a> also redesigned the demo player in the extension, which <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielhjacobs">@danielhjacobs</a> made serve as the replacement for the aforementioned swf-url feature. It looks pretty neat!</p>
<h3 id="desktop-ui">Desktop UI</h3>
<p>Whilst we had a super basic UI introduced in our last blog post, now it's even better! It's still as simple to use as before, but the new Advanced Open menu has many new options you can toggle to change how content plays - plus we've added a host of brand new debug tools that even Flash Player didn't have!</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://ruffle.rs/2024-01-14-2023-in-review/ui-open-advanced.png"><img src="https://ruffle.rs/2024-01-14-2023-in-review/ui-open-advanced.png" title="Ruffle's Open Advanced menu" alt="Ruffle's Open Advanced menu"></a>

<h3 id="new-website">New website</h3>
<p>Whilst not Ruffle itself, the website got some much-needed love from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Dinnerbone">@Dinnerbone</a> with a total redesign. There's a lot more we'd like to do in the future with it, but web development isn't the specialty of any of our regular contributors... help is very much welcome!</p>
<p>We've also pulled in all the improvements to the Extension's demo player, and brought those over to the website too.</p>
<h3 id="too-many-contributions-to-call-out">Too many contributions to call out!</h3>
<p>There's been just so many PRs landing that not everything can take the spotlight here. We'd like to thank every single person who helped shape Ruffle in 2023, and hope that 2024 brings more great progress.</p>
<p>In addition, a big thank you to our sponsors who help keep the project alive. We appreciate you all!</p>
