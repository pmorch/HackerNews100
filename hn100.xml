					<h3>January 11, 2025</h3>
					<p><a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/11/01/using-wordpress-is-risky">Since I last wrote about WordPress</a>, things have gone off the rails. This after a brief period when things were blissfully quiet. Matt Mullenweg stopped commenting for a while, though his company had launched <a href="https://wordpressenginetracker.com/">WP Engine Tracker</a> — a site for tracking WordPress-driven websites that moved away from WP Engine. I think this is a bit gauche, but it seems like fair marketing given everything that’s going on. It should be noted that many sites are leaving for Pressable — owned by Mullenweg’s company, Automattic —&nbsp;because of <a href="https://pressable.com/wpe-contract-buyout/">a sweetheart deal</a>.</p>

<p>But the drama ramped up quickly after WP Engine <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24318350/automattic-restore-wp-engine-access-wordpress">won a preliminary injunction</a> against Automattic on December 10th. The injunction required that WP Engine be <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/10/10/loyalty-test-checkbox">allowed to access WordPress.org resources</a>, and that Automattic <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/10/13/acf-has-been-hijacked">stop interfering with WP Engine plugins</a>, while the trial moves forward. Ernie Smith <a href="https://tedium.co/2024/12/14/wordpress-wp-engine-reaction/">wrote an excellent piece</a> with more details on outcome of the injunction, including a note about Mullenweg quitting a community Slack instance with a <a href="https://tedium.co/2024/12/14/wordpress-wp-engine-reaction/#:~:text=Don%E2%80%99t%20print%20in%20the%20newsletter%20that%20I%E2%80%99m%20mad">hammy message</a>. Mullenweg complied with the injunction, though the “<a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/10/10/loyalty-test-checkbox">loyalty test checkbox</a>” text was changed to a still-required <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/pineapple-on-pizza-is-delicious-and-if-you-disagree-you-cant-log-in-to-wordpress-org/">note about pineapple on pizza</a>.</p>

<p>On December 20th, <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-declares-holiday-break-for-wordpress-org-services">Mullenweg announced</a> that WordPress.org would be on holiday break for an unspecified amount of time. <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/12/holiday-break/">In a post on the WordPress.org blog</a>, he again mentioned being “compelled to provide free labor and services to WP Engine thanks to the success of their expensive lawyers”. He also invited people to fund legal attacks against him by signing up for WP Engine services, and hoped to have the “time, energy, and money to reopen all of this sometime in the new year”.</p>

<p>This was the first time WordPress.org had ever gone on break, and it was another instance of Mullenweg using a core part of the WordPress community to send a message. WordPress.org <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-services-resume-after-holiday-break">returned to service on January 4th</a>, but plugin and theme updates weren’t being reviewed until then. I’m all for giving volunteers time off, but this came as a surprise to the community and there was initially no indication when the break would end. Mullenweg’s “woe is me” language around maybe, possibly, being able to find the resources to reopen a core piece of WordPress infrastructure didn’t help things. It <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262232/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-org-wp-engine">further cemented</a> that Matt Mullenweg’s current mood is an important function of whether or not the WordPress community operates smoothly.</p>

<p>While WordPress.org was on hiatus, Mullenweg also reached out to the WPDrama community on Reddit, asking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WPDrama/comments/1hlp08d/what_drama_should_i_create_in_2025/">what drama he should create in 2025</a>. A couple of years ago, this sort of thing would have been some tongue-in-cheek fun from a person who’s always been a bit of a goof. These days it comes off a bit differently.</p>

<p>Then yesterday happened. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340717/automattic-wordpress-contribution-hours-cut-wp-engine">Automattic announced</a> that it would restrict its contributions to the open source version of WordPress. The company would now only put in about 45 hours a week total — down from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340717/automattic-wordpress-contribution-hours-cut-wp-engine">nearly 4,000 a week</a> — so as to match the estimated hourly contributions of WP Engine. This action is blamed on the “<a href="https://automattic.com/2025/01/09/aligning-automattics-sponsored-contributions-to-wordpress/#:~:text=the%20legal%20attacks%20started%20by%20WP%20Engine%20and%20funded%20by%20Silver%20Lake">the legal attacks started by WP Engine and funded by Silver Lake</a>”, which I think is a gross mischaracterization. <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/09/26/wordpress-vs-wp-engine">WP Engine definitely did not start this</a>.</p>

<p>Automattic noted it would focus its open source hours on “security and critical updates”. The other hours would be redirected to <a href="https://automattic.com/2025/01/09/aligning-automattics-sponsored-contributions-to-wordpress/#:~:text=for%2Dprofit%20projects%20within%20Automattic%2C%20such%20as%20WordPress.com%2C%20Pressable%2C%20WPVIP%2C%20Jetpack%2C%20and%20WooCommerce">for-profit projects like WordPress.com</a>. This means that the community will be expected to take up the slack if it wants WordPress to improve. I also really doubt that 45 hours a week is enough time to keep WordPress secure and bug-free.</p>

<p>And you know what? In a normal world, that would be fine. I’d be all for it! If the community were to take control of the open source project, I think that would be ideal. The problem is that Mullenweg has final say over some very important parts of the WordPress community. He also seems recently to be acting more childishly and impulsively than usual.</p>

<p>Another thing that <a href="https://www.threads.net/@karaswisher/post/DEniSxyS01i">came to light yesterday</a> was that the WordPress Sustainability committee was shuttered after a core member, Thijs Buijs, stepped down. In a post on the WordPress Slack, Buijs cited the “2025 drama” post on Reddit as the reason he was leaving, and called for a change in WordPress community leadership. In response, Mullenweg responded in part with “[t]oday I learned that we have a sustainability team”, and closed the channel.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/sustainability/">WordPress Sustainability Team</a> had four core members, and <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/sustainability/graphs/contributors">11 people</a> who had contributed on GitHub. As far as I can tell, they were all community members, and none were Automattic employees. Even if it wasn’t producing amazing results, I can’t see what harm it was doing. The sin was pointing out something stupid that Mullenweg did, and having a member wanting change. The optics, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/los-angeles-wildfires-1.7429025">especially given current world events</a>, are definitely not great. The wildest part of this to me is that there’s video of Mullenweg — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Qq1SBFzByDw?si=S2RfSBj2ioLl3WPC&amp;t=28744">live on stage at Word Camp Europe in 2022</a> — requesting the creation of the Slack channel he was turning off. Guess that slipped his mind.</p>

<p>All of this bodes poorly for the open source version of WordPress. I think it’s perfectly fair for Automattic to switch gears and focus on for-profit projects — it’s a company after all. The problem is that there’s a void being left. Automattic had, for better or worse, lead the development of both the commercial and open source pieces of the WordPress ecosystem. Now it seems like the community needs to take over, but Mullenweg still holds all the keys.</p>

<p>In the announcement, <a href="https://automattic.com/2025/01/09/aligning-automattics-sponsored-contributions-to-wordpress/#:~:text=Part%20of%20this%20will%20be%20making%20WordPress.com%20much%20closer%20to%20a%20core%20WordPress%20experience%2C%20instead%20of%20having%20a%20different%20interface">Automattic said</a> that WordPress.com would be updated to be more in line with the open source version of WordPress. This also makes sense to me, as WordPress.com has always been a <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/com-vs-org/">weird version</a> of the software. Of course, having slight differences to the core WordPress experience is the argument that Mullenweg initially used to call WP Engine a “<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine/">cancer</a>”, but who’s keeping track? I’d also like to point out again that Automattic <a href="https://automattic.com/ventures/#:~:text=by%20Silver%20Lake-,Series%20A,-Managed%20WordPress%20hosting">invested in WP Engine in 2011</a>. It also <a href="https://automattic.com/ventures/#:~:text=2012-,Acquired%20by%20Automattic,-Convertible%20Note">acquired Pressable in 2016</a>, likely because it was a hosting service that offered a “real” version of WordPress, unlike WordPress.com.</p>

<p>It’s hard to see how to move forward from here. I think the best bet would be for people to rally around a new community-driven infrastructure. This would likely require a fork of WordPress, though, and that’s going to be a messy. The current open source version of WordPress <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AWordPress%2FWordPress%20%22wordpress.org%22&amp;type=code">relies on the sites and services Mullenweg controls</a>. Joost de Valk, the original creator of an extremely popular <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/">SEO plugin</a>, wrote a <a href="https://joost.blog/wordpress-leadership/">blog post with some thoughts on the matter</a>. I’m hoping that more prominent people in the community step up like this, and that some way forward can be found.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you’re a WordPress developer, you may want to <a href="https://craftcms.com/blog/migrating-from-wordpress">look into some other options</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Moments after posting this, I was pointed to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/11/matt-mullenweg-deactivates-wordpress-accounts-of-contributors-planning-a-fork/">story on TechCrunch</a> about Mullenweg deactivating the WordPress.org accounts of users planning a “fork”. This after he <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/spoon/">previously promoted</a> (though in a slightly mocking way) the idea of forking open source software. In both cases, the people he mentioned weren’t actually planning forks, but musing about future ways forward for WordPress. Mullenweg framed the account deactivations as giving people the push they need to get started. Remember that WordPress.org accounts are required to submit themes, plugins, or core code to the WordPress project. These recent events really make it seem like you’re no longer welcome to contribute to WordPress if you question Matt Mullenweg.</p>

A common theory is that it was essentially a plot by modernist architects, who had a particular theory of what made a building “good” — “honest” buildings without excessive decoration or ornament — and who successfully foisted that style on an unwilling public, who preferred the old style. This is more or less the thesis of Tom Wolfe’s </span><em>From Bauhaus to Our House</em><span>, a 34,000 word polemic decrying the rise of modern architecture:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Every great law firm in New York moves without a sputter of protest into a glass-box office building with concrete slab floors and seven-foot-ten-inch-high concrete slab ceilings and plasterboard walls and pygmy corridors — and then hires a decorator and gives him a budget of hundreds of thousands of dollars to turn these mean cubes and grids into a horizontal fantasy of a Restoration townhouse. I have seen the carpenters and cabinetmakers and search-and-acquire girls hauling in more cornices, covings, pilasters, carved moldings, and recessed domes, more linenfold paneling, more (fireless) fireplaces with festoons of fruit carved in mahogany on the mantels, more chandeliers, sconces, girandoles, chestnut leather sofas, and chiming clocks than Wren, Inigo Jones, the brothers Adam, Lord Burlington, and the Dilettanti, working in concert, could have dreamed of.</em></p><p><em>Without a peep they move in! — even though the glass box appalls them all…</em></p><p><em>And why? They can't tell you. They look up at the barefaced buildings they have bought, those great hulking structures they hate so thoroughly, and they can't figure it out themselves. It makes their heads hurt.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Scott Alexander echoes this theory in </span><a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/book-review-from-bauhaus-to-our-house" rel="">his review of the book</a><span>. Samuel Hughes also gestures at this theory in this </span><em><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-beauty-of-concrete/" rel="">Works in Progress</a></em><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-beauty-of-concrete/" rel=""> piece</a><span>, where he argues that ornament on buildings didn’t die because it got too expensive, but rather because of the rise of modernism:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>In the first half of the twentieth century, Western artistic culture was transformed by a complex family of movements that we call modernism, a trend that extends far beyond architecture into the literature of Joyce and Pound, the painting of Picasso and Matisse, and the music of Schoenberg and Stravinsky. Between the 1920s and the 1950s, modernist approaches to architecture were adopted for virtually all public buildings and many private ones. Most architectural modernists mistrusted ornament and largely excluded it from their designs. The immense and sophisticated industries that had served the architectural aspirations of the nineteenth century withered in full flower. The fascinating and mysterious story of how this happened cannot be told here. But it is a story of cultural choice, not of technological destiny. It was within our collective power to choose differently. It still is.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Changing architectural trends were undoubtedly a factor in the rise of the glass box aesthetic, but this explanation misses a huge part of why this transition happened. Notably, this theory completely omits the role of the real estate developer, who has a greater influence than anyone else in how a building comes together. Skyscrapers are designed by architects, but it’s the developer who conceives of the project, arranges the funding, hires the design team, and ultimately decides what the building will be. To me, the question isn’t “Why did architects embrace modernism? It’s “Why did </span><em>real estate developers embrace modernism</em><span>?”</span></p><p>Ultimately, it was economics (or at least perceived economics) that drove developers to embrace this style. Glass curtain wall buildings were cheaper to erect than their masonry predecessors, and they allowed developers to squeeze more rentable space from the same building footprint. Ornate, detailed exteriors were increasingly seen as something tenants didn’t particularly care about, making it harder to justify spending money on them. And once this style had taken hold, rational risk aversion encouraged developers and builders to keep using it.</p><p><span>In the US, most skyscrapers are built as speculative buildings: they’re built to be rented or sold to someone else. Even large corporate headquarters tend to rent out much of their space to other companies: when Sears built the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Tower" rel="">Sears Tower</a><span> (now Willis Tower), the company only occupied a little over half the building, and rented out the rest. A skyscraper is thus primarily a </span><em>business venture</em><span>: the builder invests money in constructing it, in the hopes of earning a return on that investment by renting it out or selling it. Typically, the builder of a skyscraper will be a real estate developer, someone in the business of acquiring parcels of land and constructing buildings on them.</span></p><p>The basis of a speculative building project is the pro forma: a financial model of the building and its profitability, based on its various projected costs (land, construction costs, financing and so on) compared to the revenues earned from rents. When considering a new building project, the developer will play around with this model — how many apartment units to construct and of what type, whether they should be market rate or luxury, whether any adjacent parcels are needed or not, whether the project should include office space or retail, how much parking is required and where on the site it can fit — until he gets something that seems to work.</p><p><span>The pro forma creates a box that the developer has to work within, and ultimately dictates what sort of building can be built. If costs are too high, or revenues are too low, or the </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationrate.asp" rel="">cap rate</a><span> (net income divided by value of the building) isn’t what it needs to be, then the developer won’t be able to raise the funds from investors to get the building built. The form and function of the building is thus a reflection of what the developer thinks is likely to be profitable. As Jerry Adler notes in </span><em>High Rise</em><span>, a chronicle of the construction of a New York skyscraper:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>…What [is] most distinctively American about the skyscraper is its purpose, which is to make money. A building, if it is successful, takes on a kind of teleological necessity once it is built, as if no other possible building could have been contemplated in that particular location. We see the arrangement of shapes the architects refer to as the massing, the heart-stopping shimmer in the reflections of the clouds as the wind sucks at the black glass of the windows, the checkerboards of granite on the lobby floor, and to us that is the self-evident end and purpose of all that vast labor. But properly regarded, the physical building is merely the three-dimensional projection of a set of documents known as the pro forma, the calculations that demonstrate how a given piece of real estate can make money. Thus architect, engineer, ironworker all dance to the tune called by the developer.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Of course, for better or for worse, the developer can’t simply build anything that he wants. The developer’s pro forma-shaped-box is constrained by local building rules and regulations: zoning rules that dictate allowable building heights and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_area_ratio" rel="">floor area ratios</a><span> (the ratio of building floor space to overall land area), code requirements that determine what sort of building systems need to be used (and thus how much the building costs to build), aesthetic requirements implemented by local planning commissions, feedback from design review boards and local residents, and so on.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png" width="608" height="346" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:346,&quot;width&quot;:608,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a1e0ca-c804-40bb-b336-387641caacc6_608x346.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>New York skyline in the 1920s.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>These constraints can have very large impacts on the size and shape of buildings: the distinctive layer-cake style of early 20th century New York skyscrapers, for instance, was due to zoning rules that required setbacks to prevent buildings from occupying the entirety of their sites. In other cases, securing local approval is so difficult that it ultimately dictates the exterior form of the building, as noted by one Chicago developer in </span><em>How Real Estate Developers Think</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“…The developer spends a lot of money designing this fancy picture or model,’’ says Emmerman, ‘‘so that they can take it to the alderman, councilman, or mayor, and they either fall in love with it or they bastardize it first and then fall in love with it.’’ Even then, elected politicians will not promote a project until the broader community has seen it and come out in support of it — or at least not come out in complete opposition to it — so the next step is to seek input from the neighbors. ‘‘So then you spend months dealing with the neighborhood and ‘can you make it shorter, can you put the parking underground, can you put in flower boxes,’ and still, we have not talked about how this building functions.’’ By the time the developer commits to proceeding with the detailed design, after many months of promoting the architect’s rendering or model, the image of the building’s exterior shell has become fixed in the minds of the public.</em></p><p><em>“…Once you have figured out the typical floor plate based on all of these constraints,’’ says Emmerman, ‘‘you try to fit the units into the space that is left over.’’</em></p></blockquote><p><span>It’s the developers job to navigate this mass of constraints, and to come up with a plan for a building that will be compelling to renters, acceptable to local residents and building authorities, and earn an acceptable return. The developer is </span><em>highly</em><span> incentivized to get this correct: real estate is a competitive market, and a new building project must compete with many other buildings on the market. Developers will thus typically pay very close attention to the local real estate market: growth rates, population demographics, what sort of projects are successful and what aren’t, what features are compelling to tenants, and so on. In some cases developers will go so far as to bring their sales staff to early stage design meetings, and have them weigh in on the design of the building itself, to ensure they’re building something that buyers want and staff can sell.</span></p><p><span>To design the building, the developer hires an architect, who will lead the design effort and manage the design team (which includes specialties like structural engineers, mechanical engineers, and so on). The architect is the developer’s agent, and is </span><a href="https://www.conspectusinc.com/blog/2018/07/better-ethics-for-architects" rel="">duty-bound by professional ethics</a><span> to act in their interest.</span></p><p>Which is not to say that the architect simply does exactly what the developer wants. An architect is hired for their professional expertise on building design, including a building’s aesthetics. A good design that not only meets the developer’s programmatic requirements (number of units, amount of rentable space) but is aesthetically pleasing is one of the services the architect is providing. If an architect advocates for some particular design choice — a finish material, a building shape, a decorative feature — the developer will take that seriously. They hired the architect in part for their aesthetic taste, after all.</p><p>But this sort of advocacy works only to a point. An architect typically can’t just go in whatever aesthetic direction they want, with the developer forced to follow along. For one, they can’t stray outside the box built by the developer’s pro forma and by what will be approved by the local authorities. This limits what sort of options an architect has to choose from: they can’t simply pick a facade material that’s twice as expensive, or a building shape that doesn’t have sufficient square footage, just because they like the look of it.</p><p><span>For another, architecture is a very competitive field (there are around </span><a href="https://www.ncarb.org/sites/default/files/NBTN-2024.pdf" rel="">120,000 registered architects</a><span> in the US), and an architect who makes unreasonable demands or can’t keep projects within budget is an architect who will have a hard time getting future work. Often a developer will solicit proposals from several design teams, choosing the team they like the best or the one that has the lowest fee. Developers tend to return to architects whom they work well with, who understand that a building is ultimately a question of economics, who know what sort of things are reasonable to ask for and what can’t be accommodated. Most buildings aren’t designed by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starchitect" rel="">starchitects</a><span> like Frank Gehry or Zaha Hadid who are trying to create unique works of art, but by client-friendly architects who will hew to the constraints they’re given and try to deliver a reasonably-priced building that meets the design requirements.</span></p><p><span>One such firm was </span><a href="https://architectuul.com/architect/emery-roth-sons" rel="">Emery Roth and Sons</a><span>, founded by Emery Roth in 1903. While not a household name, Roth and Sons’ influence on the New York skyline was enormous. Between 1950 and 1970, the firm designed 70 office buildings, accounting “for half the [New York] office acreage created since the war”:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>…Four consecutive blockfronts on the west side of Park Avenue between Forty-eighth and Fifty-second streets were redeveloped according to the plans of Emery Roth and Sons. These skyscrapers were built to house some of America’s mightiest corporations, and above their portals were emblazoned the names of Bankers Trust Company, Colgate-Palmolive, International Telephone and Telegraph and Manufacturers Hanover Trust. The new, glittering, glass-walled faces of Park Avenue, as well as of Madison and Third Avenues, were almost entirely Roth-fashioned. As testament to this fact, a new word was coined — ”Rothscrapers” — to denote the glass and metal towers designed in the Roths’ modern idiom. They had such a dramatic effect on the New York skyline that Ada Louise Huxtable, former architecture critic of the New York Times, saw them “as responsible for the face of modern New York as Sixtus V was for baroque Rome.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Emery Roth and Sons’ success was not because of their aesthetics – their designs were highly criticized by architecture critics.

You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>These sorts of developer friendly architects abound. In Chicago, architect slash developer </span><a href="https://www.enr.com/articles/50443-architect-developer-james-loewenberg-revitalized-chicago-lakefront" rel="">James Loewenberg</a><span> was similarly infamous for filling the skyline with aesthetically forgettable but very profitable buildings. In the early 20th century, Shreve and Lamb (later Shreve, Lamb and Harmon), the firm which designed the Empire State Building, was likewise known for being practical, unsentimental, and keeping their eye on the bottom line, as John Tauranac notes in his </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Empire-State-Building-Making-Landmark/dp/0801479398" rel="">history of the Empire State Building</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>"The day that an architect could sit before his drawing board and make pretty sketches of decidedly uneconomic monuments to himself has gone," said Lamb. "His scorn of things 'practical' has been replaced by an intense earnestness to make practical necessities the armature upon which he molds the form of his idea…he must know how to plan his building so that it will 'work' economically and produce the revenue for which his clients have made their investment."</em></p></blockquote><p>With the design of the Empire State Building itself, Lamb would state that “whatever ‘style’ it may be is the result of a logical and simple answer to the problems set by the economic and technical demands of this unprecedented program.”</p><p>Developers, especially those successful enough to be able to finance skyscraper construction, are also savvy enough to understand the architecture market: what firms are best at what sort of work, which architects are easy to work with and which aren’t, and what they’re getting when they sign on with one. If a high-profile architect is hired, it’s because the developer thinks that their style, or the cachet of their name, will bring value to the project. But even famous and opinionated architects aren’t necessarily given carte blanche to design buildings however they like.</p><p><span>An example of this is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1540_Broadway" rel="">1540 Broadway</a><span>, the New York skyscraper whose design and construction was chronicled by the book </span><em>High Rise</em><span>. The developer hired Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) to create the design. SOM was (and is) one of the most famous architectural firms in the world, responsible for designing many of the world’s tallest buildings. At the time, SOM was notable for having fervently embraced architectural modernism, so much so that the three cofounders were sometimes called “the three blind Mies,” after modernism founder Mies van der Rohe.</span></p><p><span>But impeccable architectural credentials and strong aesthetic preferences didn’t mean that SOM was in the driver’s seat. The developer, Bruce Eichner, required constant redesigns to get the building where it needed to be finance-wise. Major architectural features were constantly removed or reworked: for instance, SOM wanted to have three-foot-deep recesses in the building as a major architectural feature, which would be supported by an expensive </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vierendeel_bridge" rel="">Vierendeel truss.</a><span> But this was rejected as too expensive, and SOM was ultimately forced to accept much shallower, nine-inch recesses and a more conventional steel moment frame. The building’s shape was changed to remove articulation and reduce the amount of expensive cladding required. Interior finishes were changed based on feedback Eichner got from a real estate broker on what tenants wanted.</span></p><p><span>This sort of client feedback is common with high-profile architects. Minoru Yamasaki was the architect who designed the World Trade Center, but his feet were held to the fire the entire time by his client, the Port Authority. From </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/City-Sky-World-Trade-Center/dp/0805076913" rel="">City in the Sky</a></em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Tozzoli also weighed in. The trade center, he said, was going to be beautiful. That was why Yamasaki had been hired. But this was not going to be some esoteric architectural exercise. The commanding force here — besides the bottom line — was going to be “the Program,” the nonnegotiable set of specifications for the job. It totaled 10 million square feet of net rentable space. The message was eminently clear. This was not going to be a project in which Yamasaki came up with a design and then presented the results to an awed client. He was facing the prospect of an endless interrogation and negotiating and bickering with the Port Authority. His plans would be criticized at every step and changed if they did not meet the test of practicality as defined by Tozzoli and Levy and the others. And it would soon be especially obvious that there was no escaping Levy, a man who could be so nasty he could, and often would, make Yamasaki quiver silently with humiliation or anger. Levy was going to be Tozzoli’s whip hand on the trade center. The cursing, tantrum-prone Levy was going to make sure that the little group of architects in the Detroit suburbs designed the kind of buildings that the Port Authority damn well wanted.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png" width="486" height="617.8032" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1589,&quot;width&quot;:1250,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:486,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a791a7b-0e1c-43b0-b56a-4ce19f2332bd_1250x1589.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Pennzoil Place, Houston.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Similarly, famous modern architect </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Johnson" rel="">Philip Johnson</a><span> designed </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennzoil_Place" rel="">Pennzoil Place</a><span>, which won many accolades for its design (it was described as the “Building of the Decade” by architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable), but its design was ultimately the result of feedback from developer Gerald Hines and Pennzoil chairman Hugh Liedtke</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-154617516" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-skyscrapers-became-glass-boxes#footnote-1-154617516" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>. From </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raising-Bar-Life-Gerald-Hines/dp/0988926121" rel="">Raising the Bar</a></em><span>, a biography of Gerald Hines:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The first thing Hugh Liedtke said was, “I don’t want one of those upturned cigar boxes!” said Burgee. “He said, ‘I won’t have any of that’... Hugh started saying “I want something that when people see it, they say, ‘That’s Pennzoil.’ ...Then he said to me, ‘I hate aluminum, can’t be aluminum, these damn aluminum and glass and mirrored glass buildings.’”</em></p><p><em>…Johnson and Burgee’s initial ideas were unsuccessful — either too conventional or too similar to the Seagram Building that Johnson had designed in New York. Both Hines and Liedtke soundly rejected all of their ideas. Then Hines, without realizing it, came up with the answer. “Gerry said, ‘we’ve gotta have two tenants,’ said Burgee… “And Philip Johnson said, ‘Well, why not two buildings?’”</em></p><p><em>“Hugh said he didn’t want an upturned cigar box,” Burgee said. “Well, except for the little cut in the building, the buildings we’d designed were cigar boxes from one side. So we said, ‘We’ve got to do something with the top so it isn’t just a flat, cut-off cigar box.’” So they cut the top off of each building at an angle, leaving two dramatic pointed peaks.</em></p><p><em>“I remember showing the idea to Gerry for the first time, and he said, ‘Oh, no, no, that’ll never do,’” Burgee said. “‘A point on a building?’ he said. ‘You can’t rent that point.’ ...”And he said, ‘we have to take it to Hugh and see what he thinks,’ said Burgee. “But make the points removable,’ So we made the model so that the tops pulled off so that Hugh could see the building flat and also with points.”</em></p><p><em>“[Liedtke] saw it, and he was quiet, and he thought about it and said, ‘I like it,’” said Burgee. Then the architects showed Liedtke the model without the points. So we took the tops off, and Gerry said, “Mr. Liedtke, this is going to cost X hundreds of thousands of dollars’ or something. Hugh didn’t answer. He looked at us, Philip and me, and he said, ‘Put ‘em back,’ and we put ‘em back on. And he said, ‘That’s it’ and left. Those points never came off again, and that was the end of the meeting.”</em></p></blockquote><p>More generally, developers may or may not have strong aesthetic preferences (some care deeply, some not at all), but either way they tend to exercise a firm hand in the design process, putting money where it's useful and cutting it out where its not, and will often be very opinionated about what will work for a given project, based on the market and what tenants are believed to want.</p><p>So why did developers embrace the glass box aesthetic? Unsurprisingly, it comes down to economics.</p><p><span>Prior to World War II, most skyscrapers had walls of stone or masonry. This was partly a holdover from the days when buildings were built with load-bearing exterior walls. The </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-skyscrapers-are-so-short/#:~:text=While%20the%20building%20is%20under,as%20the%20building%20gets%20taller." rel="">development of the steel frame</a><span> at the end of the 19th century allowed buildings with non-load-bearing exterior walls, but codes were slower to change than technology, and still often required a thick layer of stone, brick, or terra cotta on the exterior. But by the late 1940s and early 1950s, building codes were beginning to omit these requirements.</span></p><p><span>As codes were changing, other technological developments were making thin exterior walls made of metal and glass practical. Air conditioning was </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-evolution-of-indoor-climate-part" rel="">becoming common</a><span>, making it possible to cool buildings with large expanses of windows that might otherwise get too hot in the summer. Aluminum production had risen enormously during the war due to the needs of the aircraft industry, driving down its cost, and after the war manufacturers hunted for new markets that could absorb some of this capacity. Aluminum building cladding and window framing soon became an important new market. In 1948, aluminum-framed windows were just 5% of the market: by 1956, that had risen to 20%. The new headquarters of aluminum manufacturer Alcoa, built in 1952, was described as “one big showcase of aluminum,” with aluminum “walls, roofs, ceilings, doors, hardware, baseboards” and much more. From Tom Leslie’s </span><a href="https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=c044953" rel="">history of Chicago skycrapers</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The building’s “most important feature…from the standpoint of future large-volume use of aluminum in skyscrapers,” though, was its cladding system of stamped aluminum panels with integral windows, each just an eighth of an inch thick and factory-assembled, avoiding complex assembly on-site.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Glass, too, was getting cheaper. In the 1950s, British glass manufacturer Pilkington invented the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Float_glass" rel="">float glass process</a><span>, which produced glass by casting it on a pool of molten tin. The resulting surface was nearly defect-free, eliminating the costly grinding process flat glass had previously required and greatly reducing the cost of high-quality window glass. Between the late 1950s and the 2010s the cost of flat glass fell by 75% in inflation-adjusted terms.</span></p><p>These developments made it possible to replace thick, heavy walls of stone and brick with thin, light curtain walls made of glass and aluminum. And while this style of construction was indeed championed by modernist architects, it also had decisive advantages from a real estate developer’s perspective.</p><p>The most obvious was cost. A glass and metal curtain wall wasn’t necessarily all that much cheaper than one made of brick in terms of the materials themselves, but it was much thinner and lighter. Its thinness meant that for two equally sized floor plates, the curtain wall framed one would have more rentable square feet than the stone or brick one. This more than made up for the fact that the thin curtain walls had worse insulation and were more expensive to heat and cool than masonry walls.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png" width="588" height="539" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:539,&quot;width&quot;:588,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01807e1-8404-4bae-976d-5aa36feecc06_588x539.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via Architectural Forum.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Similarly, the fact that a glass and metal curtain wall was so light meant that less structural framing was required to support it.

Curtain wall could also be produced as large, prefabricated panels, allowing for very rapid installation on-site and eliminating expensive craft trades like masons.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-154617516" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-skyscrapers-became-glass-boxes#footnote-2-154617516" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> With curtain wall, a building no longer needed scaffolding around the edge of the building for masons to work on: the curtain wall panels could simply be swung into place. From </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ecologies-Building-Envelope-Material-Architectural/dp/1948765187" rel="">The Ecologies of the Building Envelope</a></em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Facades for office towers composed of prefabricated panels could be literally installed within days, and were done so with fanfare to incite a growing clientele… Emery Roth and Sons’ 1954 National Distillers Building, at 99 Park Avenue, featured a prefabricated curtain wall “comprising 1800 two-story-high panels.” It was erected in “six-and-a-half working days, a remarkable feat compared with the eight weeks or more that a conventional masonry facade would have required.” This building was originally specified to be clad in masonry. However, the executives of the Tishman realty and Construction Company “had been impressed with the facade of [Alcoa’s] Pittsburgh headquarters” and decided to switch to aluminum. In the same year, Emery Roth and Sons was commissioned to clad 460 Park Avenue, and astonishingly did so in a single day.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>The cost advantages of curtain wall still exist today: if you use </span><a href="https://www.rsmeans.com/" rel="">RSMeans</a><span>’ pricing tool on a high-rise apartment building, curtain wall will come out cheaper than either precast concrete cladding or brick (though it will be more expensive than the even cheaper </span><a href="https://www.rockwool.com/north-america/products-and-applications/exterior-wall-insulation/exterior-insulation-finish-systems/#:~:text=Exterior%20Insulation%20and%20Finish%20Systems%20(EIFS)%20are%20non%2Dload,to%20meet%20increasingly%20more%20stringent" rel="">EIFS</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>There were also functional advantages of curtain wall that made it attractive to tenants. Large expanses of glass let in lots of natural light and maximized the amount of floor space that had nice views, two things that tenants valued highly (and were willing to pay for). Continuous expanses of glass also made it very easy to rearrange interior office partitions, as Richard Roth noted in an </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/sim_progressive-architecture_1957-06_38_6/page/196/mode/2up" rel="">article in Progressive Architecture</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Architecturally strong and impressive as the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Center" rel="">Radio City masses</a><span> may be, they do not, with their window-pier-window design, allow for this interior planning flexibility. Therefore — the new exterior design to suit interior plan spacing. It is as simple as that! Window-mullion-window-mullion (445 Park Avenue — Kahn and Jacobs): strip building with continuous windows and continuous masonry spandrels (575 Madison Avenue — Emery Roth and Sons): metal and glass “skin” buildings (Lever House — Skidmore Owings and Merrill): and the metal and metal with the windows losing their accent in the dominance of the metal (99 Park Avenue — Emery Roth and Sons).</span></em></p></blockquote><p>But the popularity of curtain wall is only half of what needs to be explained. A preference for glass and metal cladding, wouldn’t, on its own, eliminate ornament and decoration on buildings. Ornamentation and glass curtain wall aren’t mutually exclusive.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png" width="1456" height="1121" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1121,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eb4530f-dee4-406f-80e3-d844017a8a01_1600x1232.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Hallidie Building, with glass curtain wall and gothic detailing, built in 1918.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The elimination of ornament also comes down to economics. As we noted earlier, developers place a great deal of weight on what tenants want, and what they’re willing to pay for. And the reality is that while tenants care a great deal about what the </span><em>inside</em><span> of the building is like, they pay much less attention to the exterior of the building. Some developers, such as James Loewenberg, state this explicitly. From </span><em>How Real Estate Developers Think</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“The person who looks to buy or rent a unit in a high-rise,” says Loewenberg, “only cares about three things: the location of the building, the layout of their unit, and the view from their unit. They don’t care as much about the physical appearance of the building and it is my contention that they never really look above the third floor…”</em></p><p><em>Loewenberg recalls being roundly criticized by another critic for a project with a parking garage finished in exposed concrete. “He asked me, ‘Well, why are you putting marble thresholds in the apartments and why didn’t you spend the money on better finishes for your concrete garage?’ I guess it was heresy when I said, ‘Because people don’t care about what a garage looks like and in fact they would rather see a marble or granite countertop than a magnificent exterior on a garage.’ That critic,” says Loewenberg, “was trained as an architect, so he looks at the outside of the building and thinks that no shortcuts should be taken and that you should only do beautiful architecture. I, on the other hand, would rather put my money where it counts, and I happen to know that it is the finishes that sell.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Other developers aren’t quite so explicit that they don’t care about exteriors, but nevertheless echo these sentiments. In his book </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerhouse-Principles-Ultimate-Blueprint-Ever-Changing-ebook/dp/B0019MPHSS" rel="">Powerhouse Principles</a></em><span>, developer Jorge Perez emphasizes that as a developer you should “spend your money on work that can be seen”:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Obviously the building has to meet standards and codes and everything else, but what sells it is bathrooms, kitchens, flooring, landscaping, and amenities, those things that are highly visible and that people consistently note as higher priorities… We have found, particularly in the for-sale product, that changes you made to bathrooms and kitchens were of extreme importance. People will pay you an additional amount of money for those expenditures. If I spent $2 and I did it correctly, they would pay me $4 for the more beautiful kitchen.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Perez cares a great deal about the design of his projects, but his focus is on things where people spend their time: in their units, in the amenities, in the lobby, and so on. The interior designers he uses merit multiple mentions in his book. And while he also mentions a few high-end architects he’s worked with (Arquitectonica, Robert Stern), his buildings nevertheless tend to end up as basic boxes. </span><em>From How Real Estate Developers Think</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>While [Perez] hires award-winning architects to create his building’s exteriors, like Jim Loewenberg he also knows that it is where people live that matters, and that is why he focuses on the interior design of the public areas and the amenities.</em></p></blockquote><p>If exterior details and ornamentation are not something a tenant is willing to pay for, they’re not something a developer is inclined to spend money on. And simpler, less ornamented buildings are cheaper to build. Ornaments and details cost money. Articulation and interesting facade shapes increase the amount of (expensive) exterior cladding without a corresponding increase in rentable square footage, and add joints and connections that become potential points of failure.</p><p>When a developer does add ornament, it’s often in relatively limited ways in an attempt to get the most bang for their buck, ways that don’t change the size or shape of the building: making the windows a slightly different color, adding luxurious touches to one small, highly visible corner of the building, and so on. One developer described this process to me as “applying doilies.”</p><p>An example of this is Aqua Tower in Chicago, designed and built by James Loewenberg. Aqua won awards for its design, which features an undulating shape due to its curved, differently-sized balconies that extend beyond the edge of the building.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png" width="589" height="791" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:791,&quot;width&quot;:589,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1001481-351d-4af9-b2bf-fc6b683e2965_589x791.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Aqua Tower, Chicago.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Loewenberg notes that this design was incredibly simple and inexpensive to create:</p><blockquote><p><em>‘‘it is the simplest box we have ever built, and in fact, the hardest part of the job was convincing the contractors that other than the cost of the materials to extend the balcony slabs this would be no different from building the basic box.’’ Ultimately, Loewenberg was successful: ‘‘I finally browbeat the contractors enough to talk them into it.’’</em></p><p><em>…In the end, the only additional costs incurred to realize such a unique exterior design were the material costs of the extra concrete at the extended balconies and the labor costs of the two workers installing the edge form on each floor… “The total cost for all of it was probably a couple of hundred thousand dollars, which is nothing on a building of this size.’’ Aqua is eighty-two stories and contains nearly two million square feet of hotel space, apartments, and condominiums, and its total cost was about $500 million, so a couple of hundred thousand dollars to get that magnificent effect truly was peanuts.</em></p></blockquote><p>Of course, this desire to eliminate ornament which doesn’t contribute to the bottom line didn’t emerge suddenly following World War II: it had been a trend for decades prior to that. In his history of the Empire State Building, John Tauranac notes that in the early 20th century, real estate investors were becoming less and less inclined to fund “spurious” ornamentation that wouldn’t yield greater profits. This paragraph sounds like it’s describing modernist glass skyscrapers of the 1950s, but it's actually about Art Deco skyscrapers of the 1920s:</p><blockquote><p><em>…The demands of tenants probably more than the desire of avant-garde architects was responsible for the popularity of the modern style, of this functionalism. Tenants wanted the light and space that modern buildings afforded, and were willing to accept modern design to achieve their needs. Suddenly designs that only a few years before might have seemed radical had won a more secure place. It wasn’t that ornament cost so much more, but even if the syndicate had been willing to pay for the little extra for it, there were more fingers in the fiscal pie than those of the four primary underwriters. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company was a conservative investor whose goal, naturally enough, was to secure the greatest possible return upon invested capital. Underwriters were willing to tie up their investment over a period of many years, but less willing to pay for what was deemed redundant decoration. Hood told of one banker who rejected a design that was all gussied up. When the architect returned with something more practical, the revised plan was financed. Hood said that architects and developers were catching on to the fact that mortgage money would more readily go to office buildings in the modern, functionalist style than those designed in a more traditional style, a trend that would continue…</em></p></blockquote><p>This trend towards “financialization,” of viewing a building increasingly in economic terms and only adding features that could be financially justified, continued over the course of the 20th century. Following World War II, developers embraced modernism because it provided an excuse to construct buildings less expensively, notes Steven Ruttenbaum:</p><blockquote><p><em>For builders, it was getting increasingly more expensive to erect commercial structures and to hire craftsmen to decorate them with special flourishes. It is not that ornament became prohibitively expensive, it merely entailed more of an initial investment than builders were prepared to risk. They were, of course, in business to make money, not to “squander” it on things that had no relation to their buildings’ utility. And after World War II, it became increasingly easy for them to accept austere facades in light of the growing acceptance of the International Style. In the late thirties, the great European masters of modernism arrived in America as refugees from the Nazis, and they were fortunate in securing some of the nation’s most prestigious academic positions. It was only a short time until the economical style they espoused became accepted by speculative builders.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>In </span><em>Skyscraper Dreams</em><span>, Tom Schachtman likewise notes the bland designs of Emery Roth and Sons were in large part due to client feedback:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>…when they did try flights with more fancy, as often as no Richard and Julian were asked to scale back the more extravagant touches. Years later, when asked why he did not design more interesting buildings, Richard was heard to mutter that if he’d had more innovative clients he’d have produced more innovative designs. This was more humble than necessary: the designs were better than the critics suggested. And perhaps the forelock-tugging inherent in the statement was subtly encouraged by the Roths’ developer clients, to reinforce awareness of the minor place of the architect in the builder’s grand scheme. In a period in which beauty was no longer perceived a great sales tool, artistry in buildings was not assiduously cultivated.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Similarly, in his </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Architectural-Practice-Critical-Robert-Gutman/dp/0910413452" rel="">analysis of the architectural profession</a><span> in the 1980s, Robert Gutman notes that architects were increasingly pressured by clients to economically justify the aesthetic elements of their designs, in part because clients were increasingly organizations rather than individuals:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The most significant characteristic of the organization clients is their disposition to view architectural production from purely a rational and instrumental perspective. This means that the organization clients regard buildings as capital assets, which should be managed like every other potential source of productivity, income, and profit… All features of buildings come to be judged by these criteria, including the esthetic dimension, which traditionally was considered as outside of the realm of this system of calculation.</em></p><p><em>The prevalence of the instrumental mentality in the building and design process represents the latest stage in the historical transformation of the architect-patron relationship, a process that began in the middle of the nineteenth century.</em></p></blockquote><p>Even non-profits aren’t immune from this sort of pressure:</p><blockquote><p><em>A fact that often surprises architects when they discover it for the first time is that the instrumental view of architecture has also taken over non-profit institutions, which formerly took a more casual view of their physical plant and regarded buildings primarily as works of architectural art. This new mentality regarding buildings is especially noticeable among university and cultural organizations in the non-profit sector. With the expansion in the number of universities, museums, symphony halls, and theaters, competition for funding is rapidly becoming more intense. Curators, presidents, and other managers of these institutions are under increasing pressure to justify their building needs in terms similar to those that apply to the profit sector.</em></p></blockquote><p>This tendency to omit decoration that buyers don’t seem to value isn’t limited to modernist, International Style skyscrapers.

On the </span><em>sides</em><span>, however, there’s virtually nothing: no stone cladding, no decoration on the windows, almost no ornament whatsoever. (In many houses, even the decorative </span><a href="https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/what-are-window-mullions-muntins/" rel="">muntins</a><span> on the windows will be omitted on the sides and back of the house.) Builders apparently believe that buyers don’t particularly value ornament other than on the front of the house, and so they omit it everywhere else. And since it’s very rare for owners to go and add any sort of ornament back in, it seems like the builders are correct.</span></p><p>Part of this is a problem of legibility. For some building features, like granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, or washer/dryer hookups, developers can quantify how much they’ll contribute to additional rents, and how much it's worth spending on them. But for exterior ornamentation, or simply an attractive exterior design, it’s much more difficult to quantify the benefits of it. If it can’t be included as an element in a financial model of the building, it's hard for a developer to justify spending money on it.</p><p>More generally, there seems to be a certain amount of market inefficiency in the construction of new buildings, for reasons I don’t quite understand. Some developers have told me that the value of good design is the sort of thing that accrues over the long term. A developer putting up a building and then holding on to it might be able to see that value (though convincing outside investors is another story), but for a merchant builder that’s going to turn around and sell it, it won’t be reflected in the price they’ll be able to get for it.</p><p>For these reasons, the unadorned glass box aesthetic became popular. And once a construction system becomes popular, numerous forces conspire to keep it in place. For one, a huge number of decisions in real estate are based on “comparables”: comparing your building to a similar building targeting a similar part of the market. This ultimately pushes new buildings to be similar to what’s already being built. Investors are risk-averse, and don’t want to fund a project that’s too different from what already exists and what the market expects. Developers don’t want to make risky design decisions, because bold choices are perceived to be polarizing, and are more likely to drive away tenants than they are to attract them. And for a developer, the downside of a project going poorly is much greater than a project doing exceptionally well, which incentivizes going with the tried and true. The more common a style becomes, the riskier it is for a developer or investor to deviate from it.</p><p>A similar logic drives architectural and engineering decisions. Architects and engineers want to use systems they’re familiar with and have used before: they already have the details and calculations for them (saving them time and effort), and the systems have been vetted and demonstrated to work. An architect who specifies a glass curtain wall that he’s used many times before can be confident that the system will perform as expected, that the waterproofing will work as designed, and so on. If instead he specifies a novel system, he’s both making more work for himself and taking a major risk in doing so.</p><p><span>On the construction side, contractors similarly prefer to use the tried and true rather than something novel with </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-its-hard-to-innovate-in-construction" rel="">significant downside risk</a><span>. On Aqua Tower, the contractor was extremely reluctant to build the novel curved balconies, not because they were expensive but because they were different. And if a construction system stops being used, the skilled labor that knows how to install it eventually disappears from the labor pool. Architects and developers have told me that one hurdle for specifying ornate masonry or stonework is that in many cases there’s a really limited number of skilled practitioners that can do that sort of high-quality work. It’s much easier, cheaper, and less risky for a developer to simply use the systems that local contractors are already familiar with.</span></p><h5>Is the glass box a market failure?</h5><p>So ultimately, the glass box aesthetic became popular not only because modernist architects liked it, but because it made buildings cheaper to build, and because developers gradually realized that ornate, highly-detailed exteriors weren’t particularly compelling to renters or to their investors. And once that aesthetic was in place, risk aversion and cost considerations kept it in place.</p><p><span>Of course, none of this means that it’s impossible to build anything other than a plain glass skyscraper. Many developers care deeply about good exterior design, believe more classical design adds value and makes their project more competitive, and get funding to build those sorts of projects. Architects like </span><a href="https://www.ramsa.com/index.php/projects" rel="">Robert Stern</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.ppapc.com/projects/the-benson-on-madison-avenue/" rel="">Peter Pennoyer</a><span> have designed and built several skyscrapers with brick and stone cladding, and interesting detailing. But these sorts of efforts are to some extent swimming against the current, which nudges developers towards a simpler, more modernist aesthetic.</span></p><p>One could argue that there’s a sort of market failure at work here: because architecture is ultimately funded by the people who occupy a building but viewed by people outside of it, there are externalities (in the form of benefits of attractive exteriors) that aren’t being appropriately priced in. An “efficient” market for architecture, which used some sort of mechanism to properly weigh the preferences of everyone who has to look at the building, might be expected to produce more beautiful buildings (for whatever your definition of beautiful is).</p><p>Unfortunately for proponents of this theory, we already have such a mechanism: as discussed above, building design is heavily influenced by design review boards, planning commissions, and other forms of community input. Our current system bends over backwards to consider local preferences and give weight to these sorts of externalities. This doesn’t seem to have had much of an impact on how “beautiful” buildings are, or the dominance of the glass box aesthetic: all it does is make them harder to build.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><b>Literate programming: Knuth is doing it wrong</b></p><p>
Literate programming advocates this: <em>Order your code for others to read,
not for the compiler. Beautifully typeset your code so one can curl up in bed
to read it like a novel. Keep documentation in sync with code.</em> What's not
to like about this vision? I have two beefs with it: the ends are insufficiently
ambitious by focusing on a passive representation; and the means were insufficiently
polished, by over-emphasizing typesetting at the cost of prose quality.
Elaboration, in reverse order:

<!-- more -->
<br>
</p><center><em>Canonizing typesetting over organization</em></center>

<p>
When I look around at the legacy of literate programming, systems to do
so-called semi- or quasi-literate programming dominate. These are systems that
focus on generating beautifully typeset documentation without allowing the
author to arbitrarily order code. I think this is exactly backwards; codebases
are easy to read primarily due to the author's efforts to orchestrate the
presentation, and only secondarily by typesetting improvements. As a concrete
example, just about every literate program out there begins with cruft like
this:<sup><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>

</p><pre><span>// Some #includes</span>
</pre>

<p>
or:

</p><pre><span>-- Don't mind these imports.</span>
</pre>

<p>
I used to think people just didn't understand Knuth's vision. But then I went
and looked at his literate programs. Boom, #includes:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/advent.w.gz">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/adventure.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
The example Pascal program in <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf">Knuth's
original paper</a> didn't have any imports at all. But when it comes to
organizing larger codebases, we've been putting imports thoughtlessly at the
top. Right from day one.

</p><p>
Exhibit 2:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/sat12.w">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/sat12.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
<em>“Skip ahead if you are impatient to see the interesting stuff.”</em>
Well gee, if only we had, you know, a tool to put the interesting stuff up
front.

</p><p>
Exhibit 3:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/sham.w">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/sham.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
This is the start of the piece. There's a sentence of introduction, and then
this:

</p><div>
<p><span>“</span>We use a utility field to record
the vertex degrees.

</p><p>
#define deg u.I
</p>
</div>

<p>
That's a steep jump across several levels of abstraction. Literally the first
line of code shown is a macro to access a field for presumably a struct whose
definition — whose <em>very type name</em> — we haven't even seen
yet. (The variable name for the struct is also hard-coded in; but I'll stop
nit-picking further.)

</p><p>
Exhibit 4: Zoom out just a little bit on the previous example:

</p><p>
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/programs/sham.w">
<img src="https://akkartik.name/images/literate-programming/sham2.png"></a>
<br clear="both">

</p><p>
Again, there's #includes at the top but I won't belabor that. Let's look at
what's in these #includes. "GraphBase data structures" seems kinda relevant to
the program. Surely the description should inline and describe the core data
structures the program will be using. In the immortal words of <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Fred
Brooks</a>:

</p><p><span>“</span>Show me your flowcharts [code]
and conceal your tables [data types], and I shall continue to be
mystified. Show me your tables, and I won’t usually need your flowcharts;
they’ll be obvious."
</p>

<p>
Surely a system to optimize order for exposition shouldn't be stymied by
<em>code in a different file</em>.

</p><p>
On the whole, people have failed to appreciate the promise of literate
programming because the early examples are just not that good, barring the
small program in Knuth's original paper. The programs jump across abstraction
layers. Problems are ill-motivated. There's a pervasive mindset of top-down
thinking, of starting from <span>main</span>, whether or not that's easiest to read. The
ability to change order is under-used, perhaps because early literate tools
made debugging harder, but mostly I think because of all the emphasis —
<a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf">right from the
start</a> — on just how <em>darn cool</em> the typesetting was.<sup><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>

</p><p>
All this may seem harsh on Knuth, but I figure Knuth can take it. He's, well,
Knuth, and I'm nobody. He came up with literate programming as the successor
to structured programming, meaning that he was introducing ordering considerations
at a time when most people were still using <em>gotos</em> as a matter of
course. There was no typesetting for programmers or academics, no internet, no
hyperlinking. No, these early examples are fine for what they are. They
haven't developed because <em>we programmers</em> have failed to develop them
over time. We've been too quick to treat them as sacred cows to be merely
interpreted (not noticing the violence our interpretations do to the original
idea anyway). I speculate that nobody has actually read anybody else's
literate programs in any sort of detail. And so nobody has been truly inspired
to do better. We've been using literate programming, like the vast majority of
us use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming">TAOCP</a>,
as a signalling device to show that we are hip to what's cool. (If you have
spent time reading somebody else's literate programs, I want to hear about
your experiences!)

<br>
</p><center><em>Canonizing passive reading over interactive feedback</em></center>

<p>
I've been indirectly maligning typesetting, but it's time to aim squarely at
it. There's a fundamental problem with generating a beautifully typeset
document for a codebase: it's dead. It can't render inside just about any
actual programming environment (editor or IDE) on this planet, and so we can't
make changes to it while we work on the codebase. Everybody reads a pdf about
a program at most once, when they first encounter it. After that, re-rendering
it is a pain, and proof-reading the rendered document, well forget about it.
That dooms generated documentation to be an after-thought, forever at risk of
falling stale, or at least rendering poorly.

</p><p>
You can't work with it, you can't try to make changes to it to see what
happens, and you certainly can't run it interactively. All you can do,
literally, is curl up with it in bed. And promptly fall asleep. I mean, who
reads code in bed without a keyboard?!

</p><p>
What's the alternative? In the spirit of presenting a target of my own for
others to attack, I'll point you at some literate code I wrote <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers">last
year</a> for a simple interpreter. A sample of what it looks like:

</p><pre>&nbsp;<span>// Programs are run in two stages:</span>
&nbsp;<span>//  a) _read_ the text of the program into a tree of cells</span>
&nbsp;<span>//  b) _evaluate_ the tree of cells to yield a result</span>
&nbsp;cell* run(istream&amp; in) {
&nbsp;  cell* result = nil;
&nbsp;  do {
&nbsp;      <span>// TEMP and 'update' help recycle cells after we're done with</span>
&nbsp;      <span>// them.</span>
&nbsp;      <span>// Gotta pay attention to this all the time; see the 'memory'</span>
&nbsp;      <span>// layer.</span>
&nbsp;      TEMP(form, read(in));
&nbsp;      update(result, eval(form));
&nbsp;  } while (!eof(in));
&nbsp;  return result;
&nbsp;}
&nbsp;
&nbsp;cell* run(string s) {
&nbsp;  stringstream in(s);
&nbsp;  return run(in);
&nbsp;}
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<span>:(scenarios run)</span>
&nbsp;<span>:(scenario examples)</span>
&nbsp;<span># function call; later we'll support a more natural syntax for</span>
&nbsp;<span># arithmetic</span>
&nbsp;(+ 1 1)
&nbsp;<span>=&gt;</span> 2
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<span># assignment</span>
&nbsp;(&lt;- x 3)
&nbsp;x
&nbsp;<span>=&gt;</span> 3
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<span># list; deliberately looks just like a function call</span>
&nbsp;'(1 2 3)
&nbsp;<span>=&gt;</span> (1 2 3)
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<span># the function (fn) doesn't have to be named</span>
&nbsp;((fn (a b)  <span># parameters (params)</span>
&nbsp;    (+ a b))  <span># body</span>
&nbsp;   3 4)  <span># arguments (args) that are bound to params inside this call</span>
&nbsp;<span>=&gt;</span> 7
</pre>

<p>
A <a href="http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers">previous post</a> describes
the format, but we won't need more details for this example. Just note that it
is simple plaintext that will open up in your text editor. There is minimal
prose, because just the order of presentation does so much heavy lifting.
Comments are like code: the less you write, the less there is to go bad. I'm
paying the cost of ‘<span>//</span>’
to delineate comments because I haven't gotten around to fixing it, because
it's just not that important to clean it up. You can't see it in this sample,
but the program at large organizes features in self-contained layers, with
later features hooking into the code for earlier ones. Here's <a href="http://akkartik.name/images/wart-layers/test.html">a
test harness</a>. (With, I can't resist pointing out, the includes at the
bottom.) Here's a <a href="http://akkartik.name/images/wart-layers/memory.html">garbage
collector</a>. <a href="https://github.com/akkartik/wart/blob/master/literate/030scope">Here</a>
I replace a flat namespace of bindings with dynamic scope. In each case, code
is freely intermingled with tests to exercise it (like the <span>scenarios</span>
above), tests that can be run from the commandline.

</p><pre>&nbsp;<span>$</span> build_and_test_until 029  <span># exercises the core interpreter</span>
&nbsp;<span>$</span> build_and_test_until 030  <span># exercises dynamic scope</span>
&nbsp;...
</pre>

<p>
Having built the program with just a subset of layers, you're free to poke at
it and run what-if experiments. <em>Why did Kartik write this line like
so?</em> Make a change, run the tests. <em>Oh, that's why.</em> You can add
logging to trace through execution, and you can use a debugger, because you're
sitting at your workstation like a reasonable programmer, not curled up in
bed.

</p><p>
Eventually I'd like to live in a world where our systems for viewing live,
modifiable, interactive code are as adept at typesetting as our publishing
systems are. But until that day, I'll choose simple markdown-like plain-text
documentation that the author labored over the structure of. Every single
time.

<br>
</p><center><em>footnotes</em></center>

<p>
<a name="f1">1.</a> Literate Haskell and CoffeeScript to a lesser extent allow
very flexible ordering in the language, which mitigates this problem. But then
we have their authors <a href="http://jashkenas.github.io/docco">telling
us</a> that their tools can be used with any language, blithely ignoring the
fact that other languages may need better tools. Everybody's selling mechanisms,
nobody's inculcating the right <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_mechanism_and_policy">policies</a>.

</p><p>
<a name="f2">2.</a> We've all had the little endorphin rush of seeing our
crappy little papers or assignments magically improved by sprinkling a little
typesetting. And we tend to take well-typeset documents <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/12/dont_make_the_d.html">more
seriously</a>. The flip side to this phenomenon: if it looks done <a href="http://blog.42floors.com/thirty-percent-feedback">you
won't get as much feedback on it</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Exclusive</span> Broadcom has lost another large customer for its VMware platform: Austrian cloud provider Anexia has moved 12,000 VMs, some of them rented by major European businesses, to an open-source system based on the KVM hypervisor.</p>
<p>Anexia was founded in 2006, is based in Austria, and provides cloud services from over 100 locations around the world by placing equipment in third party datacenters. Clients include remote access and control vendor TeamViewer, and airline Lufthansa – plus plenty more outfits that need reliable hosting and service to match.</p>
<p>CEO Alexander Windbichler told <i>The Register</i> that after Broadcom acquired VMware, increased licensing costs, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/10/broadcom_ends_vmware_partner_program/">made big changes to its partner program</a>, Anexia remained eligible to operate a VMware-powered cloud.</p>

    

<p>But Windbichler felt he couldn’t afford to continue, because Broadcom offered new terms that saw the cost of VMware licenses rise sharply. The CEO preferred not to enumerate the increase precisely however <i>The Register</i> understands it exceeded 500 percent.</p>

        


        

<p>Whatever the actual figure, Windbichler said the cost increase “Would have been existential for us.”</p>
<p>“We used to pay for VMware software one month in arrears,” he said. “With Broadcom we had to pay a year in advance with a two-year contract.” That arrangement, the CEO said, would have created extreme stress on company cashflow.</p>

        

<p>“We would not be able to compete with the market,” he said. “We had customers on contracts, and they would not pay for a price increase.”</p>
<p>Windbichler considered legal action, but felt the fight would have been slow and expensive.</p>
<p>Anexia therefore resolved to migrate, a choice made easier by its ownership of another hosting business called Netcup that ran on a KVM-based platform. Another factor in the company’s favour was that it disguised the fact it ran VMware with an abstraction layer it called “Anexia Engine” that meant customers never saw Virtzilla’s wares and instead worked in a different interface to manage their VM fleets. The hosting company is also a big user of NetApp storage, so customer data was already stored in a resource independent of its VMware rig – any new VMs would just need to be pointed at existing volumes. A further fortuitous circumstance was that KVM can boot virtual machines created with VMware’s VMDK format.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/16/ingram_micro_vmware_broadcom_deal_ends/">Ingram Micro to 'stop doing business' with Broadcom, downgrade to 'limited engagement' on VMware</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/13/broadcom_q4_fy_2024_vmware/">Broadcom says VMware is a better money-making machine than it hoped</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/28/broadcom_vmware_vcdx_snafu/">No, Broadcom did not just end VMware's flagship VCDX certification program</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Windbichler and his team felt that Netcup’s platform could be upgraded to meet the needs of Anexia’s clients, some of whom use it to host mission-critical realtime workloads that demand low latency, and that Anexia engine could be adapted to work with a KVM back end.</p>
<p>But the terms of Anexia’s licenses meant it had a handful of months to get the job done before price rises and a two-year subscription kicked in – and less time to convince customers who signed up for VMware-powered services that the new platform would do the job.</p>
<h3>‘Fighting for a cause’</h3>
<p>Windbichler felt customers would oppose the move, so created a presentation in which he pitched the move as more than a cost-saving migration.</p>
<p>“We said we are fighting for a cause,” he said. “I did not expect that customers would care about that, but they were happy to do it.”</p>

        

<p>Among the factors that he feels got customers over the line were media articles about Broadcom’s actions, including some from <i>The Register</i>.</p>
<p>Through early 2024, Anexia’s developer team worked to improve the Netcup platform and create a simple migration tool. The result was an agent that runs on a guest VM and presents info in Anexia engine that helps customers understand if a VM is ready to move from VMware to KVM.</p>
<p>If a customer agrees to migrate, it takes one click and a brief pause for a VM reboot – an act which maps a VM to storage and converted it to the appropriate virtual disk format– and workloads resume as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Windbichler said the migration tool was delivered in time for all Anexia customers, and their 12,000 VMs, to migrate by May 2024.</p>
<p>The process wasn’t easy, as the migration process meant that for a brief time two instances of a VM would exist, requiring more hardware capacity than the company might possess in some of its locations. Careful resource management planning was needed, as some customers could not easily find a change window and it was hard to ensure servers and storage would be ready for the move. Anexia pulled it off without having to alter its physical fleet, which given its widespread operations would have added enormous complexity to the project.</p>
<h3>Broadcom ‘lost all the trust’</h3>
<p>The CEO rates the project the most complex thing Anexia has done, and in conversation with <i>The Register</i> was full of praise for his team who he said did amazing work and now feel they were part of a once-in-a-lifetime effort.</p>
<p>That team is now growing, as without VMware bills – and all customers still aboard – Anexia’s balance sheet is in good shape.</p>
<p>“We have free budget to work on the open source solution and make us sovereign for us and our customers,” Windbichler said.</p>
<p>The CEO thinks more companies will move from VMware.</p>
<p>“I do not believe Broadcom will be successful,” he told <i>The Register</i>. “They lost all the trust. I have talked to so many VMware customers and they say they cannot work with a company like that.”</p>
<p>Regulators are also interested in Broadcom’s practices, he said. As Anexia tried to understand the impact of the VMware acquisition, it engaged with industry group Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), which was able to arrange meetings with EU officials. Windbichler believes those engagements led to some of Broadcom’s concessions to its channel. The CEO also found Austria’s competition authorities receptive. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div width="435"><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/the-origins-of-wokeness-1.gif" width="204" height="18" alt="The Origins of Wokeness"><span size="2" face="verdana">January 2025<p>The word "prig" isn't very common now, but if you look up
the definition, it will sound familiar. Google's isn't bad:
</p><blockquote>
  A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if
  superior to others.
</blockquote>
This sense of the word originated in the 18th century, and
its age is an important clue: it shows that although
wokeness is a comparatively recent phenomenon, it's an
instance of a much older one.<p>There's a certain kind of person who's attracted to a
shallow, exacting kind of moral purity, and who demonstrates
his purity by attacking anyone who breaks the rules. Every
society has these people. All that changes is the rules they
enforce. In Victorian England it was Christian virtue. In
Stalin's Russia it was orthodox Marxism-Leninism. For the
woke, it's social justice.</p><p>So if you want to understand wokeness, the question to ask
is not why people behave this way. Every society has prigs.
The question to ask is why our prigs are priggish about
these ideas, at this moment. And to answer that we have to
ask when and where wokeness began.</p><p>The answer to the first question is the 1980s. Wokeness is a
second, more aggressive wave of political correctness, which
started in the late 1980s, died down in the late 1990s, and
then returned with a vengeance in the early 2010s, finally
peaking after the riots of 2020.</p><p>This was not the original meaning of woke, but it's rarely
used in the original sense now. Now the pejorative sense is
the dominant one. What <i>does</i> it mean now? I've often been
asked to define both wokeness and political correctness by
people who think they're meaningless labels, so I will. They
both have the same definition:
</p><blockquote>
  An aggressively performative focus on social justice.
</blockquote>
In other words, it's people being prigs about social
justice. And that's the real problem — the
performativeness, not the social justice.<p>Racism, for example, is a genuine problem. Not a problem on
the scale that the woke believe it to be, but a genuine one.
I don't think any reasonable person would deny that. The
problem with political correctness was not that it focused
on marginalized groups, but the shallow, aggressive way in
which it did so. Instead of going out into the world and
quietly helping members of marginalized groups, the
politically correct focused on getting people in trouble for
using the wrong words to talk about them.</p><p>As for where political correctness began, if you think about
it, you probably already know the answer. Did it begin
outside universities and spread to them from this external
source? Obviously not; it has always been most extreme in
universities. So where in universities did it begin? Did it
begin in math, or the hard sciences, or engineering, and
spread from there to the humanities and social sciences?
Those are amusing images, but no, obviously it began in the
humanities and social sciences.</p><p>Why there? And why then? What happened in the humanities and
social sciences in the 1980s?</p><p>A successful theory of the origin of political correctness
has to be able to explain why it didn't happen earlier. Why
didn't it happen during the protest movements of the 1960s,
for example? They were concerned with much the same issues.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><span color="#dddddd">1</span></a>]</span><p>The reason the student protests of the 1960s didn't lead to
political correctness was precisely that — they were
student movements. They didn't have any real power. The
students may have been talking a lot about women's
liberation and black power, but it was not what they were
being taught in their classes. Not yet.</p><p>But in the early 1970s the student protestors of the 1960s
began to finish their dissertations and get hired as
professors. At first they were neither powerful nor
numerous. But as more of their peers joined them and the
previous generation of professors started to retire, they
gradually became both.</p><p>The reason political correctness began in the humanities and
social sciences was that these fields offered more scope for
the injection of politics. A 1960s radical who got a job as
a physics professor could still attend protests, but his
political beliefs wouldn't affect his work. Whereas research
in sociology and modern literature can be made as political
as you like.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><span color="#dddddd">2</span></a>]</span><p>I saw political correctness arise. When I started college in
1982 it was not yet a thing. Female students might object if
someone said something they considered sexist, but no one
was getting <i>reported</i> for it. It was still not a thing when
I started grad school in 1986. It was definitely a thing in
1988 though, and by the early 1990s it seemed to pervade
campus life.</p><p>What happened? How did protest become punishment? Why were
the late 1980s the point at which protests against male
chauvinism (as it used to be called) morphed into formal
complaints to university authorities about sexism?
Basically, the 1960s radicals got tenure. They became the
Establishment they'd protested against two decades before.
Now they were in a position not just to speak out about
their ideas, but to enforce them.</p><p>A new set of moral rules to enforce was exciting news to a
certain kind of student. What made it particularly exciting
was that they were allowed to attack professors. I remember
noticing that aspect of political correctness at the time.
It wasn't simply a grass-roots student movement. It was
faculty members encouraging students to attack other faculty
members. In that respect it was like the Cultural
Revolution. That wasn't a grass-roots movement either; that
was Mao unleashing the younger generation on his political
opponents. And in fact when Roderick MacFarquhar started
teaching a class on the Cultural Revolution at Harvard in
the late 1980s, many saw it as a comment on current events.
I don't know if it actually was, but people thought it was,
and that means the similarities were obvious.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><span color="#dddddd">3</span></a>]</span><p>College students larp. It's their nature. It's usually
harmless. But larping morality turned out to be a poisonous
combination. The result was a kind of moral etiquette,
superficial but very complicated. Imagine having to explain
to a well-meaning visitor from another planet why using the
phrase "people of color" is considered particularly
enlightened, but saying "colored people" gets you fired. And
why exactly one isn't supposed to use the word "negro" now,
even though Martin Luther King used it constantly in his
speeches. There are no underlying principles. You'd just
have to give him a long list of rules to memorize.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><span color="#dddddd">4</span></a>]</span><p>
The danger of these rules was not just that they created
land mines for the unwary, but that their elaborateness made
them an effective substitute for virtue. Whenever a society
has a concept of heresy and orthodoxy, orthodoxy becomes a
substitute for virtue. You can be the worst person in the
world, but as long as you're orthodox you're better than
everyone who isn't. This makes orthodoxy very attractive to
bad people.</p><p>But for it to work as a substitute for virtue, orthodoxy
must be difficult. If all you have to do to be orthodox is
wear some garment or avoid saying some word, everyone knows
to do it, and the only way to seem more virtuous than other
people is to actually be virtuous. The shallow, complicated,
and frequently changing rules of political correctness made
it the perfect substitute for actual virtue. And the result
was a world in which good people who weren't up to date on
current moral fashions were brought down by people whose
characters would make you recoil in horror if you could see
them.</p><p>One big contributing factor in the rise of political
correctness was the lack of other things to be morally pure
about. Previous generations of prigs had been prigs mostly
about religion and sex. But among the cultural elite these
were the deadest of dead letters by the 1980s; if you were
religious, or a virgin, this was something you tended to
conceal rather than advertise. So the sort of people who
enjoy being moral enforcers had become starved of things to
enforce. A new set of rules was just what they'd been
waiting for.</p><p>Curiously enough, the tolerant side of the 1960s left helped
create the conditions in which the intolerant side
prevailed. The relaxed social rules advocated by the old,
easy-going hippy left became the dominant ones, at least
among the elite, and this left nothing for the naturally
intolerant to be intolerant about.</p><p>Another possibly contributing factor was the fall of the
Soviet empire. Marxism had been a popular focus of moral
purity on the left before political correctness emerged as a
competitor, but the pro-democracy movements in Eastern Bloc
countries took most of the shine off it. Especially the fall
of the Berlin Wall in 1989. You couldn't be on the side of
the Stasi. I remember looking at the moribund Soviet Studies
section of a used bookshop in Cambridge in the late 1980s
and thinking "what will those people go on about now?" As it
turned out the answer was right under my nose.</p><p>One thing I noticed at the time about the first phase of
political correctness was that it was more popular with
women than men. As many writers (perhaps most eloquently
George Orwell) have observed, women seem more attracted than
men to the idea of being moral enforcers. But there was
another more specific reason women tended to be the
enforcers of political correctness. There was at this time a
great backlash against sexual harassment; the mid 1980s were
the point when the definition of sexual harassment was
expanded from explicit sexual advances to creating a
"hostile environment." Within universities the classic form
of accusation was for a (female) student to say that a
professor made her "feel uncomfortable." But the vagueness
of this accusation allowed the radius of forbidden behavior
to expand to include talking about heterodox ideas. Those
make people uncomfortable too.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><span color="#dddddd">5</span></a>]</span><p>Was it sexist to propose that Darwin's greater male
variability hypothesis might explain some variation in human
performance? Sexist enough to get Larry Summers pushed out
as president of Harvard, apparently. One woman who heard the
talk in which he mentioned this idea said it made her feel
"physically ill" and that she had to leave halfway through.
If the test of a hostile environment is how it makes people
feel, this certainly sounds like one. And yet it does seem
plausible that greater male variability explains some of the
variation in human performance. So which should prevail,
comfort or truth? Surely if truth should prevail anywhere,
it should be in universities; that's supposed to be their
specialty; but for decades starting in the late 1980s the
politically correct tried to pretend this conflict didn't
exist.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><span color="#dddddd">6</span></a>]</span><p>Political correctness seemed to burn out in the second half
of the 1990s. One reason, perhaps the main reason, was that
it literally became a joke. It offered rich material for
comedians, who performed their usual disinfectant action
upon it. Humor is one of the most powerful weapons against
priggishness of any sort, because prigs, being humorless,
can't respond in kind. Humor was what defeated Victorian
prudishness, and by 2000 it seemed to have done the same
thing to political correctness.</p><p>Unfortunately this was an illusion. Within universities the
embers of political correctness were still glowing brightly.
After all, the forces that created it were still there. The
professors who started it were now becoming deans and
department heads. And in addition to their departments there
were now a bunch of new ones explicitly focused on social
justice. Students were still hungry for things to be morally
pure about. And there had been an explosion in the number of
university administrators, many of whose jobs involved
enforcing various forms of political correctness.</p><p>In the early 2010s the embers of political correctness burst
into flame anew. There were several differences between this
new phase and the original one. It was more virulent. It
spread further into the real world, although it still burned
hottest within universities. And it was concerned with a
wider variety of sins. In the first phase of political
correctness there were really only three things people got
accused of: sexism, racism, and homophobia (which at the
time was a neologism invented for the purpose). But between
then and 2010 a lot of people had spent a lot of time trying
to invent new kinds of -isms and -phobias and seeing which
could be made to stick.</p><p>The second phase was, in multiple senses, political
correctness metastasized. Why did it happen when it did? My
guess is that it was due to the rise of social media,
particularly Tumblr and Twitter, because one of the most
distinctive features of the second wave of political
correctness was the <i>cancel mob</i>: a mob of angry people
uniting on social media to get someone ostracized or fired.
Indeed this second wave of political correctness was
originally called "cancel culture"; it didn't start to be
called "wokeness" till the 2020s.</p><p>One aspect of social media that surprised almost everyone at
first was the popularity of outrage. Users seemed to <i>like</i>
being outraged. We're so used to this idea now that we take
it for granted, but really it's pretty strange. Being
outraged is not a pleasant feeling. You wouldn't expect
people to seek it out. But they do. And above all, they want
to share it. I happened to be running a forum from 2007 to
2014, so I can actually quantify how much they want to share
it: our users were about three times more likely to upvote
something if it outraged them.</p><p>This tilt toward outrage wasn't due to wokeness. It's an
inherent feature of social media, or at least this
generation of it. But it did make social media the perfect
mechanism for fanning the flames of wokeness.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f7n"><span color="#dddddd">7</span></a>]</span><p>It wasn't just public social networks that drove the rise of
wokeness though. Group chat apps were also critical,
especially in the final step, cancellation. Imagine if a
group of employees trying to get someone fired had to do it
using only email. It would be hard to organize a mob. But
once you have group chat, mobs form naturally.</p><p>Another contributing factor in this second wave of political
correctness was the dramatic increase in the polarization of
the press. In the print era, newspapers were constrained to
be, or at least seem, politically neutral. The department
stores that ran ads in the New York Times wanted to reach
everyone in the region, both liberal and conservative, so
the Times had to serve both. But the Times didn't regard
this neutrality as something forced upon them. They embraced
it as their duty as a <i>paper of record</i> — as one of the big
newspapers that aimed to be chronicles of their times,
reporting every sufficiently important story from a neutral
point of view.</p><p>When I grew up the papers of record seemed timeless, almost
sacred institutions. Papers like the New York Times and
Washington Post had immense prestige, partly because other
sources of news were limited, but also because they did make
some effort to be neutral.</p><p>Unfortunately it turned out that the paper of record was
mostly an artifact of the constraints imposed by print.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f8n"><span color="#dddddd">8</span></a>]</span>
When your market was determined by geography, you had
to be neutral. But publishing online enabled — in fact
probably forced — newspapers to switch to serving markets
defined by ideology instead of geography. Most that remained
in business fell in the direction they'd already been
leaning: left. On October 11, 2020 the New York Times
announced that "The paper is in the midst of an evolution
from the stodgy paper of record into a juicy collection of
great narratives."
<span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f9n"><span color="#dddddd">9</span></a>]</span>
Meanwhile journalists, of a sort,
had arisen to serve the right as well. And so journalism,
which in the previous era had been one of the great
centralizing forces, now became one of the great polarizing
ones.<p>The rise of social media and the increasing polarization of
journalism reinforced one another. In fact there arose a new
variety of journalism involving a loop through social media.
Someone would say something controversial on social media.
Within hours it would become a news story. Outraged readers
would then post links to the story on social media, driving
further arguments online. It was the cheapest source of
clicks imaginable. You didn't have to maintain overseas news
bureaus or pay for month-long investigations. All you had to
do was watch Twitter for controversial remarks and repost
them on your site, with some additional comments to inflame
readers further.</p><p>For the press there was money in wokeness. But they weren't
the only ones. That was one of the biggest differences
between the two waves of political correctness: the first
was driven almost entirely by amateurs, but the second was
often driven by professionals. For some it was their whole
job. By 2010 a new class of administrators had arisen whose
job was basically to enforce wokeness. They played a role
similar to that of the political commissars who got attached
to military and industrial organizations in the USSR: they
weren't directly in the flow of the organization's work, but
watched from the side to ensure that nothing improper
happened in the doing of it. These new administrators could
often be recognized by the word "inclusion" in their titles.
Within institutions this was the preferred euphemism for
wokeness; a new list of banned words, for example, would
usually be called an "inclusive language guide."
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f10n"><span color="#dddddd">10</span></a>]</span><p>This new class of bureaucrats pursued a woke agenda as if
their jobs depended on it, because they did. If you hire
people to keep watch for a particular type of problem,
they're going to find it, because otherwise there's no
justification for their existence.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f11n"><span color="#dddddd">11</span></a>]</span>
But these
bureaucrats also represented a second and possibly even
greater danger. Many were involved in hiring, and when
possible they tried to ensure their employers hired only
people who shared their political beliefs. The most
egregious cases were the new "DEI statements" that some
universities started to require from faculty candidates,
proving their commitment to wokeness. Some universities used
these statements as the initial filter and only even
considered candidates who scored high enough on them. You're
not hiring Einstein that way; imagine what you get instead.<p>Another factor in the rise of wokeness was the Black Lives
Matter movement, which started in 2013 when a white man was
acquitted after killing a black teenager in Florida. But
this didn't launch wokeness; it was well underway by 2013.</p><p>Similarly for the Me Too Movement, which took off in 2017
after the first news stories about Harvey Weinstein's
history of raping women. It accelerated wokeness, but didn't
play the same role in launching it that the 80s version did
in launching political correctness.</p><p>The election of Donald Trump in 2016 also accelerated
wokeness, particularly in the press, where outrage now meant
traffic. Trump made the New York Times a lot of money:
headlines during his first administration mentioned his name
at about four times the rate of previous presidents.</p><p>In 2020 we saw the biggest accelerant of all, after a white
police officer asphyxiated a black suspect on video. At this
point the metaphorical fire became a literal one, as violent
protests broke out across America. But in retrospect this
turned out to be peak woke, or close to it. By every measure
I've seen, wokeness peaked in 2020 or 2021.</p><p>Wokeness is sometimes described as a mind-virus. What makes
it viral is that it defines new types of impropriety. Most
people are afraid of impropriety; they're never exactly sure
what the social rules are or which ones they might be
breaking. Especially if the rules change rapidly. And since
most people already worry that they might be breaking rules
they don't know about, if you tell them they're breaking a
rule, their default reaction is to believe you. Especially
if multiple people tell them. Which in turn is a recipe for
exponential growth. Zealots invent some new impropriety to
avoid. The first people to adopt it are fellow zealots,
eager for new ways to signal their virtue. If there are
enough of these, the initial group of zealots is followed by
a much larger group, motivated by fear. They're not trying
to signal virtue; they're just trying to avoid getting in
trouble. At this point the new impropriety is now firmly
established. Plus its success has increased the rate of
change in social rules, which, remember, is one of the
reasons people are nervous about which rules they might be
breaking. So the cycle accelerates.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f12n"><span color="#dddddd">12</span></a>]</span><p>What's true of individuals is even more true of
organizations. Especially organizations without a powerful
leader. Such organizations do everything based on "best
practices." There's no higher authority; if some new "best
practice" achieves critical mass, they <i>must</i> adopt it. And
in this case the organization can't do what it usually does
when it's uncertain: delay. It might be committing
improprieties right now! So it's surprisingly easy for a
small group of zealots to capture this type of organization
by describing new improprieties it might be guilty of. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f13n"><span color="#dddddd">13</span></a>]</span><p>How does this kind of cycle ever end? Eventually it leads to
disaster, and people start to say enough is enough. The
excesses of 2020 made a lot of people say that.</p><p>Since then wokeness has been in gradual but continual
retreat. Corporate CEOs, starting with Brian Armstrong, have
openly rejected it. Universities, led by the University of
Chicago and MIT, have explicitly confirmed their commitment
to free speech. Twitter, which was arguably the hub of
wokeness, was bought by Elon Musk in order to neutralize it,
and he seems to have succeeded — and not, incidentally, by
censoring left-wing users the way Twitter used to censor
right-wing ones, but without censoring either.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f14n"><span color="#dddddd">14</span></a>]</span>
Consumers have emphatically rejected brands that ventured
too far into wokeness. The Bud Light brand may have been
permanently damaged by it. I'm not going to claim Trump's
second victory in 2024 was a referendum on wokeness; I think
he won, as presidential candidates always do, because he was
more <a href="https://paulgraham.com/charisma.html"><u>charismatic</u></a>; but voters' 
disgust with wokeness must have helped.<p>So what do we do now? Wokeness is already in retreat.
Obviously we should help it along. What's the best way to do
that? And more importantly, how do we avoid a third
outbreak? After all, it seemed to be dead once, but came
back worse than ever.</p><p>In fact there's an even more ambitious goal: is there a way
to prevent any similar outbreak of aggressively performative
moralism in the future — not just a third outbreak
political correctness, but the next thing like it? Because
there will be a next thing. Prigs are prigs by nature. They
need rules to obey and enforce, and now that Darwin has cut
off their traditional supply of rules, they're constantly
hungry for new ones. All they need is someone to meet them
halfway by defining a new way to be morally pure, and we'll
see the same phenomenon again.</p><p>Let's start with the easier problem. Is there a simple,
principled way to deal with wokeness? I think there is: to
use the customs we already have for dealing with religion.
Wokeness is effectively a religion, just with God replaced
by protected classes. It's not even the first religion of
this kind; Marxism had a similar form, with God replaced by
the masses.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f15n"><span color="#dddddd">15</span></a>]</span>
And we already have well-established
customs for dealing with religion within organizations. You
can express your own religious identity and explain your
beliefs, but you can't call your coworkers infidels if they
disagree, or try to ban them from saying things that
contradict its doctrines, or insist that the organization
adopt yours as its official religion.<p>If we're not sure what to do about any particular
manifestation of wokeness, imagine we were dealing with some
other religion, like Christianity. Should we have people
within organizations whose jobs are to enforce woke
orthodoxy? No, because we wouldn't have people whose jobs
were to enforce Christian orthodoxy. Should we censor
</p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/02/17/roald-dahl-books-rewritten-offensive-matilda-witches-twits/"><u>writers</u></a> or 
<a href="https://x.com/KoustaStavroula/status/1562034502897106946"><u>scientists</u></a> whose work contradicts woke doctrines?
No, because we wouldn't do this to people whose work
contradicted Christian teachings. Should job candidates be
required to write DEI statements? Of course not; imagine an
employer requiring proof of one's religious beliefs. Should
students and employees have to participate in woke
indoctrination sessions in which they're required to answer
questions about their beliefs to ensure compliance? No,
because we wouldn't dream of catechizing people in this way
about their religion.
<span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f16n"><span color="#dddddd">16</span></a>]</span><p>One shouldn't feel bad about not wanting to watch woke
movies any more than one would feel bad about not wanting to
listen to Christian rock. In my twenties I drove across
America several times, listening to local radio stations.
Occasionally I'd turn the dial and hear some new song. But
the moment anyone mentioned Jesus I'd turn the dial again.
Even the tiniest bit of being preached to was enough to make
me lose interest.</p><p>But by the same token we should not automatically reject
everything the woke believe. I'm not a Christian, but I can
see that many Christian principles are good ones. It would
be a mistake to discard them all just because one didn't
share the religion that espoused them. It would be the sort
of thing a religious zealot would do.</p><p>If we have genuine pluralism, I think we'll be safe from
future outbreaks of woke intolerance. Wokeness itself won't
go away. There will for the foreseeable future continue to
be pockets of woke zealots inventing new moral fashions. The
key is not to let them treat their fashions as normative.
They can change what their coreligionists are allowed to say
every few months if they like, but they mustn't be allowed
to change what we're allowed to say.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f17n"><span color="#dddddd">17</span></a>]</span><p>The more general problem — how to prevent similar outbreaks
of aggressively performative moralism — is of course
harder. Here we're up against human nature. There will
always be prigs. And in particular there will always be the
enforcers among them, the 
</p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/conformism.html"><u>aggressively conventional-minded</u></a>.
These people are born that way. Every society has them. So
the best we can do is to keep them bottled up.<p>The aggressively conventional-minded aren't always on the
rampage. Usually they just enforce whatever random rules are
nearest to hand. They only become dangerous when some new
ideology gets a lot of them pointed in the same direction at
once. That's what happened during the Cultural Revolution,
and to a lesser extent (thank God) in the two waves of
political correctness we've experienced.</p><p>We can't get rid of the aggressively conventional-minded.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f18n"><span color="#dddddd">18</span></a>]</span>
And we couldn't prevent people from creating new
ideologies that appealed to them even if we wanted to. So if
we want to keep them bottled up, we have to do it one step
downstream. Fortunately when the aggressively
conventional-minded go on the rampage they always do one
thing that gives them away: they define new <a href="https://paulgraham.com/heresy.html"><u>heresies</u></a> to
punish people for. So the best way to protect ourselves from
future outbreaks of things like wokeness is to have powerful
antibodies against the concept of heresy.<p>We should have a conscious bias against defining new forms
of heresy. Whenever anyone tries to ban saying something
that we'd previously been able to say, our initial
assumption should be that they're wrong. Only our initial
assumption of course. If they can prove we should stop
saying it, then we should. But the burden of proof is on
them. In liberal democracies, people trying to prevent
something from being said will usually claim they're not
merely engaging in censorship, but trying to prevent some
form of "harm". And maybe they're right. But once again, the
burden of proof is on them. It's not enough to claim harm;
they have to prove it.</p><p>As long as the aggressively conventional-minded continue to
give themselves away by banning heresies, we'll always be
able to notice when they become aligned behind some new
ideology. And if we always fight back at that point, with
any luck we can stop them in their tracks.</p><p>The number of true things we </p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/say.html"><u>can't say</u></a>
should not increase. If it does, something is wrong.<p><b>Notes</b></p><p>[</p><a name="f1n"><span color="#000000">1</span></a>]
Why did 1960s radicals focus on the causes they did?
One of the people who reviewed drafts of this essay
explained this so well that I asked if I could quote him:
<blockquote>
  The middle-class student protestors of the New Left
  rejected the socialist/Marxist left as unhip. They were
  interested in sexier forms of oppression uncovered by
  cultural analysis (Marcuse) and abstruse "Theory". Labor
  politics became stodgy and old-fashioned. This took a
  couple generations to work through. The woke ideology's
  conspicuous lack of interest in the working class is the
  tell-tale sign. Such fragments as are, er, left of the old
  left are anti-woke, and meanwhile the actual working class
  shifted to the populist right and gave us Trump. Trump and
  wokeness are cousins.<p>The middle-class origins of wokeness smoothed its way
  through the institutions because it had no interest in
  "seizing the means of production" (how quaint such phrases
  seem now), which would quickly have run up against hard
  state and corporate power. The fact that wokeness only
  expressed interest in other kinds of class (race, sex,
  etc) signalled compromise with existing power: give us
  power within your system and we'll bestow the resource we
  control — moral rectitude — upon you. As an ideological
  stalking horse for gaining control over discourse and
  institutions, this succeeded where a more ambitious
  revolutionary program would not have.

It helped that the humanities and social sciences also
included some of the biggest and easiest undergrad majors.
If a political movement had to start with physics students,
it could never get off the ground; there would be too few of
them, and they wouldn't have the time to spare.<p>At the top universities these majors are not as big as they
used to be, though. A 
</p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/the-end-of-the-english-major"><u>2022 survey</u></a> found that only 7% of
Harvard undergrads plan to major in the humanities, vs
nearly 30% during the 1970s. I expect wokeness is at least
part of the reason; when undergrads consider majoring in
English, it's presumably because they love the written word
and not because they want to listen to lectures about
racism.<p>[</p><a name="f3n"><span color="#000000">3</span></a>]
The puppet-master-and-puppet character of political
correctness became clearly visible when a bakery near
Oberlin College was falsely accused of race discrimination
in 2016. In the subsequent civil trial, lawyers for the
bakery produced a text message from Oberlin Dean of Students
Meredith Raimondo that read "I'd say unleash the students if
I wasn't convinced this needs to be put behind us."<p>[</p><a name="f4n"><span color="#000000">4</span></a>]
The woke sometimes claim that wokeness is simply
treating people with respect. But if it were, that would be
the only rule you'd have to remember, and this is comically
far from being the case. My younger son likes to imitate
voices, and at one point when he was about seven I had to
explain which accents it was currently safe to imitate
publicly and which not. It took about ten minutes, and I
still hadn't covered all the cases.<p>[</p><a name="f5n"><span color="#000000">5</span></a>]
In 1986 the Supreme Court ruled that creating a
hostile work environment could constitute sex
discrimination, which in turn affected universities via
Title IX. The court specified that the test of a hostile
environment was whether it would bother a reasonable person,
but since for a professor merely being the subject of a
sexual harassment complaint would be a disaster whether the
complainant was reasonable or not, in practice any joke or
remark remotely connected with sex was now effectively
forbidden. Which meant we'd now come full circle to
Victorian codes of behavior, when there was a large class of
things that might not be said "with ladies present."<p>[</p><a name="f6n"><span color="#000000">6</span></a>]
Much as they tried to pretend there was no conflict
between diversity and quality. But you can't simultaneously
optimize for two things that aren't identical. What
diversity actually means, judging from the way the term is
used, is proportional representation, and unless you're
selecting a group whose purpose is to be representative,
like poll respondents, optimizing for proportional
representation has to come at the expense of quality. This
is not because of anything about representation; it's the
nature of optimization; optimizing for x has to come at the
expense of y unless x and y are identical.<p>[</p><a name="f7n"><span color="#000000">7</span></a>]
Maybe societies will eventually develop antibodies to
viral outrage. Maybe we were just the first to be exposed to
it, so it tore through us like an epidemic through a
previously isolated population. I'm fairly confident that it
would be possible to create new social media apps that were
less driven by outrage, and an app of this type would have a
good chance of stealing users from existing ones, because
the smartest people would tend to migrate to it.<p>[</p><a name="f8n"><span color="#000000">8</span></a>]
I say "mostly" because I have hopes that journalistic
neutrality will return in some form. There is some market
for unbiased news, and while it may be small, it's valuable.
The rich and powerful want to know what's really going on;
that's how they became rich and powerful.<p>[</p><a name="f9n"><span color="#000000">9</span></a>]
The Times made this momentous announcement very
informally, in passing in the middle of an 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/business/media/new-york-times-rukmini-callimachi-caliphate.html"><u>article</u></a> about a
Times reporter who'd been criticized for inaccuracy. It's
quite possible no senior editor even approved it. But it's
somehow appropriate that this particular universe ended with
a whimper rather than a bang.<p>[</p><a name="f10n"><span color="#000000">10</span></a>]
As the acronym DEI goes out of fashion, many of these
bureaucrats will try to go underground by changing their
titles. It looks like "belonging" will be a popular option.<p>[</p><a name="f11n"><span color="#000000">11</span></a>]
If you've ever wondered why our legal system includes
protections like the separation of prosecutor, judge, and
jury, the right to examine evidence and cross-examine
witnesses, and the right to be represented by legal counsel,
the de facto 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/magazine/title-ix-sexual-harassment-accusations.html">parallel legal system</a>
established by Title IX
makes that all too clear.<p>[</p><a name="f12n"><span color="#000000">12</span></a>]
The invention of new improprieties is most visible in
the rapid evolution of woke nomenclature. This is
particularly annoying to me as a writer, because the new
names are always worse. Any religious observance has to be
inconvenient and slightly absurd; otherwise gentiles would
do it too. So "slaves" becomes "enslaved individuals." But
web search can show us the leading edge of moral growth in
real time: if you search for "individuals experiencing
slavery" you will as of this writing find five legit
attempts to use the phrase, and you'll even find two for
"individuals experiencing enslavement."<p>[</p><a name="f13n"><span color="#000000">13</span></a>]
Organizations that do dubious things are particularly
concerned with propriety, which is how you end up with
absurdities like tobacco and oil companies having higher ESG
ratings than Tesla.<p>[</p><a name="f14n"><span color="#000000">14</span></a>]
Elon did something else that tilted Twitter rightward
though: he gave more visibility to paying users. Paying
users lean right on average, because people on the far left
dislike Elon and don't want to give him money. Elon
presumably knew this would happen. On the other hand, the
people on the far left have only themselves to blame; they
could tilt Twitter back to the left tomorrow if they wanted
to.<p>[</p><a name="f15n"><span color="#000000">15</span></a>]
It even, as James Lindsay and Peter Boghossian
pointed out, has a concept of original sin: privilege. Which
means unlike Christianity's egalitarian version, people have varying
degrees of it. An able-bodied straight white
American male is born with such a load of sin that only by
the most abject repentance can he be saved.<p>Wokeness also shares something rather funny with many actual
versions of Christianity: like God, the people for whose
sake wokeness purports to act are often revolted by the
things done in their name.</p><p>[</p><a name="f16n"><span color="#000000">16</span></a>]
There is one exception to most of these rules: actual
religious organizations. It's reasonable for them to insist
on orthodoxy. But they in turn should declare that they're
religious organizations. It's rightly considered shady
when something that appears to be an ordinary business or
publication turns out to be a religious organization.<p>[</p><a name="f17n"><span color="#000000">17</span></a>]
I don't want to give the impression that it will be
simple to roll back wokeness. There will be places where the
fight inevitably gets messy — particularly within
universities, which everyone has to share, yet which are are
currently the most pervaded by wokeness of any institutions.<p>[</p><a name="f18n"><span color="#000000">18</span></a>]
You can however get rid of aggressively
conventional-minded people within an organization, and in
many if not most organizations this would be an excellent
idea. Even a handful of them can do a lot of damage. I bet
you'd feel a noticeable improvement going from a handful to
none.<span color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman,

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>The 'cab' is hinged round the bottom of the box structure, probably released by Keaton at the appropriate moment, and very likely sprung to assist the demolition.</p>

<p>The rest is just balanced on top and will fall at the slightest provocation.</p>

<p>You only see it move about 6 feet, so it doesn't have to last long. As I can see no evidence of a rope to pull it [and I don't think painting techniques would be good enough to paint it out afterwards] let's assume someone pushed it from a few yards further back then ran out of frame. It has no engine, of course.</p>

<p>If you watch it frame by frame, it's easier to see...</p>

<p>In the first 2 frames, all is well so far - except the bonnet/hood isn't quite seated properly. Also note Keaton's hand on the bodywork - that may already be loose [or may be part of the release mechanism]. The wheel at camera right isn't quite straight either...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/6p3N5.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/6p3N5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>By frame 3, that wheel is already falling off, before it even hits the bump...<br>
Incidentally, the bonnet/hood has dropped back into its correct position momentarily.<br>
After further analysis, the release has been triggered by frame 3. There is a disconnect at the rear, camera left, and I'm now certain the front wheel, camera right, has a sprung steering mechanism to push it the right way.  </p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/eTw65.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/eTw65.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>by frame 4, the catch has been released and the bodywork is hinging outwards...
The seat is also being hinged backwards and downwards, but we can't see that yet.
[Further evidence of the steering being sprung is that the initial impact with the dirt ridge  momentarily pushes it back straight. The rear wheel is also off by this point and the axle has dropped, assisting the slew - better detail at the end]</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/VlVI6.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/VlVI6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Keaton lifts the steering wheel away and the front panel falls forwards - assisting the demolition of the engine bay and grille. One thing to keep track of over the next few frames is that the steering column stays in position relative to the car's chassis, which could be quite a hazard.<br>
[My 'sprung steering theory' is that the spring force has now overcome the bump and is back on track. It's hard to tell from this point if it is only the steering, or if the axle itself bends forwards. [From what little I know of cars from this era, that axle ought to be a solid bar, with steering at the ends.]<br>
Further evidence now shows the entire axle turns, see detail at the end of the post.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/i27oC.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/i27oC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Now we can see the seat tilting, preventing Keaton from sliding forwards into the loose debris and containing him within the relative safety of the hinged box. Throwing his legs upwards as the seat drops is a) comedic and b) safer.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/ldc2m.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/ldc2m.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a>  </p>

<p>Now we get to see the steering column that didn't fall away ...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/M7SbO.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/M7SbO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Note he seems well aware that the steering column didn't fall away - construction error or design, we may never know. You can see him avoid it over the next few frames, even as the car takes a final lurch.<br>
You can also see the clear benefit in these final frames of the seat falling back to 45°, preventing him from sliding forwards.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/GLdFd.jpg" width="320"> <img src="https://i.sstatic.net/tKKOo.jpg" width="320"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/YFERy.jpg" width="320"> </p>

<p>And that's it. He's already stepping out of the car by frame 11.<br>
Note his exit route is a) planned and b) padded - the original car door.</p>

<p>That is probably a clue as to why the camera right wheel went first, to slew the car in a specific direction.</p>

<p>Ten minutes and both he and the car could be ready for another take.</p>

<p>Re: the slewing - I've been trying to decide if this frame shows the front axle bending to ensure it goes in that direction. I can't decide.<br>
Perhaps the release mechanism also disconnected the steering on that side, or sprung it across, to push it in the correct direction.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/ejcNh.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/ejcNh.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>
<a href="https://i.sstatic.net/ebM33.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/ebM33.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Last bit of evidence - from another source - the rear camera-left wheel drops first, assisting the slew, even as the front wheel is turning, before it hits the dirt at all...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/YNeql.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/YNeql.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a>
<a href="https://i.sstatic.net/84Pjh.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/84Pjh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>The front axle in its entirety turns too [on this better footage, there's no sign it bends, but it does turn as a whole piece.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/o66Vu.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/o66Vu.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p><strong>One final note...</strong></p>

<p>The wheels never come off. They're tethered, like a modern Formula 1 car.<br>
They fall over but never fully detach from the axle ends.<br>
If they weren't, pure chance would say one of them wouldn't land right next to its own axle - especially the rear which we see come loose long before the rest.  </p>

<p>It would appear that the only totally free-to-fly items are the radiator grille and the two headlamps. Everything else, including the last-to-fall front wing/fender, is held firmly in place, at least by one end.</p>

						<p>When I was analysing the structures of CYOA works a few years back, I began to recognise some strong recurring design patterns. I came up with some home-brewed terminology, but didn’t ever lay it out in a nice clear way. This is a non-exhaustive look at some of the more common approaches, somewhat-updated (a lot has changed since then).</p>
<p>I should stress that these aren’t discrete categories: while a lot of works will fall very straightforwardly into a single pattern, many will involve elements of multiple patterns. (And yes, I’m aware that you can often simulate one using the mechanics of another. That’s mostly beside the point.) Also, the example diagrams I’m using are smaller and simpler than would be&nbsp;likely in actual works.</p>
<p><strong>Time Cave.&nbsp;</strong>A heavily-branching sequence. All choices are of roughly equal significance; there is little or no re-merging, and therefore no need for state-tracking. There are many, many endings.</p>

<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>The time cave is the oldest and most obvious CYOA structure. It is often good for narratives about freedom and open possibility, adventures that could go&nbsp;<em>anywhere,</em>&nbsp;flights of fancy.&nbsp;Time caves tend to have relatively short playthroughs, but strongly&nbsp;encourage replay: they are broad rather than long. Even with multiple playthroughs, most players will probably miss a good deal of the content.</p>
<p>The time cave’s&nbsp;structure is both organised by chronological progression and detached from it.&nbsp;It’s ungrounded by regularity: possibility is&nbsp;<em>so</em> open that it often becomes fantastic or surreal, with different branches occupying wholly different realities. The player has velocity but little grasp, vast freedom but little&nbsp;ability to comprehend it.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;</em>Edward Packard’s earlier work (<a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/cyoa-structures-the-cave-of-time/">The Cave of Time</a><em>, </em><a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/cyoa-structures-more-packard/">Sugarcane Island</a>), Emily Short’s <a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/24/cyoa-structure-if/">A dark and stormy entry</a>; <a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/cyoa-structure-millennial-snark/">Pretty Little Mistakes</a><i>.</i></p>

<p><strong>Gauntlet.&nbsp;</strong>Long rather than broad, gauntlets have a relatively linear central thread, pruned by branches which end in death, backtracking, or quick rejoining. The Gauntlet generally tells one anointed story, which can be adorned with optional content or prematurely ended with failure; if there are multiple endings, they’re likely to derive from a Final Choice. Gauntlets rarely rely on state to any great extent (if they do, they are likely to evolve into a branch-and-bottleneck structure.)</p>

<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>The player is likely to realise that they are on a constrained path, but the presentation of side-branches matters a great deal – do they mean death? incorrect answers? travel back in time? blocked paths, footnotes, &nbsp;or&nbsp;scenic details? Most often,<em>&nbsp;</em>the gauntlet creates an atmosphere of a hazardous, difficult or constrained world. Sometimes this can be punishing or depressing; sometimes it can be darkly comic; sometimes it’s a sign that you’re in a work heavily dependent on reflective or rhetorical choice. Perhaps the easiest structure to author, gauntlets can be conceived of in similar terms to&nbsp;linear stories, and ensure that most players will see most of the important content.</p>
<p>There are two major varieties of gauntlet: deadly and friendly. Deadly gauntlets mostly prune the tree with&nbsp;<em>failure</em>; friendly ones mostly do so with short-range rejoining, and look a bit more like simple <em>branch-and-bottleneck</em> structures. Friendly gauntlets have been vastly more common in recent years, making up a high&nbsp;proportion of Twine works.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;</em><a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/20/cyoa-structure-spin-offs/">Zork: The Forces of Krill</a><em>. </em><a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=qgyhzznz7r5p64eq">Our Boys In Uniform</a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Branch and Bottleneck.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The game branches, but the branches regularly rejoin, usually around events that are common to all versions of the story. To avoid obliterating the effect of past choices, branch-and-bottleneck structures almost always rely on heavy use of state-tracking (if a game doesn’t do this, chances are you are dealing with a gauntlet).</p>
<p>Somewhat rarely, the bottlenecks may be invisible – the plot branches and never reaches an explicit rejoining node, but the choices at the end of each branch are the same or similar, creating an exquisite-corpse effect.</p>

<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>Branch-and-bottleneck games tend to be heavily&nbsp;governed by the passage of time, while still allowing the player fairly strong grasp.<em>&nbsp;</em>The branch-and-bottleneck structure is most often used to reflect the growth of the player-character: it allows the player to construct a somewhat-distinctive story and/or personality, while still allowing for a manageable plot. There’s a tendency – not a necessary one, by any means – for playthroughs to be very similar in the early game, then diverge as the effects of earlier choices accumulate. In order for the approach to work, it has to be used in a fairly large piece; you need time to accumulate change before producing results that reflect it.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;</em>This is pretty much how&nbsp;<a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2014/12/13/long-live-the-queen/">Long Live the Queen</a> works, and is the guiding principle of <a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/standard-patterns-in-choice-based-games/choiceofgames.com">Choice of Games</a> (Dan Fabulich uses the&nbsp;term <a href="https://www.choiceofgames.com/2011/07/by-the-numbers-how-to-write-a-long-interactive-novel-that-doesnt-suck/"><em>delayed branching</em></a>). It’s also a common plot structure in non-IF games that allow significant plot choices.</p>
<p><strong><br>
Quest.&nbsp;</strong>The quest structure forms distinct branches, though they tend to rejoin to reach a relatively small number of winning endings (often only one). The elements of these branches have&nbsp;a modular structure: small, tightly-grouped clusters of nodes allowing&nbsp;many ways to approach a single situation, with lots of interconnection within each cluster and relatively little outside it. Re-merging is fairly common; backtracking rather less so. Quests generally involve some level of state-tracking, and do poorly when they don’t. The minimal size for a quest is relatively large, and this category includes some of the largest CYOAs.</p>

<p><span><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>This mode is well-suited for journeys of exploration, focused on setting; the quest’s structure tends to be organised by geography rather than time. Indeed, most works of this kind involve a journey with a specific purpose in mind. Quests work well for grounded, consistent worlds, but within that context the player-character’s situation is constantly changing. The&nbsp;narrative&nbsp;tends to be fragmentary or episodic, like old-school D&amp;D encounters: little chunks of story which might not have any great significance for the big picture.</span></p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;</em>The <i>Fighting Fantasy</i> books and their descendants (<a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/cyoa-structures-cyo-rpg/">Lone Wolf</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2014/08/24/80-days-the-map-is-the-territory/">80 Days</a><em>).</em></p>
<p><span><b>Open Map.</b>&nbsp;Even though quests are structured by geography, time still plays an important part: there’s a built-in direction of travel. But take a&nbsp;CYOA structure, make travel between the major nodes reversible, and you&nbsp;have a static geography, a world in which the player can toodle about indefinitely. Often&nbsp;this is a&nbsp;<em>literal</em> geography and relies on extensive state-tracking both explicit and secret for narrative progress. But it’s not an uncommon mode for things with assumptions grounded in the hypertext-novel idiom – static but non-linear works like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.francoiscoulon.com/le_reprobateur.html">Le Reprobateur</a><em>.</em></span></p>
<p><a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openmap.png"><img data-attachment-id="1173" data-permalink="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/standard-patterns-in-choice-based-games/openmap/" data-orig-file="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openmap.png" data-orig-size="400,228" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="openmap" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openmap.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openmap.png?w=400" loading="lazy" src="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openmap.png?w=640" alt="openmap" srcset="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openmap.png 400w, https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openmap.png?w=150&amp;h=86 150w, https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openmap.png?w=300&amp;h=171 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></p>
<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>This is often used as an imitation of the default style of parser IF, although some may be parallel derivation from the former’s D&amp;D roots. As with classic map-based parser games, the narrative tends to become slower-paced and less directed; the player has more leisure to explore and grasp the world, but spends less of their time advancing the story.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;Duelmaster</em>;&nbsp;<a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=qfvfc6576i90py4w">Chemistry and Physics</a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sorting Hat.&nbsp;</strong>The early game branches heavily and rejoins heavily (branch-and-bottleneck is a likely model here), ultimately determining which major branch the player gets assigned to. These major branches are typically quite linear&nbsp;– sometimes they look like gauntlets, but they might be choiceless&nbsp;straight-shots.&nbsp;Sorting Hats almost always rely substantially&nbsp;on state-tracking in the early game, and often bottleneck at the decision point.</p>
<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>The Sorting Hat&nbsp;is a compromise between the breadth of more open formats and the depth of linear ones. Sometimes&nbsp;the nature of the various branches is signaled to the player; this is kind of important, in fact, because the player is pretty likely to notice the linearity of the second half and might assume that&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>of their choices will ultimately get funneled&nbsp;into that particular thread. The player gets a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> of influence over how the story goes; however, the author may end up effectively having to write several different games.</p>
<p><em>Examples: </em><a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2011/09/11/cyoa-structure-graphic-novels/">Katawa Shoujo</a><em>; </em><a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=es0sfij74uu4barv">Magical Makeover</a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Floating&nbsp;Modules.</strong>&nbsp;A mode only really possible in computer-based works. There is no tree – or, while there may be scattered twigs and branches, there’s no trunk. No central plot, no through-line: modular encounters become available to the player based largely on state, or perhaps randomly.</p>
<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>This is a challenging&nbsp;style to write for, both because it’s difficult to intuitively grasp – writers tend to rebound quickly to a more unified structure – and because few assumptions can ever be made about prior events.&nbsp;Without a large amount of content, the method tends to collapse into a linear system. Because play mechanics are largely about altering stats in order to negotiate a world, there’s a strong incentive to expose those stats to the player; repeated events chosen only to affect a stat (grinding) may be a feature.</p>
<p>There are different approaches to&nbsp;floating-module: <a href="https://emshort.wordpress.com/2016/04/12/beyond-branching-quality-based-and-salience-based-narrative-structures/">Emily Short has a tentative categorisation here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;</em>Pure examples of modular design are relatively rare. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040404061317/www.channelzilch.com/doug/battle.htm">King of Chicago</a>&nbsp;(hat-tip Sean Barrett)&nbsp;is an early example.&nbsp;<a href="http://storynexus.com/s">StoryNexus</a> and its conceptual relatives (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="http://varytale.com/books/book/short-bee/info/">Bee</a>) inhabit&nbsp;this space, though they&nbsp;generally impose some more linear-progression structure on it. (Alexis Kennedy uses the term <a href="http://www.failbettergames.com/storynexus-developer-diary-2-fewer-spreadsheets-less-swearing/">quality-based narrative</a> to describe the general approach: ‘pieces of story like mosaic tiles, not pipes or complex machinery.’)</p>

This is a very general pattern, and can co-exist with many others.&nbsp;<em>Trapped in Time</em>, for instance, is basically a cycle-and-growing Gauntlet;&nbsp;<em>Bee</em>&nbsp;tames its floating-module&nbsp;nature with a year-long loop structure.</p>
<p><em>Effects:&nbsp;</em>Loop&nbsp;and Grow emphasizes the regularity of the world while retaining narrative momentum. A justification is needed for why whole sections of narrative can repeat: the player-character is often following routine activities in a familiar space, engaged in time-travel, or performing tasks at a certain level of abstraction. This regularity often comes at the price of openness: many stories with a strong Loop&nbsp;and Grow structure involve a struggle against confinement or stagnation.</p>
<p>An important variation&nbsp;of&nbsp;loop-and-grow structures is&nbsp;<strong>spoke and hub:&nbsp;</strong>the game has several major branches, but they all originate at and return to a central node or set of nodes. The player may go out along each spoke once, or many times.</p>
<p><em>Examples:&nbsp;Bee</em>, <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=juj5b61griyoswn2">Trapped in Time</a>, <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=b6ljg2m07tmc2ffv">Solarium</a>.</p>
