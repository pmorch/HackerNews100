            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/bad-code-at-big-companies/">https://www.seangoedecke.com/bad-code-at-big-companies/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46082223">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header></header><section><p>Every couple of years <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/migrating-from-github-to-codeberg/">somebody</a> <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/10362">notices</a> that large tech companies sometimes produce surprisingly sloppy code. If you haven’t worked at a big company, it might be hard to understand how this happens. Big tech companies pay well enough to attract many competent engineers. They move slowly enough that it looks like they’re able to take their time and do solid work. How does bad code happen?</p>
<h3>Most code changes are made by relative beginners</h3>
<p>I think the main reason is that <strong>big companies are full of engineers working outside their area of expertise</strong>. The average big tech employee stays for only <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/04/19/whats-the-average-tenure-of-an-engineer-at-a-big-tech-company-ep-434/">a year or two</a><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. In fact, big tech compensation packages are typically designed to put a four-year cap on engineer tenure: after four years, the initial share grant is fully vested, causing engineers to take what can be a 50% pay cut. Companies do extend temporary yearly refreshes, but it obviously incentivizes engineers to go find another job where they don’t have to wonder if they’re going to get the other half of their compensation each year.</p>
<p>If you count internal mobility, it’s even worse. The longest I have ever stayed on a single team or codebase was three years, near the start of my career. I expect to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDcaRklX7q4">re-orged</a> at least every year, and often much more frequently.</p>
<p>However, the average tenure of a codebase in a big tech company is a lot longer than that. Many of the services I work on are a decade old or more, and have had many, many different owners over the years. That means many big tech engineers are constantly “figuring it out”. <strong>A pretty high percentage of code changes are made by “beginners”:</strong> people who have onboarded to the company, the codebase, or even the programming language in the past six months.</p>
<h3>Old hands</h3>
<p>To some extent, this problem is mitigated by “old hands”: engineers who happen to have been in the orbit of a particular system for long enough to develop real expertise. These engineers can give deep code reviews and reliably catch obvious problems. But relying on “old hands” has two problems. </p>
<p>First, <strong>this process is entirely informal</strong>. Big tech companies make surprisingly little effort to develop long-term expertise in individual systems, and once they’ve got it they seem to barely care at all about retaining it. Often the engineers in question are moved to different services, and have to either keep up their “old hand” duties on an effectively volunteer basis, or abandon them and become a relative beginner on a brand new system.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>experienced engineers are always overloaded</strong>. It is a <em>busy</em> job being one of the few engineers who has deep expertise on a particular service. You don’t have enough time to personally review every software change, or to be actively involved in every decision-making process. Remember that <em>you also have your own work to do</em>: if you spend all your time reviewing changes and being involved in discussions, you’ll likely be punished by the company for not having enough individual output.</p>
<h3>The median productive engineer</h3>
<p>Putting all this together, what does the median productive<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> engineer at a big tech company look like? They are usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>competent enough to pass the hiring bar and be able to do the work, but either</li>
<li>working on a codebase or language that is largely new to them, or</li>
<li>trying to stay on top of a flood of code changes while also juggling their own work.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are almost certainly working to a deadline, or to a series of overlapping deadlines for different projects. In other words, <strong>they are trying to do their best in an environment that is not set up to produce quality code.</strong></p>
<p>That’s how “obviously” bad code happens. For instance, a junior engineer picks up a ticket for an annoying bug in a codebase they’re barely familiar with. They spend a few days figuring it out and come up with a hacky solution. One of the more senior “old hands” (if they’re lucky) glances over it in a spare half-hour, vetoes it, and suggests something slightly better that would at least work. The junior engineer implements that as best they can, tests that it works, it gets briefly reviewed and shipped, and everyone involved immediately moves on to higher-priority work. Five years later somebody notices this<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> and thinks “wow, that’s hacky - how did such bad code get written at such a big software company”?</p>
<h3>Big tech companies are fine with this</h3>
<p>I have written a lot about the internal tech company dynamics that contribute to this. Most directly, in <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/seeing-like-a-software-company"><em>Seeing like a software company</em></a> I argue that big tech companies consistently prioritize internal <em>legibility</em> - the ability to see at a glance who’s working on what and to change it at will - over productivity. Big companies know that treating engineers as fungible and moving them around destroys their ability to develop long-term expertise in a single codebase. <strong>That’s a deliberate tradeoff.</strong> They’re giving up some amount of expertise and software quality in order to gain the ability to rapidly deploy skilled engineers onto whatever the problem-of-the-month is.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this is a good idea or a bad idea. It certainly seems to be working for the big tech companies, particularly now that “how fast can you pivot to something AI-related” is so important. But if you’re doing this, then <em>of course</em> you’re going to produce some genuinely bad code. That’s what happens when you ask engineers to rush out work on systems they’re unfamiliar with.</p>
<p><strong>Individual engineers are entirely powerless to alter this dynamic</strong>. This is particularly true in 2025, when <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-times-are-over">the balance of power has tilted</a> away from engineers and towards tech company leadership. The most you can do as an individual engineer is to try and become an “old hand”: to develop expertise in at least one area, and to use it to block the worst changes and steer people towards at least minimally-sensible technical decisions. But even that is often swimming against the current of the organization, and if inexpertly done can cause you to get <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1et7miz/what_you_need_to_know_about_performance/">PIP-ed</a> or worse.</p>
<h3>Pure and impure engineering</h3>
<p>I think a lot of this comes down to the distinction between <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/pure-and-impure-engineering">pure and impure software engineering</a>. To pure engineers - engineers working on self-contained technical projects, like <a href="https://ziglang.org/">a programming language</a> - the only explanation for bad code is incompetence. But impure engineers operate more like plumbers or electricians. They’re working to deadlines on projects that are relatively new to them, and even if their technical fundamentals are impeccable, there’s always <em>something</em> about the particular setup of this situation that’s awkward or surprising. To impure engineers, bad code is inevitable. As long as the overall system works well enough, the project is a success.</p>
<p>At big tech companies, engineers don’t get to decide if they’re working on pure or impure engineering work. It’s <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/not-your-codebase">not their codebase</a>! If the company wants to move you from working on database infrastructure to building the new payments system, they’re fully entitled to do that. The fact that you might make some mistakes in an unfamiliar system - or that your old colleagues on the database infra team might suffer without your expertise - is a deliberate tradeoff being made by <strong>the company, not the engineer</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s fine to point out examples of bad code at big companies. If nothing else, it can be an effective way to get those specific examples fixed, since execs usually jump at the chance to turn bad PR into good PR. But I think it’s a mistake<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> to attribute primary responsibility to the engineers at those companies. If you could wave a magic wand and make every engineer twice as strong, <em>you would still have bad code</em>, because almost nobody can come into a brand new codebase and quickly make changes with zero mistakes. The root cause is that <strong>most big company engineers are forced to do most of their work in unfamiliar codebases</strong>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imgur decided to block UK users. Honestly? I don’t really care that much. I haven’t actively browsed the site in years. But it used to be everywhere. Back when Reddit embedded everything on Imgur, maybe fifteen years ago, it was genuinely useful. Then Reddit built their own image hosting, Discord did the same, and Imgur slowly faded into the background.</p><p>Except it never fully disappeared. And since the block, I keep stumbling across Imgur links that just show “unavailable.” It’s mildly infuriating.</p><p><img src="https://blog.tymscar.com/imgur-uk/not-working.png" alt="Imgur showing unavailable in the UK"></p><h2 id="the-minecraft-shader-problem">The Minecraft shader problem<a href="#the-minecraft-shader-problem" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>Here’s a concrete example. I was playing Minecraft with some work colleagues and wanted to try different shaders. Most shader pages embed preview images hosted on Imgur. So I’d click through shader after shader, and every single preview was just gone. I couldn’t see what any of them looked like without the images.</p><p>This kind of thing happens constantly now. Old forum posts, Reddit threads, documentation pages, random project READMEs. Imgur links are still scattered across the internet, and in the UK, they’re all broken.</p><h2 id="why-i-didnt-just-install-a-vpn">Why I didn’t just install a VPN<a href="#why-i-didnt-just-install-a-vpn" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>The obvious solution is to use a VPN. Change your location, problem solved. But I have a few issues with that approach.</p><p>First, I just <a href="https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/wifi7speedhunt/">upgraded to 2.5 Gbps internet</a> and I don’t want to route all my traffic through a VPN and take the speed hit. I have this bandwidth for a reason.</p><p>Second, even if I installed a VPN on my main machine, what about my phone? My laptop? My desktop? Every device would need the VPN running, and I’d have to remember to connect it before browsing. It’s messy.</p><p>I wanted something cleaner: a solution that works for every device on my network, automatically, without any client-side configuration.</p><h2 id="the-network-level-approach">The network-level approach<a href="#the-network-level-approach" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>I already run a homelab with Traefik as my reverse proxy, Pi-hole for DNS, and everything declaratively configured with NixOS. If you’ve read my <a href="https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/nixosdockerwithsecrets/">previous post on Docker containers with secrets</a>, you’ll recognise the pattern.</p><p>The idea was simple: intercept all requests to <code>i.imgur.com</code> at the DNS level, route them through a VPN-connected container, and serve the images back. Every device on my network automatically uses Pi-hole for DNS via DHCP, so this would be completely transparent.</p><p>Here’s the flow:</p><ol><li>Device requests <code>i.imgur.com</code></li><li>Pi-hole returns my Traefik instance’s IP instead</li><li>Traefik sees the SNI hostname and routes to Gluetun</li><li>Gluetun tunnels the request through a VPN</li><li>Nginx (attached to Gluetun’s network) proxies to the real Imgur</li><li>Image comes back through the tunnel to the device</li></ol><h2 id="why-nginx-when-i-already-have-traefik">Why Nginx when I already have Traefik?<a href="#why-nginx-when-i-already-have-traefik" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>Good question. Gluetun isn’t a reverse proxy. It’s a container that provides VPN connectivity to other containers attached to its network namespace.

<p>The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacker News dataset</a> contains 28.74 million

<p>I don’t remember when I first started noticing that people I knew out in the world had lost their sense of erotic privacy, but I do remember the day it struck me as a phenomenon that had escaped my timeline and entered my real, fleshy life. It was last year, when I was having a conversation with a friend of mine, who, for the record, is five years younger than me (I’m 31). I told my friend about an erotic encounter I’d just experienced and very much delighted in, in which I had my hair brushed at the same time by two very beautiful women at the hair salon — one was teaching the other how to do it a certain way. When I finished my story, my friend looked at me, horrified.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They had no idea you felt something sexual about them,” she said. “What if they found out? Lowkey, I hate to say this but: you took advantage of them.” I was shocked. I tried to explain — and it felt extremely absurd to explain — that this had happened in my body and in my thoughts, which were private to me and which nobody had the right to know about. But they did have the right, my friend argued. She demanded that I apologize to the women for sexualizing them. Offended at having been accused — in my view, in extremely bad faith — of being some kind of peep-show creep, I tried to argue that I’d simply responded in a physical way to an unexpected, direct, and involuntary stimulus. Back and forth, back and forth, we fought like this for a while. In fact, it ended the friendship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were other conversations, too, that suggested to me that conceptions of love and sex have changed fundamentally among people I know. Too many of my friends and acquaintances — of varying degrees of “onlineness,” from veteran discourse observers to casual browsers — seem to have internalized the internet’s tendency to reach for the least charitable interpretation of every glancing thought and, as a result, to have pathologized what I would characterize as the normal, internal vagaries of desire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hence, there was the friend who justified her predilection for being praised in bed as a “kink” inherited through the “trauma” of her father always harping on her because of her grades. There was the friend who felt entitled to posting screenshots of intimate conversations on Twitter after a messy breakup so that she could get a ruling on “who was the crazy one.” Then there was the friend who bitterly described a man he was dating as a “fuckboy” because he stood him up, claiming that their having enjoyed sex together beforehand was “emotionally manipulative.” When I dug a bit deeper, it turned out the man in question had just gotten out of a seven-year relationship and realized he wasn’t ready to be sexually intimate, and while he was rude to stand my friend up, it shocked me how quick my friend was to categorize his rightfully hurt feelings as something pathological or sinister in the other person, and that he did this in order to preemptively shield himself from being cast as the villain in what was a multi-party experience. This last friend I asked: “Who are you defending yourself against?” To which he answered, to my astonishment: “I don’t know. The world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I choose these examples from my personal life because they express sentiments that were once the kind of stuff I encountered only in the messy battlegrounds of Twitter, amid discussions about whether Sabrina Carpenter is being oversexualized, whether kinks are akin to a sexual orientation, whether a woman can truly consent in an age-gap relationship, and whether exposure to sex scenes in movies violates viewer consent. It is quite easy to dismiss these “discourse wars” as a “puritanism” afflicting the young, a reactionary current to be solved with a different, corrective discourse of pro-sex liberation, distributed via those same channels. If only it were so! To me, the reality goes deeper and is bleaker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact is that our most intimate interactions with others are now governed by the expectation of surveillance and punishment from an online public. One can never be sure that this public or someone who could potentially expose us to it isn’t there<em>, </em>always secretly filming, posting, taking notes, ready to pounce the second one does something cringe or problematic (as defined by whom?). To claim that these matters are merely discursive in nature is to ignore the problem. Because love and sex are so intimate and vulnerable, the stakes of punishment are higher, and the fear of it penetrates deeper into the psyche and is harder to rationalize away than, say, fear of pushback from tweeting a divisive political opinion.</p>



<p>I should state at this point that this is not an essay about “cancel culture going too far,” a topic which can now be historicized as little more than a rhetorical cudgel wielded successfully by the right to wrest cultural power back from an ascendant progressive liberalism. This was especially true after the prominence of organized campaigns such as #MeToo. #MeToo was smeared by liberals and conservatives alike (united, as they always are, in misogyny) as being inherently punitive in nature, meant to punish men who’d fallen into a rough patch of bad behavior, or who, perhaps, might not have done anything at all (the falsely accused or the misinterpreted man became the real victim, in this view). #MeToo did make use of the call-out — the story shared in a spreadsheet anonymously or in a signed op-ed — but the call-outs had a purpose: to end a long-standing and long-permitted norm of sexual abuse within institutions. Underlying this was a discursive practice and a form of solidarity building in which people believed that sharing their stories of trauma en masse could bring about structural change. As someone who participated myself, I too believed in this theory and saw it as necessary, cathartic, and political, and far from vigilante justice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the pushback against #MeToo reveals a certain peril to storytelling as politics, not only in the retraumatization evident in the practice of revealing one’s most intimate harms before an infinite online audience, which could always include those listening in bad faith. But also, a discursive market opened up in which trauma became a kind of currency of authenticity, resulting in a doubled exploitation. This idea, while not very nice, lingers in the use of harm as an authoritative form of rhetorical defense. The problem here is not what is said, but how it is used. A friction has since emerged between an awareness of weaponization of harm and emotion and the continued need to express oneself as vulnerably as possible in order to come off as sincere. This friction is unresolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The organized goals of the #MeToo movement are missing from the new puritanism. I think that the prudish revulsion I’ve seen online and in my own life has as much to do with surveillance as with sex. Punishing strangers for their perceived perversion is a form of compensation for a process that is already completed: the erosion of erotic and emotional privacy through internet-driven surveillance practices, practices we have since turned inward on ourselves. In short, we have become our own panopticons.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>The prudish revulsion I’ve seen online and in my own life has as much to do with surveillance as with sex.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>On the rightmost side of the spectrum, punitive anti-erotic surveillance is very explicit and very real, especially for women. The Andrew Tates of the world and the practitioners of extreme forms of misogyny have no problem with using internet tools and social media websites for mass shaming and explicit harm. Covert filming of sex acts, AI deep fakes, extortion, and revenge porn are all realities one has to contend with when thinking about hooking up or going to public places such as nightclubs and gay bars. This is blackmail at its most explicit and extreme, meant to further solidify a link between sex and fear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that link between sex and fear is operating in more “benign” or common modes of internet practice. There is an online culture that thinks nothing of submitting screenshots, notes, videos, and photos with calls for collective judgement. When it became desirable and permissible to transform our own lives into content, it didn’t take long before a sense of entitlement emerged that extended that transformation to people we know and to strangers. My ex sent me this text, clearly she is the crazy one, right? Look at this dumb/funny/cringe Hinge profile! Look at this note some guy sent me, is this a red flag? Look at this random woman I photographed buying wine, coconut oil, and a long cucumber at the supermarket!&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think these kinds of posts sometimes amount to little more than common bullying, but they are on a continuum with a puritan discourse in which intimate questions, practices, and beliefs about queerness, sexuality, gender presentation, and desire are also subjected to days-long piles-on. In both instances, the instinct to submit online strangers to viral discipline is given a faux-radical sheen. It’s a kind of casual blackmail that warns everyone to conform or be exposed; a way of saying if you don’t cave to my point of view, redefine yourself in my image of what sexuality is or should be, and (most importantly) apologize to me and the public, I will subject you to my large following and there will be hell to pay. Such unproductive and antisocial behavior is justified as a step toward liberation from predation, misogyny, or any number of other harms. But the punitive mindset we’ve developed towards relationships is indicative of an inability to imagine a future of gendered or sexual relations without subjugation. To couch that in the language of harm reduction and trauma delegitimizes both.</p>



<p>There are other ways the politics of surveillance have become a kind of funhouse mirror. It is seen as more and more normal to track one’s partner through Find My iPhone or an AirTag, even though the potential for abuse of this technology is staggering and obvious. There are all kinds of new products, such as a biometric ring that is allegedly able to tell you whether your partner is cheating, that expand this capability into more and more granular settings. That’s all before we get into the endless TikToks about “why I go through my partner’s text messages.” That men use these tactics and tools to control women is a known threat. What is astonishing is the lengths to which some women will go to use these same technologies, claiming that they are necessary to <em>prevent </em>harm — especially that caused by cheating, which is now seen as some kind of lifelong trauma or permanently damnable offense instead of one of the rather quotidian, if very painful, ways we hurt one another. Each of these surveillance practices operates from a feeling of entitlement and control over other people, their bodies, and what they do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pundits like to decree sexlessness as a Gen-Z problem, to argue no one is fucking because they are too on their phones. However, it is always too easy to blame the young. It was my generation that failed to instill the social norms necessary to prevent a situation where fear of strangers on the internet has successfully replaced the disciplinary apparatus more commonly held by religious or conservative doctrine. Even when, as in my experience in the salon, I am acting in the privacy of my own body, someone is always there watching, ready to interpret my actions, problematize them so as to share in the same sense of magical thinking, the same insecurities, and to be punished for not being insecure in the same way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s only in retrospect that I’m able to realize the toll that constant, nagging interaction with my devices and the internet has taken on my thinking life <em>and</em> my sex life. I remember very viscerally when I’d just come out of the closet as bisexual in 2016. When I embarked on a journey to find the kind of lover I wanted to be, my only experience with the world of queerness was online through memes, articles, and others’ social media presentation of themselves and of politics. Queer sex was not something that could be discovered through sensation, through physical interaction, but was rather a catalog of specific acts and roles one was already expected to know. I was terrified of making some kind of mistake, of being the wrong kind of bisexual, of misrepresenting myself in an offensive way (could I use the term “soft butch” if I wasn’t a lesbian?), of being exposed somehow as a fraud. When the time came for me to have sex for the first time, what should have been a joyous occasion was instead burdened with a sense of being watched. I could not let the natural processes of erotic discovery take their course, so caught up was I in judging myself from the perspective of strangers to whom I owed nothing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it wasn’t just a matter of queerness, either. When I hooked up with men, I could only perceive of sex the same way, not as situational but as a set of prescribed acts and scenes, many of which I wanted to explore. However, this time I interrogated these urges as being sociogenic in nature and somehow harmful to me, when they were, in fact, private, and I did not, in reality, feel harmed. Because I wanted, at one point in my life, to be tied up and gagged, the disempowering nature of such a want necessitated trying to justify it against invisible accusations with some kind of traumatogenic and immutable quality. Maybe it was because I was raped in college. Maybe I was just inherently submissive. One of the great ironies in the history of sex is that pathologization used to be a way of controlling sexual desire. (All are familiar with the many myths that masturbation would turn one blind.) Now it is a way of exempting oneself, of relinquishing control of one’s actions so as to absolve them of scrutiny. My little bondage moment couldn’t be problematic if it couldn’t be helped. It couldn’t be subjected to interrogation if there was something I could point to to say “it’s beyond my control, don’t judge me!” One day, however, I came to an important revelation: The reality was much simpler. It was a passing phase, a desire that originated with a specific man and lost its charm after I moved on from him. There wasn’t some deterministic quality in myself that made me like this. My desire was not fixed in nature. My sexual qualities were transient and not inborn. What aroused me was wonderfully, entirely situational.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A situational eroticism is what is needed now, in our literalist times. It’s exhausting, how everything is so readily defined by types, acts, traumas, kinks, fetishes, pathology, and aesthetics. To me, our predilection for determinism is an expected psychological response to excessive surveillance. A situational eroticism decouples sensation from narrative and typology. It allows us to feel without excuse and to relate our feelings to our immediate embodied moment, grounded in a fundamental sense of personal privacy. While it is admirable to try and understand ourselves and important to protect ourselves from harm and investigate critically the ways in which what we want may put us at risk of that harm — or at risk of doing harm to others — sometimes desires just are, and they are not that way for long. Arousal is a matter of the self, which takes place within the body, a space no one can see into. It is often a mystery, a surprise, a discovery. It can happen at a small scale, say, the frisson of two sets of fingers in one’s hair at once. It is beautiful, unplanned and does not judge itself because it is an inert sensation, unimbued with premeditated meaning. This should liberate rather than frighten us. Maybe what it means doesn’t matter. Maybe we don’t have to justify it even to ourselves.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>&nbsp;We are very afraid not of sex, but of exposure.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>But in order to facilitate a return to situational eroticism, we need to kill the panopticon in our heads. That means first killing the panopticon we’ve built for others. There is no purpose in vindictive or thoughtless exposure. Not everything needs to be subjected to public opinion, not every anecdote is worth sharing, not every debate needs engagement, especially those debates which have no material basis to them, no ask, no funnel for all that energy. We need to stop confusing vigilantism with justice and posting with politics. That does not mean we stop the work that #MeToo started, but that revenge is a weapon best utilized collectively against the enemies of liberation. We need to protect the vulnerable from exploitative technologies and practices, repeatedly denounce their use, and work towards a world without sexual coercion, digital or otherwise.</p>



<p>On an individual level, we need to abandon or reshape our relationships with our phones and regain a sense of our own personal and mental privacy. It’s a matter of existential, metaphysical importance. Only when this decoupling from ourselves and the mediated performance of ourselves is complete, can we begin the process of returning to our own bodies out there, in the world, with no one watching or reading our thoughts except those we want to. The truth is, we are very afraid not of sex, but of exposure. Only when we are unafraid can we begin to let desire flourish. Only when we return to ourselves can we really know what we want.</p>

<p>Kuo said Apple plans to utilize Intel's <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/process/18a.html">18A process</a>, which is the "earliest available sub-2nm advanced node manufactured in North America."</p>
<p>If this rumor proves to be accurate, Intel could supply Apple with M6 or M7 chips for future MacBook Air, iPad Air, and iPad Pro models at a minimum. However, while previous Intel chips for Macs were designed by Intel and based on x86 architecture, M-series chips are designed by Apple and use Arm architecture. Intel would only assist with manufacturing.</p>
<p>TSMC would continue to supply the majority of Apple's M-series chips.</p>
<p>Kuo said that Apple choosing to have Intel supply its lowest-end M-series chip would appease the Trump administration's desire for "Made in USA" products, and it would also help Apple to diversify its supply chain for manufacturing.</p>
<p>Apple began transitioning away from Intel processors in Macs in 2020, and its own M-series chips continue to provide industry-leading performance per watt.</p>
<p>Apple previously announced that macOS Tahoe will be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/intel-macs-no-more-updates/">final major macOS release that supports Intel-based Macs</a> with x86 architecture.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>November 26, 2025</p><article><p>When we launched <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/skaldlabs/skald">Skald</a>, we wanted it to not only be self-hostable, but also for one to be able to run it without sending any data to third-parties.</p>
<p>With LLMs getting better and better, privacy-sensitive organizations shouldn't have to choose between being left behind by not accessing frontier models and doing away with their committment to (or legal requirement for) data privacy.</p>
<p>So here's what we did to support this use case and also some benchmarks comparing performance when using proprietary APIs vs self-hosted open-source tech.</p>
<h2 id="rag-components-and-their-oss-alternatives"><a href="#rag-components-and-their-oss-alternatives"></a>RAG components and their OSS alternatives</h2>
<p>A basic RAG usually has the following core components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A vector database</li>
<li>A vector embeddings model</li>
<li>An LLM</li>
</ul>
<p>And most times it also has these as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reranker</li>
<li>Document parsing (for PDFs, PowerPoints, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>What that means is that when you're looking to build a fully local RAG setup, you'll need to substitute whatever SaaS providers you're using for a local option for each of those components.</p>
<p>Here's a table with some examples of what we might use in a scenario where we can use third-party Cloud services and one where we can't:</p>



































<table><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>Proprietary Options</th><th>Open-Source Options</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vector Database</td><td>Pinecone, Turbopuffer, Weaviate Cloud, Qdrant Cloud</td><td>Qdrant, Weaviate, Postgres with pgvector</td></tr><tr><td>Vector Embeddings Provider</td><td>OpenAI, Cohere, Voyage</td><td>Sentence Transformers, BGE, E5</td></tr><tr><td>LLM</td><td>GPT, Claude, Gemini</td><td>Llama, Mistral, GPT-OSS</td></tr><tr><td>Reranker</td><td>Cohere, Voyage</td><td>BGE Reranker, Sentence Transformers Cross-Encoder</td></tr><tr><td>Document Parsing</td><td>Reducto, Datalab</td><td>Docling</td></tr></tbody></table>
<blockquote>
<p>Do note that running something locally does not mean it <em>needs</em> to be open-source, as one could pay for a license to self-host proprietary software. But at Skald our goal was to use fully open-source tech, which is what I'll be convering here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The table above is far from covering all available options on both columns, but basically it gives you an indication of what to research into in order to pick a tool that works for you.</p>
<p>As with anything, what works for you will greatly depend on your use case. And you need to be prepared to run a few more services than you're used to if you've just been calling APIs.</p>
<p>For our local stack, we went with the easiest setup for now to get it working (and it does! see writeup on this lower down) but will be running benchmarks on all other options to determine the best possible setup.</p>
<p>This is what we have today:</p>
<p><strong>Vector DB:</strong> Postgres + pgvector. We already use Postgres and didn't want to bundle another service into our stack, but this is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://alex-jacobs.com/posts/the-case-against-pgvector/">controversial</a> and we will be running benchmarks to make a better informed decision here. Note that pgvector will serve a lot of use cases well all the way up to hundreds of thousands of documents, though.</p>
<p><strong>Vector embeddings:</strong> Users can configure this in Skald and we use Sentence Transformers (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2">all-MiniLM-L6-v2</a>) as our default (solid all-around performer for speed and retrieval, English-only). I also ran Skald with bge-m3 (larger, multi-language) and share the results later in this post.</p>
<p><strong>LLM:</strong> We don't even bundle a default with Skald and it's up to the users to run and manage this. I tested our setup with GPT-OSS 20B on EC2 (results shown below).</p>
<p><strong>Reranker:</strong> Users can also configure this in Skald, and the default is the Sentence Transformers <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder">cross encoder</a> (solid, English-only). I've also used bge-reranker-v2-m3 and mmarco-mMiniLMv2-L12-H384-v1 which offer multi-lingual support.</p>
<p><strong>Document parsing:</strong> There isn't much of a question on this one. We're using Docling. It's great. We run it via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/docling-project/docling-serve">docling-serve</a>.</p>
<h2 id="does-it-perform-though"><a href="#does-it-perform-though"></a>Does it perform though?</h2>
<p>So the main goal here was first to get something working then ensure it worked well with our platform and could be easily deployed. From here we'll be running extensive benchmarks and working with our clients to provide a solid setup that both performs well but is also not a nightmare to deploy and manage.</p>
<p>From that perspective, this was a great success.</p>
<p>Deploying a production instance of Skald with this whole stack took me 8 minutes, and that comes bundled with the vector database (well, Postgres), a reranking and embedding service, and Docling.</p>
<p>The only thing I needed to run separately was the LLM, which I did via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>.</p>
<p>Having gotten this sorted, I imported all the content from the PostHog website <a href="#footnotes">[1]</a> and set up a tiny dataset <a href="#footnotes">[2]</a> of questions and expected answers inside of Skald, then used our Experiments feature to run the RAG over this dataset.</p>
<p>I explicitly kept the topK values really high (100 for the vector search and 50 for post-reranking), as I was mostly testing for accuracy and wanted to see the performance when questions required e.g. aggregating context over 15+ documents.</p>
<details><summary>Full config</summary><p>Here are the params configured in the Skald UI for the the experiment.</p>




































<table><thead><tr><th>Config option</th><th>Selection</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Extra system prompt</td><td>Be really concise in your answers</td></tr><tr><td>Query rewriting</td><td>Off</td></tr><tr><td>Vector search topK</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Vector search distance threshold</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr><td>Reranking</td><td>On</td></tr><tr><td>Reranking topK</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>References</td><td>Off</td></tr></tbody></table></details>
<p>So without any more delay, here are the results of my not-very-scientific at all benchmark using the experimentation platform inside of Skald.</p>
<p><img alt="skald experiments" src="https://blog.yakkomajuri.com/images/voyage-claude.png"></p>
<h3 id="voyage-claude"><a href="#voyage-claude"></a>Voyage + Claude</h3>
<p>This is our default Cloud setup. We use voyage-3-large and rerank-2.5 from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.voyageai.com/">Voyage AI</a> as our embedding and reranking models respectively, and we default to Claude Sonnet 3.7 for responses (users can configure the model though).</p>
<p>It passed with flying colors.</p>
<p>Our LLM-as-a-Judge gave an average score of 9.45 to the responses, and I basically agree with the assessment. All answers were correct, with one missing a few extra bits of context.</p>
<h3 id="voyage-gpt-oss-20b"><a href="#voyage-gpt-oss-20b"></a>Voyage + GPT-OSS 20B</h3>
<p>With the control experiment done, I then moved on to a setup where I kept Voyage as the embeddings provider and reranker, and then used GPT-OSS 20B running on a llama.cpp server on a g5.2xlarge EC2 instance as the LLM.</p>
<p>The goal here was to see how well the open-source LLM model itself stacked up against a frontier model accessed via API.</p>
<p>And it did great!</p>
<p>We don't yet support LLM-as-a-Judge on fully local deployments, so the only score we have here is mine. I scored the answers an average of 9.18 and they were all correct, with two of them just missing a few bits of information or highlighting less relevant information from the context.</p>
<h3 id="fully-local-gpt-oss-20b"><a href="#fully-local-gpt-oss-20b"></a>Fully local + GPT-OSS 20B</h3>
<p>Lastly, it was time for the moment of truth: running a fully local setup.</p>
<p>For this I ran two tests:</p>
<p><strong>1. Default sentence transformers embedding and reranking models</strong></p>
<p>The most popular open-source models are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2">all-MiniLM-L6-v2</a> for embeddings and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2">ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2</a> as the reranker, so I used those for my first benchmark.</p>
<p>Here the average score was 7.10. Not bad, but definitely not great. However, when we dig into the results, we can get a better understanding of how this setup fails.</p>
<p>Basically, it got all point queries right, which are questions where the answer is somewhere in the mess of documents, but can be found from one specific place.</p>
<p>Where it failed was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-english query: The embeddings model and the reranker are English-based, so my question in Portuguese obviously got no answer</li>
<li>An ambiguous question with very little context ("what's ch")</li>
<li>Aggregating information from multiple documents/chunks e.g. it only found 5 out of PostHog's 7 funding rounds, and only a subset of the PostHog competitors that offer session replay (as mentioned in the source data)</li>
</ul>
<p>In my view, this is good news. That means that the default options will go a long way and should give you very good performance if your use case is only doing point queries in English. The other great thing is that these models are also fast.</p>
<p>Now, if you need to handle ambiguity better, or handle questions in other languages, then this setup is simply not for you.</p>
<p><strong>2. Multi-lingual models</strong></p>
<p>The next test I did used <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-m3">bge-m3</a> as the embeddings model and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/jeffwan/mmarco-mMiniLMv2-L12-H384-v1">mmarco-mMiniLMv2-L12-H384-v1</a> as the reranker. The embeddings model is supposedly much better than the one used in the previous test and is also multi-lingual. The reranker on the other hand uses the same cross-encoder from the previous test as the base model but also adds multi-lingual support. The more standard option here would have been the much more popular <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3">bge-reranker-v2-m3</a> model, but I found it to be much slower. I intend to tweak my setup and test it again, however.</p>
<p>Anyway, onto the results! I scored it 8.63 on average, which is very good. There were no complete failures, and it handled the question in Portuguese well.</p>
<p>The mistakes it made were:</p>
<ul>
<li>This new setup also did not do the best job at aggregating information, missing 2 of PostHog's funding rounds, and a couple of its session replay competitors</li>
<li>It also answered a question correctly, but added incorrect additional context after it</li>
</ul>
<p>So overall it performed quite well. Again what we what saw was the main problem is when the context needed for the response is scattered across multiple documents. There are various techniques to help with this and we'll be trialing some soon! They haven't been needed on the Cloud version because better models save you from having to add complexity for minimal performance gains, but as we're focused on building a really solid setup for local deploys, we'll be looking into this more and more.</p>
<h2 id="now-what"><a href="#now-what"></a>Now what?</h2>
<p>I hope this writeup has provided you with at least some insight and context into building a local RAG, and also the fact that it does work, it can serve a lot of use cases, and that the tendency is for this setup to get better and better as a) models improve b) we get more open-source models across the board, with both being things that we seem to be trending towards.</p>
<p>As for us at Skald, we intend to polish this setup further in order to serve even more use cases really well, as well as intend to soon be publishing more legitimate benchmarks for models in the open-source space, from LLMs to rerankers.</p>

<p><strong>[1]</strong> I used the PostHog website here because the website content is MIT-licensed (yes, wild) and readily-available as markdown on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com">GitHub</a> and having worked there I know a lot of answers off the top of my head making it a great dataset of ~2000 documents that I know well.</p>

							<h2> <p>The biggest car news and reviews, no BS</p>

					</div>

<p>The internet is raging right now over <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/stellantis-news" target="_blank">Stellantis</a> pushing marketing pop-ups to owners’ in-car screens. It’s obnoxious, to be sure, and it’s legit—we have confirmation from a <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/jeep-news" target="_blank">Jeep</a> driver as well as Stellantis itself. But this isn’t even the first time it’s happened, as we <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/jeep-owners-say-pop-up-ads-for-extended-warranties-keep-blocking-their-touchscreens" target="_blank">reported in February</a> about Jeep advertising extended warranties in the same way.</p>



<p>Auto writer and all-around car guy <a href="https://x.com/SpeedSportLife" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Zerin Dube</a> posted earlier this week about his WL Grand Cherokee’s “marketing notification” on X. The photo started popping off, and before long, others were sharing the same ad that was sent to their screens. Dube labeled it as “late stage capitalism,” which feels like an accurate descriptor.</p>



<p>Funny enough, Dube was in the market for a new Wrangler anyhow, and he took advantage of the $1,500 loyalty offer Jeep sent straight to his Grand Cherokee. He drove off the lot Thursday night in a new Rubicon X, so I guess you can say it worked.</p>




<figure><div>

<blockquote data-tweet-id="1991132235328610547" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And you're looking for ANOTHER jeep? I'd swear off the brand forever if it started sending me ads in the infotainment</p>— Vee! (@VLangs) <a href="https://twitter.com/VLangs/status/1991132235328610547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">November 19, 2025</a></blockquote>

</div></figure>




<figure></figure>



<p>Others online were less accepting of the ploy. Practically every repost of Dube’s photo decried Jeep and Stellantis at large, with some Ram and Chrysler drivers corroborating the ad’s rollout that spread across multiple brands. Most of the comments said something along the lines of, “Guess what I’m never buying.” Some made the informed prediction that this type of promotion will become commonplace in the industry before long.</p>



<p>For its part, Stellantis told <em>The Drive</em> that it sends out these notifications to “stay in contact with our owners at critical points in their ownership.” The in-vehicle message system is also used to notify drivers of vehicle recalls and health monitor alerts. A spokesperson for the brand said:</p>



<p>“Recently, a select group of owners received a special marketing notification in their vehicle, and we tailored this special offer to minimize any intrusions:</p>



<ul>
<li>The simple text message offering a $1,500 bonus incentive appears only on startup and while the vehicle is stationary</li>



<li>The message disappears when the vehicle begins moving, or the driver clicks the OK or X icon on the screen, or after 15 seconds</li>



<li>The message returns at the next key-on cycle&nbsp;<strong><em>only</em></strong>&nbsp;if the driver clicked on Remind Me Later, or they did not click OK or X</li>
</ul>



<p>“Our goal is to deliver the best vehicle experience for our customers. As a result of these efforts, we have seen our customers take advantage of this offer,” the spokesperson said.</p>



<p>The Stellantis spokesperson concluded by saying that owners can permanently opt out of in-vehicle messaging by calling the company’s customer care line at 800-777-3600.</p>




<figure></figure>



<p>The $1,500 loyalty bonus is just one of many discounts that Stellantis dealers are stacking in order to move more units. I reported last week that <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/ford-bronco-sales-are-threatening-the-jeep-wranglers-dominance-for-the-first-time" target="_blank">storming Ford Bronco sales</a> are genuinely threatening the Wrangler’s spot atop the segment, and as Dube shared on X, he got something like $16,500 off his new Jeep. Apparently, now’s a good time to buy if you can stand the occasional spam on your car’s screen.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/jeep-owners-say-pop-up-ads-for-extended-warranties-keep-blocking-their-touchscreens" target="_blank">The last time this happened</a>, Stellantis was advertising extended warranties to owners via their infotainment. Many were frustrated as the offer continued to show, even after acknowledging it by pressing “OK.” What’s more, others saw the ad despite their car exceeding the mileage limit mentioned in the promotion.</p>



<p>Connected cars, man. Gotta love ’em.</p>

<p dir="auto">We're taught that email must go through servers. Why? Because the Internet was built around centralized infrastructure. Every email you send travels through multiple servers - your provider's server, maybe a few relay servers, and finally your recipient's provider's server. Each hop is a potential point of surveillance, censorship, or failure.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even "encrypted" email solutions still rely on these centralized servers. They encrypt the message content but the metadata - who you're talking to, when, how often - is visible to anyone watching the servers.</p>
<p dir="auto">But there is a network, called <strong><a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Yggdrasil</a></strong>, that gives everyone a free IPv6 and doesn't need a blessing from your ISP. We finally have this possibility to use true P2P email. And moreover, this network has strong encryption to protect all data that flows from one IP to another.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Tyr brings true peer-to-peer email to your Android device</strong> using these unusual conditions. Unlike traditional email clients, Tyr doesn't need:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>❌ Centralized mail servers (the connections are straight P2P)</li>
<li>❌ Message encryption layers (the network takes care of that)</li>
<li>❌ Port forwarding or STUN/TURN servers (Yggdrasil handles NAT traversal)</li>

<p dir="auto">Tyr runs a complete email server right on your Android device, using the Yggdrasil network for transport. The <strong><a href="https://github.com/JB-SelfCompany/yggmail-android">Yggmail</a></strong> mail server (built in Go) is embedded as a library inside the app and runs as a foreground service.</p>
<p dir="auto">On top of Yggdrasil, it provides standard <strong>SMTP</strong> and <strong>IMAP</strong> protocols on localhost (<code>127.0.0.1:1025</code> and <code>127.0.0.1:1143</code>). Any email client can connect to these ports - but we recommend <strong>DeltaChat</strong> or <strong>ArcaneChat</strong> for the best P2P messaging experience.</p>

JVCo, in turn, owns Laidley LLC (Landlord). None of this is unusual except for the part where Meta designs, builds, guarantees, operates, funds the overruns, pays the rent, and does not consolidate it.</p><p>This project has nine data centers and two support buildings, with about four million sq. ft. and 2.064 GW capacity. The support buildings will store the reams of documentation needed to convince everyone this structure isn’t what it looks like. The total capital plan of $28.79 billion will be funded as follows:</p><ul><li><p>$27.30 billion of debt raised by Beignet.</p></li><li><p>$2.45 billion of deferred equity commitments from Blue Owl funds.</p></li><li><p>And, in a feat of financial hydration, $1.16 billion of interest generated by the same borrowed money while it sits in laddered Treasuries.</p></li></ul><p>The structure allows the Issuer to borrow money, earn interest on the borrowed money, and then use that interest to satisfy the equity requirement that would normally require… money.</p><p>Nothing is created. Nothing is contributed. It’s a loop. Borrow money, earn interest, and use the interest to claim you provided equity. The kind of circle only finance can call a straight line.</p><p>Together, these flows cover Beignet’s $23.03 billion obligation to JVCo, plus the usual constellation of capitalized interest, reserve accounts, and transaction expenses. In any other context this would raise questions. For us, it raises the credit rating.</p><p>Meta, through Pelican Leap LLC (Tenant), has entered into eleven triple-net leases—one for each building—with an initial four-year term starting in 2029 and four renewal options that could extend the arrangement to twenty years. The leases rely on the assumption that Meta will continue to need exponentially more compute power and that AI demand will not collapse, reverse, plateau, or become structurally inconvenient.</p><p>The notes issued by Beignet are secured by Beignet’s equity interest in JVCo and relevant transaction accounts. They are not secured by the underlying physical assets, which remain at the JVCo and Landlord level. This is described as standard practice, which is true in the same way that using eleven entities to rent buildings to yourself has become standard practice.</p><p>The resulting structure allows Meta to support the project economically while leaving the associated debt somewhere that is technically not on Meta’s balance sheet. The distinction is thin, but apparently wide enough to matter.</p><p>The preliminary A+ rating reflects our view that this is functionally Meta borrowing $27.30 billion for a campus no one else will touch, packaged in legal formality precise enough to satisfy the letter of consolidation rules and absurd enough to insult the spirit.</p><p>Credit risk aligns almost one-for-one with Meta’s own profile because:</p><ul><li><p>Meta is obligated to fund construction cost overruns beyond 105 percent of the fixed budget, excluding force majeure events, which rating agencies historically treat as theoretical inconveniences rather than recurring features of the physical world.</p></li><li><p>Meta guarantees all lease payments and operating obligations, both during the initial four-year term and across any renewal periods it already intends to exercise, an arrangement whose purpose becomes clearer when one remembers why the campus is being built at all.</p></li><li><p>Meta provides an RVG (residual value guarantee) structured to be sufficient, in most modeled cases, to ensure bondholders are repaid even if Meta recommits to the Metaverse or any future initiative born from its ongoing fascination with expensive detours. We did not model what would happen if data center demand collapses and Meta cannot secure a new tenant. This scenario was excluded for methodological convenience.</p></li><li><p>The minimum rent schedule has been calibrated to produce a debt service coverage ratio of approximately 1.12 through 2049. We consider this a sufficient level of stability usually found only in spreadsheets that freeze when real-world data is used.</p></li></ul><p>Taken together, these features tie Beignet’s credit quality to Meta so tightly that you’d have to not be paying attention to miss them. The structure maintains a precarious technical separation that, under current interpretations of accounting guidance, allows Meta to keep roughly $27 billion of assets and debt off its own balance sheet while continuing to provide every meaningful form of economic support.</p><p>This treatment is considered acceptable because the people who decide what is acceptable have accepted it.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://stohl.substack.com/p/exclusive-credit-report-shows-meta?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://stohl.substack.com/p/exclusive-credit-report-shows-meta?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>JVCo qualifies as a variable interest entity because the equity at risk is ceremonial and the real economic exposure sits entirely with the party insisting it does not control the venture. This remains legal due to the enduring belief that balance sheets are healthier when the risky parts are hidden.</p><p>Under U.S. GAAP, consolidation is required if Meta is the primary beneficiary, defined as the party that both:</p><ol><li><p>Directs the activities that most significantly affect the entity’s performance, and</p></li><li><p>Absorbs significant losses or receives significant benefits.</p></li></ol><p>Meta asserts it is not the primary beneficiary.</p><p>To evaluate that assertion, we note the following uncontested facts:</p><ul><li><p>Meta is responsible for designing, overseeing, and operating a 2.064 GW AI campus, an activity that requires technical capabilities Blue Owl does not possess.</p></li><li><p>Meta bears construction cost overruns beyond 105 percent of the fixed budget, as well as specified casualty repair obligations of up to $3.125 billion per event during construction.</p></li><li><p>Meta provides the guarantee for all rent and operating payments under the leases, across the initial term and any renewals.</p></li><li><p>Meta provides the residual value guarantee, ensuring bondholders are repaid if leases are not renewed or are terminated, either through a sale or by paying the guaranteed minimum values directly.</p></li><li><p>Meta contributes funding, directs operations, bears construction risk, guarantees payments, guarantees asset values, determines utilization, controls renewal behavior, and can trigger the sale of the facility.</p></li></ul><p>Based on this, or despite this, Meta concludes it does not control JVCo.</p><p>Our interpretation is fully compliant with U.S. GAAP, which prioritizes the geometry of the legal structure over the inconvenience of economic substance and recognizes control only if the controlling party agrees to be recognized as controlling.</p><p>Meta has not agreed, and the framework, including this agency, respects that choice.</p><p>For rating purposes, we therefore accept Meta’s non-consolidation as an accounting outcome while treating Meta, in all practical respects, as fully responsible for the performance of an entity it does not officially control.</p><p>The lease structure is designed to look like a normal commercial arrangement while functioning as a long-term commitment Meta insists, for accounting reasons, it cannot possibly predict.</p><p>Tenant will pay fixed rent for the first 19 months of operations, based on a 50 percent assumed utilization rate, after which rent scales with actual power consumption. The leases are triple-net. Meta is responsible for everything: operating costs, maintenance, taxes, insurance, utilities. If a pipe breaks, Meta fixes the pipe. If a hurricane relocates a roof, Meta pays to staple the roof back on.</p><p>In practical terms, the only scenario in which Beignet bears operating exposure is a scenario in which Meta stops paying its own bills, at which point the lease structure becomes irrelevant because the same lawyers that structured this deal will have already quietly extricated Meta from liability.</p><p>The contract terms include:</p><ul><li><p>A minimum rent floor engineered to produce a DSCR of 1.12 in a spreadsheet where 1.12 was likely hard-coded and independent of math.</p></li><li><p>A four-year initial term with four four-year renewal options, theoretically creating a 20-year runway Meta pretends not to see.</p></li><li><p>Meta guarantees all tenant payment obligations across the entire potential lease life, including renewals it strategically refuses to acknowledge as inevitable.</p></li><li><p>No performance-based KPIs. Under this structure, the buildings could underperform, overperform, or catch fire. Meta still pays rent.</p></li><li><p>The RVG requires Meta to ensure that, at every potential lease-termination date, the asset is worth at least the guaranteed minimum value. If markets disagree, Meta pays the difference. Because Meta is rated AA-/Stable, we are instructed to assume that it will do so without hesitation, including in scenarios where demand softens or secondary markets discover that a hyperscale campus in Richland Parish is not the world’s most liquid asset class.</p></li></ul><p>The interplay between the lease term and the RVG creates a circular logic we find structurally exquisite.</p><p>From a credit perspective, this circularity is considered supportive, because the same logic used to avoid consolidating the debt also ensures bondholders are paid. The circularity is not treated as a feature or a flaw. It is treated as accounting.</p><p>Because Meta is AA-/Stable, we assume it will pay whatever number the Excel model finds through Goal Seek, even in scenarios involving technological obsolescence or an invasion of raccoons.</p><p>The accounting hinges on a paradox engineered with dull tweezers:</p><ul><li><p>Under lease accounting, Meta must record future lease obligations only if renewals are reasonably certain.</p></li><li><p>Under RVG accounting, Meta must record a guarantee liability only if payment is probable.</p></li></ul><p>To keep $27 billion off its balance sheet, Meta must therefore assert:</p><ul><li><p>Renewals are not reasonably certain, despite designing, funding, building, and exclusively using a 2.064 GW AI campus for which the realistic tenant list begins and ends with Meta.</p></li><li><p>The RVG will probably never be triggered, despite the fact that not renewing would trigger it immediately.</p></li></ul><p>This requires a narrow corridor of assumptions in which Meta simultaneously plans to use the facility for two decades and insists that no one can predict four years of corporate intention.</p><p>From a credit standpoint, we are supportive. The assumptions that render the debt invisible are precisely what make it secure. A harmony best described as collateralized cognitive dissonance.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Meta linkage.</strong><span> The economics are wedded to Meta’s credit profile, which we are required to describe as AA-/Stable rather than “the only reason this entire structure doesn’t fold from a stiff breeze.” Meta guarantees the rent, the RVG, and the continued relevance of the facility. The rest is décor auditors would deem “tasteful.”</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Minimum rent floor.</strong><span> The lease schedule produces a perfectly flat DSCR of 1.12 through 2049. Projects of this size do not produce flat anything, but the model insists otherwise, so we pretend we believe it. Being sticklers for tradition, and having learned nothing from the financial crisis of 2008, we treat the spreadsheet as the final arbiter of truth, even when the inputs describe a world no one lives in.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Construction risk transfer.</strong><span> Meta absorbs cost overruns beyond 105 percent of budget and handles casualty repairs during construction. Our methodology interprets “contractually transferred” as “ceased to exist,” so we decline to model the risk of overruns on a $28 billion campus built in a hurricane corridor. This is considered best practice.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>RVG backstop.</strong><span> The residual value guarantee eliminates tail risk in much the same way a parent cosigning for their teenager’s car loan eliminates tail risk: by ensuring that the person with all the money pays for everything. If the market value collapses, Meta pays the difference. If the facility can’t be sold, Meta pays the whole thing. If the entire campus becomes a raccoon sanctuary, Meta still pays. We classify this as credit protection, a nuanced designation that allows us to recognize the security of the arrangement without recognizing the debt.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Absence of performance KPIs. </strong><span>There are no operational KPIs that allow rent abatement. This is helpful because KPIs create volatility, and volatility requires thought, a variable we explicitly exclude from our methodology. By removing KPIs entirely, the structure ensures a level of cash-flow stability that exists only in transactions where the tenant is also the economic owner pretending to be a squatter.</span></p></li></ul><p>The rating also reflects several risks that are acknowledged, intellectually troubling, and ultimately tolerated because Meta is large enough that everyone agrees to stop asking questions.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Off-balance-sheet dependence. </strong><span>Meta treats JVCo as if it belongs to someone else, which is a generous interpretation of ownership. If consolidation rules ever evolve to reflect economic substance, Meta could be required to add $27 billion of assets and matching debt back onto its own balance sheet. Our methodology treats this as a theoretical inconvenience rather than a credit event, because calling it what it really is would create a conflict with the very companies we rate.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Concentration risk. </strong><span>The entire project exists for one tenant with one business model in one industry undergoing technological whiplash. The facility is engineered so specifically for Meta’s AI ambitions that the only plausible alternative tenant is another version of Meta from a parallel timeline. We strongly disagree with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. We set this concern aside because at this stage in the transaction, the A+ rating is a structural load-bearing wall, and we are not paid to do demolition.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Residual value uncertainty. </strong><span>The RVG depends on modeled guaranteed minimum values that assume buyers will one day desire a vast hyperscale complex in Richland Parish under stress scenarios. If hyperscale supply balloons or the resale market for 2-gigawatt data centers becomes as illiquid as common sense, Meta will owe more money. This increases Meta’s direct obligations, which should concern us, but does not, because Meta is rated AA-/Stable and therefore presumed to withstand any scenario we have chosen not to model.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Casualty and force majeure. </strong><span>In extreme scenarios, multiple buildings could be destroyed by a hurricane, which we view as unlikely given that they almost never impact Louisiana. The logic resembles a Rube Goldberg machine built out of indemnities. We classify this as a strength.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>JV structural subordination. </strong><span>Cash flows must navigate waterfalls, covenants, carve-outs, and the possibility of up to $75 million of JV-level debt. These features introduce structural complexity, which we flag, then promptly ignore, because acknowledging would force us to explain who benefits from the convolution.</span></p></li></ul><p>Despite these risks, we maintain an A+ rating because Meta’s credit quality is strong, the structure is designed to hide risk rather than transfer it, and our role in this ecosystem is to observe these contradictions and proceed as though they were features rather than warnings.</p><p>The outlook is Superficially Stable. That means we expect the structure to hold together as long as Meta keeps paying for everything and the accounting rules remain generously uninterested in economic reality.</p><p>We assume, with the confidence of people who have clearly not been punished enough:</p><ul><li><p>Meta will preserve an AA-/Stable profile because any other outcome would force everyone involved to admit what this actually is.</p></li><li><p>Construction will stay “broadly on schedule,” a phrase we use to pre-forgive whatever happens as long as Meta covers the overruns, which it must.</p></li><li><p>Lease payments and the minimum rent schedule will continue producing a DSCR that hovers around 1.12 in models designed to ensure that result, and not materially below 1.10 unless something un-modeled happens, which we classify as “outside scope.”</p></li><li><p>The RVG will remain enforceable, which matters more than the resale value of a hyperscale facility in a world where hyperscale facilities may or may not be worth anything.</p></li><li><p>Changes in VIE or lease-accounting guidance will affect where Meta stores the debt, not whether Meta pays it.</p></li></ul><p>We could lower the rating if Meta were downgraded, if DSCR sagged below the range we pretend is acceptable, if Meta weakened its guarantees, or if events unfold in ways our assumptions did not account for, as events tend to do. The last category includes anything that would force us to revisit the assumptions we confidently made without testing.</p><p>We view an upgrade as unlikely. The structure already performs the single miracle it was designed for: keeping $27.3 billion off Meta’s balance sheet in a manner we are professionally obligated to support.</p><p><strong>CONFIDENTIALITY AND USE:</strong><span> This report is intended solely for institutional investors, entities required by compliance to review documents they will not read, and any regulatory body still pretending to monitor off-balance-sheet arrangements.

<a name="tmpdir" href="https://blog.plover.com/tech/tmpdir.html">Don't tug on that, you never know what it might be attached to</a>
<br>
</p><p>This is a story about a very interesting bug that I tracked down
yesterday.  It was causing a bad effect very far from where the bug
actually was.</p>

<h3>emacsclient</h3>

<p>The <code>emacs</code> text editor comes with a separate utility, called
<code>emacsclient</code>, which can communicate with the main editor process and
tell it to open files for editing.  You have your main <code>emacs</code>
running. Then somewhere else you run the command</p>

<pre><code>     emacsclient some-files...
</code></pre>

<p>and it sends the main <code>emacs</code>  a message that you want to edit
<code>some-files</code>.  Emacs gets the message and pops up new windows for editing
those files.  When you're done editing <code>some-files</code> you tell Emacs, by
typing <code>C-#</code> or something, it
it communicates back to <code>emacsclient</code> that the editing is done, and
<code>emacsclient</code> exits.</p>

<p>This was more important in the olden days when Emacs was big and
bloated and took a long time to start up.  (They used to joke that
“Emacs” was an abbreviation for “Eight Megs And Constantly Swapping”.
Eight megs!)  But even today it's still useful, say from shell scripts
that need to run an editor.</p>

<p>Here's the reason I was running it.  I have a very nice shell script,
called <code>also</code>, that does something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interpret command-line arguments as patterns</li>
<li>Find files matching those patterns</li>
<li>Present a menu of the files</li>
<li>Wait for me to select files of interest</li>
<li>Run <code>emacsclient</code> on the selected files</li>
</ul>

<p>It is essentially a wrapper around
<a href="https://github.com/mjdominus/util/blob/master/bin/menupick"><code>menupick</code></a>,
a menu-picking utility I wrote which has seen use as a component of
several other tools.
I can type </p>

<pre><code>    also Wizard
</code></pre>

<p>in the shell and get a menu of the files related to the wizard, select
the ones I actually want to edit, and they show up in Emacs.  This is
more convenient than using Emacs itself to find and open them. I use
it many times a day.</p>

<p>Or rather, I did until this week, when it suddenly stopped working.
Everything ran fine until the execution of <code>emacsclient</code>, which would
fail, saying:</p>

<pre><code> emacsclient: can't find socket; have you started the server?
</code></pre>

<p>(A socket is a facility that enables interprocess communication, in
this case between <code>emacs</code> and <code>emacsclient</code>.)</p>

<p>This message is familiar.  It usually means that I have forgotten to
tell Emacs to start listening for <code>emacsclient</code>, by running <code>M-x
server-start</code>.  (I should have Emacs do this when it starts up, but I
don't.  Why not?  I'm not sure.) So the first time it happened I went
to Emacs and ran <code>M-x server-start</code>.  Emacs announced that it had
started the server, so I reran <code>also</code>.  And the same thing happened.</p>

<pre><code> emacsclient: can't find socket; have you started the server?
</code></pre>

<h3>Finding the socket</h3>

<p>So the first question is: why can't <code>emacsclient</code> find the socket?
And this resolves naturally into two subquestions: where is the
socket, and where is <code>emacsclient</code> looking?</p>

<p>The second one is easily answered; I ran <code>strace emacsclient</code> (hi
Julia!) and saw that the last interesting thing <code>emacsclient</code> did
before emitting the error message was</p>

<pre><code>    stat("/mnt/tmp/emacs2017/server", 0x7ffd90ec4d40) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
</code></pre>

<p>which means it's looking for the socket at <code>/mnt/tmp/emacs2017/server</code>
but didn't find it there.</p>

<p>The question of where Emacs actually put the socket file was a little
trickier. I did not run Emacs under <code>strace</code> because I felt sure that
the output would be voluminous and it would be tedious to grovel over
it.</p>

<p>I don't exactly remember now how I figured this out, but I think now
that I probably made an educated guess, something like: <code>emacsclient</code>
is looking in <code>/mnt/tmp</code>; this seems unusual.  I would expect the
socket to be under <code>/tmp</code>.  Maybe it <em>is</em> under <code>/tmp</code>?  So I looked
under <code>/tmp</code> and there it was, in <code>/tmp/emacs2017/server</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    srwx------ 1 mjd mjd 0 Jun 27 11:43 /tmp/emacs2017/server
</code></pre>

<p>(The <code>s</code> at the beginning there means that the file is a “Unix-domain
socket”.  A socket is an endpoint for interprocess communication.  The
most familiar sort is a TCP socket, which has a TCP address, and which
enables communication over the internet.  But since ancient times Unix
has also supported Unix-domain sockets, which enable communication
between two processes on the same machine.  Instead of TCP addresses,
such sockets are addressed using paths in the filesystem, in this case
<code>/tmp/emacs2017/server</code>.  When the server creates such a socket, it
appears in the filesystem as a special type of file, as here.)</p>

<p>I confirmed that this was the correct file by typing <code>M-x
server-force-delete</code> in Emacs; this immediately caused
<code>/tmp/emacs2017/server</code> to disappear.  Similarly <code>M-x server-start</code>
made it reappear.</p>

<h3>Why the disagreement?</h3>

<p>Now the question is: Why is <code>emacsclient</code> looking for the socket under
<code>/mnt/tmp</code> when Emacs is putting it in <code>/tmp</code>?  They used to
rendezvous properly; what has gone wrong?  I recalled that there was
some environment variable for controlling where temporary files are
put, so I did</p>

<pre><code>       env | grep mnt
</code></pre>

<p>to see if anything relevant turned up.  And sure enough there was:</p>

<pre><code>       TMPDIR=/mnt/tmp
</code></pre>

<p>When programs want to create tmporary<!-- this typo is too good to
correct --> files and directories, they normally do it in <code>/tmp</code>.  But
if there is a <code>TMPDIR</code> setting, they use that directory instead.  This
explained why <code>emacsclient</code> was looking for
<code>/mnt/tmp/emacs2017/socket</code>.  And the explanation for why Emacs itself
was creating the socket in <code>/tmp</code> seemed clear: Emacs was failing to
honor the <code>TMPDIR</code> setting.</p>

<p>With this clear explanation in hand, I began to report the bug in
Emacs, using <code>M-x report-emacs-bug</code>. (The folks in the <code>#emacs</code> IRC
channel on Freenode suggested this.  <a href="https://blog.plover.com/prog/elisp.html">I had a bad
experience</a> last time I tried
<code>#emacs</code>, and then people mocked me for even <em>trying</em> to get useful
information out of IRC.  But this time it went pretty well.)</p>

<p>Emacs popped up a buffer with full version information and invited me
to write down the steps to reproduce the problem.  So I wrote down</p>

<pre><code>     % export TMPDIR=/mnt/tmp
     % emacs
</code></pre>

<p>and as I did that I ran those commands in the shell.</p>

<p>Then I wrote</p>

<pre><code>     In Emacs:
     M-x getenv TMPDIR
     (emacs claims there is no such variable)
</code></pre>

<p>and I did that in Emacs also.  But instead of claiming there was no
such variable, Emacs cheerfully informed me that the value of <code>TMPDIR</code>
was <code>/mnt/tmp</code>.</p>

<p>(There is an important lesson here!  To submit a bug report, you find
a minimal demonstration.  But then you also <em>try</em> the minimal
demonstration exactly as you reported it.  Because of what just
happened!  Had I sent off that bug report, I would have wasted
everyone else's time, and even worse, I would have looked like a
fool.)</p>

<p>My minimal demonstration did not demonstrate.  Something else was
going on.</p>

<h3>Why no <code>TMPDIR</code>?</h3>

<p>This was a head-scratcher.  All I could think of was that
<code>emacsclient</code> and Emacs were somehow getting different environments,
one with the <code>TMPDIR</code> setting and one without.  Maybe I had run them
from different shells, and only one of the shells had the setting?</p>

<p>I got on a sidetrack at this point to find out why <code>TMPDIR</code> was set in
the first place; I didn't think I had set it. I looked for it in
<code>/etc/profile</code>, which is the default Bash startup instructions, but it
wasn't there.  But I also noticed an <code>/etc/profile.d</code> which seemed
relevant.  (I saw later that the <code>/etc/profile</code> contained instructions
to load everything under <code>/etc/profile.d</code>.)  And when I grepped for
<code>TMPDIR</code> in the <code>profile.d</code> files, I found that it was being set by
<code>/etc/profile.d/ziprecruiter_environment.sh</code>, which the sysadmins had
installed.  So that mystery at least was cleared up.</p>

<p>That got me on a second sidetrack, looking through our Git history for
recent changes involving <code>TMPDIR</code>.  There weren't any, so that was a
dead end.</p>

<p>I was still puzzled about why Emacs sometimes got the <code>TMPDIR</code> setting
and sometimes not.  That's when I realized that my original Emacs
process, the one that had failed to rendezvous with <code>emacsclient</code>,
had not been started in the usual way.  Instead of simply running
<code>emacs</code>, I had run</p>

<pre><code>    git re-edit
</code></pre>

<p>which invokes Git, which then runs</p>

<pre><code>    /home/mjd/bin/git-re-edit
</code></pre>

<p>which is a Perl program I wrote that does a bunch of stuff to figure
out which files I was editing recently and then execs <code>emacs</code> to edit
them some more.  So there are several programs here that could be
tampering with the environment and removing the <code>TMPDIR</code> setting.</p>

<p>To more accurately point the finger of blame, I put some diagnostics
into the <code>git-re-edit</code> program to have it print out the value of
<code>TMPDIR</code>.  Indeed, <code>git-re-edit</code> reported that <code>TMPDIR</code> was unset.
Clearly, the culprit was Git, which must have been removing <code>TMPDIR</code>
from the environment before invoking my Perl program.</p>

<h3>Who is stripping the environment?</h3>

<p>To confirm this conclusion, I created a tiny shell script,
<code>/home/mjd/bin/git-env</code>, which simply printed out the environment, and
then I ran <code>git env</code>, which tells Git to find <code>git-env</code> and run it.
If the environment it printed were to omit <code>TMPDIR</code>, I would know Git
was the culprit.  But <code>TMPDIR</code> <em>was</em> in the output.</p>

<p>So I created a Perl version of <code>git-env</code>, called <code>git-perlenv</code>, which
did the same thing, and I ran it via <code>git perlenv</code>.  And this time
<code>TMPDIR</code> was <em>not</em> in the output. I ran diff on the outputs of <code>git
env</code> and <code>git perlenv</code> and they were identical—except that <code>git
perlenv</code> was missing <code>TMPDIR</code>.</p>

<p>So it was <em>Perl's</em> fault!  And I verified this by running <code>perl
/home/mjd/bin/git-re-edit</code> directly, without involving Git at all.
The diagnostics I had put in reported that <code>TMPDIR</code> was unset.</p>

<h3>WTF Perl?</h3>

<p>At this point I tried getting rid of <code>get-re-edit</code> itself, and ran the
one-line program</p>

<pre><code>    perl -le 'print $ENV{TMPDIR}'
</code></pre>

<p>which simply runs Perl and tells it to print out the value of the
<code>TMPDIR</code> environment variable. It should print <code>/mnt/tmp</code>, but instead
it printed the empty string.  This is a smoking gun, and Perl no
longer has anywhere to hide.</p>

<p>The mystery is not cleared up, however.  Why was Perl doing this?
Surely not a bug; someone else would have noticed such an obvious bug
sometime in the past 25 years.  And it only failed for <code>TMPDIR</code>, not
for other variables.  For example</p>

<pre><code>    FOO=bar perl -le 'print $ENV{FOO}'
</code></pre>

<p>printed out <code>bar</code> as one would expect.  This was weird: how could
Perl's environment handling be broken for just the <code>TMPDIR</code> variable?</p>

<p>At this point I got Rik Signes and Frew Schmidt to look at it with
me.  They confirmed that the problem was not in Perl generally, but
just in <em>this</em> Perl.  Perl on <em>other</em> systems did not display this
behavior.  </p>

<p>I looked in the output of <code>perl -V</code>, which says what version of Perl
you are using and which patches have been applied, and wasted a lot of
time looking into
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2381">CVE-2016-2381</a>,
which seemed relevant.  But it turned out to be a red herring.</p>

<h3>Working around the problem, 1.</h3>

<p>While all this was going on I was looking for a workaround.  Finding
one is at least as important as actually tracking down the problem
because ultimately I am paid to do something other than figure out why
Perl is losing <code>TMPDIR</code>.  Having a workaround in hand means that when
I get sick and tired of looking into the underlying problem I can
abandon it instantly instead of having to push onward.</p>

<p>The first workaround I found was to not use the Unix-domain socket.
Emacs has an option to use a TCP socket instead, which is useful on
systems that do not support Unix-domain sockets, such as non-Unix
systems.  (I am told that some do still exist.)</p>

<p>You set the <code>server-use-tcp</code> variable to a true value, and when you
start the server, Emacs creates a TCP socket and writes a description
of it into a “server file”, usually <code>~/.emacs.d/server/server</code>.  Then
when you run <code>emacsclient</code> you  tell it to connect to the socket that
is described in the file, with</p>

<pre><code>    emacsclient --server-file=~/.emacs.d/server/server
</code></pre>

<p>or by setting the <code>EMACS_SERVER_FILE</code> environment variable. I tried
this, and it worked, once I figured out the thing about
<code>server-use-tcp</code> and what a “server file” was.  (I had misunderstood
at first, and thought that “server file” meant the Unix-domain socket
itself, and I tried to get <code>emacsclient</code> to use the right one by
setting <code>EMACS_SERVER_FILE</code>, which didn't work at all.  The resulting
error message was obscure enough to lead me to IRC to ask about it.)</p>

<h3>Working around the problem, 2.</h3>

<p>I spent quite a while looking for an environment variable analogous to
<code>EMACS_SERVER_FILE</code> to tell <code>emacsclient</code> where the Unix-domain socket
was.  But while there is a <code>--socket-name</code> command-line argument to
control this, there is inexplicably no environment variable.  I hacked
my <code>also</code> command (responsible for running <code>emacsclient</code>) to look for
an environment variable named <code>EMACS_SERVER_SOCKET</code>, and to pass its
value to <code>emacsclient --socket-name</code> if there was one.  (It probably
would have been better to write a wrapper for <code>emacsclient</code>, but I
didn't.)  Then I put</p>

<pre><code>    EMACS_SERVER_SOCKET=$TMPDIR/emacs$(id -u)/server
</code></pre>

<p>in my Bash profile, which effectively solved the problem.  This set
<code>EMACS_SERVER_SOCKET</code> to <code>/mnt/tmp/emacs2017/server</code> whenever I
started a new shell.  When I ran <code>also</code> it would notice the setting
and pass it along to <code>emacsclient</code> with <code>--socket-name</code>, to tell
<code>emacsclient</code> to look in the right place.  Having set this up I could
forget all about the original problem if I wanted to.</p>

<h3>But but but WHY?</h3>

<p>But why was Perl removing <code>TMPDIR</code> from the environment?  I didn't
figure out the answer to this; Frew took it to the <code>#p5p</code> IRC channel
on <code>perl.org</code>, where the answer was eventually tracked down by Matthew
Horsfall and Zefrem.</p>

<p>The answer turned out to be quite subtle.  One of the classic attacks
that can be mounted against a process with elevated privileges is as
follows.  Suppose you know that the program is going to write to a
temporary file.  So you set <code>TMPDIR</code> beforehand and trick it into
writing in the wrong place, possibly overwriting or destroying
something important.</p>

<p>When a program is loaded into a process, the dynamic loader does the
loading.  To protect against this attack, the loader checks to see if
the program it is going to run has elevated privileges, say because it
is setuid, and if so it sanitizes the process’ environment to prevent
the attack.  Among other things, it removes <code>TMPDIR</code> from the
environment.</p>

<p>I hadn't thought of exactly this, but I had thought of something like
it:  If <em>Perl</em> detects that it is running setuid, it enables 
a secure mode which, among other things, sanitizes the environment.
For example, it ignores the <code>PERL5LIB</code> environment variable that
normally tells it where to look for loadable modules, and instead
loads modules only from a few compiled-in trustworthy directories.  I
had checked early on to see if this was causing the <code>TMPDIR</code> problem,
but the <code>perl</code> executable was not setuid and Perl was not running in
secure mode.</p>

<p>But Linux supports a feature called “capabilities”, which is a sort of
partial superuser privilege.  You can give a program <em>some</em> of the
superuser's capabilities without giving away the keys to the whole
kingdom.  Our systems were configured to give <code>perl</code> one extra
capability, of binding to low-numbered TCP ports, which is normally
permitted only to the superuser.  And when the dynamic loader ran
<code>perl</code>, it saw this additional capability and removed <code>TMPDIR</code> from
the environment for safety.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is why Emacs had the <code>TMPDIR</code> setting when run from the command
  line, but not when run via <code>git-re-edit</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Until this came up, I had not even been aware that the “capabilities”
feature existed.</p>

<h3>A red herring</h3>

<p>There was one more delightful confusion on the way to this happy
ending.  When Frew found out that it was just the Perl on my
development machine that was misbehaving, he tried logging into his
own, nearly identical development machine to see if it misbehaved in
the same way.  It did, but when he ran a system update to update Perl,
the problem went away.  He told me this would fix the problem on my
machine.  But I reported that I had updated my system a few hours
before, so there was nothing to update!</p>

<p>The elevated capabilities theory explained this also.  When Frew
updated his system, the new Perl was installed without the elevated
capability feature, so the dynamic loader did not remove <code>TMPDIR</code> from
the environment.  </p>

<p>When I had updated my system earlier, the same thing happened.  But
as soon as the update was complete, I reloaded my system configuration, which
reinstated the capability setting.  Frew hadn't done this.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<ul>
<li>The system configuration gave <code>perl</code> a special capability</li>
<li>so the dynamic loader sanitized its environment</li>
<li>so that when <code>perl</code> ran <code>emacs</code>,</li>
<li>the Emacs process didn't have the <code>TMPDIR</code> environment setting</li>
<li>which caused  Emacs to create its listening socket in the usual place</li>
<li>but because <code>emacsclient</code> <em>did</em> get the setting, it looked in the <em>wrong</em> place</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This computer stuff is amazingly complicated.  I don't know how anyone
gets anything done.</p>

      <p>The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court <span>suddenly couldn't access his email. According to Microsoft, that's because of US </span><a href="https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2025/11/04/internationaal-strafhof-dumpt-microsoft-en-kiest-voor-europees-alternatief-a4911821"><span>sanctions</span></a><span> against the court's employees. </span>The Trump administration was not amused by the Court's arrest warrant against the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>The main takeaway from this episode is that those looking to protect themselves from Trump's wrath would be wise not to depend on any companies from his country. According to the Dutch newspaper <a href="https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2025/11/04/internationaal-strafhof-dumpt-microsoft-en-kiest-voor-europees-alternatief-a4911821">NRC</a>, the International Criminal Court now uses a German alternative to Microsoft, though it has not officially commented on the switch.</p><p>The German alternative, OpenDesk, allows users to send emails, edit text-based documents, create presentations, share files, and make video calls. It is open source, so anyone can view and improve its code.</p><p>The same applies to another alternative, also from Germany, called Nextcloud. This office software has been tested by around 75 researchers from five Dutch universities since the beginning of 2025. Maybe other institutions could switch to it as well?</p><p><strong>Dependency</strong><br>Dutch higher education is highly dependent on American tech companies, especially Microsoft. Not only do students and staff use its software extensively, but their IT staff are tied to a wide range of specialised Microsoft software. In addition, Dutch universities store a lot of data in Microsoft's cloud.</p><p>Dutch lecturers have been sounding the alarm about this. Last Wednesday, the knowledge centre for practice-oriented research, DCC-PO, <a href="https://dcc-po.nl/publicaties/position-statement-digitale-soevereiniteit/">stated</a> that the dominance of parties such as Google and Microsoft threatens the autonomy of Dutch researchers. In their view, universities should adopt more open-source tools and open standards.</p><p>In July, the Young Academy also <a href="https://dub.uu.nl/en/news/young-academy-sounds-alarm-about-power-big-tech">warned</a> that students and staff at Dutch higher education institutions have no idea what tech companies are doing with their data. By outsourcing the management of IT systems, these educational institutions are losing technical knowledge and control. As a result, they are becoming increasingly dependent on big tech, putting academic freedom and independence at risk.</p><p><strong>Fickle</strong><br>Seven Dutch universities and one university college are already on the State of Florida's <a href="https://dub.uu.nl/en/news/utrecht-university-blacklisted-florida-pension-fund">sanctions list</a> for severing or freezing ties with Israeli institutions. With a fickle president like Donald Trump, educational institutions could also face “punishment” at any moment.</p><p>Can they do without Microsoft, however? Can they work without Office, Outlook, Teams and OneDrive? Not yet, according to UU professors José van Dijck and Albert Meijer. "All research and education would come to an immediate standstill," <a href="https://dub.uu.nl/en/news/professors-concerned-about-uus-dependence-big-tech">they wrote in March</a> in an open letter calling on the Executive Board to do something about digital dependence.</p><p>According to the professors, Utrecht University is particularly dependent on Microsoft Office 365. UU staff and students use the programme for email and video calls, writing and sharing documents, creating presentations and data storage, among other tasks. Such dependence makes for "vulnerabilities, especially in light of a rapidly changing geopolitical situation".</p><p>Meijer and Van Dijck believe that "dependence on big tech is fundamentally at odds with public values such as freedom, independence, autonomy and equality". The professors would like the Executive Board to invest more in "local expertise," for example, by using its own mail server. They also recommend collaborating with other European universities, especially those in Germany and France, "on an autonomous academic IT infrastructure".</p><p><strong>Breaking free</strong><br>It is becoming increasingly clear that dependence on big tech entails risks. This also applies to Dutch higher education, according to Wladimir Mufty, from SURF, the IT cooperative of Dutch education and research institutions. "We have already gone through an awareness phase that lasted several years. We have looked at where the dependencies lie, and now it is time to start trying out alternatives."</p><p>Mufty is SURF's digital sovereignty programme manager. At the end of last year, he sat down with five universities that wanted a single, shared digital environment for their research programme, AlgoSoc. Scientists from Delft, Utrecht, Rotterdam, Tilburg and Amsterdam (UvA) wanted to use the same appointment planner, share files, work together on a single text, and make video calls, without being dependent on a large provider. Mufty suggested the open source software package from Nextcloud.</p><p>One of the users, PhD student Jacqueline Kernahan from TU Delft, thinks that Nextcloud could compete with Microsoft, though there are still a few glitches here and there. She is not deterred by those, as she knows how problematic dependence on Microsoft is.</p><p>She demonstrates the software in the hall of her faculty in Delft. It looks very ordinary. "The word processor is quite good," says Kernahan, who is doing her PhD on quality and security controls in digital systems. "I'm an average user, so I don't need all the options and apps the programme has to offer. But, to be honest, Microsoft is making it increasingly attractive to switch. Now that the company is putting AI in everything, everything is becoming more annoying to use."</p><p>Nevertheless, Mufty believes that not all educational institutions will be able to switch to OpenDesk or Nextcloud overnight. "The Criminal Court now has to act quickly, under pressure, but if a university wanted to move away from Microsoft tomorrow, that would pose a problem."</p><p><strong>Entanglement</strong><br>Meanwhile, Microsoft is taking on more and more tasks. In addition to office software, it also develops artificial intelligence, builds its own data centres and even lays its own internet cables on the seabed. The company is “vertically integrated”, as specialists call it: everything can be done through one company, from basic technology to the end user.</p><p>And that's not all. Microsoft is also expanding “horizontally” by acquiring companies where content is the primary focus, rather than technology. "That's a new phase, which I find worrying," says Mufty. For example, Microsoft bought LinkedIn, with its hundreds of millions of active users who produce enormous amounts of data, and GitHub, where software developers can share and store their work.</p><p>SURF is keeping a close eye on these developments. "I would like our education to remain public and be able to pursue public values such as autonomy, independence and academic freedom. IT should be helpful, not controlling," says Mufty.</p><p>He views the collaboration between Microsoft and Sanoma with suspicion. The Finnish publisher, which also serves the Dutch education market through its Malmberg subsidiary, wants to make its teaching materials available via Microsoft Teams. Microsoft would then add its own “learning accelerators”, i.e. artificial intelligence designed to help personalise the learning process. “Things like this sometimes keep me awake at night,” sighs Mufty.</p><p><strong>Alternatives</strong><br>Dutch and European alternatives do exist. For example, research institute TNO is working with SURF and the Netherlands Forensic Institute on its own AI language model. There are also dedicated data centres.</p><p>Additionally, SURFConext is making headway with a secure login service. "But that's not enough. If logging in via Microsoft doesn't work in the future for whatever reason, we'll have a big problem. This also applies to applications that are not from Microsoft itself," explains Mufty.</p><p>In his view, we need serious alternatives. When the need arises, one shouldn't have to start from scratch. Moreover, competition ensures that the market leader cannot charge top dollar.</p><p>But which educational institution is willing to sacrifice itself to run those alternatives, with all the teething problems that entails, when Microsoft can deliver everything ready-made? Mufty believes that, especially in the beginning, educational institutions will have to run two systems in parallel, with additional expenditure on support, maintenance, and security. "But in my opinion, no sector is as value-driven as education and research. This is precisely where alternatives should be able to get off the ground."</p><p><strong>Rectors</strong><br>In 2019, the rectors of fourteen universities jointly published a compelling argument about the digital independence of Dutch higher education. The gist was that we risk losing control to Google and Microsoft.</p><p>Little has improved since then, according to Jacquelien Scherpen, Rector of the University of Groningen. "The coronavirus pandemic broke out just a few months after that article was published. We became even more dependent on big tech, because we didn't have time to look for alternatives." Microsoft Teams has become indispensable, for example.</p><p>Scherpen is the portfolio holder for digital sovereignty within UNL, the umbrella association for Dutch universities. She advocates taking small steps: "If we now choose an alternative product that functions less well, students and staff will start using free programmes, and we will be further away from our goal."</p><p>Moreover, Scherpen says that we need legislation to protect European alternatives from big tech. Suppose a university partners up with a European competitor of Microsoft, and then Microsoft buys that company, what is the university to do then?</p><p>That is not a theoretical scenario. She mentions the Dutch software company Solvinity, which is involved with government services such as DigiD and provides secure communication for the Ministry of Justice. An American company now wants to take it over.</p><p>Scherpen: "Perhaps we need to become more protectionist, without hindering the free exchange of new insights and innovations. We must ensure that the independence we are fighting for does not slip out of our hands again."</p>

				<strong>Petition richtet sich an:</strong>
									Deutscher Bundestag Petitionsausschuss							</p>

			<!--marker--><p>Open-Source-Software bildet heute das Fundament großer Teile der digitalen Infrastruktur – in Verwaltung, Wirtschaft, Forschung und im täglichen Leben. Selbst im aktuellen <b>Koalitionsvertrag</b> der <b>Bundesregierung</b> wird Open-Source-Software als elementarer Baustein zur Erreichung  <b>digitaler Souveränität</b> genannt.</p><p>Dennoch wird die Arbeit, die tausende Freiwillige dafür leisten, in Deutschland steuer- und förderrechtlich <b>nicht als Ehrenamt anerkannt</b>. Dieses Ungleichgewicht zwischen gesellschaftlicher Bedeutung und rechtlichem Status gilt es zu korrigieren.</p><p>Als aktiver Contributor in Open-Source-Projekten fordere ich daher, Open-Source-Arbeit als <b>gemeinwohlorientiertes Ehrenamt</b> anzuerkennen – gleichrangig mit Vereinsarbeit, Jugendarbeit oder Rettungsdiensten.</p>		</div>

					<h4>Begründung</h4>

			<div dir="ltr" lang="de">
				<!--marker--><p><b>1. Open-Source trägt nachweislich zum Gemeinwohl bei</b><br></p><ul><li>Open-Source-Projekte schaffen <b>freie, transparente und überprüfbare Software</b>, die allen zugutekommt.</li><li>Kritische Systeme wie <b>Internet-Protokolle, Sicherheitsbibliotheken, Gesundheits-IT, KI-Frameworks, Energieverwaltung, Bildungstechnologien und Kommunikationswerkzeuge</b> basieren maßgeblich auf freiwilligen Beiträgen.</li><li>Ohne diese Arbeit wäre Deutschland digital <b>abhängiger, weniger sicher und weniger innovativ</b>.</li></ul><p>Gemeinwohlorientierung ist ein zentrales Kriterium für ein Ehrenamt – und Open-Source erfüllt dieses in höchstem Maße.</p><p><b>2. Die Arbeit geschieht überwiegend unbezahlt – und ist freiwilliges bürgerschaftliches Engagement</b><br></p><ul><li>Die Mehrheit aller Entwicklungs-, Wartungs- und Dokumentationsleistungen erfolgt <b>ehrenamtlich in der Freizeit</b>.</li><li>Contributor übernehmen Verantwortung für <b>Sicherheit, Stabilität und Weiterentwicklung</b> zentraler Softwarekomponenten, ohne Vergütung und oft ohne Anerkennung.</li><li>Das Engagement ist <b>vergleichbar mit Tätigkeiten in gemeinnützigen Vereinen</b>, nur eben digital.</li></ul><p>Die rechtliche Gleichstellung mit klassischem Ehrenamt wäre daher folgerichtig.</p><p><b>3. Gesellschaftliche Abhängigkeit ohne gesellschaftliche Anerkennung</b><br></p><ul><li>Staatliche Einrichtungen, Kommunen, Schulen und Unternehmen <b>profitieren direkt</b> von Open-Source-Bibliotheken, Frameworks und Tools.</li><li>Sicherheitslücken wie „Heartbleed“ oder Log4Shell haben gezeigt, wie entscheidend die Arbeit der Maintainer für das <b>Schutzinteresse der Allgemeinheit</b> ist.</li><li>Gleichzeitig fehlen Ressourcen und Strukturen, weil die Arbeit <b>formal nicht als Ehrenamt</b> eingestuft ist – und damit <i>keinerlei steuerliche oder organisatorische Förderung</i> erhält.</li></ul><p>Dies erzeugt eine <b>unausgewogene Verantwortungslast</b>, die auf wenigen Freiwilligen liegt, während Millionen Nutzer*innen profitieren.</p><p><b>4. Anerkennung als Ehrenamt würde Rechtsklarheit schaffen</b></p><p>Durch eine formelle Anerkennung könnten:<br></p><ul><li><b>Aufwandsentschädigungen steuerfrei</b> gewährt werden (Ehrenamtspauschale/Übungsleiterpauschale).</li><li><b>Gemeinnützige Open-Source-Projekte</b> eine leichtere Einstufung nach §52 AO erreichen.</li><li>Contributor bei Haftungsfragen besser gestellt werden (analog zu §31a BGB für Vereinsvorstände).</li><li>Projekte rechtssicher Kosten erstatten oder Spendenquittungen ausstellen.</li></ul><p>Dies schafft <b>Transparenz</b>, <b>Rechtssicherheit</b> und <b>Nachhaltigkeit</b> im digitalen Ehrenamt.</p><p><b>5. Digitalisierung braucht freiwillige Kompetenz – und diese verdient Förderung</b><br></p><ul><li>Open-Source-Engagement erfordert hohe technische Kompetenz.</li><li>Freiwillige Entwickler*innen leisten Arbeit, die Unternehmen ansonsten für hohe Stundensätze einkaufen müssten.</li><li>Der Staat investiert Milliarden in Digitalisierung, ignoriert aber die Menschen, die die technologische Basis <b>freiwillig</b> pflegen.</li></ul><p>Eine Anerkennung als Ehrenamt wäre ein <b>kosteneffizienter Beitrag zur digitalen Souveränität</b> Deutschlands.</p><p><b>6. Deutschland hinkt international hinterher</b></p><p>Andere Staaten fördern Open-Source-Engagement bereits durch:</p><ul><li>steuerliche Begünstigungen</li><li>institutionelle Förderung</li><li>Anerkennung gemeinnütziger Softwareentwicklung</li></ul><p>Deutschland riskiert, im globalen Wettbewerb zurückzufallen, wenn Freiwilligenarbeit im digitalen Raum weiterhin <b>strukturell benachteiligt</b> wird.</p>			</div>

And it’s super obvious. That seems like a very fundamental thing.</em><span>”</span></p><p>Some of this may come as news to a lot of the machine learning community; it might be surprising coming from Sutskever, who is an icon of deep learning, having worked, inter alia, on the critical 2012 paper that showed how much GPUs could improve deep learning, the foundation of LLMs, in practice. He is also a co-founder of OpenAI, considered by many to have been their leading researcher until he departed after a failed effort to oust Sam Altman. </p><p><span>But none of what Sutskever said should actually come as a surprise, especially not to readers of this Substack, or to anyone who followed me over the years. Essentially </span><em>all</em><span> of it was in my pre-GPT 2018 article “</span><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00631" rel="">Deep learning: A Critical Appraisal</a></em><span>”, which argued for neurosymbolic approaches to complement neural networks (as Sutskever now is), for more </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05667" rel="">innate</a><span> (i.e., built-in, rather than learned) constraints (what Sutskever calls “new inductive constraints”) and/or in my 2022 “</span><em><a href="https://nautil.us/deep-learning-is-hitting-a-wall-238440/" rel="">Deep learning is hitting a wall</a></em><span>” evaluation of LLMs, which explicitly argued that the Kaplan scaling laws would eventually reach a point of diminishing returns (as Sutskever just did), and that problems with hallucinations, truth, generalization and reasoning would persist even as models scaled, much of which Sutskever just acknowledged.  </span></p><p><span>Subbarao Kambhampati, meanwhile, has been arguing or years about </span><a href="https://cotopaxi.eas.asu.edu/" rel="">limits on planning with LLMs</a><span>. Emily Bender has been saying for ages that an excess focus on LLMs has been “sucking the oxygen from the room” relative to other research approaches.

To be sure, the VC get even richer still if the investments pan out, to be sure. but they are covered either way; even if it all falls apart, the venture capitalists themselves will become wealthy from the management fees alone. (It is their clients, such as pension funds, that will take the hit). So venture capitalists may continue to support LLM mania, at least for a while.</p><p>But let’s suppose for the sake of argument that Sutskever and the rest of us are correct, and that AGI will never emerge straight from LLMs, and that to a certain extent that they have run their course, and that we do in fact need new ideas. </p><p>The question then becomes, what did it cost the field and society that it took so long for the machine learning mainstream to figure out what some of us, including virtually the entire neurosymbolic AI community had been saying for years?</p><p>§</p><p>The first and most obvious answer is money, which I estimate, back of the envelope as (roughly) a trillion dollars, much of it on Nvidia chips and massive salaries. (Zuckerberg has apparently hired some machine learning experts at salaries of $100,000,000 a year). </p><p><span>According to Ed Zitron’s calculations, “</span><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/big-tech-2tr/" rel="">Big Tech Needs $2 Trillion In AI Revenue By 2030 or They Wasted Their Capex</a><span>”. If Sutskever and I are right about the limits of LLMs, the only way to get to that $2T is to invent new ideas.</span></p><p>If the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results, trillion dollar investments in ever more expensive experiments aiming to reach AGI may be delusional to the highest degree.</p><p>To a first approximation, all the big tech companies, from OpenAI to Google to Meta to xAI to Anthropic to several Chinese companies, keep doing the same experiment over and over: building ever larger LLMs in hopes of reaching AGI. </p><p><span>It has never worked. Each new bigger, more expensive model ekes out measurable improvements, but returns appear to be diminishing (that’s what Sutskever is saying about </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" rel="">the Kaplan laws</a><span>) and none of these experiments has solved core issues around hallucinations, generalization, planning and reasoning, as Sutskever too now recognizes. </span></p><p><span>But it’s not just that a trillion dollars or more might go down the drain, but that there might be considerable collateral damage, to the rest of society, both economic and otherwise (e.g., in terms of how </span><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html" rel="">LLMs have undermined college education</a><span>). As Rogé Karma put in a recent article in The Atlantic, “</span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/09/ai-bubble-us-economy/684128/" rel="">The entire U.S. economy is being propped up by the promise of productivity gains that seem very far from materializing.</a><span>”   </span></p><p>To be fair,  nobody knows for sure what the blast radius would be. If LLM-powered AI didn’t meet expectations and became valued less, who would take the hit? Would it  just be the “limited partners” like pension funds who entrusted their money with VC firms? Or might the consequences be much broader? Might banks go down with the ship, in 2008-style liquidity crisis,possibly forcing taxpayers to bail them out? In the worst case, the impact of a deflated AI bubble could be immense. (Consumer spending, much of it fueled by wealthy people who could a hit on the stock market, might also drop, a recipe for recession.) </p><p>Even the White House has admitted concerns about this. As the White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks himself put it earlier this week, referring to a Wall Street Journal analysis, “Al-related investment accounts for half of GDP growth. A reversal [in that]  would risk recession.”  </p><p>Quoting from Karma’s article in The Atlantic :</p><blockquote><p><span>That prosperity [that GenAI was supposed to deliver]  has largely yet to materialize anywhere other than their share prices. (The exception is Nvidia, which provides the crucial inputs—advanced chips—that the rest of the Magnificent Seven are buying.) As </span><em>The Wall Street Journal</em><span> reports, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have seen their </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/the-ai-booms-hidden-risk-to-the-economy-731b00d6" rel="">free cash flow</a><span> decline by 30 percent over the past two years. By one </span><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-haters-gui/" rel="">estimate</a><span>, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Tesla will by the end of this year have collectively spent $560 billion on AI-related capital expenditures since the beginning of 2024 and have brought in just $35 billion in AI-related revenue. OpenAI and Anthropic are </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/anthropic-hits-3-billion-annualized-revenue-business-demand-ai-2025-05-30/" rel="">bringing</a><span> in lots of revenue and are growing fast, but they are still </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-does-not-expect-be-cash-flow-positive-until-2029-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-03-26/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="">nowhere</a><span> </span><a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-projects-soaring-growth-34-002016322.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="">near</a><span> profitable. Their valuations—roughly </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/01/business/dealbook/openai-ai-mega-funding-deal.html" rel="">$300 billion</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/anthropics-valuation-more-than-doubles-183-billion-after-13-billion-fundraise-2025-09-02/" rel="">$183 billion</a><span>, respectively, and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/technology/openai-chatgpt-stock-sale-valuation.html" rel="">rising</a><span>—are many multiples higher than their current revenues. (OpenAI </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/openai-expects-revenue-will-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year" rel="">projects</a><span> about $13 billion in revenues this year; </span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-projects-soaring-growth-to-34-5-billion-in-2027-revenue" rel="">Anthropic</a><span>, $2 billion to $4 billion.) Investors are betting heavily on the prospect that all of this spending will soon generate record-breaking profits. If that belief collapses, however, investors might start to sell en masse, causing the market to experience a large and painful correction.</span></p><p>…</p><p><span>The dot-com crash was bad, but it did not trigger a crisis. An AI-bubble crash could be different. AI-related investments have already </span><a href="https://paulkedrosky.com/honey-ai-capex-ate-the-economy/" rel="">surpassed</a><span> the level that telecom hit at the peak of the dot-com boom as a share of the economy. In the first half of this year, business spending on AI added more to GDP growth than all consumer spending </span><em>combined</em><span>. Many experts believe that a major reason the U.S. economy has been able to weather tariffs and mass deportations without a recession is because all of this AI spending is acting, in the </span><a href="https://paulkedrosky.com/honey-ai-capex-ate-the-economy/" rel="">words</a><span> of one economist, as a “massive private sector stimulus program.” An AI crash could lead broadly to less spending, fewer jobs, and slower growth, potentially dragging the economy into a recession. The economist Noah Smith </span><a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy" rel="">argues</a><span> that it could even lead to a financial crisis if the unregulated “private credit” loans funding much of the industry’s expansion all go bust at once.</span></p></blockquote><p>The whole thing looks incredibly fragile. </p><p>§</p><p>To put it bluntly, the world has gone “all in” on LLMs, but, as Sutskever’s interview highlights, there are many reasons to doubt that LLMs will ever deliver the rewards that many people expected. </p><p>The sad part is that most of the reasons have been known – though not widely accepted – for a very long time.  It all could have been avoided. But the machine learning community has arrogantly excluded other voices, and indeed whole other fields like the cognitive sciences. And we all now may be about to pay the price. </p><p>An old saying about such follies is that “six months in the lab can you save you an afternoon in the library”; here we may have wasted a trillion dollars and several years to rediscover what cognitive science already knew.</p><p>A trillion dollars is a terrible amount of money to have perhaps wasted. If the blast radius is wider it could be a lot more. It is all starting to feel like a tale straight out of Greek tragedy, an avoidable mixture of arrogance and power that just might wind up taking down the economy. </p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

If it didn’t include the word “literally” I’d assume some poetic license on the part of whoever, or whatever, wrote this. But even then it would be crazy wrong.</p><p>I’m not surprised or perturbed by the underlying sentiment. Some of my endings have been controversial for a long time. Tastes differ. Some readers would prefer more conclusive endings. Now, in some cases, such as Snow Crash, I simply can’t fathom why any reader could read the ending—a long action sequence in which the Big Bad is defeated, the two primary antagonists meet their maker and Y.T. is reconciled and reunited with her mother—as anything other than a proper wind-up to the story. In other cases, notably The Diamond Age and Seveneves, I can understand why readers who prefer a firm conclusion would end up being frustrated. It is simply not what I was trying to do in those books. So, for a long time, people have argued about some of my endings, and that’s fine.</p><p>In this case, though, we have a big company explicitly stating that several of my best-known books just stop mid-sentence, and putting in the word “literally” to eliminate any room for interpretive leeway.</p><p>This isn’t literary criticism, which consists of statements of opinion. This is a factual assertion that is (a) false, (b) easy to fact-check, and (c) casts my work ethic, and that of my editors, in an unflattering light.</p><p>It is interesting to speculate as to how such an assertion found its way onto A16Z’s website!</p><p>By far the most plausible explanation is that this verbiage was generated by an AI and then copy-pasted into the web page by a human who didn’t bother to fact-check it. This would explain the misspelling of my name and some peculiarities in the writing style. Of course, this kind of thing is happening all the time now in law, academia, journalism, and other fields, so it’s pretty unremarkable; it just caught my attention because it’s the first time it’s directly affected me.</p><p>The flow diagram looks like this:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png" width="1456" height="1091" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1091,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:138336,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://nealstephenson.substack.com/i/179984587?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>That does a pretty good job of explaining how this all might have come about.

It could be that the person (or the AI) who wrote the above excerpt decided to save some money by downloading one of those, and got a bad copy that was cut off in mid-sentence.</span></p><p>Even in the legit publishing industry, the quality of translations can be quite variable, and it’s difficult for authors to know whether a given translation was any good. I’ve seen translated editions of some of my books that look suspiciously short on page count. For all I know there might be translations of my books (legit or bootleg) that actually do stop mid-sentence!</p><p>I genuinely am grateful to have been included on this list! But I had to say something about this astonishing howler embedded in the otherwise reasonable verbiage.</p><p>Even the most cynical and Internet-savvy among us are somehow hard-wired to take anything we read on the Internet at face value. I’m as guilty as the next person. This has been a bad idea for a long time now, since bad actors have been swarming onto the Internet for decades.  Now, though, it’s a bad idea for a whole new reason: content we read on the Internet might not have been written by a person with an intent to misinform, but rather by an LLM with no motives whatsoever, and no underlying model of reality that enables it to determine fact from fiction.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

Radioactive iodine was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/chernobyl/faqs">a leading cause of death</a> in the first days and weeks, and, later, of cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>In an attempt to reduce the risk of radiation poisoning and long-term health complications, a 30km (19 mile) exclusion zone – also known as the "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sites.se.manchester.ac.uk/nuclearhitchhiker/2017/03/10/637/">zone of alienation" – was established</a> to keep people at a distance from the worst of the radioactive remains of reactor four.</p><p>But while humans were kept away, Zhdanova's black mould had slowly colonised the area.</p></div><div data-component="layout-block"><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Germán Orizaola/Pablo Burraco Ionising radiation may have led tree frogs inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone to have darker skin (left) than those outside it (right) (Credit: Germán Orizaola/ Pablo Burraco)"><span>Germán Orizaola/Pablo Burraco</span></p><figcaption>Ionising radiation may have led tree frogs inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone to have darker skin (left) than those outside it (right) (Credit: Germán Orizaola/ Pablo Burraco)</figcaption></figure><p>Like plants reaching for sunlight, Zhdanova's research indicated that the fungal hyphae of the black mould seemed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0953756209810575">attracted</a> to ionising radiation. But "radiotropism", as Zhdanova called it, was a paradox: ionising radiation is generally far more powerful than sunlight, a barrage of radioactive particles that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK401323/">shreds through DNA and proteins</a> like bullets puncture flesh. The damage it causes can trigger harmful mutations, destroy cells and kill organisms.</p><p>Along with the apparently radiotropic fungi, Zhdanova's surveys found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0953756208615026">36 other species of ordinary, but distantly related, fungi growing</a> around Chernobyl. Over the next two decades, her pioneering work on the radiotropic fungi she identified would reach far outside of Ukraine. It would add to knowledge of a potentially <a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2677413/">new foundation of life</a> on Earth – one that thrives on radiation rather than sunlight. And it would lead scientists at Nasa to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/ames/could-future-homes-on-the-moon-and-mars-be-made-of-fungi/">consider surrounding their astronauts in walls of fungi</a> for a durable form of life support.</p><p>At the centre of this story is a pigment found widely in life on Earth: melanin. This molecule, which can range from black to reddish brown, is what leads to different skin and hair colours in people. But it is also the reason why the various species of mould growing in Chernobyl were black. Their cell walls were <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0953756209810575">packed</a> with melanin.</p><p>Just as darker skin protects our cells from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, Zhdanova suspected that the melanin of these fungi was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1369527408001306?via%3Dihub">acting as a shield</a> against ionising radiation.</p></div><div data-component="layout-block"><div><p><span>Just as those black moulds colonised an abandoned world at Chernobyl, perhaps they could one day protect our first steps on new worlds elsewhere in the Solar System</span></p></div><p>It wasn't just fungi that were harnessing melanin's protective properties. In the ponds around Chernobyl, frogs with higher concentrations of melanin in their cells, and so darker in colour, were <a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/chernobyl-black-frogs-reveal-evolution-in-action-191034">better able to survive and reproduce</a>, slowly turning the local population living there black.</p><p>In warfare, a shield might protect a soldier from an arrow by deflecting the projectile away from their body. But melanin doesn't work like this. It isn't a hard or smooth surface. The radiation – whether UV or radioactive particles – is <a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2677413/">swallowed by its disordered structure</a>, its energy <a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2671032/">dissipated rather than deflected</a>. Melanin is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459156/">also an antioxidant</a>, a molecule that can turn the reactive ions that radiation produces in biological matter and return them to a stable state.</p><p>In 2007, Ekaterina Dadachova, a nuclear scientist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, added to Zhdanova's work on Chernobyl's fungi, revealing that their growth wasn't just directional (radiotropic) but actually <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17520016/">increased</a> in the presence of radiation. Melanised fungi, just like those inside Chernobyl's reactor, grew 10% faster in the presence of radioactive Caesium compared to the same fungi cultured without radiation, she found. Dadachova and her team also found that the melanised fungi that were irradiated appeared to be using the energy to help drive its metabolism. In other words, they were using it to grow.</p><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Elsevier/ Zhdanova et al. 2000 Cultures found in the fourth unit at Chernobyl, including Cladosporium sphaerospermum.

These fungi weren't just growing towards radiation for warmth or some unknown reaction between radiation and its surroundings as Zhdanova had suggested. Dadachova believed the fungi were actively feeding on the radiation's energy. She called this process "<a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17520016/">radiosynthesis</a>". And melanin was central to the theory.</p><p>"The energy of ionising radiation is around one million times higher than the energy of white light, which is used in photosynthesis," says Dadachova. "So you need a pretty powerful energy transducer, and this is what we think melanin is capable of doing – to transduce [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ionizing-radiation-and-health-effects">ionising radiation</a>] into usable levels of energy."&nbsp;</p><p>Radiosynthesis is still just a theory, as it can only be proven if the precise mechanism between melanin and metabolism is discovered. Scientists would need to find the exact receptor – or a particular nook in melanin's convoluted structure – that is involved in converting radiation into energy for growth.</p><p>In more recent years, Dadachova&nbsp;and her colleagues have started to identify some of the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32389299/">pathways</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33425251/">proteins</a>&nbsp;that might underlie the fungi's increase in growth with ionising radiation.&nbsp;</p><p>Not all melanised fungi show a tendency for radiotropism and positive growth in the presence of radiation. A 2006 <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16821711/">study</a> from Zhdanova and her colleagues, for example, found that only nine of the 47 species of melanised fungi they collected at Chernobyl grew towards a source of radioactive caesium (caesium-137).&nbsp;</p></div><div data-component="layout-block"><p>Similarly, in 2022, scientists at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-16063-z">found no difference in growth</a> when two species of fungi (one melanised, one not) were exposed to UV radiation and caesium-137.</p><p>But that same year, the same tendency for fungal growth when exposed to radiation <a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.877625/full">was found again –</a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.877625/full"> in space</a>.</p><p>Different from the radioactive decay found at Chernobyl, so-called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/analog-field-testing/why-space-radiation-matters/">galactic cosmic radiation</a> is an invisible storm of charged protons, each travelling near the speed of light through the Universe.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="4189490c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					<p>European governments have taken another step toward reviving the EU’s controversial <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/chat-control-2-0-eu-moves-toward-ending-private-communication">Chat Control agenda</a>, approving a new negotiating mandate for the Child Sexual Abuse Regulation in a closed session of the Council of the European Union on November 26.</p>
<p>The measure, presented as a tool for child protection, is once again drawing heavy criticism for its surveillance implications and the way it reshapes private digital communication in Europe.</p>
<p>Unlike earlier drafts, this version <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/eus-weakened-chat-control-bill-still-poses-major-privacy-risks">drops the explicit obligation</a> for companies to scan all private messages but quietly introduces what opponents describe as an indirect system of pressure.</p>
<p>It rewards or penalizes online services depending on whether they agree to carry out “voluntary” scanning, effectively making intrusive monitoring a business expectation rather than a legal requirement.</p>
<p>Former MEP Patrick Breyer, a long-standing defender of digital freedom and one of the most vocal opponents of the plan, said the deal “paves the way for a permanent infrastructure of mass surveillance.”</p>
<p>According to him, the Council’s text replaces legal compulsion with financial and regulatory incentives that push major US technology firms toward indiscriminate scanning.</p>
<p>He warned that the framework also brings “anonymity-breaking age checks” that will turn ordinary online use into an exercise in identity verification.</p>
<p>The new proposal, brokered largely through Danish mediation, comes months after the original “Chat Control 1.0” regulation appeared to have been shelved following widespread backlash.</p>
<p>It reinstates many of the same principles, requiring providers to assess their potential “risk” for child abuse content and to apply “mitigation measures” approved by authorities. In practice, that could mean pressure to install scanning tools that probe both encrypted and unencrypted communications.</p>
<p>Czech MEP Markéta Gregorová called the Council’s position “a disappointment…Chat Control…opens the way to blanket scanning of our messages.”</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CnZOD1FJo2Zk.jpg" alt="Dark-mode screenshot of a verified Twitter/X post warning that the EU Council approved “Chat Control,” allowing blanket scanning of messages, while saying the European Parliament opposes it; an embedded Czech headline reads “EU states agreed on a proposal against child pornography, Czechia voted against”; timestamp Nov 26, 2025, 5:04 AM and 88.9K views are shown." width="776" height="604" srcset="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CnZOD1FJo2Zk.jpg 776w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CnZOD1FJo2Zk-300x234.jpg 300w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CnZOD1FJo2Zk-768x598.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px"></p>
<p>Similar objections emerged across Europe.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, members of parliament forced their government to vote against the plan, warning that it combines “mandatory age verification” with a “voluntary obligation” scheme that could penalize any company refusing to adopt invasive surveillance methods. Poland and the Czech Republic also voted against, and Italy abstained.</p>
<p>Former Dutch MEP Rob Roos accused Brussels of operating “behind closed doors,” warning that “Europe risks sliding into digital authoritarianism.”</p>
<p>Beyond parliamentarians, independent voices such as Daniel Vávra, David Heinemeier Hansson, and privacy-focused company Mullvad have spoken out against the Council’s position, calling it a direct threat to private communication online.</p>
<p>Despite the removal of the word “mandatory,” the structure of the new deal appears to preserve mass scanning in practice.</p>
<p>Breyer described it as a “Trojan Horse,” arguing that by calling the process “voluntary,” EU governments have shifted the burden of surveillance to tech companies themselves.</p>
<p>The Council’s mandate introduces three central dangers that remain largely unacknowledged in the public debate.</p>
<p>First, so-called “voluntary scanning” turns mass surveillance into standard operating procedure. The proposal extends the earlier temporary regulation that allowed service providers to scan user messages and images without warrants.</p>
<p>Authorities like Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office have reported that roughly<a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/germany-chat-control-false-reports-surveillance-encryption-privacy"> half the alerts from such systems are baseless</a>, often involving completely legal content flagged by flawed algorithms. Breyer said these systems leak “tens of thousands of completely legal, private chats” to law enforcement every year.</p>
<p>Second, the plan effectively erases anonymous communication. To meet the new requirement to “reliably identify minors,” providers will have to implement universal age checks. This likely means ID verification or face scans before accessing even basic services such as email or messaging apps.</p>
<p>For journalists, activists, and anyone who depends on anonymity for protection, this system could make easy private speech functionally impossible.</p>
<p>Technical experts have repeatedly warned that age estimation “cannot be performed in a privacy-preserving way” and carries “a disproportionate risk of serious privacy violation and discrimination.”</p>
<p>Third, it risks digitally isolating young people. Under the Council’s framework, users under 17 could be blocked from many platforms unless they pass strict identity verification, including chat-enabled games and messaging services. Breyer called this idea “pedagogical nonsense,” arguing that it excludes teenagers instead of helping them develop safe online habits.</p>
<p>Member states remain divided: the Netherlands, Poland, and the Czech Republic rejected the text, while Italy abstained. Negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council are expected to begin soon, aiming for a final version before April 2026.</p>
<p>Breyer warned that the apparent compromise is no real retreat from surveillance. “The headlines are misleading: Chat Control is not dead, it is just being privatized,” he said. “We are facing a future where you need an ID card to send a message, and where foreign black-box AI decides if your private photos are suspicious. This is not a victory for privacy; it is a disaster waiting to happen.”</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>An SQLite database file with a defined schema
often makes an excellent application file format.
Here are a dozen reasons why this is so:

</p><ol>
<li> Simplified Application Development
</li><li> Single-File Documents
</li><li> High-Level Query Language
</li><li> Accessible Content
</li><li> Cross-Platform
</li><li> Atomic Transactions
</li><li> Incremental And Continuous Updates
</li><li> Easily Extensible
</li><li> Performance
</li><li> Concurrent Use By Multiple Processes
</li><li> Multiple Programming Languages
</li><li> Better Applications
</li></ol>

<p>Each of these points will be described in more detail below,
after first considering more closely the meaning of
"application file format".  See also the <a href="https://sqlite.org/aff_short.html">short version</a> of this
whitepaper.

</p><h2>What Is An Application File Format?</h2>

<p>
An "application file format" is the file format
used to persist application state to disk or to exchange
information between programs.
There are thousands of application file formats in use today.
Here are just a few examples:

</p><ul>
<li>DOC - Word Perfect and Microsoft Office documents
</li><li>DWG - AutoCAD drawings
</li><li>PDF - Portable Document Format from Adobe
</li><li>XLS - Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet
</li><li>GIT - Git source code repository
</li><li>EPUB - The Electronic Publication format used by non-Kindle eBooks
</li><li>ODT - The Open Document format used by OpenOffice and others
</li><li>PPT - Microsoft PowerPoint presentations
</li><li>ODP - The Open Document presentation format used by OpenOffice and others
</li></ul>

<p>We make a distinction between a "file format" and an "application format".
A file format is used to store a single object.  So, for example, a GIF or
JPEG file stores a single image, and an XHTML file stores text,
so those are "file formats" and not "application formats".  An EPUB file, 
in contrast, stores both text and images (as contained XHTML and GIF/JPEG
files) and so it is considered an "application format".  This article is
about "application formats".

</p><p>The boundary between a file format and an application format is fuzzy.
This article calls JPEG a file format, but for an image editor, JPEG 
might be considered the application format.  Much depends on context.
For this article, let us say that a file format stores a single object
and an application format stores many different objects and their relationships
to one another.

</p><p>Most application formats fit into one of these three categories:

</p><ol>
<li><p><b>Fully Custom Formats.</b>
Custom formats are specifically designed for a single application.
DOC, DWG, PDF, XLS, and PPT are examples of custom formats.  Custom
formats are usually contained within a single file, for ease of transport.
They are also usually binary, though the DWG format is a notable exception.
Custom file formats require specialized application code
to read and write and are not normally accessible from commonly
available tools such as unix command-line programs and text editors.
In other words, custom formats are usually "opaque blobs".
To access the content of a custom application file format, one needs
a tool specifically engineered to read and/or write that format.

</p></li><li><p><b>Pile-of-Files Formats.</b>
Sometimes the application state is stored as a hierarchy of
files.  Git is a prime example of this, though the phenomenon occurs
frequently in one-off and bespoke applications.  A pile-of-files format
essentially uses the filesystem as a key/value database, storing small
chunks of information into separate files.  This gives the
advantage of making the content more accessible to common utility
programs such as text editors or "awk" or "grep".  But even if many 
of the files in a pile-of-files format
are easily readable, there are usually some files that have their
own custom format (example: Git "Packfiles") and are hence
"opaque blobs" that are not readable
or writable without specialized tools.  It is also much less convenient
to move a pile-of-files from one place or machine to another, than
it is to move a single file.  And it is hard to make a pile-of-files
document into an email attachment, for example.  Finally, a pile-of-files
format breaks the "document metaphor":
there is no one file that a user can point to
that is "the document".

</p></li><li><p><b>Wrapped Pile-of-Files Formats.</b>
Some applications use a Pile-of-Files that is then encapsulated into
some kind of single-file container, usually a ZIP archive.  
EPUB, ODT,and ODP are examples of this approach.
An EPUB book is really just a ZIP archive that contains various
XHTML files for the text of book chapters, GIF and JPEG images for
the artwork, and a specialized catalog file that tells the eBook
reader how all the XML and image files fit together.  OpenOffice
documents (ODT and ODP) are also ZIP archives containing XML and
images that represent their content as well as "catalog" files that
show the interrelationships between the component parts.

</p><p>A wrapped pile-of-files format is a compromise between a full
custom file format and a pure pile-of-files format.
A wrapped pile-of-files format is not an opaque blob in the same sense
as a custom format, since the component parts can still be accessed
using any common ZIP archiver, but the format is not quite as accessible
as a pure pile-of-files format because one does still need the ZIP 
archiver, and one cannot normally use command-line tools like "find"
on the file hierarchy without first un-zipping it.  On the other
hand, a wrapped pile-of-files format does preserve the document
metaphor by putting all content into a single disk file.  And
because it is compressed, the wrapped pile-of-files format tends to
be more compact.

</p><p>As with custom file formats, and unlike pure pile-of-file formats,
a wrapped pile-of-files format is not as easy to edit, since
usually the entire file must be rewritten in order to change any
component part.
</p></li></ol>

<p>The purpose of this document is to argue in favor of a fourth
new category of application file format: An SQLite database file.

</p><h2>SQLite As The Application File Format</h2>

<p>
Any application state that can be recorded in a pile-of-files can
also be recorded in an SQLite database with a simple key/value schema
like this:
</p><blockquote><pre>CREATE TABLE files(filename TEXT PRIMARY KEY, content BLOB);
</pre></blockquote>
If the content is compressed, then such an <a href="https://sqlite.org/sqlar.html">SQLite Archive</a> database is
<a href="https://sqlite.org/affcase1.html#smaller">the same size</a> (±1%)
as an equivalent ZIP archive, and it has the advantage
of being able to update individual "files" without rewriting
the entire document.

<p>
But an SQLite database is not limited to a simple key/value structure
like a pile-of-files database.  An SQLite database can have dozens
or hundreds or thousands of different tables, with dozens or
hundreds or thousands of fields per table, each with different datatypes
and constraints and particular meanings, all cross-referencing each other,
appropriately and automatically indexed for rapid retrieval,
and all stored efficiently and compactly in a single disk file.
And all of this structure is succinctly documented for humans
by the SQL schema.

</p><p>In other words, an SQLite database can do everything that a 
pile-of-files or wrapped pile-of-files format can do, plus much more,
and with greater lucidity.
An SQLite database is a more versatile container than key/value
filesystem or a ZIP archive.  (For a detailed example, see the
<a href="https://sqlite.org/affcase1.html">OpenOffice case study</a> essay.)

</p><p>The power of an SQLite database could, in theory, be achieved using
a custom file format.  But any custom file format that is as expressive
as a relational database would likely require an enormous design specification 
and many tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of code to 
implement.  And the end result would be an "opaque blob" that is
inaccessible without specialized tools.

</p><p>
Hence, in comparison to other approaches, the use of
an SQLite database as an application file format has
compelling advantages.  Here are a few of these advantages,
enumerated and expounded:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p><b>Simplified Application Development.</b>
No new code is needed for reading or writing the application file.
One has merely to link against the SQLite library, or include the 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/amalgamation.html">single "sqlite3.c" source file</a> with the rest of the
application C code, and SQLite will take care of all of the application
file I/O.  This can reduce application code size by many thousands of
lines, with corresponding saving in development and maintenance costs.

</p><p>SQLite is one of the
<a href="https://sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">most used</a> software libraries in the world.
There are literally tens of billions of SQLite database files in use 
daily, on smartphones and gadgets and in desktop applications.
SQLite is <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html">carefully tested</a> and proven reliable.  It is not
a component that needs much tuning or debugging, allowing developers
to stay focused on application logic.

</p></li><li><p><b>Single-File Documents.</b>
An SQLite database is contained in a single file, which is easily
copied or moved or attached.  The "document" metaphor is preserved.

</p><p>SQLite does not have any file naming requirements
and so the application can use any custom file suffix that it wants
to help identify the file as "belonging" to the application.
SQLite database files contain a 4-byte <a href="https://sqlite.org/fileformat2.html#appid">Application ID</a> in
their headers that can be set to an application-defined value
and then used to identify the "type" of the document for utility
programs such as <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/file">file(1)</a>, further
enhancing the document metaphor.


</p></li><li><p><b>High-Level Query Language.</b>
SQLite is a complete relational database engine, which means that the
application can access content using high-level queries.  Application
developers need not spend time thinking about "how" to retrieve the
information they need from a document.  Developers can write SQL that
expresses "what" information they want and let the database engine
figure out how to best retrieve that content.  This helps developers
operate "heads up" and remain focused on solving the user's problem,
and avoid time spent "heads down" fiddling with low-level file
formatting details.

</p><p>A pile-of-files format can be viewed as a key/value database.  
A key/value database is better than no database at all.
But without transactions or indices or a high-level query language or
a proper schema,
it is much harder and more error prone to use a key/value database than
a relational database.

</p></li><li><p><b>Accessible Content.</b>
Information held in an SQLite database file is accessible using 
commonly available open-source command-line tools - tools that 
are installed by default on Mac and Linux systems and that are 
freely available as a self-contained EXE file on Windows.
Unlike custom file formats, application-specific programs are
not required to read or write content in an SQLite database.
An SQLite database file is not an opaque blob.  It is true
that command-line tools such as text editors or "grep" or "awk" are
not useful on an SQLite database, but the SQL query language is a much
more powerful and convenient way for examining the content, so the
inability to use "grep" and "awk" and the like is not seen as a loss.

</p><p>An SQLite database is a <a href="https://sqlite.org/fileformat2.html">well-defined and well-documented</a>
file format that is in widespread use by literally millions of applications
and is backwards compatible to its inception in 2004 and which promises
to continue to be compatible in decades to come.  The longevity of
SQLite database files is particularly important to bespoke applications,
since it allows the document content to be accessed far in the
future, long after all traces of the original application have been lost.
Data lives longer than code.
SQLite databases are <a href="https://sqlite.org/locrsf.html">recommended by the US Library of Congress</a>
as a storage format for long-term preservation of digital content.


</p></li><li><p><b>Cross-Platform.</b>
SQLite database files are portable between 32-bit and 64-bit machines and
between big-endian and little-endian architectures and between any of the
various flavors of Windows and Unix-like operating systems.
The application using an SQLite application file format can store
binary numeric data without having to worry about the byte-order of
integers or floating point numbers.
Text content can be read or written as UTF-8, UTF-16LE, or UTF-16BE and 
SQLite will automatically perform any necessary translations on-the-fly.

</p></li><li><p><b>Atomic Transactions.</b>
Writes to an SQLite database are <a href="https://sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html">atomic</a>.  
They either happen completely
or not at all, even during system crashes or power failures.  So
there is no danger of corrupting a document just because the power happened
to go out at the same instant that a change was being written to disk.

</p><p>SQLite is transactional, meaning that multiple changes can be grouped
together such that either all or none of them occur, and so that the
changes can be rolled back if a problem is found prior to commit.
This allows an application to make a change incrementally, then run
various sanity and consistency checks on the resulting data prior to
committing the changes to disk.  The
<a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/">Fossil</a> DVCS 
<a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/tip/www/selfcheck.wiki">uses this technique</a>
to verify that no repository history has been lost prior to each change.

</p></li><li><p><b>Incremental And Continuous Updates.</b>
When writing to an SQLite database file, only those parts of the file that
actually change are written out to disk.  This makes the writing happen faster
and saves wear on SSDs.  This is an enormous advantage over custom
and wrapped pile-of-files formats, both of which usually require a
rewrite of the entire document in order to change a single byte.  
Pure pile-of-files formats can also
do incremental updates to some extent, though the granularity of writes is 
usually larger with pile-of-file formats (a single file) than with SQLite
(a single page).

</p><p>SQLite also supports continuous update.
Instead of collecting changes in memory and then writing
them to disk only on a File/Save action, changes can be written back to
the disk as they occur.  This avoids loss of work on a system crash or
power failure.  An <a href="https://sqlite.org/undoredo.html">automated undo/redo stack</a>, managed using triggers,
can be kept in the on-disk database, meaning that undo/redo can occur 
across session boundaries.

</p></li><li><p><b>Easily Extensible.</b>
As an application grows, new features can be added to an
SQLite application file format simply by adding new tables to the schema
or by adding new columns to existing tables.  Adding columns or tables
does not change the meaning of prior queries, so with a 
modicum of care to ensuring that the meaning of legacy columns and
tables are preserved, backwards compatibility is maintained.

</p><p>It is possible to extend custom or pile-of-files formats too, of course,
but doing so is often much harder.  If indices are added, then all application
code that changes the corresponding tables must be located and modified to
keep those indices up-to-date.  If columns are added, then all application
code that accesses the corresponding table must be located and modified to 
take into account the new columns.

</p></li><li><p><b>Performance.</b>
In many cases, an SQLite application file format will be 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html">faster than a pile-of-files format</a> or
a custom format.  In addition to being faster for raw read and
writes, SQLite can often dramatically improves start-up times because 
instead of having to
read and parse the entire document into memory, the application can
do queries to extract only the information needed for the initial screen.
As the application progresses, it only needs to load as much material as
is needed to draw the next screen, and can discard information from
prior screens that is no longer in use.  This helps keep the memory
footprint of the application under control.

</p><p>A pile-of-files format can be read incrementally just like SQLite.
But many developers are surprised to learn that SQLite can read and 
write smaller BLOBs (less than about 100KB in size) from its database 
faster than those same blobs can be read or written as separate files 
from the filesystem.  (See
<a href="https://sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html">35% Faster Than The Filesystem</a> and
<a href="https://sqlite.org/intern-v-extern-blob.html">Internal Versus External BLOBs</a> for further information.)
There is overhead associated with operating a relational
database engine, however one should not assume that direct file I/O
is faster than SQLite database I/O, as often it is not.

</p><p>In either case, if performance problems do arise in an SQLite application 
those problems can often be resolved by adding one or two <a href="https://sqlite.org/lang_createindex.html">CREATE INDEX</a>
statements to the schema or perhaps running <a href="https://sqlite.org/lang_analyze.html">ANALYZE</a> one time
and without having to touch a single line of
application code.  But if a performance problem comes up in a custom or 
pile-of-files format, the fix will often require extensive changes
to application code to add and maintain new indices or to extract 
information using different algorithms.

</p></li><li><p><b>Concurrent Use By Multiple Processes.</b>
SQLite automatically coordinates concurrent access to the same
document from multiple threads and/or processes.  Two or more
applications can connect and read from the same document at the
same time.  Writes are serialized, but as writes normally only
take milliseconds, applications simply take turns writing.
SQLite automatically ensures that the low-level format of the
document is uncorrupted.  Accomplishing the same with a custom
or pile-of-files format, in contrast, requires extensive support
in the application.  And the application logic needed to support
concurrency is a notorious bug-magnet.

</p></li><li><p><b>Multiple Programming Languages.</b>
Though SQLite is itself written in ANSI-C, interfaces exist for
just about every other programming language you can think of:
C++, C#, Objective-C, Java, Tcl, Perl, Python, Ruby, Erlang,
JavaScript, and so forth.  So programmers can develop in whatever
language they are most comfortable with and which best matches
the needs of the project.

</p><p>An SQLite application file format is a great 
choice in cases where there is a collection or "federation" of
separate programs, often written in different languages and by
different development teams.
This comes up commonly in research or laboratory
environments where one team is responsible for data acquisition
and other teams are responsible for various stages of analysis.
Each team can use whatever hardware, operating system,
programming language and development methodology that they are 
most comfortable with, and as long as all programs use an SQLite 
database with a common schema, they can all interoperate.


</p></li><li><p><b>Better Applications.</b>
If the application file format is an SQLite database, the complete
documentation for that file format consists of the database schema,
with perhaps a few extra words about what each table and column
represents.  The description of a custom file format,
on the other hand, typically runs on for hundreds of 
pages.  A pile-of-files format, while much simpler and easier to
describe than a fully custom format, still tends to be much larger
and more complex than an SQL schema dump, since the names and format
for the individual files must still be described.

</p><p>This is not a trivial point.  A clear, concise, and easy to understand
file format is a crucial part of any application design.
Fred Brooks, in his all-time best-selling computer science text,
<i>The Mythical Man-Month</i> says:
</p><blockquote><i>Representation is the
essence of computer programming.<br>...<br>
Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall 
continue to be mystified.  Show me your tables, and I won't usually
need your flowcharts; they'll be obvious.</i></blockquote>
<p>Rob Pike, in his
<i>Rules of Programming</i> expresses the same idea this way:
</p><blockquote>
<i>Data dominates.  If you've chosen the right data structures
and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always
be self-evident.  Data structures, not algorithms, are central
to programming.</i></blockquote>
<p> Linus Torvalds used different words to say
much the same thing on the Git mailing list on 2006-06-27: 
</p><blockquote>
<i>Bad programmers worry about the code.  Good programmers worry
about data structures and their relationships.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>The point is this: an SQL database schema almost always does 
a far better job of defining and organizing the tables and 
data structures and their relationships.
And having clear, concise, and well-defined representation
almost always results in an application that performs better,
has fewer problems, and is easier to develop and maintain.
</p></li></ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
SQLite is not the perfect application file format for every situation.
But in many cases, SQLite is a far better choice than either a custom
file format, a pile-of-files, or a wrapped pile-of-files.
SQLite is a high-level, stable, reliable, cross-platform, widely-deployed,
extensible, performant, accessible, concurrent file format.  It deserves
your consideration as the standard file format on your next application
design.

<p dir="auto"><strong>Glasses to detect smart-glasses that have cameras</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">I'm experimenting with 2 main approaches:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="#optics">Optics</a>: classify the camera using light reflections.</li>
<li><a href="#networking">Networking</a>: bluetooth and wi-fi analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">So far fingerprinting specific devices based on bluetooth (BLE) is looking like easiest and most reliable approach. The picture below is the first version, which plays the legend of zelda 'secret found' jingle when it detects a BLE advertisement from Meta Raybans.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/blob/main/banrays_physical_v1.png"><img src="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/raw/main/banrays_physical_v1.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I'm essentially treating this README like a logbook, so it will have my current approaches/ideas.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Optics</h2><a id="user-content-optics" aria-label="Permalink: Optics" href="#optics"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">By sending IR at camera lenses, we can take advantage of the fact that the CMOS sensor in a camera reflects light directly back at the source (called 'retro-reflectivity' / 'cat-eye effect') to identify cameras.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/blob/main/irrb.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/raw/main/irrb.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This isn't exactly a new idea. Some researchers in 2005 used this property to create 'capture-resistant environments' when smartphones with cameras were gaining popularity.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/papers/cre.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/papers/cre.pdf</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">There's even some recent research (2024) that figured out how to classify individual cameras based on their retro-reflections.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-32-8-13836" rel="nofollow">https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-32-8-13836</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Now we have a similar situation to those 2005 researchers on our hands, where smart glasses with hidden cameras seem to be getting more popular. So I want to create a pair of glasses to identify these. Unfortunately, from what I can tell most of the existing research in this space records data with a camera and then uses ML, a ton of controlled angles, etc. to differentiate between normal reflective surfaces and cameras.</p>
<p dir="auto">I would feel pretty silly if my solution uses its own camera. So I'll be avoiding that. Instead I think it's likely I'll have to rely on being consistent with my 'sweeps', and creating a good classifier based on signal data. For example you can see here that the back camera on my smartphone seems to produce quick and large spikes, while the glossy screen creates a more prolonged wave.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/blob/main/ts_plot_labeled.png"><img src="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/raw/main/ts_plot_labeled.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/blob/main/ts_plot_spikes.png"><img src="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/raw/main/ts_plot_spikes.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">After getting to test some Meta Raybans, I found that this setup is not going to be sufficient. Here's a test of some sweeps of the camera-area + the same area when the lens is covered. You can see the waveform is similar to what I saw in the earlier test (short spike for camera, wider otherwise), but it's wildly inconsistent and the strength of the signal is very weak. This was from about 4 inches away from the LEDs. I didn't notice much difference when swapping between 940nm and 850nm LEDs.</p>

<p dir="auto">So at least with current hardware that's easy for me to access, this probably isn't enough to differentiate accurately.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another idea I had is to create a designated sweep 'pattern'. The user (wearing the detector glasses) would perform a specific scan pattern of the target. Using the waveforms captured from this data, maybe we can more accurately fingerprint the raybans. For example, sweeping across the targets glasses in a 'left, right, up, down' approach. I tested this by comparing the results of the Meta raybans vs some aviators I had lying around. I think the idea behind this approach is sound (actually it's light), but it might need more workshopping.</p>

<p dir="auto">This has been more tricky than I first thought! My current approach here is to fingerprint the Meta Raybans over Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) advertisements. But, <strong>I have only been able to detect BLE traffic during 1) pairing 2) powering-on</strong>. I sometimes also see the advertisement as they are taken out of the case (while already powered on), but not consistently.</p>

<p dir="auto">The goal is to detect them during usage when they're communicating with the paired phone, but to see this type of directed BLE traffic it seems like I would first need to see the <code>CONNECT_REQ</code> packet which has information as to what which of the communication channels to hop between in sync. I don't think what I currently have (ESP32) is set up to do this kind of following.</p>

</ul>
<p dir="auto">For any of the bluetooth classic (BTC) traffic, unfortunately the hardware seems a bit more involved (read: expensive). So if I want to do down this route, I'll likely need a more clever solution here.</p>
<p dir="auto">When turned on or put into pairing mode (or sometimes when taken out of the case), I can detect the device through advertised manufacturer data and service UUIDs. <code>0x01AB</code> is a Meta-specific SIG-assigned ID (assigned by the Bluetooth standards body), and <code>0xFD5F</code> in the Service UUID is assigned to Meta as well.</p>

		<h2 id="1-core-principles">1. Core principles</h2>
		<p>
			Tiger Style is not just a set of coding standards; it's a practical
			approach to software development. By prioritizing
			<strong>safety</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, and
			<strong>developer experience</strong>, you create code that is reliable,
			efficient, and enjoyable to work with.
		</p>

		<h4 id="safety">Safety</h4>
		<p>
			Safety is the foundation of Tiger Style. It means writing code that
			works in all situations and reduces the risk of errors. Focusing on
			safety makes your software reliable and trustworthy.
		</p>

		<h4 id="performance">Performance</h4>
		<p>
			Performance is about using resources efficiently to deliver fast,
			responsive software. Prioritizing performance early helps you design
			systems that meet or exceed user expectations.
		</p>

		<h4 id="developer-experience">Developer experience</h4>
		<p>
			A good developer experience improves code quality and maintainability.
			Readable and easy-to-work-with code encourages collaboration and reduces
			errors, leading to a healthier codebase that stands the test of time
			<a href="#addendum-zero-technical-debt">[1]</a>.
		</p>

		<h2 id="2-design-goals">2. Design goals</h2>

		<p>
			The design goals focus on building software that is safe, fast, and easy
			to maintain.
		</p>

		<h3 id="2.1-safety">2.1. Safety</h3>

		<p>
			Safety in coding relies on clear, structured practices that prevent
			errors and strengthen the codebase. It's about writing code that works
			in all situations and catches problems early. By focusing on safety, you
			create reliable software that behaves predictably no matter where it
			runs.
		</p>

		<h4 id="control-and-limits">Control and limits</h4>

		<p>
			Predictable control flow and bounded system resources are essential for
			safe execution.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li id="simple-and-explicit-control-flow">
				<p>
					<strong>Simple and explicit control flow</strong>: Favor
					straightforward control structures over complex logic. Simple
					control flow makes code easier to understand and reduces the risk of
					bugs. Avoid recursion if possible to keep execution bounded and
					predictable, preventing stack overflows and uncontrolled resource
					use.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="set-fixed-limits">
				<p>
					<strong>Set fixed limits</strong>: Set explicit upper bounds on
					loops, queues, and other data structures. Fixed limits prevent
					infinite loops and uncontrolled resource use, following the
					<strong>fail-fast</strong> principle. This approach helps catch
					issues early and keeps the system stable.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="limit-function-length">
				<p>
					<strong>Limit function length</strong>: Keep functions concise,
					ideally under <strong>70 lines</strong>. Shorter functions are
					easier to understand, test, and debug. They promote single
					responsibility, where each function does one thing well, leading to
					a more modular and maintainable codebase.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="centralize-control-flow">
				<p>
					<strong>Centralize control flow</strong>: Keep switch or if
					statements in the main parent function, and move non-branching logic
					to helper functions. Let the parent function manage state, using
					helpers to calculate changes without directly applying them. Keep
					leaf functions pure and focused on specific computations. This
					divides responsibility: one function controls flow, others handle
					specific logic.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 id="memory-and-types">Memory and types</h4>
		<p>
			Clear and consistent handling of memory and types is key to writing
			safe, portable code.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li id="use-explicitly-sized-types">
				<p>
					<strong>Use explicitly sized types</strong>: Use data types with
					explicit sizes, like <code>u32</code> or <code>i64</code>, instead
					of architecture-dependent types like <code>usize</code>. This keeps
					behavior consistent across platforms and avoids size-related errors,
					improving portability and reliability.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="static-memory-allocation">
				<p>
					<strong>Static memory allocation</strong>: Allocate all necessary
					memory during startup and avoid dynamic memory allocation after
					initialization. Dynamic allocation at runtime can cause
					unpredictable behavior, fragmentation, and memory leaks. Static
					allocation makes memory management simpler and more predictable.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="minimize-variable-scope">
				<p>
					<strong>Minimize variable scope</strong>: Declare variables in the
					smallest possible scope. Limiting scope reduces the risk of
					unintended interactions and misuse. It also makes the code more
					readable and easier to maintain by keeping variables within their
					relevant context.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 id="error-handling">Error handling</h4>

		<p>
			Correct error handling keeps the system robust and reliable in all
			conditions.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li id="use-assertions">
				<p>
					<strong>Use assertions</strong>: Use assertions to verify that
					conditions hold true at specific points in the code. Assertions work
					as internal checks, increase robustness, and simplify debugging.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Assert function arguments and return values</strong>:
						Check that functions receive and return expected values.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Validate invariants</strong>: Keep critical conditions
						stable by asserting invariants during execution.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Use pair assertions</strong>: Check critical data at
						multiple points to catch inconsistencies early.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Fail fast on programmer errors</strong>: Detect unexpected
						conditions immediately, stopping faulty code from continuing.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li id="handle-all-errors">
				<p>
					<strong>Handle all errors</strong>: Check and handle every error.
					Ignoring errors can lead to undefined behavior, security issues, or
					crashes. Write thorough tests for error-handling code to make sure
					your application works correctly in all cases.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="treat-compiler-warnings-as-errors">
				<p>
					<strong>Treat compiler warnings as errors</strong>: Use the
					strictest compiler settings and
					<strong>treat all warnings as errors</strong>. Warnings often point
					to potential issues that could cause bugs. Fixing them right away
					improves code quality and reliability.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="avoid-implicit-defaults">
				<p>
					<strong>Avoid implicit defaults</strong>: Explicitly specify options
					when calling library functions instead of relying on defaults.
					Implicit defaults can change between library versions or across
					environments, causing inconsistent behavior. Being explicit improves
					code clarity and stability.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="2.2-performance">2.2. Performance</h3>

		<p>
			Performance is about using resources efficiently to deliver fast,
			responsive software. Prioritizing performance early helps design systems
			that meet or exceed user expectations without unnecessary overhead.
		</p>

		<h4 id="design-for-performance">Design for performance</h4>

		<p>
			Early design decisions have a significant impact on performance.
			Thoughtful planning helps avoid bottlenecks later.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li id="design-for-performance-early">
				<p>
					<strong>Design for performance early</strong>: Consider performance
					during the initial design phase. Early architectural decisions have
					a big impact on overall performance, and planning ahead ensures you
					can avoid bottlenecks and improve resource efficiency.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="napkin-math">
				<p>
					<strong>Napkin math</strong>: Use quick, back-of-the-envelope
					calculations to estimate system performance and resource costs. For
					example, estimate how long it takes to read 1 GB of data from memory
					or what the expected storage cost will be for logging 100,000
					requests per second. This helps set practical expectations early and
					identify potential bottlenecks before they occur.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="batch-operations">
				<p>
					<strong>Batch operations</strong>: Amortize expensive operations by
					processing multiple items together. Batching reduces overhead per
					item, increases throughput, and is especially useful for I/O-bound
					operations.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 id="efficient-resource-usage">Efficient resource use</h4>
		<p>Focus on optimizing the slowest resources, typically in this order:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Network</strong>: Optimize data transfer and reduce latency.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Disk</strong>: Improve I/O operations and manage storage
				efficiently.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Memory</strong>: Use memory effectively to prevent leaks and
				overuse.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>CPU</strong>: Increase computational efficiency and reduce
				processing time.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h4 id="predictability">Predictability</h4>
		<p>
			Writing predictable code improves performance by reducing CPU cache
			misses and optimizing branch prediction.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li id="ensure-predictability">
				<p>
					<strong>Ensure predictability</strong>: Write code with predictable
					execution paths. Predictable code uses CPU caching and branch
					prediction better, leading to improved performance. Avoid patterns
					that cause frequent cache misses or unpredictable branching, as they
					degrade performance.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li id="reduce-compiler-dependence">
				<p>
					<strong>Reduce compiler dependence</strong>: Don't rely solely on
					compiler optimizations for performance. Write clear, efficient code
					that doesn't depend on compiler behavior. Be explicit in
					performance-critical sections to ensure consistent results across
					compilers.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="2.3-developer-experience">2.3. Developer experience</h3>
		<p>
			Improving the developer experience creates a more maintainable and
			collaborative codebase.
		</p>

		<h4 id="name-things-meaningfully">Name things</h4>
		<p>
			Get the nouns and verbs right. Great names capture what something is or
			does and create a clear, intuitive model. They show you understand the
			domain. Take time to find good names, where nouns and verbs fit
			together, making the whole greater than the sum of its parts.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li id="clear-and-consistent-naming">
				<p>
					<strong>Clear and consistent naming</strong>: Use descriptive and
					meaningful names for variables, functions, and files. Good naming
					improves code readability and helps others understand each
					component's purpose. Stick to a consistent style, like
					<code>snake_case</code>, throughout the codebase.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="avoid-abbreviations">
				<p>
					<strong>Avoid abbreviations</strong>: Use full words in names unless
					the abbreviation is widely accepted and clear (e.g.,
					<code>ID</code>, <code>URL</code>). Abbreviations can be confusing
					and make it harder for others, especially new contributors, to
					understand the code.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="include-units-or-qualifiers-in-names">
				<p>
					<strong>Include units or qualifiers in names</strong>: Append units
					or qualifiers to variable names, placing them in descending order of
					significance (e.g., <code>latency_ms_max</code> instead of
					<code>max_latency_ms</code>). This clears up meaning, avoids
					confusion, and ensures related variables, like
					<code>latency_ms_min</code>, line up logically and group together.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="document-the-why">
				<p>
					<strong>Document the 'why'</strong>: Use comments to explain why
					decisions were made, not just what the code does. Knowing the intent
					helps others maintain and extend the code properly. Give context for
					complex algorithms, unusual approaches, or key constraints.
				</p>
			</li>

			
		</ul>

		<h4 id="code-organization">Organize things</h4>

		<p>
			Organizing code well makes it easy to navigate, maintain, and extend. A
			logical structure reduces cognitive load, letting developers focus on
			solving problems instead of figuring out the code. Group related
			elements, and simplify interfaces to keep the codebase clean, scalable,
			and manageable as complexity grows.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li id="organize-code-logically">
				<p>
					<strong>Organize code logically</strong>: Structure your code
					logically. Group related functions and classes together. Order code
					naturally, placing high-level abstractions before low-level details.
					Logical organization makes code easier to navigate and understand.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li id="simplify-function-signatures">
				<p>
					<strong>Simplify function signatures</strong>: Keep function
					interfaces simple. Limit parameters, and prefer returning simple
					types. Simple interfaces reduce cognitive load, making functions
					easier to understand and use correctly.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="construct-objects-in-place">
				<p>
					<strong>Construct objects in-place</strong>: Initialize large
					structures or objects directly where they are declared. In-place
					construction avoids unnecessary copying or moving of data, improving
					performance and reducing the potential for lifecycle errors.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="minimize-variable-scope">
				<p>
					<strong>Minimize variable scope</strong>: Declare variables close to
					their usage and within the smallest necessary scope. This reduces
					the risk of misuse and makes code easier to read and maintain.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 id="ensure-consistency">Ensure consistency</h4>

		<p>
			Maintaining consistency in your code helps reduce errors and creates a
			stable foundation for the rest of the system.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li id="avoid-duplicates-and-aliases">
				<p>
					<strong>Avoid duplicates and aliases</strong>: Prevent
					inconsistencies by avoiding duplicated variables or unnecessary
					aliases. When two variables represent the same data, there's a
					higher chance they fall out of sync. Use references or pointers to
					maintain a single source of truth.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="pass-large-objects-by-reference">
				<p>
					<strong>Pass large objects by reference</strong>: If a function's
					argument is larger than 16 bytes, pass it as a reference instead of
					by value to avoid unnecessary copying. This can catch bugs early
					where unintended copies may occur.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="minimize-dimensionality">
				<p>
					<strong>Minimize dimensionality</strong>: Keep function signatures
					and return types simple to reduce the number of cases a developer
					has to handle. For example, prefer <code>void</code> over
					<code>bool</code>, <code>bool</code> over <code>u64</code>, and so
					on, when it suits the function's purpose.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="handle-buffer-allocation-cleanly">
				<p>
					<strong>Handle buffer allocation cleanly</strong>: When working with
					buffers, allocate them close to where they are used and ensure all
					corresponding cleanup happens in the same logical block. Group
					resource allocation and deallocation with clear newlines to make
					leaks easier to identify.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 id="avoid-off-by-one-errors">Avoid off-by-one errors</h4>

		<p>
			Off-by-one errors often result from casual interactions between an
			<code>index</code>, a <code>count</code>, or a <code>size</code>. Treat
			these as distinct types, and apply clear rules when converting between
			them.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li id="indexes-counts-sizes">
				<p>
					<strong>Indexes, counts, and sizes</strong>: Indexes are 0-based,
					counts are 1-based, and sizes represent total memory usage. When
					converting between them, add or multiply accordingly. Use meaningful
					<a href="#include-units-or-qualifiers-in-names">names with units or qualifiers</a>
					to avoid confusion. See
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="handle-division-intentionally">
				<p>
					<strong>Handle division intentionally</strong>: When dividing, make
					your intent clear by specifying how rounding should be handled in
					edge cases. Use functions or operators designed for exact division,
					floor division, or ceiling division. This avoids ambiguity and
					ensures the result behaves as expected.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 id="code-consistency-and-tooling">Code consistency and tooling</h4>

		<p>
			Consistency in code style and tools improves readability, reduces mental
			load, and makes working together easier.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li id="maintain-consistent-indentation">
				<p>
					<strong>Maintain consistent indentation</strong>: Use a uniform
					indentation style across the codebase. For example, using 4 spaces
					for indentation provides better visual clarity, especially in
					complex structures.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="limit-line-lengths">
				<p>
					<strong>Limit line lengths</strong>: Keep lines within a reasonable
					length (e.g., 100 characters) to ensure readability. This prevents
					horizontal scrolling and helps maintain an accessible code layout.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="use-clear-code-blocks">
				<p>
					<strong>Use clear code blocks</strong>: Structure code clearly by
					separating blocks (e.g., control structures, loops, function
					definitions) to make it easy to follow. Avoid placing multiple
					statements on a single line, even if allowed. Consistent block
					structures prevent subtle logic errors and make code easier to
					maintain.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="minimize-external-dependencies">
				<p>
					<strong>Minimize external dependencies</strong>: Reducing external
					dependencies simplifies the build process and improves security
					management. Fewer dependencies lower the risk of supply chain
					attacks, minimize performance issues, and speed up installation.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li id="standardize-tooling">
				<p>
					<strong>Standardize tooling</strong>: Using a small, standardized
					set of tools simplifies the development environment and reduces
					accidental complexity. Choose cross-platform tools where possible to
					avoid platform-specific issues and improve portability across
					systems.
				</p>
			</li>

			<p>
				You should think about performance early in design. Napkin math is a
				helpful tool for this.
			</p>

			<p>
				Napkin math uses simple calculations and rounded numbers to quickly
				estimate system performance and resource needs.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Quick insights</strong>: Understand system behavior fast
					without deep analysis.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Early decisions</strong>: Find potential bottlenecks early
					in design.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Sanity checks</strong>: See if an idea works before you
					build it.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				For example, if you're designing a system to store logs, you can
				estimate storage costs like this:
			</p>

			<pre>				<code>
1. <strong>Estimate log volume</strong>:
   Assume 1,000 requests per second (RPS)
   Each log entry is about 1 KB

2. <strong>Calculate daily log volume</strong>:
   1,000 RPS * 86,400 seconds/day * 1 KB ≈ 86,400,000 KB/day ≈ 86.4 GB/day

3. <strong>Estimate monthly storage</strong>:
   86.4 GB/day * 30 days ≈ 2,592 GB/month

4. <strong>Estimate cost (using $0.02 per GB for blob storage)</strong>:
   2,592 GB * 1000 GB/TB * $0.02/GB ≈ $51 per month</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				This gives you a rough idea of monthly storage costs. It helps you
				check if your logging plan works. The idea is to get within 10x of the
				right answer.
