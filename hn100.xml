<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>It is with great sadness that the Simons Foundation announces the death of its co-founder and chair emeritus, James Harris Simons, on May 10, 2024, at the age of 86, in New York City.</p>
<p>Jim (as he preferred to be called) was an award-winning mathematician, a legend in quantitative investing, and an inspired and generous philanthropist.</p>
<p>Together with his wife, Simons Foundation chair Marilyn Simons, he gave billions of dollars to hundreds of philanthropic causes, particularly those supporting math and science research and education. In 1994, they<a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/"> established the Simons Foundation</a>, which supports scientists and organizations worldwide in advancing the frontiers of research in mathematics and the basic sciences.</p>
<p>Jim was active in the work of the Simons Foundation until the end of his life, and his curiosity and lifelong passion for math and basic science were an inspiration to those around him. He was determined to make a meaningful difference in the level of support that mathematics and basic sciences received in the United States, notably by sponsoring projects that were important but unlikely to find funding elsewhere.</p>
<p>Over its 30-year history, the Simons Foundation’s work has led to breakthroughs in our understanding of autism, the origins of the universe, cellular biology and computational science. Jim and Marilyn’s giving continues to support the next generation of mathematicians and scientists at schools and universities in New York City and around the world.</p>
<p>Jim <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2024/05/10/remembering-the-life-and-careers-of-jim-simons/">frequently said that he went through three phases in his professional life</a>: mathematician, investor and philanthropist. He previously chaired the math department at Stony Brook University in New York, and his mathematical breakthroughs during that time are now instrumental to fields such as string theory, topology and condensed matter physics.</p>
<p>In 1978, Jim founded what would become <a href="https://www.rentec.com/Home.action?index=true">Renaissance Technologies</a>, a hedge fund that pioneered quantitative trading and became one of the most profitable investment firms in history. He then turned his focus to making a difference in the world through the<a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/"> Simons Foundation</a>,<a href="https://www.sfi.org.bm/"> Simons Foundation International</a>,<a href="https://www.mathforamerica.org/"> Math for America</a> and other philanthropic efforts.</p>
<p>“Jim was an exceptional leader who did transformative work in mathematics and developed a world-leading investment company,” says Simons Foundation president David Spergel. “Together with Marilyn Simons, the current Simons Foundation board chair, Jim created an organization that has already had enormous impact in mathematics, basic science and our understanding of autism. The Simons Foundation, an in-perpetuity foundation, will carry their vision for philanthropy into the future.”</p>
<p>Jim Simons is survived by his wife, three children, five grandchildren, a great-grandchild, and countless colleagues, friends and family who fondly recall his genuine curiosity and quick wit.</p>
<p>We know that many people have stories, messages and memories they would like to share about Jim. Please send them to <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eb8489988e999d82858cab9882868485988d849e858f8a9f828485c584998c"><span data-cfemail="f09f9283958286999e97b083999d9f9e83969f859e949184999f9ede9f8297">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>.</p>
<p>Information on memorial services and other events honoring Jim’s life and legacy <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/observing/">will be posted on the Simons Foundation website</a>.</p>

<h2>:.: OpenBSD Desktop</h2>

<p>Yes, this is the year of the <a href="https://openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> Desktop!</p>

<p>I am a minimalist, and I tend to always keep it as small as I can, so I try to use all
I have in base (if it fits), plus of course some other tools needed.</p>

<p>My general list is:
 </p><ul>
  <li>WM: <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cwm.1">cwm(1)</a></li>
  <li>Statusbar: <a href="https://github.com/gonzalo-/termbarc">termbar</a></li>
  <li>Mail: <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=aerc">aerc</a> (now) - <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=neomutt">neomutt</a> (former)</li>
  <li>Browser: <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=firefox">Firefox</a> - <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=ungoogled-chromium">ungoogled-chromium</a></li>
  <li>FileManager: <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=walk">walk</a> (former llama)</li>
  <li>Editor: <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=emacs">emacs</a> - <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1">mg</a></li>
  <li>Photo Viewer: <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=geeqie">geeqie</a></li>
  <li>PDFs: <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=mupdf">mupdf</a> and <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=foliate">foliate</a> (for ebooks or more complex stuff)</li>
  <li>Others: <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a>, <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=got">got</a>, <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=duf">duf</a>, <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=sysclean">sysclean</a>, <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=tor">tor</a>, <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=remmina">remmina</a>, <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=feh">feh</a>, <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=sct">sct</a>, <a href="https://openbsd.app/?search=scrot">scrot</a> among others</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally I unslack myself and tried to write some C code to convert my <a href="https://github.com/gonzalo-/termbar">old termbar</a> into a <a href="https://github.com/gonzalo-/termbarc">new one</a> in C. There is still a lot to fix and adjust, but so far it works on my machines and
it shows all I need and want without any weird error.</p>

<p><a href="https://x61.ar/log/img/termbar.png" target="_blank">
	<img src="https://x61.ar/log/img/termbar.png" alt="termbar in C">
</a></p><p>Yes, I like anime and those colours are trying to emulate the <a href="https://x61.ar/log/img/eva01.png">eva 01</a>, my <b>.Xresources</b>
looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>!!! Colours
*color0: rgb:2a/3b/4d
*color1: rgb:c4/67/6c
*color2: rgb:66/ff/66
*color3: rgb:ff/ff/66
*color4: rgb:15/f4/ee
*color5: rgb:9c/6c/d3
*color6: rgb:4b/8f/77
*color7: rgb:9f/a2/a6
*color8: rgb:55/79/9c
*color9: rgb:c4/67/6c
*color10: rgb:66/ff/66
*color11: rgb:ff/ff/66
*color12: rgb:15/f4/ee
*color13: rgb:9c/6c/d3
*color14: rgb:4b/8f/77
*color15: rgb:ff/ff/ff
*color16: rgb:ff/99/66 # Base 09

*color20: rgb:7e/90/a3 # Base 04
*color21: rgb:d6/d7/d9 # Base 06</code></pre>

<p>My console is <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/xterm.1">xterm(1)</a> and I really don't need
much more than that, my bits for it in the <b>.Xresources</b> are:</p>

<pre><code>!!! Xterm
XTerm*background: black
XTerm*foreground: rgb:9f/a2/a6
XTerm*eightBitInput: false
XTerm*loginShell: true
XTerm*scrollBar: false
XTerm*saveLines: 2000
XTerm*faceName: dejavu sans mono:size=12
XTerm*internalBorder: 10
XTerm*locale: true
XTerm*pointerMode: 2
XTerm*allowTitleOps: true
XTerm*termName: xterm-256color</code></pre>

<p>I also have some love for <a href="https://github.com/gonzalo-/termbarc">termbar</a> in there, which
will show the right font, size, etc:</p>

<pre><code>!!! termbar
termbar*faceName: dejavu sans mono:size=12
termbar*geometry: 3840x1+0+0
termbar*internalBorder: 6
termbar*saveLines: 0
termbar*locale: true
termbar*scrollBar: false
termbar*title: termbar</code></pre>

<p>Those are colours, and I have my "setup" on my <b>.xsession</b>, I have it pretty much all
commented to here it is:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh -x

            <description><![CDATA[<p>See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40318542">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN, I wanted to show you a product a small team and I have been working on for 4 years. <a href="https://jam.dev/" rel="nofollow">https://jam.dev</a></p><p>It’s called Jam and it prevents product managers (like I used to be) from being able to create vague and un-reproducible bug tickets (like I used to create).</p><p>It’s actually really hard as a non-engineer to file useful bug tickets for engineers. Like, sometimes I thought I included a screenshot, but the important information the engineer needed was what was actually right outside the boundary of the screenshot I took. Or I'd write that something "didn't work" but the engineer wasn't sure if I meant that it returned an error or if it was unresponsive. So the engineer would be frustrated, I would be frustrated, and fixing stuff would slow to a halt while we went back and forth to clarify how to repro the issue over async Jira comments.</p><p>It’s actually pretty crazy that while so much has changed in how we develop software (heck, we have types in javascript now*), the way we capture and report bugs is just as manual and lossy as it was in the 1990’s. We can run assembly in the browser but there’s still no tooling to help a non-engineer show a bug to an engineer productively.</p><p>So that’s what Jam is. Dev tools + video in a link. It’s like a shareable HAR file synced to a video recording of the session. And besides video, you can use it to share an instant replay of a bug that just happened — basically a 30 second playback of the DOM as a video.</p><p>We’ve spent a lot of time adding in a ton of niceties, like Jam writes automatic repro steps for you, and Jam’s dev tools use the same keyboard shortcuts you’re used to in Chrome dev tools, and our team’s personal favorite: Jam parses GraphQL responses and pulls out mutation names and errors (which is important because GraphQL uses one endpoint for all requests and always returns a 200, meaning you usually have to sift through every GraphQL request when debugging to find the one you’re looking for)</p><p>We’re now 2 years in to the product being live and people have used Jam to fix more than 2 million bugs - which makes me so happy - but there’s still a ton to do. I wanted to open up for discussion here and get your feedback and opinions how can we make it even more valuable for you debugging?</p><p>The worst part of the engineering job is debugging and not even being able to repro the issue, it’s not even really engineering, it’s just a communication gap, one that we should be able to solve with tools. So yeah excited to get your feedback and hear your thoughts how we can make debugging just a little less frustrating.</p><p>(Jam is free to use forever — there is a paid tier for features real companies would need, but we’re keeping a large free plan forever. We learned to build products at Cloudflare and free tier is in our ethos, both my co-founder and I and about half the team is ex-Cloudflare) and what we loved there is how much great feedback we’d get because the product was mostly  free to use. We definitely want to keep that going at Jam.)</p><p>By the way, we’re hiring engineers and if this is a problem that excites you, we’d love to chat: jam.dev/careers</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40317740">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article lang="en-US"><header><details><summary><span role="img" aria-label="Baseline Check"></span><h2>Baseline<!-- --> <span>2024</span></h2><p>Newly available</p><span></span></summary></details></header><p>The <strong>Popover API</strong> provides developers with a standard, consistent, flexible mechanism for displaying popover content on top of other page content. Popover content can be controlled either declaratively using HTML attributes, or via JavaScript.</p><section aria-labelledby="concepts_and_usage"><h2 id="concepts_and_usage"><a href="#concepts_and_usage">Concepts and usage</a></h2><div><p>A very common pattern on the web is to show content over the top of other content, drawing the user's attention to specific important information or actions that need to be taken. This content can take several different names — overlays, popups, popovers, dialogs, etc. We will refer to them as popovers through the documentation. Generally speaking, these can be:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>modal</strong>, meaning that while a popover is being shown, the rest of the page is rendered non-interactive until the popover is actioned in some way (for example an important choice is made).</li>
  <li><strong>non-modal</strong>, meaning that the rest of the page can be interacted with while the popover is being shown.</li>
</ul>
<p>Popovers created using the Popover API are always non-modal. If you want to create a modal popover, a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog"><code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code></a> element is the right way to go. There is significant overlap between the two — you might for example want to create a popover that persists, but control it using declarative HTML. You can turn a <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element into a popover (<code>&lt;dialog popover&gt;</code> is perfectly valid) if you want to combine popover control with dialog semantics.</p>
<p>Typical use cases for the popover API include user-interactive elements like action menus, custom "toast" notifications, form element suggestions, content pickers, or teaching UI.</p>
<p>You can create popovers in two different ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Declaratively, via a set of new HTML attributes. A simple popover with a toggle button can be created using the following code:
    <div><pre data-signature="KdnYlrjDZk+9KBeXtIzbj2uatLAvVEOa7d4apg36UVg="><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>popovertarget</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>mypopover<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Toggle the popover<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>mypopover<span>"</span></span> <span>popover</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Popover content<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre></div>
  </li>
  <li>Via a JavaScript API. For example, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/togglePopover"><code>HTMLElement.togglePopover()</code></a> can be used to toggle a popover between shown and hidden.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also new events to react to a popover being toggled, and CSS features to aid in styling popovers. All the new features are listed below.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API/Using">Using the popover API</a> for a detailed guide to using this API.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="html_attributes"><h2 id="html_attributes"><a href="#html_attributes">HTML attributes</a></h2><div><dl>
  <dt id="popover"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/popover"><code>popover</code></a></dt>
  <dd>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
                
<p><em>This question might be hard because <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4908114/are-the-root-of-a-polynomial-with-the-largest-or-the-smallest-modulus-more-likel">it got <span>$35$</span> upvotes in MSE and also had a <span>$200$</span> points bounty</a> by Jyrki Lahtonen but it was unanswered. So I am posting it in MO.</em></p>
<p>The number of real roots of a random polynomial with real coefficients is much smaller than the number of complex roots. Assume that the coefficients are independently and uniformly random in <span>$(-1,1)$</span> for if not then we can divide each coefficient by the coefficient with the largest absolutely value to scale each coefficient to <span>$(-1,1)$</span>. The number of real roots of a polynomial of degree <span>$n$</span> is asymptotic to <span>$\displaystyle \frac{2\log n}{\pi} + o(1)$</span>. This means that the number of complex roots is approximately <span>$\displaystyle n - \frac{2\log n}{\pi}$</span>. Similar asymptotics hold for <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4128" rel="noreferrer">other distribution of the coefficients</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>**Definition **: <em>The largest (or smallest) root of a polynomial is the root with the largest (or smallest) modulus.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/TpOFTU8J.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/TpOFTU8J.png" alt="Roots scatter plot"></a></p>
<p>The above graph shows the roots one such polynomial with degree <span>$101$</span>. The largest root is in the top right corner in green.</p>
<p>We can ask if the largest (or the smallest) root more likely to be real or complex? Since there are exponentially more complex roots than real roots as seen from the above asymptotic, my naive guess was that the largest (or the smallest) root is more likely to be complex. However experimental data proved to be quite counterintuitive.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/nuuqhaXP.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/nuuqhaXP.png" alt="Probability that the largest root is real"></a></p>
<p>The data shows that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Probability that the largest (or smallest) root is real is greater than the probability that it is complex.</li>
<li>And this probability decreases to some value near <span>$1/2$</span> as <span>$n \to \infty$</span> as shown in the above graph (created using a Monte Carlo simulation with <span>$10^5$</span> trials for each value of <span>$n$</span>).</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: Instead of uniform distribution, if we assume that the coefficients are normally distributed with mean <span>$0$</span> and standard deviation <span>$1$</span> and scaled to <span>$(-1,1)$</span>, the above observation and limiting probabilities hold.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is counterintuitive that despite being much (exponentially) fewer in number, real roots are more likely to contain the both largest and the smallest roots of a random polynomial. <em>In this sense, the largest and the smallest roots are both biased towards reals</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: What is the reason for this bias?</p>
<p><strong>Question 2</strong>: Does the probability that the largest (or the smallest) root of a polynomial of degree <span>$n$</span> is real converge (to some value near <span>$\frac{1}{2}$</span> as <span>$n \to \infty$</span>)?</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We can quantify the observed bias as follows. Let <span>$P(L|R)$</span> be the probability that a root is the largest given that it is real and let <span>$P(L|C)$</span> be the probability that a root is the largest given that it is complex. Similarly, let <span>$P(S|R)$</span> be the probability that a root is the smallest given that it is real and let <span>$P(S|C)$</span> be the probability that a root is the smallest given that it is complex. Then the experimental data says that</p>
<p><span>$$
P(L|R) = P(S|R) \approx \frac{\pi}{4\log n},
$$</span></p>
<p><span>$$
P(L|C) = P(S|C) \approx \frac{\pi}{2n\pi - 4\log n}.
$$</span></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: In the <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4908114/is-the-largest-root-of-a-random-polynomial-more-likely-to-be-real-than-complex">linked MSE post</a>, it has now been proved that the probability that the largest root is real is at least</p>
<p><span>$$
\frac{23-16\sqrt{2}}{6} \approx 6.2 \%

I was sitting at a brewery just around the corner from the rental on North Wood Street in Chicago when the man on the other end of the line said that our planned visit wouldn’t be possible. A previous guest had flushed something down the toilet, which had left the unit flooded with water, he explained. Apologetic, he promised to let us stay in another property he managed until he could call a plumber.</p></span></p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>I had flown with two friends to the city in hopes of a relaxing end-of-summer getaway. We had purchased tickets to attend the September music festival Riot Fest, where Blink-182 and Taking Back Sunday were scheduled to perform. The trip had gotten off to a rough start even before the call. Around a month before, a first Airbnb host had already canceled, leaving us with little time to figure out alternative housing. While scrambling to find something else, I stumbled upon a local Airbnb rental listed by a couple, Becky and Andrew. Sure, the house looked a little basic in the photos online, but it was nice enough, especially considering the time crunch—light-filled, spacious, and close to the Blue Line.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Now, we were facing our second potential disaster in 30 days, and I couldn’t help but feel slightly suspicious of the man on the phone, who had called me from a number with a Los Angeles area code. Hoping to talk in person, I asked him if he was in the area. He said that he was at work and didn’t really have time to chat. Then he added that I needed to decide immediately if I was willing to change my reservation.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>As if he could hear me calculating in my head how much of a hassle it would be to find a hotel instead, he then added something else to his pitch.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“It’s about three times bigger,” the man said. “That’s the good news.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The bad news, which went unstated, was that I had unknowingly stumbled into a nationwide web of deception that appeared to span eight cities and nearly 100 property listings—an undetected scam created by some person or organization that had figured out just how easy it is to exploit Airbnb’s poorly written rules in order to collect thousands of dollars through phony listings, fake reviews, and, when necessary, intimidation. Considering Airbnb’s lax enforcement of its own policies, who could blame the scammers for taking advantage of the new world of short-term rental platforms? They had every reason to believe they could do so with impunity.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p><em>Have you ever worked at Airbnb? Have you ever been scammed by someone exploiting a short-term rental platform? We'd love to hear from you. Send an email to scams@vice.com or reach out to us on Signal at (310) 614-3752.</em></p></span></p><div data-component="ImageBlock"><p>This is how Becky and Andrew advertised the Airbnb I ended up staying in for two nights.</p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>From what I could see on my phone, the photos he sent looked fine enough, and finding myself again in a last-minute pinch, I reluctantly agreed. My one condition was that he <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/1570017743airbnbagreement.png" target="_blank">put in writing what we’d agreed</a> to verbally: that I’d move back into the original listing as soon as possible, or be refunded for half of my trip if the plumbing issue couldn’t be resolved. He agreed, and I accepted a change to my reservation through Airbnb’s messaging app.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>We popped the new address into Uber and took off, but when the driver approached the drop-off location, we noticed something odd: That exact address didn’t exist. After walking up and down North Kenmore Avenue, we were able to find a guest house hidden in a back alley that had a keypad on its front door. Once inside, we discovered what looked more like a flophouse than someone’s home. While, at three levels, it was quite big, almost everything else seemed off. The pantry housed a single bottle of soy sauce. The couch looked nothing like the one in the photos. The bedrooms were filled with a large number of bizarrely arranged beds. The whole place felt grimy, and there was a hole punched in a wall. The only decor was a giant wooden cross and a few pieces of generic Chicago-themed artwork, and the dining room's <a href="https://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Boris-Contemporary-LeatherAdjustable-Barstool-Set-of-4/10036871/product.html?option=15157325&amp;refccid=ZPWGDGCEPDMKKJCDW6XCSJRAZ4&amp;searchidx=176&amp;kwds=&amp;rfmt=product%20features%3ASwivel%7Cstyle%3AModern%20%26amp%3B%20Contemporary" target="_blank">Overstock.com barstools</a> looked as if they would turn into dust if you sat on them.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>By then, it was already late in the afternoon. With the first day of my vacation basically gone, I decided to let the whole thing slide. But the next day, we got a text from the man, who said that the plumbing in the original rental hadn’t been fixed, but that new tenants were moving into our flophouse the next day. Not quite sure what to do, we booked a hotel and decided to deal with getting a refund later.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The last time I heard from Becky and Andrew, they sent me <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/09/157063343310_AM.png" target="_blank">a strange message on Airbnb</a> asking that I give them no less than a five-star review⁠—since Airbnb had “changed its algorithm”⁠—and that I communicate all concerns privately.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“I respectfully request that you let me know about any challenges you faced with my property directly on this message thread rather than write a 4 star review [sic],” they wrote.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>When I asked about the status of my refund, they ghosted, which led me to contact Airbnb. Though I had been moved to a flophouse and then told to leave early, Becky and Andrew only refunded me $399 of my $1,221.20, and only did so after I badgered a number of Airbnb case managers over the course of several days. The $399 didn’t even include the service fees Airbnb charged me for the pleasure of being thrown out on the street. But my power was nothing compared to that of a company valued this year at <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/19/18272274/airbnb-valuation-common-stock-hoteltonight" target="_blank">$35 billion</a>, and I figured it was probably the best I could do.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>I was thankful I’d gotten the last-minute agreement in writing, but I also started to wonder what had actually happened in Chicago. Unable to shake the sense that this was more than a run-of-the-mill bad host, I started to look for red flags I must have missed. It didn’t take long to find a few. For one, the phone number that the Airbnb host had called me with was a Google number that couldn’t be traced. Through a reverse image search, I also realized that the profile picture Becky and Andrew had used on Airbnb was a <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/28/157227664200_PM.png" target="_blank">stock photo from a website that hosts surfing-themed desktop wallpapers</a>. And when I started going through other people’s reviews of Becky and Andrew’s properties, I noticed some other renters had reported experiences that strangely mirrored my own. A woman said she was forced to switch up her itinerary three minutes before check-in due to alleged plumbing issues. A man said that he was promised a refund because his rental was “falling apart,” though it never materialized.</p></span></p><div data-component="ImageBlock"><p>The photo for Becky and Andrew's account popped up elsewhere on the internet after a reverse image search.</p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Even some of the positive reviews of Becky and Andrew’s Chicago rentals seemed odd, especially those left by other pairs of hosts. Kelsey and Jean, for example, said Becky and Andrew were “awesome and communicative guests.” But they <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/29/157238569135_PM.png" target="_blank">themselves were based in Chicago</a>, where it seemed they had at least two properties of their own. Why would they need to rent from someone else there? Even stranger, Kelsey and Jean’s <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/157004632144_PM.png" target="_blank">photo</a> also had been <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/157004630945_PM.png" target="_blank">cribbed from a travel site</a>, and the language they used to describe their home (“Westloop 6 Bed Getaway - Walk the City”) seemed similar to that of Becky and Andrew’s (“6 Bed Downtown / Wicker Park / Walk the City”). It wasn’t long before I found what looked an awful lot like the <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569966599beckyandandrew.png" target="_blank">apartment I’d originally booked</a> with Becky and Andrew—the one on North Wood Street—<a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569966640kelseyandjean.png" target="_blank">listed by Kelsey and Jean</a> as well. There was no mistaking it: The couch, coffee table, dining room set, and wall art were all the same.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>I started to wonder whether “Becky and Andrew” and “Kelsey and Jean” existed at all.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>I also wanted to figure out if Becky and Andrew and <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569966640kelseyandjean.png" target="_blank">Kelsey and Jean</a> had the same unit as <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569966656alexandbrittany.png" target="_blank">three</a> <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569966676rachelandpete.png" target="_blank">other</a> <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569966619krisandbecky.png" target="_blank">couples</a>, or if they just had the same detailing around the windows and a bunch of the same furniture pieces in different arrangements. Kris and Becky’s unit looked identical, save for a coffee table that was rectangular instead of round. Alex and Brittany had an additional armchair in their living room. Rachel and Pete’s place showed the most variation, but was still eerily similar to the rest of the bunch. When I finally plugged the original address of the place that I’d booked from Becky and Andrew into Google Street View, I felt like I was losing my mind. Becky and Andrew’s photos had no floor-to-ceiling windows, but the building on Street View at the same address clearly did.</p></span></p><div data-component="ImageBlock"><p>The listings from these different accounts are all similar but shot at different angles.</p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>It seemed as if one person or group might have created numerous phony accounts to run a much larger Airbnb operation. If that proved true, it meant whoever ran the five accounts I’d located was controlling at least 94 properties in eight different cities. How many other people who had been scammed out of money like me? Feeling as if I was entering a Pynchonian nightmare, I <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/1570018017metoairbnb.png" target="_blank">sent a message to Airbnb</a> alerting them to what increasingly seemed like an elaborate scam.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But Airbnb, which <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/09/19/airbnb-initial-public-offering-2020/" target="_blank">plans to go public next year</a>, seemed to have little interest in rooting out the rot from within its own platform. When I didn’t hear back from the company after a few days, and saw that the suspicious accounts were still active, I took it upon myself to figure out who exactly had ruined my vacation.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>I wanted to know who owned the building we ended up staying in, but I couldn’t find much on the county property assessor’s website except that the LLC that owned the house had an association with lawyers in Chicago and New York. Figuring that I needed to find the addresses of some of the other properties in order to discern who owned them, I decided to track down other people who had left negative reviews of Becky and Andrew.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The first person I reached out to was Jane Patterson, of Holland, Michigan. She called me back almost immediately, saying that she had gotten scammed by Becky and Andrew earlier this year and had been unable to stop thinking about it since.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>She hadn’t had much Airbnb experience when she and her daughter decided to book a place in Marina del Rey, California, this past spring, she said. But as a criminal defense attorney, she figured she had a pretty good barometer for bullshit.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Just before check-in, Patterson had gotten a call that was almost exactly the same as the one I had received. The man on the other end of the line said that the property’s bathroom wasn’t working, but that he was able to put them up in a much bigger place until a plumber could fix the problem. It was inconvenient, but also an invitation to stay at what sounded like a mansion in one of the most exclusive areas of the country.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“We were like, ‘Shit, it’s in Malibu, what the heck?’” Patterson recalled. “We looked at the pictures and thought it was a great deal for us.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>When they arrived, they realized it wasn’t. The front door had been left unlocked, which Patterson described as “creepy,” and it was dirty and filled with furniture that looked like it had been picked up off the street. The <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569973838IMG_8351.jpg" target="_blank">couches were tattered</a>, the armchairs were <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/156997466616_PM.png" target="_blank">burned by cigarettes</a>, and the <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/01/1569973819IMG_8352.jpg" target="_blank">tables were banged-up</a>—details I confirmed through photos she’d taken at the time.</p></span></p><div data-component="ImageBlock"><p>Jane Patterson refused to stay in Becky and Andrew's supposed upgrade after determining it was run down and dirty.</p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Patterson said she left a message at the contact number she’d been given for Becky and Andrew to say that she wouldn’t stay in such a place. Though the person who answered the phone said they’d get back to her about the issues she described, they never did. After retreating to the house of a friend who happened to live nearby, she began the process of requesting a refund for the trip “pretty much right away”—one she believed her profession undoubtedly gave her a huge leg up on obtaining.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Airbnb’s refund policy is based on a <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/home/cancellation_policies" target="_blank">complicated rubric</a> that doesn’t say guests need written evidence in order to obtain a full refund but does note the company has “final say in all disputes.” It’s easy enough to see how a scammer might exploit the policies as laid out. If a guest stays even one night in a rental, for example, it is difficult to obtain a full refund, according to Airbnb’s rules. If a host asks a guest to stay at a property that’s different from the one they rented, Airbnb <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/250/what-if-a-host-informs-me-that-the-listing-i-already-paid-for-is-now-unavailable-but-they-have-an-alternative" target="_blank">advises</a> the guest to request a cancellation if they’re “not okay with the switch.” In both cases, the rules favor a would-be scammer and place the onus on guests who have just parachuted into an unfamiliar locale with their luggage and have nowhere else to stay that night.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>After Airbnb looked over Patterson’s pictures, a company representative told her that Becky and Andrew had a right to respond to the complaint, she told me. A few days later, Airbnb offered her a partial refund. Many people might have reluctantly walked away with whatever money they got back to avoid a prolonged battle. After all, Airbnb uses a rating system in which both the host and tenant can publicly provide feedback to one another, which both parties then use to prove their credibility in the future. Because of that, there is a built-in incentive to avoid confrontation, which helps explain <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2554500" target="_blank">why Airbnb hosts consistently receive higher ratings than hotels reviewed on TripAdvisor</a>, according to research out of Boston University and the University of Southern California. If a customer has a negative experience on Airbnb, they might be better off just moving on instead of leaving a negative review. Choose the latter option, and you could come across as too demanding to other prospective hosts, or, in extreme cases, even receive a retaliatory review.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But Patterson didn’t care about that. She knew she had been scammed and wasn’t going to stand down until she received every penny back.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“I’m an attorney, so I love to argue,” she said. “I just didn’t stop calling.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>She eventually got her full refund, but it indeed came with a harsh review from Becky and Andrew for doing so. “We would NOT host or recommend her to the airbnb community!!” they wrote. Patterson couldn’t help but wonder how people with fewer resources and no place to crash would have fared in the same situation.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“You think about these people who maybe saved up for six months to go to Marina del Rey for five days and have nowhere to stay,” Patterson said. “I can see how they can get some people who are trapped into staying in a shitty place.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>That’s what happened to Juan David Garrido, a college student from St. Paul, Minnesota, who rented a place from Kris and Becky in Milwaukee this past Fourth of July weekend.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Garrido had traveled to the city to attend a musical festival with friends, only to have the hosts cancel on him at the last minute. But Kris seemed eager to help him out, saying he had a place that was still available for rent and could easily fit seven guests. Finding himself in a pinch, Garrido remembered feeling immensely grateful and quickly booking the new spot⁠—so quickly, in fact, that he didn’t quite absorb the cost. Because of Garrido’s large party, Kris and Becky had charged him almost $1,800 for three nights—roughly half of what he made in a full semester’s work study.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Garrido cancelled the reservation, but didn’t read the fine print before doing so, triggering a $950 cancellation fee. He called up Kris and said that he’d stay there after all if he’d waive the fee. Kris verbally agreed, he told me.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>It wasn’t long after Garrido arrived that he realized he was probably never going to get his cancellation fee refunded and that Kris wasn’t as helpful as he’d first seemed. “No one lived there,” he told me over the phone. “It was just beds.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Garrido tried to get his money back through Airbnb customer support for more than a week (he let me review the chain of correspondence). Because of his poor experience, an Airbnb customer representative refunded Garrido approximately $700 of the $1800 he spent on Kris and Becky’s listing, but explained the couple had the right to keep the cancellation fee since Garrido had not received the agreement to waive the fee in writing.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Maria LaSota, 29, wasn’t even that lucky.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>During a trip to Milwaukee from Chicago to celebrate her mom’s 60th birthday last July, she also rented a unit from Kris and Becky. She recounted over the phone how a man claiming to be Kris called her up just before check-in and said that he had accidentally double-booked. He needed to move her party to a bigger unit he managed on the same street. LaSota didn’t really feel she had much of a choice. It was a busy weekend in the city, what with the Chicago Cubs playing the Milwaukee Brewers and annual Summerfest musical festival taking place.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Like the other properties, LaSota’s rental was a mess—covered in sawdust and without the amenities needed to even open and drink a bottle of wine they’d brought to celebrate the occasion. “You could tell the apartment was just staged for pictures,” she said. The king-sized bed only came with throw pillows and a fitted sheet. The gas stove wasn’t hooked up. There was no air-conditioning, and they couldn’t open the windows because there were no screens. There were also no curtains, which meant anyone who walked past could see straight inside. But they didn’t have anywhere else to go, so they stayed anyway.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>While there, she met a few men at the bar down the street from the rental who mentioned that they were also staying at an Airbnb in the same building. “It turned out the same thing had happened to them,” LaSota said. “They were originally supposed to have the unit we were staying in, and there was still a construction crew there, so they were moved to a place upstairs that was smaller and didn’t fit all the guys.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“They got the call 10 minutes before they arrived,” she added.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The following week, LaSota received a call thanking her for being such a good guest. The man on the other end of the line said his name was Kris, but it was clearly not the same person she’d spoken to previously, LaSota said. After LaSota started mentioning the problems with the unit, the man said he was confused and needed to call his wife.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“I said, ‘Your wife or the other guy’s wife?’” LaSota said. “‘The guy who called me last week told me his name was Kris, too, and your tone of voice and accent are completely different.’”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The man hung up on her, and she never heard from him again. Soon after, however, “Kris and Becky” left a review complaining that she’d left beer bottles all over the house and even harassed people. (“They tried to say I threw a wild party,” LaSota said. “I was with four 60-year-old women.”) Distressed, she <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/1570020084IMG_6893.jpeg" target="_blank">tried to report the couple to Airbnb</a> through its customer support system. The case manager told her over the phone on the first day in August that she would hear something from the company within eight weeks; she’s still heard nothing.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>LaSota’s story tracked with what I’d seen online. When people had written bad reviews of “Becky and Andrew” in the past, the hosts would turn around and claim that the renters themselves were scammers or inexperienced travelers.</p></span></p><div data-component="ImageBlock"><p>When people complain about Becky and Andrew's properties, the hosts insult them.</p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But there was another thing about LaSota’s story that caught my attention. The fact that the Airbnb host was able to shuffle both LaSota’s family and the men at the bar around the same building made me wonder whether the hosts owned the property in its entirety, which would increase the likelihood of the schemer’s name appearing in the public record. When I looked up the address on the property appraiser’s website, I got the name of yet another LLC, which I plugged into the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions’ website. Such sites are where you find the name of the registered agent, or the person who handles legal documents for the company. Usually, you’ll get the name of a lawyer who’s under no obligation to reveal information about their clients to a reporter over the phone.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But in this case, the profile I was looking at didn’t belong to a lawyer. It belonged to someone named Shray Goel.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>When I looked up Goel on LinkedIn, I found that he was based in Los Angeles, and described himself as <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/04/157020382940_AM.png" target="_blank">the director of an “upscale corporate rental company” named Abbot Pacific LLC</a>. Another man named Shaun Raheja ran the business alongside him, according to Raheja’s own <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/04/157020387224_AM.png" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> page. Goel’s YouTube page features videos of him <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/08/157054987412_AM.png" target="_blank">touring run-down properties</a>, including one at the same address Garrido and LaSota told me that they stayed at in Milwaukee. On his Instagram page, <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/28/157227842037_PM.png" target="_blank">he listed himself</a> as a “long distance real estate investor” who works in “LA, Chicago, Nashville, Austin, Dallas, Milwaukee, Indiana, and Orlando.” Those eight cities overlap with properties tied to “Becky and Andrew” and the other accounts. For his part, Raheja’s public Instagram features <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/157001909339_PM.png" target="_blank">pictures</a> of the <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/02/156997701623_PM.png" target="_blank">properties</a> <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/03/157011516137_AM.png" target="_blank">advertised by</a> Kelsey and Jean on Airbnb. (Raheja didn’t respond to calls, emails, or direct messages over Twitter seeking comment.)</p></span></p><div data-component="ImageBlock"><p>A YouTube user named Shray Goel has uploaded a video tour of the property two of Kris and Becky's customers stayed at.</p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>When I looked back through old reviews of the couples, I noticed something else that I hadn’t before. Back in 2012, a man had left a review on Kelsey and Jean’s page that had referred to them not as “Kelsey and Jean,” but as a single person: <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/29/157238594108_PM.png" target="_blank">“Shray."</a></p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Shray is a delight to host,” the man wrote in the 2012 review. “And I would welcome him.back [sic] anytime! He is neat and tidy and very independent.”</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>This was it. I was convinced I had found the scammer.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>I desperately wanted to know Goel’s side of the story, and repeatedly tried to reach him on his cell phone, to no avail. So I decided to call Abbot Pacific, the company he ran, according to LinkedIn. The company’s website only listed a Google number, which I called repeatedly on a Wednesday in October before leaving a voicemail explaining that I needed to speak with Goel. The next day, I emailed Goel on his personal Gmail. Less than two hours later, someone finally got back to me, but the man on the other end of the line said he wasn’t who I was looking for. He claimed his name was “Patrick.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“I just handle incoming phone calls” for Abbot Pacific, the man said.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Patrick told me that Goel had been bought out of the company nine months ago. Then the man started to pepper me with questions about this piece. “I Googled you very briefly, and it seems like you write generally negative things, so I’m just trying to figure out how I can help,” he said. The man asked me about my motivations, and for the names of the people I’d spoken to. I told him that I’d rather talk to Goel, and he said that he would work on getting me in touch with him, which he never did.</p></span></p><div data-component="ImageBlock"><p>Abbot Pacific's website was taken offline moments after I spoke with a man who said he answered phones for the company.</p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Approximately 30 minutes after the call, I tried to go back on Abbot Pacific’s website. But I couldn’t. It had disappeared, replaced only five words in all caps: “THIS WEBSITE IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE.” I called “Patrick” back to ask what happened. “I think it went down yesterday,” he said. “We’re adding some new stuff to it. New properties and stuff like that.”</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>When I told him that I had just been on the site moments before our initial conversation and found it strange that the website went down right after, he agreed that it was “weird.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>I asked Patrick what he used to do before becoming a secretary for Abbot Pacific, and he said that he was in property management. I asked if he had a LinkedIn, and he said that he did, though he declined to tell me his last name. (I could not find a “Patrick” who works at Abbot Pacific on LinkedIn.) I also offered to email him links to the Airbnb accounts I was referring to, but he never gave me an email address, saying that he had a pad and pen to take them down, which would presumably be a first in human history. I described the interviews I’d done so far.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Then I added something else.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Oh, and I should say that this also happened to me,” I said.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Several seconds of silence passed before Patrick responded.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“This makes a lot more sense now,” he said.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Patrick said that Abbot Pacific did have properties on the street that Garrido and LaSota stayed on, though he noted that he wasn’t much involved with the Airbnb side of the business and that it was “ramping down.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Let me make a few calls and figure out where this disconnect happened,” he said.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>After hanging up, I messaged Kris and Becky’s account and asked for Goel to call me because I was writing an article. It was around 3 p.m. in New York.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Hi Allie—Think you might be mistaken,” they wrote back four hours later. “Are you looking to book the home?”</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Six hours after that, the prices for <a href="https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2019/10/04/1570204205image__16_.png" target="_blank">several of Kris and Becky’s properties</a> rose to $10,000 a night—far too high to be seen by anyone searching for a short-term rental on a reasonable budget.</p></span></p><div><p><img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1572380788885-4.png" width="636" height="543" alt="1572380788885-4"></p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Weeks later, Abbot Pacific’s website remains down. The man who called himself Patrick never called me back with more information about the “disconnect,” or put me in touch with Goel, as he said he would. I again emailed and called Goel myself. I texted him as well as messaged him on Facebook, and on the real estate investment forum BiggerPockets, but never got a response. It nevertheless appears he knew I wanted to talk to him. The day after I spoke with Patrick, Goel’s LinkedIn page had been completely scrubbed of any mention of Abbot Pacific.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>As it turned out, I had accidentally stumbled upon a larger, more metastasized version of what researchers at a Los Angeles-based advocacy organization uncovered themselves while researching Airbnb in the middle of the decade. In 2015, the <a href="https://www.laane.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AirBnB-Final.pdf" target="_blank">Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy released a report</a> that said large rental companies in Los Angeles had started to profit off Airbnb by creating pseudonyms that helped them appear to be normal homeowners. The most prolific host that LAANE identified in LA was “ghc,” or Globe Homes and Condos, a <a href="http://globehomes.com/" target="_blank">now-defunct company</a> that at one time ran an Airbnb profile using the pseudonyms “Danielle and Lexi.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Airbnb’s Community Standards state that no host should “<a href="https://www.finder.com/how-to-become-an-airbnb-host" target="_blank">provide inaccurate information</a>,” but Airbnb does not rigorously police the request, according to the report. “In spite of the fact that Danielle and Lexi received a verified ID, badge on their profile page, we have no way of knowing if they had any role in the properties other than having their photo taken,” the report stated. “This case also undermines one of the cornerstones of AirBnB’s business model, namely that the company’s ratings and identity verification system are a viable means by which travelers can vet their prospective hosts.”</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>James Elmendorf, a senior policy analyst at LAANE, told me that Airbnb’s weak verification process created the opportunity for those who were willing to exploit the platform through the creation of “faux, just-like-you personas.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Airbnb does no checking up on this whatsoever,” said Elmendorf. “They’re one of the most sophisticated companies in the world, and you’re telling me they can’t come up with a system that prevents this? Airbnb is doing that hand-wavy thing that tech companies do where they say, ‘We can’t solve this.' If they wanted to solve it, they would figure it out.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The problem extends beyond my own scammer and beyond Los Angeles. The Better Business Bureau has received around 200 complaints about Airbnb through its “Scam Tracker” in the past three years, and about half of those were regarding fake profiles, spokesperson Katherine Hutt told me. The use of fake profiles does not necessarily translate into a bad customer experience. Many people don’t care whose home they’re staying in—they just want something cheaper than a hotel. But by allowing hosts to easily operate under fake identities, Airbnb has set up a system that allows scammers like mine to thrive.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Feeling I had all the evidence I needed to prove my point to Airbnb, I emailed the company’s press team a long note, asking them, among other things, how they make sure that people are accurately representing themselves on their profiles and how case managers are directed to deal with allegations of fraud.</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>A little more than 24 hours later, a company flak responded in an emailed statement.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Engaging in deceptive behavior such as substituting one listing for another is a violation of our Community Standards,” the flak wrote. “We are suspending the listings while we investigate further.”</p></span></p><div data-component="ImageBlock"><p>Shray Goel removed Abbot Pacific from his LinkedIn page after I spoke with "Patrick" on the phone.</p></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>That was it. No one at the company ever agreed to speak on the record about the specifics of what I uncovered. Nor would anyone answer any of my questions about Airbnb's verification process. As far as what obligation it has to people who have fallen victim to a scam on Airbnb's platform, the company only said in an email that it is "here 24/7 to support with rebooking assistance, full refunds and reimbursements" in cases of fraud or misrepresentation by hosts. Maybe Airbnb couldn't get more detailed about its verification process because it doesn't have much of one at all. I had asked the company about three accounts—Annie and Chase, Becky and Andrew, and Kris and Becky. Annie and Chase’s account has been deleted, and the two others no longer have any listings posted, which, due to Airbnb’s messaging constraints, means I could not message them for comment. Of the six other accounts I'd connected to the scheme, five are still active weeks later. Only Kelsey and Jean’s has disappeared from the site.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Even if my scammers had been slightly foiled, there was no guarantee that they couldn’t just start fresh with new profiles. The system was still in place. Airbnb has created a web of <a href="https://press.airbnb.com/fast-facts/" target="_blank">more than 7 million listings</a> built largely on trust, easily exploitable by those willing to do so. Maybe it’s not so surprising that the company would rather play a half-assed game of whack-a-mole than answer basic questions about its verification process. For every person who doesn’t receive a complete refund, Airbnb makes money.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Kellen Zale, a professor at the University of Houston who studies property law and short-term rentals, told me there’s no politician at the state or federal level who’s made all that much noise about Airbnb. Instead, the onus falls on local governments—some of which are too cash-strapped to put up much of a fight.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In 2015, Airbnb <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/airbnb-san-francisco-proposition-f_n_56366676e4b0c66bae5cc3b6" target="_blank">spent at least $8 million on lobbying efforts</a> to fight back <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/19/airbnb-san-francisco-listings-cut-in-half/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAB6DudPNMHzGwwcPT9c9ZhhlKoDIEXphptSp84fxFFgD1y25f4e3eVlgR8LNeJrmKMlLw-OcxciS5ccKjp5IS9MZYADJ2bDf5GsF-REj8jTC9J1eN3Yq6EEYijLL0Ihbu-lVELw5uSoyp1PrmyElaASx1I3LqpXXJtuNljLHS1ZD" target="_blank">an ordinance in San Francisco</a> that required all Airbnb hosts to register their units with the city in a lengthy process. The ordinance passed anyway, severely reducing the number of properties available. But not all cities have San Francisco’s budgetary resources. When New Orleans <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/article_c390da62-ba00-11e9-b876-237e289ed3ef.html" target="_blank">overhauled their short-term rental laws in August</a>, for example, the budget-strapped city mostly left oversight of the new rules in the hands of Airbnb.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>For now, the rest of us are left to deal with the fallout. Zale herself had a less-than-stellar experience with Airbnb a few years back. Her host gave her the wrong code to unlock the door to a property she’d rented in Texas, and she had to book an expensive hotel at the last minute. She said that despite being angry that Airbnb didn’t refund the cost of the hotel, she has stuck with the platform. She likes the “appeal of living in a neighborhood for a couple of nights,” she said.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The other people I spoke to are dealing with the same cognitive dissonance. They know that they’re rolling the dice with short-term rental startups, but feel they have no other choice. For her part, Patterson said she might switch to Vrbo, but LaSota is still trying to get a retaliatory review she received taken down ahead of an Italian vacation. Garrido said he anticipates a lifetime of fealty to Airbnb, too.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“If I had another choice, I would not use Airbnb again,” he told me. “I was very put off by getting scammed. But at this point, I feel like if I want to travel, there’s not really much else I can do.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Even after a month of digging through public records, scouring the internet for clues, repeatedly calling Airbnb and confronting the man who called himself Patrick, I can’t say I’ll be leaving the platform, either. Dealing with Airbnb’s easily exploitable and occasionally crazy-making system is still just a bit cheaper than renting a hotel.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In fact, after all that, I never even left Becky and Andrew a review.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p><strong>Update 11/1/19:</strong> The morning after this article was published, the FBI contacted VICE about the claims made above.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p><strong>Correction 11/21/19:</strong> A previous version of this article stated that Airbnb refunded $399. That sentence has been corrected to reflect that the $399 was refunded by "Becky and Andrew" after Airbnb intervened.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/page/sign-up-for-the-vice-newsletter" target="_blank"><em>Sign up for our newsletter</em></a> <em>to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.</em></p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p><em>Follow Allie Conti on <a href="https://twitter.com/allie_conti" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</em></p></span></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We explore how interaction with large language models (LLMs) can give rise to emergent behaviors, empowering players to participate in the evolution of game narratives. Our testbed is a text-adventure game in which players attempt to solve a mystery under a fixed narrative premise, but can freely interact with non-player characters generated by GPT-4, a large language model. We recruit 28 gamers to play the game and use GPT-4 to automatically convert the game logs into a node-graph representing the narrative in the player's gameplay. We find that through their interactions with the non-deterministic behavior of the LLM, players are able to discover interesting new emergent nodes that were not a part of the original narrative but have potential for being fun and engaging. Players that created the most emergent nodes tended to be those that often enjoy games that facilitate discovery, exploration and experimentation.

Despite the fact that the Linux Kernel is mostly written in C, it
makes broad use of some techniques from the field of object-oriented
programming.
Developers wanting to use these object-oriented techniques receive
little support or guidance from the language and so are left to fend
for themselves.  As is often the case, this is a double-edged sword.
The developer has enough flexibility to do really cool things, and
equally the flexibility to do really stupid things, and it isn't
always clear at first glance which is which, or more accurately: where
on the spectrum a particular approach sits.
</p><p>
Instead of looking to the language to provide guidance, a software
engineer must look to established practice to find out what works well
and what is best avoided.  Interpreting established practice is not
always as easy as one might like and the effort, once made, is worth
preserving.
To preserve that effort on your author's part, this article brings
another installment in an
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/336224/">occasional series</a> on Linux Kernel Design
Patterns and attempts to set out - with examples - the design patterns
in the Linux Kernel which effect an object-oriented style of
programming.
</p><p>
Rather than providing a brief introduction to the object-oriented
style, tempting though that is, we will assume the reader has a basic
knowledge of objects, classes, methods, inheritance, and similar
terms.  For those as yet unfamiliar with these, there are plenty of
resources to be found elsewhere on the web.
</p><p>
Over two weeks we will look for patterns in just two areas:  method
dispatch and data inheritance.  Despite their apparent
simplicity they lead to some rich veins for investigation.
This first article will focus on method dispatch.
</p>
<h3>Method Dispatch</h3>
<p>
The large variety of styles of inheritance and rules for its usage in
languages today seems to suggest that there is no uniform
understanding of what "object-oriented" really means.  The term is a bit like
"love": everyone thinks they know what it means but when you get down
to details people can find they have very different ideas.

While what it means to be "oriented" might not be clear, what we mean
by an "object" does seem to be uniformly agreed upon.  It is simply an
abstraction comprising both state and behavior.  An object is like a
record (Pascal) or struct (C), except that some of the names of members
refer to functions which act on the other fields in the object.
These function members are sometimes referred to a "methods".
</p><p>
The most obvious way to implement objects in C is to declare a
"struct" where some fields are pointers to functions which take a
pointer to the struct itself as their first argument.  The calling
convention for method "foo" in object "bar" would simply be:
<tt>bar-&gt;foo(bar, ...args);</tt>

While this pattern is used in the Linux kernel it is not the dominant
pattern so we will leave discussion of it until a little later.
</p><p>
As methods (unlike state) are not normally changed on a per-object
basis, a more common and only slightly less obvious approach is to
collect all the methods for a particular class of objects into a
separate structure, sometimes known as a "virtual function table" or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">vtable</a>.

The object then has a single pointer to this table rather than a
separate pointer for each method, and consequently uses less memory.
</p><p>
This then leads to our first pattern - a <b>pure vtable</b> being a
structure which contains only function pointers where the first argument of
each is a pointer to some other structure (the object type) which itself
contains a pointer to this vtable.

Some simple examples of this in the Linux kernel are the
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/fs.h#L1062"><tt>file_lock_operations</tt></a>
structure which contains two function pointers
each of which take a pointer to a <tt>struct file_lock</tt>, and the
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/seq_file.h#L29"><tt>seq_operations</tt></a> vtable which contains four function pointers
which each operate on a <tt>struct seq_file</tt>.

These two examples display an obvious naming pattern - the structure
holding a vtable is named for the structure holding the object
(possibly abbreviated) followed by "_operations".  While this pattern is
common it is by no means universal.   Around the time of 2.6.39
there are approximately 30 "*_operations" structures along with well over
100 "*_ops" structures, most if not all of which are vtables of some
sort. There are also several structs such as <tt>struct mdk_personality</tt>
which are essentially vtables but do not have particularly helpful
names.
</p><p>
Among these nearly 200 vtable structures there is plenty of variability
and so plenty of scope to look for interesting patterns.  In
particular we can look for common variations from the "pure vtable"
pattern described above and determine how these variations contribute
to our understanding of object use in Linux.
</p>
<h4>NULL function pointers</h4>
<p>
The first observation is that some function pointers in some vtables
are allowed to be NULL.  Clearly trying to call such a function would
be futile, so the code that calls into these methods generally
contains an explicit test for the pointer being NULL.  There are a few
different reasons for these NULL pointers.

Probably easiest to justify is the incremental development
reason.  Because of the way vtable structures are initialized, adding
a new function pointer to the structure definition causes all existing
table declarations to initialise that pointer to NULL.  Thus it is
possible to add a caller of the new method before any instance
supports that method, and have it check for NULL and perform a default
behavior.   Then as incremental development continues those vtable
instances which need it can get non-default methods.
</p><p>
A recent example is commit
<a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=77af1b2641faf4">77af1b2641faf4</a> adding
<tt>set_voltage_time_sel()</tt> to <tt>struct regulator_ops</tt> which acts on
<tt>struct regulator_dev</tt>.  Subsequent commit
<a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=42ab616afe8844">42ab616afe8844</a>
defines that method
for a particular device.  This is simply the most recent example of a
very common theme.
</p><p>
Another common reason is that certain methods are not particularly
meaningful in certain cases so the calling code simply tests for NULL
and returns an appropriate error when found.  There are multiple
examples of this in the virtual filesystem (VFS) layer.  For instance,
the <tt>create()</tt> function in
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/fs.h#L1569"><tt>inode_operations</tt></a>
is only meaningful if the inode in question is a
directory.  So <tt>inode_operations</tt> structures for non-directories
typically have NULL for the <tt>create()</tt> function (and many others) and
the calling code in <tt>vfs_create()</tt> checks for NULL and returns <tt>-EACCES</tt>.
</p><p>
A final reason that vtables sometimes contain NULL is that an element
of functionality might be being transitioned from one interface to
another.  A good example of this is the <tt>ioctl()</tt> operation in
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/fs.h#L1537"><tt>file_operations</tt></a>.
In 2.6.11, a new method, <tt>unlocked_ioctl()</tt> was added
which was called without the big kernel lock held.  In 2.6.36, when all
drivers and filesystems had been converted to use <tt>unlocked_ioctl()</tt>,
the original <tt>ioctl()</tt> was finally removed.  During this transition a file system
would typically define only one of two, leaving the other defaulting to NULL.
</p><p>
A slightly more subtle example of this is <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>aio_read()</tt>, also in
<tt>file_operations</tt>, and the corresponding <tt>write()</tt> and <tt>aio_write()</tt>.
<tt>aio_read()</tt> was introduced to support asynchronous IO, and if it is
provided the regular synchronous <tt>read()</tt> is not needed (it is effected
using <tt>do_sync_read()</tt> which calls the <tt>aio_read()</tt> method).  In this case
there appears to be no intention of ever removing <tt>read()</tt> - it will
remain for cases where async IO is not relevant such as special
filesystems like procfs and sysfs.  So it is still the case that only one of each
pair need be defined by a filesystem, but it is not simply a transition, it is
a long-term state.
</p><p>
Though there seem to be several different reasons for a NULL function pointer,
almost every case is an example of one simple pattern - that of providing a
default implementation for the method.  In the "incremental development"
examples and the non-meaningful method case, this is fairly straightforward.
e.g. the default for <tt>inode-&gt;create()</tt> is simply to return an error.
In the interface transition case it is only slightly less obvious.  The default for
<tt>unlocked_ioctl()</tt> would be to take the kernel lock and then call
the <tt>ioctl()</tt> method.  The
default for <tt>read()</tt> is exactly <tt>do_sync_read()</tt> and some filesystems such
as <tt><a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/fs/ext3/file.c#L55">ext3</a></tt>
actually provide this value explicitly rather than using
"NULL" to indicate a default.
</p><p>
With that in mind, a little reflection suggests that if the real goal is to
provide a default, then maybe the best approach would be to explicitly give a
default rather than using the circuitous route of using a default of NULL and
interpreting it specially.
</p><p>
While NULL is certainly the easiest value to provide as a default - as the C
standard assures us that uninitialized members of a structure do get set to
NULL - it is not very much harder to set a more meaningful default.
I am indebted to LWN reader
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/437878/">wahern</a> for the observation that
C99 allows fields in a structure to be initialized multiple times with only the
final value taking effect and that this allows easy setting of default values
such as by following the simple model:
</p>
<pre>    #define FOO_DEFAULTS  .bar = default_bar, .baz = default_baz
    struct foo_operations my_foo = { FOO_DEFAULTS,
	.bar = my_bar,
    };
</pre><p>
This will declare <tt>my_foo</tt> with a predefined default value for <tt>baz</tt> and a
localized value for <tt>bar</tt>.  Thus for the small cost of defining a few "default"
functions and including a "<tt>_DEFAULTS</tt>" entry to each declaration, the
default value for any field can easily be chosen when the field is first
created, and automatically included in every use of the structure.
</p><p>
Not only are meaningful defaults easy to implement, they can lead to a more
efficient implementation.  In those cases where the function pointer actually
is NULL it is probably faster to test and branch rather than to make an
indirect function call.  However the NULL case is very often
the exception rather than the rule, and optimizing for an
exception is not normal practice.  In the more common case when
the function pointer is not NULL, the test for NULL is simply a
waste of code space and a waste of execution time.  If we
disallow NULLs we can make all call sites a little bit smaller and simpler.
</p><p>
In general, any testing performed by the caller before calling a method
can be seen as an instance of the "mid-layer mistake" discussed
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/336262/">in a previous article</a>.  It shows that the
mid-layer is making 
assumptions about the behavior of the lower level driver rather than simply
giving the driver freedom to behave in whatever way is most
suitable.  This may not always be an expensive mistake, but it
is still best avoided where possible.

Nevertheless there is a clear pattern in the Linux kernel that
pointers in vtables can sometimes be NULLable, typically though not
always to enable a transition, and the call sites should in these
cases test for NULL before proceeding with the call.
</p><p>
The observant reader will have noticed a hole in the above logic
denouncing the use NULL pointers for defaults.  In the case where the
default is the common case and where performance is paramount, the
reasoning does not hold and a NULL pointer could well be justified.
Naturally the Linux kernel provides an example of such a case for our
examination.
</p><p>
One of the data structures used by the VFS for caching filesystem
information is the "dentry".  A "dentry" represents a name in the
filesystem, and so each "dentry" has a parent, being the directory
containing it, and an "inode" representing the named file.  The dentry
is separate from the inode because a single file can have multiple
names (so an "inode" can have multiple "dentry"s).

There is a <tt>dentry_operations</tt> vtable with a number of operations including,
for example, "d_compare" which will compare two names and "d_hash"
which will generate a hash for the name to guide the storage of the
"dentry" in a hash table.  Most filesystems do not need this flexibility.  They
treat names as uninterpreted strings of bytes so the default compare and hash
functions are the common case.  A few filesystems define these to
handle case-insensitive names but that is not the norm.
</p><p>
Further, filename lookup is a common operation in Linux and so
optimizing it is a priority.  Thus these two operations
appear to be good candidates where a test for NULL and an inlined
default operation might be appropriate.  What we find though is that
when such an optimization is warranted it is not by itself enough.

The code that calls <tt>d_compare()</tt> and <tt>d_hash()</tt> (and a couple of other dentry
operations) does not test these functions for NULL directly.  Rather
they require that a few flag bits (DCACHE_OP_HASH, DCACHE_OP_COMPARE)
in the "dentry" are set up to indicate whether the common default
should be used, or whether the function should be called.  As the flag
field is likely to be in cache anyway, and the <tt>dentry_operations</tt>
structure will often be not needed at all, this avoids a memory fetch
in a hot path.
</p><p>
So we find that the one case where using a NULL function pointer to
indicate a default could be justified, it is not actually used; instead, a
different, more efficient,
mechanism is used to indicate that the default method is requested.
</p>
<h4>Members other than function pointers</h4>
<p>
While most vtable-like structures in the kernel contain exclusively
function pointers, there are a significant minority that have
non-function-pointer fields.  Many of these appear on the surface
quite arbitrary and a few closer inspections suggest that some of them
result of poor design or bit-rot and their removal would only improve
the code.
</p><p>
There is one exception to the "functions only" pattern that occurs
repeatedly and provides real value, and so is worth exploring.
This pattern is seen in its most general form in
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/drivers/md/md.h#L348"><tt>struct mdk_personality</tt></a>
which provides operations for a particular software
RAID level.  In particular this structure contains an "owner", a
"name", and a "list".  The "owner" is the module that provides the
implementation.  The "name" is a simple identifier: some vtables have
string names, some have numeric names, and it is often called
something different like "version", "family", "drvname", or
"level".  But conceptually it is still a name.  In the present example
there are two names, a string and a numeric "level".
</p><p>
The "list", while part of the same functionality, is less
common. The mdk_personality structure has a <tt>struct list_head</tt>, as does
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/textsearch.h#L37"><tt>struct ts_ops</tt></a>.
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/fs.h#L1793"><tt>struct file_system_type</tt></a> 
has a simple pointer to the next
<tt>struct file_system_type</tt>.

The underlying idea here is that for any particular implementation of
an interface (or "final" definition of a class) to be usable, it must
be registered in some way so that it can be found.  Further, once it
has been found it must be possible to ensure that the module holding
the implementation is not removed while it is in use.
</p><p>
There seem to be nearly as many styles of registration against an
interface in Linux as there are interfaces to register against, so
finding strong patterns there would be a difficult task.  However it
is fairly common for a "vtable" to be treated as the primary handle on
a particular implementation of an interface and to have an "owner"
pointer which can be used to get a reference on the module which
provides the implementation.
</p><p>
So the pattern we find here is that a structure of function pointers
used as a "vtable" for object method dispatch should normally contain
<b>only</b> function pointers.  Exceptions require clear justification.  A
common exception allows a module pointer and possible other fields such
as a name and a list pointer. These fields are used to support
the registration protocol for the particular interface.
When there is no list pointer it is very likely that the entire vtable will
be treated as read-only.  In this case the vtable will often be declared as
a <tt>const</tt> structure and so could even be stored in read-only memory.

</p>
<h4>Combining Methods for different objects</h4>
<p>
A final common deviation from the "pure vtable" pattern that we see in
the Linux kernel occurs when the first argument to the function is not
always the same object type.  In a pure vtable which is referenced by
a pointer in a particular data structure, the first argument of
each function is exactly that data structure.  What reason could there
be for deviating from that pattern?  It turns out that there are few,
some more interesting than others.
</p><p>
The simplest and least interesting explanation is that, for no apparent
reason, the target data structure is listed elsewhere in the argument
list.  For example all functions in
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/fb.h#L623"><tt>struct
fb_ops</tt></a>
take a <tt>struct fb_info</tt>.  While in 18 cases that structure is the first argument, in
five cases it is the last.  There is nothing obviously wrong with this
choice and it is unlikely to confuse developers.  It is only a problem
for data miners like your author who need to filter it out as an
irrelevant pattern.
</p><p>
A slight deviation on this pattern is seen in
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/rfkill.h#L145"><tt>struct rfkill_ops</tt></a>
where two functions take a <tt>struct rkfill</tt> but the third - <tt>set_block()</tt> -
takes a <tt>void *data</tt>.  Further investigation shows that this opaque
<tt>data</tt> is exactly that which is stored in <tt>rfkill-&gt;data</tt>, so <tt>set_block()</tt>
could easily be defined to take a <tt>struct rfkill</tt> and simply to follow
the <tt>-&gt;data</tt> link itself.  This deviation is sufficiently non-obvious
that it could conceivably confuse developers as well as data miners
and so should be avoided.
</p><p>
The next deviation in seen for example in
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/suspend.h#L108"><tt>platform_suspend_ops</tt></a>,
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/oprofile.h#L51"><tt>oprofile_operations</tt></a>,
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/security.h#L1375"><tt>security_operations</tt></a>
and a few others.  These
take an odd assortment of arguments with no obvious pattern.  However
these are really very different sorts of vtable structures in that the
object they belong to are singletons.  There is only one active
platform, only one profiler, only one security policy.  Thus the
"object" on which these operations act is part of the global state and
so does not need to be included in the arguments of any functions.
</p><p>
Having filtered these two patterns out as not being very interesting
we are left with two that do serve to tell us something about object
use in the kernel.
</p><p>
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/quota.h#L301"><tt>quota_format_ops</tt></a>
and
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/exportfs.h#L167"><tt>export_operations</tt></a>
are two different operations structures that operate on a variety of different
data structures.  In each case the apparent primary object (e.g. a
<tt>struct super_block</tt> or a <tt>struct dentry</tt>) already has a vtable
structure dedicated to it (such as <tt>super_operations</tt> or
<tt>dentry_operations</tt>) and these new structures add new operations.  In
each case the new operations form a cohesive unit providing a related
set of functionality - whether supporting disk quotas or NFS export.
They don't all act on the same object simply because the functionality
in question depends on a variety of objects.
</p><p>
The best term from the language of object-oriented programming for this
is probably the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin">mixin</a>".
Though the fit may not be perfect -
depending on what your exact understanding of mixin is - the idea of
bringing in a collection of functionality without using strict hierarchical
inheritance is very close to the purpose of <tt>quota_format_ops</tt> and
<tt>export_operations</tt>.
</p><p>
Once we know to be on the lookout for mixins like these we can find
quite a few more examples.  The pattern to be alert for is not the one
that led us here - an operations structure that operates on a variety
of different objects - but rather the one we found where the functions
in an "operations" structure operate on objects that already have their
own "operations" structure.  When an object has a large number of
operations that are relevant and these operations naturally group into
subsets, it makes a lot of sense to divide them into separate
vtable-like structures.  There are several examples of this in the
networking code where for instance both
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/net/tcp.h#L661"><tt>tcp_congestion_ops</tt></a>
and
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/net/inet_connection_sock.h#L38"><tt>inet_connection_sock_af_ops</tt></a>
operate (primarily) on a <tt>struct sock</tt>,
which itself has already got a small set of dedicated operations.
</p><p>
So the pattern of a "mixin" - at least as defined as a set of operations
which apply to one or more objects without being the primary
operations for those objects - is a pattern that is often found in the
kernel and appears to be quite valuable in allowing better
modularization of code.
</p><p>
The last pattern which explains non-uniform function targets is
probably the most interesting, particularly in its contrast to the
obvious application of object-oriented programming style.

Examples of this pattern abound with
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/libata.h#L803"><tt>ata_port_operations</tt></a>,
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/tty_driver.h#L243"><tt>tty_operations</tt></a>,
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/nfs_xdr.h#L1125"><tt>nfs_rpc_ops</tt></a>
and
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/atmdev.h#L388"><tt>atmdev_ops</tt></a>
all appearing as
useful examples.  However we will focus primarily on some examples
from the filesystem layer, particularly
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/fs.h#L1613"><tt>super_operations</tt></a>
and
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/fs.h#L1569"><tt>inode_operations</tt></a>.
</p><p>
There is a strong hierarchy of objects in the implementation of a
filesystem where the filesystem - represented by a "super_block" - has a
number of files (<tt>struct inode</tt>) which may have a number of names or
links (<tt>struct dentry</tt>).  Further each file might store data in the page
cache (<tt>struct address_space</tt>) which comprises a number of individual
pages (<tt>struct page</tt>).

There is a sense in which all of these different objects belong to the
filesystem as a whole.  If a page needs to be loaded with data from a
file, the filesystem knows how to do that, and it is probably the same
mechanism for every page in every file.  Where it isn't always the
same, the filesystem knows that too.  So we could conceivably store
every operation on every one of these objects in the
<tt>struct super_block</tt>, as it represents the filesystem and could know what to
do in each case.
</p><p>
In practice that extreme is not really helpful.  It is quite likely
that while there are similarities between the storage of a regular file
and a directory, there are also important differences and being able
to encode those differences in separate vtables can be helpful.
Sometimes small symbolic links are stored directly in the inode while
larger links are stored like the contents of a regular file.  Having
different <tt>readlink()</tt> operations for the two cases can make the code a
lot more readable.
</p><p>
While the extreme of every operation attached to the one central
structure is not ideal, it is equally true that the opposite extreme
is not ideal either.  The <tt>struct page</tt> in Linux does not have a
vtable pointer at all - in part because we want to keep the structure
as small as possible because it is so populous.  Rather the
<tt>address_space_operations</tt> structure contains the operations that act
on a page.  Similarly the <tt>super_operations</tt> structure contains some
operations that apply to inodes, and <tt>inode_operations</tt> contains some
operations that apply to dentries.
</p><p>
It is clearly possible to have operations structures attached to a
parent of the target object - providing the target holds a reference
to the parent, which it normally does - though it is not quite so clear that
it is always beneficial.  In the case of <tt>struct page</tt> which avoids
having a vtable pointer altogether the benefit is clear.  In the case
of <tt>struct inode</tt> which has its own vtable pointer, the benefit of
having some operations (such as <tt>destroy_inode()</tt> or <tt>write_inode()</tt>)
attached to the super_block is less clear.
</p><p>
As there are several vtable structures where any given function
pointer could be stored, the actual choice is in many cases little
more than historical accident.  Certainly the proliferation
of <tt>struct dentry</tt> operations in <tt>inode_operations</tt> seems to be
largely due to the fact that some of them used to act directly
on the inode, but changes in the VFS eventually required this
to change.  For example in 2.1.78-pre1, each of <tt>link()</tt>,
<tt>readlink()</tt>, <tt>followlink()</tt> (and some others which are now
defunct) were 
<a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/davej/history.git;a=commitdiff;h=5770cca79b11eaf962b41008c2eb1e845c3aae51#patch45">changed</a>
from taking a <tt>struct inode</tt> to
take a <tt>struct dentry</tt> instead.  This set the scene for "dentry"
operations to be in <tt>inode_operations</tt>, so when setattr and getattr
were added for 2.3.48, it probably seemed completely natural to
include them in <tt>inode_operations</tt> despite the fact that they acted
primarily on a dentry.
</p><p>
Possibly we could simplify things by getting rid of
<tt>dentry_operations</tt> altogether.  Some operations that act on dentries
are already in <tt>inode_operations</tt> and <tt>super_operations</tt> - why not move
them all there?  While dentries are not as populous as <tt>struct page</tt>
there are still a lot of them and removing the "d_op" field could save
5% of the memory used by that structure (on x86-64).
</p><p>
With two exceptions, every active filesystem only has a single dentry
operations structure in effect.  Some filesystem implementations like
"vfat" define two - e.g. one with case-sensitive matching and one with
case-insensitive matching - but there is only one active per
super-block.  So it would seem that the operations in
dentry_operations could be moved to <tt>super_operations</tt>, or at
least accessed through "s_d_op".

The two exceptions are ceph and procfs.  These filesystems use
different <tt>d_revalidate()</tt> operations in different parts of the
filesystem and - in the case of procfs - different <tt>d_release()</tt>
operations.  The necessary distinctions could easily be made in
per-superblock versions of these operations.  Do these cases justify the 5%
space cost?  Arguably not.
</p>
<h4>Directly embedded function pointers</h4>
<p>
Finally it is appropriate to reflect on the alternate pattern
mentioned at the start, where function pointers are stored directly in
the object rather than in a separate vtable structure.

This pattern can be seen in
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/blkdev.h#L263"><tt>struct request_queue</tt></a>
which has nine function
pointers,
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/linux/efi.h#L251"><tt>struct efi</tt></a>
which has ten function pointers, and
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.39/include/net/sock.h#L238"><tt>struct sock</tt></a>
which has six function pointers.
</p><p>
The cost of embedded pointers is obviously space.  
When vtables are used, there is only one copy
of the vtable and multiple copies of an object (in most cases) so if
more than one function pointer is needed, a vtable would save space.

The cost of a vtable is an extra memory reference, though cache might
reduce much of this cost in some cases.  A vtable also has a cost of
flexibility.  When each object needs exactly the same set of operations
a vtable is good, but if there is a need to individually tailor some
of the operations for each object, then embedded function pointer can
provide that flexibility.  This is illustrated quite nicely by the
comment with "zoom_video" in <tt>struct pcmcia_socket</tt>
</p>
<pre>	/* Zoom video behaviour is so chip specific its not worth adding
	   this to _ops */
</pre><p>
So where objects are not very populous, where the list of function
pointers is small, and where multiple mixins are needed,
embedded function pointers are used instead of a separate vtable.
</p>
<h4>Method Dispatch Summary</h4>
<p>
If we combine all the pattern elements that we have found in
Linux we find that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Method pointers that operate on a particular type of object are
normally collected in a vtable associated directly with that
object, though they can also appear:
</p>
<ul>
<li> In a mixin vtable that collects related functionality which
    may be selectable independently of the base type of the
    object.
</li><li> In the vtable for a "parent" object when doing so avoids
    the need for a vtable pointer in a populous object
</li><li> Directly in the object when there are few method pointers,
    or they need to be individually tailored to the particular
    object.
</li></ul>
<p>
These vtables rarely contain anything other than function
pointers, though fields needed to register the object class can
be appropriate.  Allowing these function pointers to be NULL is
a common but not necessarily ideal technique for handling
defaults.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So in exploring the Linux Kernel code we have found that even
though it is not written in an object-oriented language, it
certainly contains objects, classes (represented as vtables),
and even mixins.  It also contains concepts not normally
found in object-oriented languages such as delegating
object methods to a "parent" object.
</p><p>
Hopefully understanding these different patterns and the
reasons for choosing between them can lead to more uniform
application of the patterns across the kernel, and hence make
it easier for a newcomer to understand which pattern is being
followed.

In the second part of our examination of object
oriented patterns we will explore the various ways that 
data inheritance is achieved in the Linux kernel
and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach so
as to see where each is most appropriate.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>This is the story of a bug that was discovered and fixed in Telegram's self-rolled cryptographic protocol about seven years ago. The bug didn't get any press, and no one seems to know about it, probably because it was only published in Russian.</p>
<p>To this day, it's the most backdoor-looking bug I've ever seen.</p>
<p>Google Translate does a good enough job on the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/206900/?ref=words.filippo.io">original article</a>, which is still available on Habr, but I'm going to walk you through it along with some context.</p>
<p>Telegram is a popular chat app that uses its own... bizarre protocol to encrypt chats, called MTProto. The protocol is used both to encrypt all messages to the Telegram server, and to encrypt opt-in 1:1 end-to-end "Secret Chats".<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> In text I can't do justice to the facial expressions of cryptographers when you mention Telegram's protocol, so just believe me that it's <em>weird</em>.</p>
<p>The current consensus seems to be that the latest version is not broken in known ways that are severe or relevant enough to affect end users, assuming the implementation is correct. That is about as safe as leaving exposed wires around your house because they are either not live or placed high enough that no one should touch them.</p>
<p>The original version was, however, completely broken, in the most puzzling of ways.</p>
<p>End-to-end Telegram chat sessions use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange?ref=words.filippo.io">finite-field Diffie-Hellman</a><sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> to establish a shared key between the two participants. The negotiation happens through messages relayed by the Telegram server. Diffie-Hellman is a fundamental building block of many cryptosystems, and it allows two parties to establish a shared secret that any eavesdroppers can't derive. It is however only one part of a secure key exchange, because an attacker capable of intercepting the messages could simply establish two separate sessions with the two parties, carrying out a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-in-the-middle_attack?ref=words.filippo.io">Person-in-the-Middle</a> attack. The parties need some way to verify they derived the same secret. In TLS, they use a signature from a certificate. In most secure chat apps, there is a fingerprint ("Safety Numbers" in Signal) that the two parties can compare out-of-band.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> What's important is that if the two sides derived the same secret, they can be sure no one else has access to it.</p>
<p>The Telegram key exchange is described in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131220000537/https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end#key-generation">the "Key Generation" section of Telegram's end-to-end API docs</a>. Concretely, Alice requests the DH parameters <code>(p, g)</code> from Telegram, painstakingly verifies them, computes a random <code>a</code> value, and sends <code>g^a mod p</code> to Telegram. Bob receives <code>(p, g, g^a mod p)</code>, similarly computes <code>b</code> and <code>g^b mod p</code>, and sends the latter back (along with a truncated hash of the derived key, for some reason).</p>
<p>Now, normally the two sides would compute the shared key as <code>(g^a)^b mod p</code> and <code>(g^b)^a mod p</code>. Instead, the original version of MTProto computed it as</p>
<pre><code>(g^a)^b mod p XOR nonce
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>nonce</code> was an arbitrary, supposedly random value sent by the server along with the peer's public contribution.</p>
<p>This was a completely non-standard and useless addition, and all it did was let the server perform an undetected Person-in-the-Middle attack. Let's see how.</p>
<p>In a normal PitM, the server negotiates two separate Diffie-Hellman sessions with Alice and Bob, who end up with different shared keys, which they could detect by comparing fingerprints.</p>
<pre><code>Alice                     Telegram              Bob

a = random()       
A = g^a mod p       -&gt;
                        t = random()
                        T = g^t mod p -&gt;
                                          b = random()
                                      &lt;-  B = g^b mod p
                                          key = T^b mod p
                    &lt;-  T
key = T^a mod p

                    T^a mod p != T^b mod p
</code></pre>
<p>With the nonce addition, however, the server could "fix" Alice's key to match Bob's by manipulating Alice's nonce. The two parties would end up with the same fingerprint, and couldn't tell that an attack happened, but the server (and no one else) would know the shared key, allowing it to decrypt all messages.</p>
<pre><code>nonce_bob = random()
key_bob = T^b mod p  XOR  nonce_bob

nonce_alice = A^t mod p  XOR  B^t mod p  XOR  nonce_bob
key_alice = T^a mod p  XOR  nonce_alice =
  T^a mod p  XOR  (A^t mod p  XOR  B^t mod p  XOR  nonce_bob) =
  B^t mod p  XOR  nonce_bob = key_bob
</code></pre>
<p>Why do I say this addition was useless? Because it literally had no purpose! Indeed, the vulnerability was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/diff/20131220000537/20131225140924/http://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end">fixed by silently removing the nonce step from the docs</a>.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> <a href="https://core.telegram.org/constructor/encryptedChatRequested?layer=11&amp;ref=words.filippo.io">A later API revision</a> removed the nonce parameter with the caption "Improve secret chats". All <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131028041748/http://core.telegram.org/constructor/encryptedChatRequested">the original API reference</a> said about the nonce is "Random server sequence for calculation of key".</p>
<p>I never heard a plausible explanation for why the designers of MTProto went out of their way to add useless complexity to their protocol, with the only outcome of making undetectable interception possible.</p>
<p><strong>Edit (2021-01-11)</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/asdofindia/status/1348491279798128641?ref=words.filippo.io">@asdofindia linked me on Twitter</a> to <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/crowdsourcing-a-more-secure-future?ref=words.filippo.io">an official statement by Telegram about this</a> that I couldn't find anymore. It claims the nonce was there to protect clients with weak random number generators. Here's what I had buried into a footnote when I couldn't find a citation to attribute that explanation to Telegram:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This doesn't make sense for a number of reasons: 1) clients with weak randomness are likely to be toast anyway, because Telegram's bizarro not-a-MAC relies on randomness in the payload to avoid an offline decryption oracle (there is a plaintext hash of the payload on the wire, I told you this was weird!); 2) the API also allows clients to request random bytes from the server to XOR with their secret share; and 3) defending against weak randomness by relying on a server contribution defends against everything but the server, which is the relevant attacker in the end-to-end setting. (Said another way, anyone that can intercept client-server messages can see the extra randomness, making it moot.) Non-practitioners might think this is a reasonable defense in depth, belts and suspenders kind of thing, but in cryptography engineering adding complexity to defend against scenarios that lead to compromise anyway is simply pointless.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's been a while, the world is a different place now, and maybe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor?ref=words.filippo.io">Hanlon's razor</a> cuts deeper than I thought. I think there are better reasons not to use Telegram today than this old bug<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1:1">[1:1]</a></sup>, but it's still what I think about every time people talk about far-fetched "bugdoors". The bar is high!</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>By the way, aside from all the cryptographic weirdness and the unexplained backdoor-looking bug, the real reason you should not trust Telegram's encryption is that it's off by default, inconvenient to use, and simply unavailable in groups, meaning most messages flow unencrypted on Telegram's servers. Nonetheless, Telegram markets itself as a secure chat app, with misleading copy along the lines of "everything is encrypted, Secret Chats are just <em>more</em> encrypted!" They explain in their FAQ that it's all about backups, and that other more secure apps "<a href="https://telegram.org/faq?ref=words.filippo.io#dev_page_content:~:text=Other%20apps%20ignore%20the%20need%20for,before%20ever%20reaching%20a%20million%20users.">never reach a million users</a>". <a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1347240006444675072?ref=words.filippo.io">In other news</a>. <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a> <a href="#fnref1:1">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn2"><p>Diffie-Hellman over finite fields is how it was originally designed, but today we'd use Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman, which is faster, has smaller outputs, and is safer. FFDH has many of <a href="https://buttondown.email/cryptography-dispatches/archive/557475c5-9781-47e0-a640-5734bc849bc7?ref=words.filippo.io">the same issues as DSA</a> (FFDH is to DSA like ECDH is to ECDSA and EdDSA.) Current-day MTProto 2.0 still uses FFDH, but that's far from the most anachronistic choice in it. <a href="#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn3"><p>This is admittedly not a particularly strong authentication strategy, but it relies on the assumption that even if 1% of users check their fingerprints, systematic PitM is likely to be detected, and high-risk users can be extra careful and consistently check fingerprints. I hope solutions like key transparency can improve this picture in the coming years without changing the default UX. <a href="#fnref3">↩︎</a></p>
