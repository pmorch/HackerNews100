<strong>According to a media report, a striking number of work accidents occur in the factory of the US electric car manufacturer Tesla in Grünheide. IG Metall has called on Tesla to make improvements to occupational safety.</strong>
</p>
<p>A year and a half ago, the US car company Tesla opened its factory in Grünheide near Berlin. Accidents at work have not been uncommon since then – this is what the magazine “Stern” reports, citing previously unknown documents from authorities and emergency services.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-taeglich-Unfaelle-bei-Tesla-in-Gruenheide">“Accidents almost every day” at Tesla in Grünheide</h2>
<p>According to a file note from the State Office for Occupational Safety, “accidents occurred almost daily on the factory premises over a long period of time.” According to research, Tesla is said to have reported at least 190 reportable accidents between June and November 2022 alone. In Germany, all work accidents must be reported. </p>
<p>According to “Stern”, documents from the rescue centers also documented that Tesla boss Elon Musk’s factory requested an ambulance or helicopter 247 times in the first year after opening alone. For comparison: Converted to the number of employees, this is three times as many emergencies – in a similar period of time – as occurred, for example, at the Audi factory in Ingolstadt. </p>
<h2 id="Verbrennungen-und-amputierte-Gliedmassen">Burns and amputated limbs</h2>
<p>The rescue reports showed, among other things, that a wooden box weighing 50 kilograms fell on an employee’s head from a height of several meters. Another employee broke into a dosing oven with red-hot aluminum with his foot. The injuries listed by the rescuers also included amputated limbs and injuries caused by burns or hydrochloric acid. </p>
<h2 id="IG-Metall-fordert-Tesla-zu-Nachbesserungen-auf">IG Metall calls on Tesla <span>Improvements </span>on</h2>
<p>IG Metall has now called on Tesla to improve occupational safety for employees in the plant. “Health comes before profit – that also applies to Tesla in Grünheide,” said Dirk Schulze, IG Metall district manager for Berlin-Brandenburg-Saxony, today. IG Metall has long been concerned about occupational safety at the plant. </p>
<p>Numerous employees reported accidents and health problems, in some areas this led to sickness rates of up to 40 percent. Instead of addressing the causes, management reacts by putting pressure on the sick. Fewer staff should produce the same quantities. “The management clearly does not give the issue of occupational health and safety a priority.” </p>
<h2 id="Bisher-26-Umwelt-Vorfaelle-in-Gruenheide">So far 26 environmental incidents in Grünheide</h2>
<p>There have also been several environmental incidents since the factory opened a year and a half ago. Tesla has since reported 26 environmental accidents. This emerges from information from the Brandenburg State Office for the Environment, which “Stern” reports on and which is also available to the dpa news agency. These include spilled substances such as paint, diesel and fires. Part of the site lies in the water protection area. </p>
<p>Specifically, the accidents included leaks of 15,000 liters of paint, 13 tons of aluminum and 50 and 150 liters of diesel. The paint incident in April 2022 was already known. According to information from the State Environment Agency, paint and aluminum were disposed of professionally or properly. </p>
<h2 id="Gefahr-fuer-das-Trinkwasser">Danger to drinking water?</h2>
<p>The “Stern” also reported that after a fire in September 2020, up to 300 liters of extinguishing water seeped into the ground; 250 liters of diesel leaked in a gas station on site in May 2023. The State Environment Agency did not provide any information on this. </p>
<p>The head of ecosystems at the Leibniz Institute for Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Martin Pusch, spoke of a fundamentally high risk with regard to drinking water. “There is a high risk of impairment of the drinking water supply due to the low retention capacity of the subsoil,” Pusch told dpa. Tesla has dismissed concerns. </p>

I'm not sure why a bot detection service would need to check sensors, but maybe it's just one signal in a myriad of signals to detect if a requestor is a human or a bot? Or maybe it's being used as part of fingerprinting to track and individually identify visitors?</p><p>I spent a little time digging around the Akamai site, and while most of their documentation is locked behind having an actual account, I stumbled on <a href="https://developer.akamai.com/tools/sdk/bot-manager?ref=grantwinney.com">this</a> regarding their mobile device capabilities:</p><blockquote>The Akamai Bot Manager Premier software development kit (BMP SDK) takes the fundamental technology of <a href="https://developer.akamai.com/akamai-bot-manager?ref=grantwinney.com">Akamai Bot Manager</a> and applies it to native mobile apps. The BMP SDK collects behavioral data while the user is interacting with the application. This behavioral data, also known as sensor data, includes the device characteristics, device orientation, accelerometer data, touch events, etc. Akamai BMP SDK provides a simple API to detect bot activities and defend against malicious bot and account takeover.</blockquote><p>It includes this graphic, which just seems to reinforce the above description, that their bot detection service(s) uses sensor data like accelerometer capabilities to determine whether a requestor is a bot or not.</p><figure><img src="https://grantwinney.com/content/images/2020/07/infographic_overview_human-request_redo.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><figcaption>source: <a href="https://developer.akamai.com/tools/sdk/bot-manager?ref=grantwinney.com">Bot Manager Premier SDK</a></figcaption></figure><p>I feel fairly confident that's the answer, but it leaves at least one more question...</p><h3 id="but-why-do-they-expect-desktops-to-have-an-accelerometer">But why do they expect desktops to have an accelerometer?</h3><p>I think maybe it's an oversight, but I can't really prove it.

So unless Akamai detects the screen size and loads a different obfuscated file for each (and what about mobile users that choose the "view desktop site" option, or tablets with a very high resolution?), odds are the same script that runs on mobile devices is running on desktops.</p><h3 id="guess-2-they-provide-two-scripts-but-companies-only-implement-one">Guess 2: They provide two scripts, but companies only implement one</h3><p>Or perhaps their <a href="https://developer.akamai.com/tools/sdk/bot-manager?ref=grantwinney.com">Akamai Bot Manager Premier SDK</a> service that builds on the basic "<a href="https://developer.akamai.com/akamai-bot-manager?ref=grantwinney.com">Akamai Bot Manager</a>" service is only meant to be loaded on mobile versions of sites, leaving the onus of implementation to individual sites. I can imagine most businesses, upon hearing that they have to implement two libraries, and then realizing that one is just a more enhanced version of the other, instructing the development team to just reference the "premier" SDK everywhere.</p><p>If anyone hears differently or knows more, please share in the comments.

  ONE of the most iconic trees in the UK has come down overnight, with authorities believing it's been deliberately felled.
</p><div id="po-inline-articlegate-partialarticle">
<p>
  The Sycamore Gap tree&nbsp;which stood tall&nbsp;next to Hadrian's Wall near Crag Lough in Northumberland,&nbsp;is standing no more, pictures from the scene show.
</p>
<p>
  In a statement, Northumberland National Park Authority said: "Northumberland National Park Authority can confirm that sadly, the famous tree at Sycamore Gap has come down overnight. We have reason to believe it has been deliberately felled.
</p>

<p>
  "We are working with the relevant agencies and partners with an interest in this iconic North East landmark and will issue more details once they are known.
</p>
<p>
  "Sycamore Gap was voted English Tree of the Year in 2016 in the Woodland Trust’s awards and is much-loved by people from across the world.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  "Northumberland National Park Authority would like to ask the public not to visit the site at this time whilst we work with our partners to identify what has happened and to make the site safe."
</p>

<p>
  The location was once a popular photographic subject, and it was described as one of the most photographed trees in the country.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  It featured in the 1991 film&nbsp;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and won the&nbsp;2016 England Tree of the Year&nbsp;award.
</p>
<p>
  A Northumbria Police spokesperson said: “We can confirm an investigation has been launched following damage to the Sycamore Gap Tree in Northumberland.
</p>
<p>
  “Enquiries are ongoing to establish whether any criminal offences have been committed."

# 🤔 Why YAML is the right devops technology for you 🤔
#
# - 100% test coverage, always compiles just fine with no errors or warnings, always shippable
# - no enforced error handling during development because runtime "panic at the disco" in production is dope
# - "something broke" is way better than stack traces with line numbers
# - you need to burn hours as part of setting up a new CI pipeline
# - safe choice with unquestionable industry adoption, "used by kubernetes"
# - is marginally better than windows.ini
# - unlike json [1], YAML supports comments
# - no official documentation (other than a specification for implementers) is totally fine
# - you need a super safe way to "execute this code"

# 🍿 wait a sec, did you say "executable yaml"?? 🍿

# 🚨 Anyone who uses YAML long enough will eventually get burned when attempting to abbreviate Norway 🚨
# `NO` is parsed as a boolean type, which with the YAML 1.1 spec, there are 22 options to write "true" or "false."
# You have to wrap "NO" in quotes to get the expected result.
NI: Nicaragua
NL: Netherlands
NO: Norway # 💣!

# YAML knows that, when you have something that looks like the time of day,
# what you _really_ wanted is the time of seconds since midnight
timeOfDay:
  whatYouWrote: 04:30 # And when you parse this file and serialize it again, you get ...
  whatYouSurelyMeant: 16200 # Have fun debugging this one!
  whatYouShouldHaveWritten: !!str 04:30

# YAML is the super best way to encode Octal (tm) and learning the hard way that Kubernetes uses YAML 1.1
# is a DevOps rite of passage. Below YAML 1.2 a large integer is automatically converted to octal.
- YAML 1.1 uses `0666` notation.
- YAML 1.2 uses `0o666` notation

# and finally, here's some ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ feedback from reddit.com:
- I need to burn the very motherboard this site runs from. It’s that awful.
- This is the worst website I've ever seen
- I agree with the author in principle but that website is inexcusable. I'm going to add YAML config to my projects on Monday just to spite that horrific "website".
- Wtf is this website and why does it repeatedly pop up my phone's keyboard
	- This Website is a giant editable textfield
		- Why?!?
			- Because it’s a good idea to demonstrate good standards while standing on one’s soapbox
				- The author of THAT website wants to tell the rest of us how to program.
- While I agree with the spirit of the website (fuck yaml), the design decisions of the author are questionable to say the least.
- The good news (I realised) was that you can select all the text of the site, and then delete it. Problem solved.
- Fuck this website. Maybe if this person stopped bitching about yaml their website wouldn't blow.
- Yeah, I’m not going to take advice on best practices from a guy whose website is a giant editable text field with unclickable hyperlinks.

Notably, the number of Ki67<sup>+</sup>, pH3<sup>+</sup> and aurora B<sup>+</sup> CMs and the total number of CMs per heart were markedly elevated 4 weeks after TAM injection (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig1">1k–n</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig7">2p–r</a>). We also detected a further increase in the absolute number of CMs per heart and in HW at 8 weeks compared to 4 weeks after TAM administration, indicating that induction of CM proliferation by inactivation of <i>Cpt1b</i> is a lasting and continuous process (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig1">1o</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig7">2j</a>).</p><p>We next carried out RNA-seq analysis of CMs isolated from control, <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>cKO</i></sup> and <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>iKO</i></sup> mice and identified 1,513 and 1,432 differentially expressed genes (<i>P</i> value &lt; 0.05) in <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>cKO</i></sup> and <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>iKO</i></sup> hearts, respectively.

In both mutant mouse lines, we also detected strong upregulation of genes associated with cell cycle progression and reduced expression levels of genes involved in maturation and contraction, concomitant with upregulation of dedifferentiation markers (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig8">3a–c</a>). Downregulated genes were mainly involved in cardiac muscle cell differentiation, heart development and sarcomere organization, suggesting a less mature state of <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig8">3a–c</a>). This notion was further confirmed by electron microscopy analysis and quantification of sarcomere density through immunofluorescence staining, uncovering reduced density of sarcomeres and irregular positioning of mitochondria, respectively (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig8">3d,e</a>). The reduction of sarcomere density was particularly evident in the centre of CMs, close to the nuclei (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig8">3e</a>). In addition, analysis by quantitative PCR (qPCR) with reverse transcription demonstrated reduced expression levels of mature CM-specific genes involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling, glucose transport (<i>Slc2a4</i>) and lactate production (<i>Ldha</i>), but increased expression levels of dedifferentiation markers (<i>Nppa</i> and <i>Acta1</i>; Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig8">3f</a>). Integrative analysis of RNA-seq datasets from <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>cKO</i></sup> and <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>iKO</i></sup> CMs disclosed 172 and 299 genes that were jointly upregulated or downregulated in both mutant strains (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig8">3g</a>).

However, the percentage of γH2A.X<sup>+</sup> cardiac nuclei dropped markedly in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient hearts&nbsp;compared to control hearts, suggesting that inhibition of FAO reduces DNA damage irrespective of reactive oxygen species or stimulates DNA repair (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig9">4d</a>).

In line with these findings, the rate of cell death was significantly reduced in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs compared to control&nbsp;CMs, as measured by uptake of ethidium homodimer 1 after exposure to 1% O<sub>2</sub> (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig10">5f,g</a>). To determine the contribution of CM proliferation to heart regeneration after I–R damage and to exclude enhanced protection as the main cause of the absence of scar formation, we initiated <i>Cpt1b</i> deletion 1 day after applying the I–R injury. Initiation of <i>Cpt1b</i> deletion by injection of TAM did not reduce CPT1B protein levels at 3 and 6 days after I–R injury, corresponding to 2 and 5 days after the first TAM injection. CPT1B protein levels were significantly reduced only 11 days after I–R injury (corresponding to 10 days after the first TAM injection) excluding the possibility that cardioprotection can occur owing to the absence CPT1B (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig10">5h</a>). Histological analysis revealed a strong reduction of the fibrotic scar area in <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>iKO</i></sup> animals&nbsp;compared to control animals. Notably, we also observed a major recovery of cardiac functions 4 weeks after I–R surgery, reaching nearly the same level as before the injury (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig2">2g–i</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#MOESM1">Supplementary Information</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#MOESM4">Supplementary Video</a>), which unequivocally demonstrates that <i>Cpt1b</i> inactivation facilitates cardiac regeneration.

Furthermore, targeted metabolome analysis revealed that levels of acyl-carnitines derived from medium-chain and long-chain fatty acids are strongly reduced in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs, whereas intracellular levels of free carnitine were markedly elevated (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3b</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6b,c</a>). Unexpectedly, intracellular levels of acetyl-CoA and most metabolites of the Krebs cycle, such as citrate, succinate and malate, were not significantly altered, suggesting that CMs use different forms of energy production in the absence of FAO (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3c</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6d</a>).

We detected a major enrichment of metabolites involved in amino acid turnover, including ammonia recycling and urea cycle (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6f</a>). The levels of several amino acids whose intermediates (for example, acetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA and fumarate) replenish the Krebs cycle were increased as well (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3c</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6g,h</a>). Likewise, we found a marked elevation of the levels of metabolites from branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient hearts, including α-ketoisovalerate and α-keto-β-methylvalerate. The levels of propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA, which serve as precursors for succinyl-CoA, were also increased (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3d,e</a>). Thus, we reason that enhanced glucose oxidation and BCAA catabolism in <i>Cpt1b-</i>deficient CMs efficiently compensate for impaired metabolic flux of fatty acid-derived acetyl-CoA into the Krebs cycle in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs. This conclusion is also supported by the increased metabolic flux rate of <sup>13</sup>C-labelled glucose and isoleucine to metabolites of the Krebs cycle or BCAA catabolism, respectively. Additional evidence comes from Seahorse analysis of <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs, indicating more efficient utilization of pyruvate, BCAAs and glucose compared to control CMs (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3f,g</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6i,j</a>).</p><p>Notably, we detected a marked, nearly 20-fold, increase of αKG in CMs after inactivation of <i>Cpt1b</i> (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3c</a>). A direct conversion of glutamine and glutamate to αKG seems unlikely to account for the accumulation of αKG, as neither the concentration of glutamine nor that of glutamate declined (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3c</a>). Instead, we observed significantly reduced isocitrate levels, along with an increase of the levels of IDH1, IDH2 and IDH3A, which catalyse conversion of isocitrate to αKG (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3c,h</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6k</a>). In addition, the enzymatic activity of OGDH, the key component of the αKG dehydrogenase complex converting αKG to succinyl-CoA was reduced in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs, despite an increase in protein concentrations of OGDH complex components (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3h,i</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6l</a>). The reduction of the enzymatic activity of OGDH is most likely caused by the well-known inhibitory effects of intermediate metabolites from BCAA catabolism, the levels of which are increased in the <i>Cpt1b</i> mutants<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Patel, M.

Inactivation of <i>Cpt1b</i> and αKG accumulation did not alter protein levels of other Krebs cycle enzymes or mitochondrial DNA content (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6m,n</a>), indicating that FAO-independent functions of mitochondria were not compromised. Taken together, the results indicate that elevated synthesis and reduced metabolization synergize to accumulate αKG in CMs after abrogation of FAO.</p><p>We did not observe significant differences in the concentrations of diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols and very long-chain acyl-CoA in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient compared to control CMs (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig12">7a–d</a>).

To further substantiate the causality between αKG accumulation and CM reprogramming, we inactivated <i>Ogdh</i> in adult CMs using <i>αMHC-MerCreMer</i><sup><i>pos/+</i></sup><i>Ogdh</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup> (<i>Ogdh</i><sup><i>iKO</i></sup>)&nbsp;mice and <i>αMHC-MerCreMer</i><sup><i>pos/+</i></sup><i>Ogdh</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> as controls, which—as expected—results in substantial accumulation of αKG (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3j</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig12">7f–h</a>). Notably, CM-specific inactivation of <i>Ogdh</i> essentially recapitulated the phenotype observed in <i>Cpt1b</i>-knockout animals, including the massive increase in CM numbers, increased proliferation of CMs and reactivation of genes characteristic of immature CMs (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3k–o</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig12">7i–m</a>).

Therefore, we wondered whether accumulation of αKG in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs affects histone methylation. Analysis of different histone lysine methylation&nbsp;modifications using cardiac nuclei sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) revealed only a reduction in the level of H3K4me3, whereas the levels of 11 other histone lysine methylation&nbsp;modifications were not reduced. By contrast, the levels of heterochromatin markers such as H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H4K20me2 were markedly increased after inactivation of <i>Cpt1b</i>, probably owing to secondary effects associated with the shift of CMs to a more immature state (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig4">4a</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8a</a>). Consistently, H3K4me3 levels are decreased in <i>Ogdh</i>-deficient CMs, which also exhibited increased αKG levels (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8b</a>). Expression levels of enzymes determining H3K4me3 levels, including methyltransferases (that is, <i>Kmt2</i> family, <i>Ash1l</i>, <i>Prdm9</i> and <i>Smyd</i> family) and αKG-dependent H3K4me3 demethylases (that is, <i>Kdm5a-d</i>, <i>Kdm2b</i> and <i>Riox1</i>), did not change after inactivation of <i>Cpt1b</i>. Neither did we detect a change in the intracellular levels of <i>S</i>-adenosyl methionine, the methyl-group donor for histone methylation. Therefore, we conclude that αKG boosts the activity of a H3K4me3-specific demethylase, eventually leading to reduction of H3K4me3 levels (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8c,d</a>).</p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-4" data-title="Increased αKG levels induce H3K4me3 demethylation and decrease expression of CM maturity genes."><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig4" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 4: Increased αKG levels induce H3K4me3 demethylation and decrease expression of CM maturity genes.</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5/figures/4" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06585-5/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6585_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig4" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06585-5/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6585_Fig4_HTML.png" alt="figure 4" loading="lazy" width="685" height="594"></picture></a></div><div data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-4-desc"><p><b>a</b>, Western blot analysis of histone methylation&nbsp;modifications using FACS-isolated CM nuclei from <i>Ctrl</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup> and <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>cKO</i></sup> mice (<i>n</i> = 3 mice&nbsp;each).

Genes showing the 25% broadest peaks exhibited the highest transcriptional activity and were preferentially associated with CM maturation and function (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig4">4b,c</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8g</a>). Integrated analysis of RNA-seq and H3K4me3 ChIP–seq datasets indicated that 31.6% (151) of genes with reduced H3K4me3 peaks were transcriptionally repressed. A total of 95 genes (62.91%) in this group contained broad H3K4me3 peaks and 44 genes (29.14%) contained medium H3K4me3 peaks. By contrast, only a few genes with narrow H3K4me3 peaks (7.95%) showed reduced expression in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig4">4d</a>). Reduction of H3K4me3 deposition in genes with both reduced expression and reduced H3K4me3 peaks was found to be more pronounced inside gene bodies compared to transcription start site regions (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8h</a>). Strikingly, such genes were mostly associated with cardiac muscle contraction, CM differentiation and maturation, including <i>Mylk3</i>, <i>Cacna1g</i> and <i>Myocd</i> (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig4">4e,f</a>). We validated these findings by ChIP–qPCR, demonstrating that H3K4me3 enrichment was broadly diminished in both promoters and gene bodies of genes associated with CM maturation, whereas H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 levels at promoters remained unchanged (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8i–k</a>). Taking these findings together, we conclude that accumulation of αKG activates a H3K4me3-specific demethylase, which subsequently erases H3K4me3 within genes required for cardiac differentiation and maturation, thereby converting <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs into a more immature, proliferation-competent state.</p></div></div><div id="Sec7-section" data-title="Activated KDM5 stimulates proliferation"><h2 id="Sec7">Activated KDM5 stimulates proliferation</h2><div id="Sec7-content"><p>To confirm that accumulation of αKG is a critical signal to prevent CM maturation and enable proliferation, we treated P0–1 neonatal CMs for 4 days with cell-permeable αKG.

Furthermore, the level of expression of <i>Nppa</i>, <i>Nppb</i>, <i>Acta1</i> and <i>Myh7</i>, genes that are predominantly expressed during fetal and neonatal stages, was strongly elevated, whereas the level of expression of genes associated with CM maturation and differentiation, including <i>Tnni3</i>, <i>Mylk3</i> and <i>Myocd</i>,&nbsp;was reduced (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig5">5c</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig14">9a</a>).

This hypothesis was confirmed by overexpression of <i>Kdm5b</i>, which strongly reduced H3K4me3 levels and markedly increased CM cell cycle activity when combined with αKG treatment (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig5">5g,h</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig15">10a–d</a>). <i>Kdm5b</i> plays important roles during heart development, and its expression progressively declines during CM maturation<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="Zaidi, S. et al.

To validate potential targets of KDM5B, we carried out ChIP–qPCR experiments. We found that KDM5B preferentially binds to genes with broad H3K4me3 domains involved in maintaining the mature phenotype of CMs, such as <i>Tnni3</i>, <i>Mylk3</i> and <i>Myocd</i>. By contrast, no enrichment of KDM5B was found on housekeeping genes characterized by narrow peaks, such as <i>Dus1l</i>, <i>Snx19</i> and <i>Lsm6</i>. Notably, mRNA levels of these housekeeping genes were not altered in response to αKG, <i>Kdm5b</i> knockdown or combined treatment (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig5">5j</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig15">10h</a>). Taken together, our results indicate that accumulation of αKG caused by <i>Cpt1b</i> inactivation activates KDM5, which lowers broad H3K4me3 peaks in genes required for CM maturation, thereby reverting CMs to a more immature state and enabling CM cell cycle activity (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig15">10i</a>).</p></div></div><div id="Sec8-section" data-title="Discussion"><h2 id="Sec8">Discussion</h2><div id="Sec8-content"><p>Here we demonstrate that the cellular metabolism directly regulates H3K4me3 histone modifications at CM identity genes, thereby playing a pivotal role in controlling the&nbsp;maturation and proliferation of CMs. Metabolism-induced partial rewinding of the maturation program not only increases the proliferative capacity of CMs but also leads to various cardioprotective changes, including increased activation of adaptive HIF1 signalling<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 31" title="Huang, C. et al.

In brief, dissected hearts were cannulated through the aorta and retrogradely perfused with calcium-free buffer. Cannulated hearts were enzymatically digested by perfusion with enzyme buffer solution and cut off from the cannula. Atria were separated, and ventricles were minced in enzyme buffer. After gentle pipetting, myocytes were centrifuged at 500 r.p.m. for 1 min and cell pellets containing CM fractions were resuspended in stop buffer.

In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased. He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind. Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science. Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work. Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on "The American Scholar," this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge.</span></p></section></header><section data-event-module="article body"><p icap="on">This has not been a scientist's war; it has been a war in which all have had a part. The scientists, burying their old professional competition in the demand of a common cause, have shared greatly and learned much. It has been exhilarating to work in effective partnership. Now, for many, this appears to be approaching an end. What are the scientists to do next?</p><p>For the biologists, and particularly for the medical scientists, there can be little indecision, for their war has hardly required them to leave the old paths. Many indeed have been able to carry on their war research in their familiar peacetime laboratories. Their objectives remain much the same.</p><p>It is the physicists who have been thrown most violently off stride, who have left academic pursuits for the making of strange destructive gadgets, who have had to devise new methods for their unanticipated assignments. They have done their part on the devices that made it possible to turn back the enemy, have worked in combined effort with the physicists of our allies. They have felt within themselves the stir of achievement. They have been part of a great team. Now, as peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy of their best.</p><p><h3>1</h3></p><p>Of what lasting benefit has been man's use of science and of the new instruments which his research brought into existence? First, they have increased his control of his material environment. They have improved his food, his clothing, his shelter; they have increased his security and released him partly from the bondage of bare existence. They have given him increased knowledge of his own biological processes so that he has had a progressive freedom from disease and an increased span of life. They are illuminating the interactions of his physiological and psychological functions, giving the promise of an improved mental health.</p><p>Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual.</p><p>There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers—conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial.</p><p>Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results of research are generations old and by now are totally inadequate for their purpose. If the aggregate time spent in writing scholarly works and in reading them could be evaluated, the ratio between these amounts of time might well be startling. Those who conscientiously attempt to keep abreast of current thought, even in restricted fields, by close and continuous reading might well shy away from an examination calculated to show how much of the previous month's efforts could be produced on call. Mendel's concept of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/genes-are-overrated/480729/">laws of genetics</a> was lost to the world for a generation because his publication did not reach the few who were capable of grasping and extending it; and this sort of catastrophe is undoubtedly being repeated all about us, as truly significant attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential.</p><p>The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record. The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships.</p><p>But there are signs of a change as new and powerful instrumentalities come into use. Photocells capable of seeing things in a physical sense, advanced photography which can record what is seen or even what is not, thermionic tubes capable of controlling potent forces under the guidance of less power than a mosquito uses to vibrate his wings, cathode ray tubes rendering visible an occurrence so brief that by comparison a microsecond is a long time, relay combinations which will carry out involved sequences of movements more reliably than any human operator and thousands of times as fast—there are plenty of mechanical aids with which to effect a transformation in scientific records.</p><p>Two centuries ago Leibnitz invented a calculating machine which embodied most of the essential features of recent keyboard devices, but it could not then come into use. The economics of the situation were against it: the labor involved in constructing it, before the days of mass production, exceeded the labor to be saved by its use, since all it could accomplish could be duplicated by sufficient use of pencil and paper. Moreover, it would have been subject to frequent breakdown, so that it could not have been depended upon; for at that time and long after, complexity and unreliability were synonymous.</p><p>Babbage, even with remarkably generous support for his time, could not produce his great arithmetical machine. His idea was sound enough, but construction and maintenance costs were then too heavy. Had a Pharaoh been given detailed and explicit designs of an automobile, and had he understood them completely, it would have taxed the resources of his kingdom to have fashioned the thousands of parts for a single car, and that car would have broken down on the first trip to Giza.</p><p>Machines with interchangeable parts can now be constructed with great economy of effort. In spite of much complexity, they perform reliably. Witness the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/the-hidden-world-of-the-typewriter/279523/">humble typewriter</a>, or the movie camera, or the automobile. Electrical contacts have ceased to stick when thoroughly understood. Note the automatic telephone exchange, which has hundreds of thousands of such contacts, and yet is reliable. A spider web of metal, sealed in a thin glass container, a wire heated to brilliant glow, in short, the thermionic tube of radio sets, is made by the hundred million, tossed about in packages, plugged into sockets—and it works! Its gossamer parts, the precise location and alignment involved in its construction, would have occupied a master craftsman of the guild for months; now it is built for thirty cents. The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of it.</p><p><h3>2</h3></p><p>A record if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted. Today we make the record conventionally by writing and photography, followed by printing; but we also record on film, on wax disks, and on magnetic wires. Even if utterly new recording procedures do not appear, these present ones are certainly in the process of modification and extension.</p><p>Certainly progress in photography is not going to stop. Faster material and lenses, more automatic cameras, finer-grained sensitive compounds to allow an extension of the minicamera idea, are all imminent. Let us project this trend ahead to a logical, if not inevitable, outcome. The camera hound of the future wears on his forehead a lump a little larger than a walnut. It takes pictures 3 millimeters square, later to be projected or enlarged, which after all involves only a factor of 10 beyond present practice. The lens is of universal focus, down to any distance accommodated by the unaided eye, simply because it is of short focal length. There is a built-in photocell on the walnut such as we now have on at least one camera, which automatically adjusts exposure for a wide range of illumination. There is film in the walnut for a hundred exposures, and the spring for operating its shutter and shifting its film is wound once for all when the film clip is inserted. It produces its result in full color. It may well be stereoscopic, and record with two spaced glass eyes, for striking improvements in stereoscopic technique are just around the corner.</p><p>The cord which trips its shutter may reach down a man's sleeve within easy reach of his fingers. A quick squeeze, and the picture is taken. On a pair of ordinary glasses is a square of fine lines near the top of one lens, where it is out of the way of ordinary vision. When an object appears in that square, it is lined up for its picture. As the scientist of the future moves about the laboratory or the field, every time he looks at something worthy of the record, he trips the shutter and in it goes, without even an audible click. Is this all fantastic? The only fantastic thing about it is the idea of making as many pictures as would result from its use.</p><p>Will there be dry photography? It is already here in two forms. When Brady made his Civil War pictures, the plate had to be wet at the time of exposure. Now it has to be wet during development instead. In the future perhaps it need not be wetted at all. There have long been films impregnated with diazo dyes which form a picture without development, so that it is already there as soon as the camera has been operated. An exposure to ammonia gas destroys the unexposed dye, and the picture can then be taken out into the light and examined. The process is now slow, but someone may speed it up, and it has no grain difficulties such as now keep photographic researchers busy. Often it would be advantageous to be able to snap the camera and to look at the picture immediately.</p><p>Another process now in use is also slow, and more or less clumsy. For fifty years impregnated papers have been used which turn dark at every point where an electrical contact touches them, by reason of the chemical change thus produced in an iodine compound included in the paper. They have been used to make records, for a pointer moving across them can leave a trail behind. If the electrical potential on the pointer is varied as it moves, the line becomes light or dark in accordance with the potential.</p><p>This scheme is now used in facsimile transmission. The pointer draws a set of closely spaced lines across the paper one after another. As it moves, its potential is varied in accordance with a varying current received over wires from a distant station, where these variations are produced by a photocell which is similarly scanning a picture. At every instant the darkness of the line being drawn is made equal to the darkness of the point on the picture being observed by the photocell. Thus, when the whole picture has been covered, a replica appears at the receiving end.</p><p>A scene itself can be just as well looked over line by line by the photocell in this way as can a photograph of the scene. This whole apparatus constitutes a camera, with the added feature, which can be dispensed with if desired, of making its picture at a distance. It is slow, and the picture is poor in detail. Still, it does give another process of dry photography, in which the picture is finished as soon as it is taken.</p><p>It would be a brave man who would predict that such a process will always remain clumsy, slow, and faulty in detail. Television equipment today transmits sixteen reasonably good pictures a second, and it involves only two essential differences from the process described above. For one, the record is made by a moving beam of electrons rather than a moving pointer, for the reason that an electron beam can sweep across the picture very rapidly indeed. The other difference involves merely the use of a screen which glows momentarily when the electrons hit, rather than a chemically treated paper or film which is permanently altered. This speed is necessary in television, for motion pictures rather than stills are the object.</p><p>Use chemically treated film in place of the glowing screen, allow the apparatus to transmit one picture only rather than a succession, and a rapid camera for dry photography results. The treated film needs to be far faster in action than present examples, but it probably could be. More serious is the objection that this scheme would involve putting the film inside a vacuum chamber, for electron beams behave normally only in such a rarefied environment. This difficulty could be avoided by allowing the electron beam to play on one side of a partition, and by pressing the film against the other side, if this partition were such as to allow the electrons to go through perpendicular to its surface, and to prevent them from spreading out sideways. Such partitions, in crude form, could certainly be constructed, and they will hardly hold up the general development.</p><p>Like dry photography, microphotography still has a long way to go. The basic scheme of reducing the size of the record, and examining it by projection rather than directly, has possibilities too great to be ignored. The combination of optical projection and photographic reduction is already producing some results in microfilm for scholarly purposes, and the potentialities are highly suggestive. Today, with microfilm, reductions by a linear factor of 20 can be employed and still produce full clarity when the material is re-enlarged for examination. The limits are set by the graininess of the film, the excellence of the optical system, and the efficiency of the light sources employed. All of these are rapidly improving.</p><p>Assume a linear ratio of 100 for future use. Consider film of the same thickness as paper, although thinner film will certainly be usable. Even under these conditions there would be a total factor of 10,000 between the bulk of the ordinary record on books, and its microfilm replica. The <i>Encyclop</i><em>æ</em><i>dia Britannica</i> could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox. A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk. If the human race has produced since the invention of movable type a total record, in the form of magazines, newspapers, books, tracts, advertising blurbs, correspondence, having a volume corresponding to a billion books, the whole affair, assembled and compressed, could be lugged off in a moving van. Mere compression, of course, is not enough; one needs not only to make and store a record but also be able to consult it, and this aspect of the matter comes later. Even the modern great library is not generally consulted; it is nibbled at by a few.</p><p>Compression is important, however, when it comes to costs. The material for the microfilm <i>Britannica</i> would cost a nickel, and it could be mailed anywhere for a cent. What would it cost to print a million copies? To print a sheet of newspaper, in a large edition, costs a small fraction of a cent. The entire material of the <i>Britannica</i> in reduced microfilm form would go on a sheet eight and one-half by eleven inches. Once it is available, with the photographic reproduction methods of the future, duplicates in large quantities could probably be turned out for a cent apiece beyond the cost of materials. The preparation of the original copy? That introduces the next aspect of the subject.</p><p><h3>3</h3></p><p>To make the record, we now push a pencil or tap a typewriter. Then comes the process of digestion and correction, followed by an intricate process of typesetting, printing, and distribution. To consider the first stage of the procedure, will the author of the future cease writing by hand or typewriter and talk directly to the record? He does so indirectly, by talking to a stenographer or a wax cylinder; but the elements are all present if he wishes to have his talk directly produce a typed record. All he needs to do is to take advantage of existing mechanisms and to alter his language.</p><p>At a recent World Fair a machine called a Voder was shown. A girl stroked its keys and it emitted recognizable speech. No human vocal chords entered into the procedure at any point; the keys simply combined some electrically produced vibrations and passed these on to a loud-speaker. In the Bell Laboratories there is the converse of this machine, called a Vocoder. The loudspeaker is replaced by a microphone, which picks up sound. Speak to it, and the corresponding keys move. This may be one element of the postulated system.</p><p>The other element is found in the stenotype, that somewhat disconcerting device encountered usually at public meetings. A girl strokes its keys languidly and looks about the room and sometimes at the speaker with a disquieting gaze. From it emerges a typed strip which records in a phonetically simplified language a record of what the speaker is supposed to have said. Later this strip is retyped into ordinary language, for in its nascent form it is intelligible only to the initiated. Combine these two elements, let the Vocoder run the stenotype, and the result is a machine which types when talked to.</p><p>Our present languages are not especially adapted to this sort of mechanization, it is true. It is strange that the inventors of universal languages have not seized upon the idea of producing one which better fitted the technique for transmitting and recording speech. Mechanization may yet force the issue, especially in the scientific field; whereupon scientific jargon would become still less intelligible to the layman.</p><p>One can now picture a future investigator in his laboratory. His hands are free, and he is not anchored. As he moves about and observes, he photographs and comments. Time is automatically recorded to tie the two records together. If he goes into the field, he may be connected by radio to his recorder. As he ponders over his notes in the evening, he again talks his comments into the record. His typed record, as well as his photographs, may both be in miniature, so that he projects them for examination.</p><p>Much needs to occur, however, between the collection of data and observations, the extraction of parallel material from the existing record, and the final insertion of new material into the general body of the common record. For mature thought there is no mechanical substitute. But creative thought and essentially repetitive thought are very different things. For the latter there are, and may be, powerful mechanical aids.</p><p>Adding a column of figures is a repetitive thought process, and it was long ago properly relegated to the machine. True, the machine is sometimes controlled by a keyboard, and thought of a sort enters in reading the figures and poking the corresponding keys, but even this is avoidable. Machines have been made which will read typed figures by photocells and then depress the corresponding keys; these are combinations of photocells for scanning the type, electric circuits for sorting the consequent variations, and relay circuits for interpreting the result into the action of solenoids to pull the keys down.</p><p>All this complication is needed because of the clumsy way in which we have learned to write figures. If we recorded them positionally, simply by the configuration of a set of dots on a card, the automatic reading mechanism would become comparatively simple. In fact if the dots are holes, we have the punched-card machine long ago produced by Hollorith for the purposes of the census, and now used throughout business. Some types of complex businesses could hardly operate without these machines.</p><p>Adding is only one operation. To perform arithmetical computation involves also subtraction, multiplication, and division, and in addition some method for temporary storage of results, removal from storage for further manipulation, and recording of final results by printing. Machines for these purposes are now of two types: keyboard machines for accounting and the like, manually controlled for the insertion of data, and usually automatically controlled as far as the sequence of operations is concerned; and punched-card machines in which separate operations are usually delegated to a series of machines, and the cards then transferred bodily from one to another. Both forms are very useful; but as far as complex computations are concerned, both are still in embryo.</p><p>Rapid electrical counting appeared soon after the physicists found it desirable to count cosmic rays. For their own purposes the physicists promptly constructed thermionic-tube equipment capable of counting electrical impulses at the rate of 100,000 a second. The advanced arithmetical machines of the future will be electrical in nature, and they will perform at 100 times present speeds, or more.</p><p>Moreover, they will be far more versatile than present commercial machines, so that they may readily be adapted for a wide variety of operations. They will be controlled by a control card or film, they will select their own data and manipulate it in accordance with the instructions thus inserted, they will perform complex arithmetical computations at exceedingly high speeds, and they will record results in such form as to be readily available for distribution or for later further manipulation. Such machines will have enormous appetites. One of them will take instructions and data from a whole roomful of girls armed with simple key board punches, and will deliver sheets of computed results every few minutes. There will always be plenty of things to compute in the detailed affairs of millions of people doing complicated things.</p><p><h3>4</h3></p><p>The repetitive processes of thought are not confined however, to matters of arithmetic and statistics. In fact, every time one combines and records facts in accordance with established logical processes, the creative aspect of thinking is concerned only with the selection of the data and the process to be employed and the manipulation thereafter is repetitive in nature and hence a fit matter to be relegated to the machine. Not so much has been done along these lines, beyond the bounds of arithmetic, as might be done, primarily because of the economics of the situation. The needs of business and the extensive market obviously waiting, assured the advent of mass-produced arithmetical machines just as soon as production methods were sufficiently advanced.</p><p>With machines for advanced analysis no such situation existed; for there was and is no extensive market; the users of advanced methods of manipulating data are a very small part of the population. There are, however, machines for solving differential equations—and functional and integral equations, for that matter. There are many special machines, such as the harmonic synthesizer which predicts the tides. There will be many more, appearing certainly first in the hands of the scientist and in small numbers.</p><p>If scientific reasoning were limited to the logical processes of arithmetic, we should not get far in our understanding of the physical world. One might as well attempt to grasp the game of poker entirely by the use of the mathematics of probability. The abacus, with its beads strung on parallel wires, led the Arabs to positional numeration and the concept of zero many centuries before the rest of the world; and it was a useful tool—so useful that it still exists.</p><p>It is a far cry from the abacus to the modern keyboard accounting machine. It will be an equal step to the arithmetical machine of the future. But even this new machine will not take the scientist where he needs to go. Relief must be secured from laborious detailed manipulation of higher mathematics as well, if the users of it are to free their brains for something more than repetitive detailed transformations in accordance with established rules. A mathematician is not a man who can readily manipulate figures; often he cannot. He is not even a man who can readily perform the transformations of equations by the use of calculus. He is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, and especially he is a man of intuitive judgment in the choice of the manipulative processes he employs.</p><p>All else he should be able to turn over to his mechanism, just as confidently as he turns over the propelling of his car to the intricate mechanism under the hood. Only then will mathematics be practically effective in bringing the growing knowledge of atomistics to the useful solution of the advanced problems of chemistry, metallurgy, and biology. For this reason there still come more machines to handle advanced mathematics for the scientist. Some of them will be sufficiently bizarre to suit the most fastidious connoisseur of the present artifacts of civilization.</p><p><h3>5</h3></p><p>The scientist, however, is not the only person who manipulates data and examines the world about him by the use of logical processes, although he sometimes preserves this appearance by adopting into the fold anyone who becomes logical, much in the manner in which a British labor leader is elevated to knighthood. Whenever logical processes of thought are employed—that is, whenever thought for a time runs along an accepted groove—there is an opportunity for the machine. Formal logic used to be a keen instrument in the hands of the teacher in his trying of students' souls. It is readily possible to construct a machine which will manipulate premises in accordance with formal logic, simply by the clever use of relay circuits. Put a set of premises into such a device and turn the crank, and it will readily pass out conclusion after conclusion, all in accordance with logical law, and with no more slips than would be expected of a keyboard adding machine.</p><p>Logic can become enormously difficult, and it would undoubtedly be well to produce more assurance in its use. The machines for higher analysis have usually been equation solvers. Ideas are beginning to appear for equation transformers, which will rearrange the relationship expressed by an equation in accordance with strict and rather advanced logic. Progress is inhibited by the exceedingly crude way in which mathematicians express their relationships. They employ a symbolism which grew like Topsy and has little consistency; a strange fact in that most logical field.</p><p>A new symbolism, probably positional, must apparently precede the reduction of mathematical transformations to machine processes. Then, on beyond the strict logic of the mathematician, lies the application of logic in everyday affairs. We may some day click off arguments on a machine with the same assurance that we now enter sales on a cash register. But the machine of logic will not look like a cash register, even of the streamlined model.</p><p>So much for the manipulation of ideas and their insertion into the record. Thus far we seem to be worse off than before—for we can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it. This is a much larger matter than merely the extraction of data for the purposes of scientific research; it involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge. The prime action of use is selection, and here we are halting indeed. There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a week by diligent search, his syntheses are not likely to keep up with the current scene.</p><p>Selection, in this broad sense, is a stone adze in the hands of a cabinetmaker. Yet, in a narrow sense and in other areas, something has already been done mechanically on selection. The personnel officer of a factory drops a stack of a few thousand employee cards into a selecting machine, sets a code in accordance with an established convention, and produces in a short time a list of all employees who live in Trenton and know Spanish. Even such devices are much too slow when it comes, for example, to matching a set of fingerprints with one of five million on file. Selection devices of this sort will soon be speeded up from their present rate of reviewing data at a few hundred a minute. By the use of photocells and microfilm they will survey items at the rate of a thousand a second, and will print out duplicates of those selected.</p><p>This process, however, is simple selection: it proceeds by examining in turn every one of a large set of items, and by picking out those which have certain specified characteristics. There is another form of selection best illustrated by the automatic telephone exchange. You dial a number and the machine selects and connects just one of a million possible stations. It does not run over them all. It pays attention only to a class given by a first digit, then only to a subclass of this given by the second digit, and so on; and thus proceeds rapidly and almost unerringly to the selected station. It requires a few seconds to make the selection, although the process could be speeded up if increased speed were economically warranted. If necessary, it could be made extremely fast by substituting thermionic-tube switching for mechanical switching, so that the full selection could be made in one one-hundredth of a second. No one would wish to spend the money necessary to make this change in the telephone system, but the general idea is applicable elsewhere.</p><p>Take the prosaic problem of the great department store. Every time a charge sale is made, there are a number of things to be done. The inventory needs to be revised, the salesman needs to be given credit for the sale, the general accounts need an entry, and, most important, the customer needs to be charged. A central records device has been developed in which much of this work is done conveniently. The salesman places on a stand the customer's identification card, his own card, and the card taken from the article sold—all punched cards. When he pulls a lever, contacts are made through the holes, machinery at a central point makes the necessary computations and entries, and the proper receipt is printed for the salesman to pass to the customer.</p><p>But there may be ten thousand charge customers doing business with the store, and before the full operation can be completed someone has to select the right card and insert it at the central office. Now rapid selection can slide just the proper card into position in an instant or two, and return it afterward. Another difficulty occurs, however. Someone must read a total on the card, so that the machine can add its computed item to it. Conceivably the cards might be of the dry photography type I have described. Existing totals could then be read by photocell, and the new total entered by an electron beam.</p><p>The cards may be in miniature, so that they occupy little space. They must move quickly. They need not be transferred far, but merely into position so that the photocell and recorder can operate on them. Positional dots can enter the data. At the end of the month a machine can readily be made to read these and to print an ordinary bill. With tube selection, in which no mechanical parts are involved in the switches, little time need be occupied in bringing the correct card into use—a second should suffice for the entire operation. The whole record on the card may be made by magnetic dots on a steel sheet if desired, instead of dots to be observed optically, following the scheme by which Poulsen long ago put speech on a magnetic wire. This method has the advantage of simplicity and ease of erasure. By using photography, however one can arrange to project the record in enlarged form and at a distance by using the process common in television equipment.</p><p>One can consider rapid selection of this form, and distant projection for other purposes. To be able to key one sheet of a million before an operator in a second or two, with the possibility of then adding notes thereto, is suggestive in many ways. It might even be of use in libraries, but that is another story. At any rate, there are now some interesting combinations possible. One might, for example, speak to a microphone, in the manner described in connection with the speech controlled typewriter, and thus make his selections. It would certainly beat the usual file clerk.</p><p><h3>6</h3></p><p>The real heart of the matter of selection, however, goes deeper than a lag in the adoption of mechanisms by libraries, or a lack of development of devices for their use. Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing. When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass to subclass. It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used; one has to have rules as to which path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome. Having found one item, moreover, one has to emerge from the system and re-enter on a new path.</p><p>The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature.</p><p>Man cannot hope fully to duplicate this mental process artificially, but he certainly ought to be able to learn from it. In minor ways he may even improve, for his records have relative permanency. The first idea, however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection. Selection by association, rather than indexing, may yet be mechanized. One cannot hope thus to equal the speed and flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence and clarity of the items resurrected from storage.</p><p>Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one at random, "memex" will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.</p><p>It consists of a desk, and while it can presumably be operated from a distance, it is primarily the piece of furniture at which he works. On the top are slanting translucent screens, on which material can be projected for convenient reading. There is a keyboard, and sets of buttons and levers. Otherwise it looks like an ordinary desk.</p><p>In one end is the stored material. The matter of bulk is well taken care of by improved microfilm. Only a small part of the interior of the memex is devoted to storage, the rest to mechanism. Yet if the user inserted 5000 pages of material a day it would take him hundreds of years to fill the repository, so he can be profligate and enter material freely.</p><p>Most of the memex contents are purchased on microfilm ready for insertion. Books of all sorts, pictures, current periodicals, newspapers, are thus obtained and dropped into place. Business correspondence takes the same path. And there is provision for direct entry. On the top of the memex is a transparent platen. On this are placed longhand notes, photographs, memoranda, all sorts of things. When one is in place, the depression of a lever causes it to be photographed onto the next blank space in a section of the memex film, dry photography being employed.</p><p>There is, of course, provision for consultation of the record by the usual scheme of indexing. If the user wishes to consult a certain book, he taps its code on the keyboard, and the title page of the book promptly appears before him, projected onto one of his viewing positions. Frequently-used codes are mnemonic, so that he seldom consults his code book; but when he does, a single tap of a key projects it for his use. Moreover, he has supplemental levers. On deflecting one of these levers to the right he runs through the book before him, each page in turn being projected at a speed which just allows a recognizing glance at each. If he deflects it further to the right, he steps through the book 10 pages at a time; still further at 100 pages at a time. Deflection to the left gives him the same control backwards.</p><p>A special button transfers him immediately to the first page of the index. Any given book of his library can thus be called up and consulted with far greater facility than if it were taken from a shelf. As he has several projection positions, he can leave one item in position while he calls up another. He can add marginal notes and comments, taking advantage of one possible type of dry photography, and it could even be arranged so that he can do this by a stylus scheme, such as is now employed in the telautograph seen in railroad waiting rooms, just as though he had the physical page before him.</p><p><h3>7</h3></p><p>All this is conventional, except for the projection forward of present-day mechanisms and gadgetry. It affords an immediate step, however, to associative indexing, the basic idea of which is a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another. This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing.</p><p>When the user is building a trail, he names it, inserts the name in his code book, and taps it out on his keyboard. Before him are the two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing positions. At the bottom of each there are a number of blank code spaces, and a pointer is set to indicate one of these on each item. The user taps a single key, and the items are permanently joined. In each code space appears the code word. Out of view, but also in the code space, is inserted a set of dots for photocell viewing; and on each item these dots by their positions designate the index number of the other item.</p><p>Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space. Moreover, when numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn, rapidly or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning the pages of a book. It is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered together from widely separated sources and bound together to form a new book. It is more than this, for any item can be joined into numerous trails.</p><p>The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.</p><p>And his trails do not fade. Several years later, his talk with a friend turns to the queer ways in which a people resist innovations, even of vital interest. He has an example, in the fact that the outraged Europeans still failed to adopt the Turkish bow. In fact he has a trail on it. A touch brings up the code book. Tapping a few keys projects the head of the trail. A lever runs through it at will, stopping at interesting items, going off on side excursions. It is an interesting trail, pertinent to the discussion. So he sets a reproducer in action, photographs the whole trail out, and passes it to his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into the more general trail.</p><p><h3>8</h3></p><p>Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authorities. The patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents, with familiar trails to every point of his client's interest. The physician, puzzled by a patient's reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics for the pertinent anatomy and histology. The chemist, struggling with the synthesis of an organic compound, has all the chemical literature before him in his laboratory, with trails following the analogies of compounds, and side trails to their physical and chemical behavior.</p><p>The historian, with a vast chronological account of a people, parallels it with a skip trail which stops only on the salient items, and can follow at any time contemporary trails which lead him all over civilization at a particular epoch. There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record. The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.</p><p>Thus science may implement the ways in which man produces, stores, and consults the record of the race. It might be striking to outline the instrumentalities of the future more spectacularly, rather than to stick closely to methods and elements now known and undergoing rapid development, as has been done here. Technical difficulties of all sorts have been ignored, certainly, but also ignored are means as yet unknown which may come any day to accelerate technical progress as violently as did the advent of the thermionic tube. In order that the picture may not be too commonplace, by reason of sticking to present-day patterns, it may be well to mention one such possibility, not to prophesy but merely to suggest, for prophecy based on extension of the known has substance, while prophecy founded on the unknown is only a doubly involved guess.</p><p>All our steps in creating or absorbing material of the record proceed through one of the senses—the tactile when we touch keys, the oral when we speak or listen, the visual when we read. Is it not possible that some day the path may be established more directly?</p><p>We know that when the eye sees, all the consequent information is transmitted to the brain by means of electrical vibrations in the channel of the optic nerve. This is an exact analogy with the electrical vibrations which occur in the cable of a television set: they convey the picture from the photocells which see it to the radio transmitter from which it is broadcast. We know further that if we can approach that cable with the proper instruments, we do not need to touch it; we can pick up those vibrations by electrical induction and thus discover and reproduce the scene which is being transmitted, just as a telephone wire may be tapped for its message.</p><p>The impulses which flow in the arm nerves of a typist convey to her fingers the translated information which reaches her eye or ear, in order that the fingers may be caused to strike the proper keys. Might not these currents be intercepted, either in the original form in which information is conveyed to the brain, or in the marvelously metamorphosed form in which they then proceed to the hand?</p><p>By bone conduction we already introduce sounds: into the nerve channels of the deaf in order that they may hear. Is it not possible that we may learn to introduce them without the present cumbersomeness of first transforming electrical vibrations to mechanical ones, which the human mechanism promptly transforms back to the electrical form? With a couple of electrodes on the skull the encephalograph now produces pen-and-ink traces which bear some relation to the electrical phenomena going on in the brain itself. True, the record is unintelligible, except as it points out certain gross misfunctioning of the cerebral mechanism; but who would now place bounds on where such a thing may lead?</p><p>In the outside world, all forms of intelligence whether of sound or sight, have been reduced to the form of varying currents in an electric circuit in order that they may be transmitted. Inside the human frame exactly the same sort of process occurs. Must we always transform to mechanical movements in order to proceed from one electrical phenomenon to another? It is a suggestive thought, but it hardly warrants prediction without losing touch with reality and immediateness.</p><p>Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important.</p><p>The applications of science have built man a well-supplied house, and are teaching him to live healthily therein. They have enabled him to throw masses of people against one another with cruel weapons. They may yet allow him truly to encompass the great record and to grow in the wisdom of race experience. He may perish in conflict before he learns to wield that record for his true good. Yet, in the application of science to the needs and desires of man, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome.</p></section><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>]]></description>

</p></div><p><span>But it’s not just boxes. As demonstrated by the Twitter (X) hashtag #CatSquares, cats often rush over to claim a square marked off on the floor with pieces of tape. And as many a cat person has noticed, a piece of paper on your desk, table or floor is also a powerful cat attractor.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This is peculiar. How safe and cozy can a cat feel sitting right out in the open on top of the water bill? Dodman describes it as something like the placebo effect. “This virtual box may provide some misplaced sense of security and psychosomatic comfort,” he writes.</span></p><p><span>Cats like boxes so much that they even fall for fake boxes. A team of researchers from Hunter College, CUNY, found that cats will happily sit in&nbsp;</span><span>illusory</span><span>&nbsp;squares.</span></p><hr><p><span>Read More: </span><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/yes-cats-really-do-have-facial-expressions"><span>Yes, Cats Really Do Have Facial Expressions</span></a><span></span></p><hr><h2><span>The Challenges of Cat Studies</span></h2><div><p>(Credit: Krakenimages.com/Shutterstock)</p></div><p><span>But before we get into the details of that study, let’s step aside for a moment and talk about scientific studies on cats. There aren’t as many of them as you’d think based on cats’ social media popularity. The reason? Cats make extremely lousy research subjects. When researchers bring cats into the lab to test their intelligence, the cats tend to wander around, hide or just laze about, completely uninterested in what the researchers are trying to get them to do.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>David Grimm is the author of&nbsp;</span><span>Citizen Canine: Our Evolving Relationship with Cats and Dogs</span><span>. In an</span><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/04/cat-intelligence-and-cognition-are-cats-smarter-than-dogs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>&nbsp;article</span></a><span>&nbsp;for Slate magazine, he wrote that when he was researching the book’s chapter on animal intelligence, he asked Ádám Miklósi, one of the world’s top experts on the subject, about research on cat intelligence. Miklósi’s answer, according to Grimm, was, “We did one study on cats—and that was enough!”</span></p><p><span>So, the Hunter College researchers wisely decided to let the cats stay home. Instead of inviting cats to the lab, they recruited citizen scientists to test their cats at home. (It helped that this was during the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, so plenty of people were at home with their cats, apparently getting bored with tossing catnip toys and looking for new ways to pass the time.)</span></p><hr><p><span>Read More: </span><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/5-cats-who-owned-famous-scientists"><span>5 Cats Who Owned Famous Scientists</span></a><span></span></p><hr><h2><span>If I Fits I Sits</span></h2><div><p>(Credit:Master1305/Shutterstock)</p></div><p><span>In the charmingly named and very clever</span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159121001258?via=ihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>&nbsp;study</span></a><span>, “If I Fits I Sits: A Citizen Science Investigation into Illusory Contour Susceptibility in Domestic Cats (Felis silvestris catus),” the researchers tested cats to see if these notorious square sitters would be fooled by an optical illusion known as a Kanisza square.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A</span><a href="https://puzzlewocky.com/optical-illusions/kanizsa-square-and-triangle-illusions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>&nbsp;Kanisza square</span></a><span>&nbsp;is a visual puzzle in which Pac-Man-like circles are arranged so as to create the illusion of a square.

And sure enough, the cats were just as likely to sit in a Kanisza square as a real one.</span></p><div><p>(Credit: SwampTurtle/Shutterstock)</p></div><p><span>The study, the researchers say, confirmed previous research showing that cats are susceptible to visual illusions, which adds to the growing but still relatively meager body of research on cat cognition.

<p>The <b>prophetic perfect tense</b> is a literary technique used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a> that describes future events that are so certain to happen that they are referred to in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_tense" title="Past tense">past tense</a> as if they had already happened.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

The category of "prophetic perfect" was already suggested by medieval Hebrew grammarians,<sup id="cite_ref-rogland_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-rogland-2">[2]</a></sup> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi" title="David Kimhi">David Kimhi</a>: "The matter is as clear as though it had already passed,"<sup id="cite_ref-waltke1_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-waltke1-3">[3]</a></sup> or Isaac ben Yedaiah:</p><blockquote><p>
"[The rabbis] of blessed memory followed, in these words of theirs, in the paths of the prophets who speak of something which will happen in the future in the language of the past. Since they saw in prophetic vision that which was to occur in the future, they spoke about it in the past tense and testified firmly that it had happened, to teach the certainty of his [God's] words -- may he be blessed -- and his positive promise that can never change and his beneficent message that will not be altered." (Isaac ben Yedaiah):<sup id="cite_ref-chazan_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-chazan-4">[4]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Gesenius describes it as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The perfect serves to express actions, events, or states, which the speaker wishes to represent from the point of view of completion, whether they belong to a determinate past time, or extend into the present, <b>or while still future</b>, are pictured as in their completed state." (GKC §106a)<sup id="cite_ref-gesenius_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-gesenius-5">[5]</a></sup> 
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"[The perfect can be used to] express facts which are undoubtedly imminent, and, therefore, in the imagination of the speaker, already accomplished (perfectum confidentiae), e.g. Nu 17:27... Gn 30:13, 1 S 6:5 ..., Pr 4:2. Even in interrogative sentences, Gn 18:12, Nu 17:28, 23:10, Ju 9:9, 11, Zc 4:10 (?), Pr 22:20.8 This use of the perfect occurs most frequently in prophetic language (perfectum propheticum). The prophet so transports himself in imagination into the future that he describes the future event as if it had been already seen or heard by him, e.g. Is 5:13 ...; 19:7, Jb 5:20, 2 Ch 20:37. Not infrequently the imperfect interchanges with such perfects either in the parallel member or further on in the narrative." (GKC §106n)<sup id="cite_ref-gesenius_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-gesenius-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote><p>
According to Waltke &amp; O'Connor:</p><blockquote><p>
"Referring to absolute future time, a perfective form may be <i>persistent</i> or <i>accidental</i>. A <i>persistent (future) perfective</i> represents a single situation extending from the present into the future.... With an <i>accidental perfective</i> a speaker vividly and dramatically represents a future situation both as complete and as independent…. This use is especially frequent in prophetic address (hence it is also called the “prophetic perfect” or “perfective of confidence”)."<sup id="cite_ref-waltke2_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-waltke2-6">[6]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Klein has attempted to identify all established instances of the prophetic perfect.<sup id="cite_ref-klein_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-klein-7">[7]</a></sup> Notarius, siding with Rogland,<sup id="cite_ref-rogland_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-rogland-2">[2]</a></sup> argues that the "prophetic perfect" is "a metaphorical use of the past tense in the retrospective future-oriented report."<sup id="cite_ref-notarius_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-notarius-8">[8]</a></sup>

<h2>Short explation</h2>
<p>The Windows NT 3.1 kernel is incompatible with enhanced 486 processors. Specifically, it is incompatible with 486 processors providing the <code>CPUID</code> instructions. Kernel debugging works fine with the 486DX-33 that was originally installed in the machine, and with the older non-enhanced core in a write-through Am486DX4-NV8T without SMM.</p>
<p>If your goal is just toying around with NT 3.1 kernel debugging, you might want to use a processor that is compatible with Windows NT 3.1 out-of-the-box. If you are as curious as me, you might want to fix Windows NT. Keep reading in this case.</p>
<h2>The underlying issue</h2>
<p>The incompatibility is due to a bug in <code>KiSaveProcessorControlState</code> (and a similar bug in the counterpart <code>KiRestoreProcessorControlState</code>), which is called from three locations inside NTOSKRNL.EXE:</p>
<ol>
<li>When an exception is reflected to the kernel debugger using <code>KdpTrap</code> (If I use Ctrl-C to break into the kernel debugger, a breakpoint exception is raised from the break-in polling functionality in the timer tick interrupt)</li>
<li>When <code>KeBugCheckEx</code> is called (i.e. the "blue screen")</li>
<li>When <code>KiSaveProcessorState</code> is invoked. This appears to never happen, as this function is neither exported nor called from inside NTOSKRNL if the control flow analysis by IDA in NTOSKRNL.EXE is exhaustive.</li>
</ol>
<p>This function is supposed to save the processor control registers into an extended <code>CONTEXT</code> structure. Its disassembly looks like this:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This function is supposed to save all control register (CR0, CR2, CR3, and CR4 on pentium and later processors), all debug registers (DR0-DR3, DR6, DR7) and various global protected mode settings (the address of the GDT, the address of the IDT, the selector of the active TSS and the selector of the LDT). To detect the processor type, it uses a value from the KPRCB (Kernel Processor Control Block). The KPRCB is part of the KPCR (Kernel Processor Control Region). The KPRCB for the boot processor (or the only processor on uniprocessor systems) is located at virtual address <code>FFDFF120</code>, which is hard-coded into this method. <a href="https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/windows/km/ntoskrnl/inc/ntos/i386_x/kprcb/index.htm" rel="noreferrer">Geoff Chappell</a> writes this about the relevant part of the KPRCB in NT 3.1:</p>
<pre><code>+018   CHAR CpuType;
+019   CHAR CpuID;
+01A   UShort CpuStep;
</code></pre>
<p>These members of the KPCRB are initialized by <code>KiSetProcessorType</code>, which identifies the relevant processors correctly (but be aware that it mistrusts processors that report a CPUID feature level above 3 and considers them as "generic non-CPUID capable 586 compatible processors". The byte at offset 18 is set to 4 for 486 processors, 5 for Pentium processors and 6 for Pentium Pro and Pentium II/III processors. The byte at offset 19 is a boolean flag that indicates whether the processor support CPUID and it behaves "reasonable".</p>
<p>A very attentive reader might already have noticed the bug: The CMP instruction uses the <em>word</em> at address <code>FFDFF138</code> (which is 18h bytes into the KPRCB), instead of the <em>byte</em> at that address. This means the byte at offset 19h in the KPRCB is considered part of the model number. If a processor supports CPUID, its model number is considered to be 256 bigger than it actually is. This means Windows NT 3.1 treats a CPUID capable 80-4-86 processor as 80-260-86 processor. And as 260 is way larger than 5 (Pentium), that processor better had CR4.</p>
<h2>The fix</h2>
<p>The fix is obvious once the bug is identified. The instruction <code>cmp     ds:word_FFDFF138, 5</code> only appears twice in NTOSKRNL.EXE, specifically in <code>KiSaveProcessorControlState</code> and <code>KiRestoreProcessorControlState</code>, and it needs to be patched to be a byte compare instead of a word compare. Use your favorite hex editor to patch <code>66 83 3D 38 F1 DF FF 05</code> to <code>90 80 3D 38 F1 DF FF 05</code>, two times. This fix applies both the NTOSKRNL.EXE from the original NT 3.1 Advanced Server distribution as well as NT 3.1 SP3.</p>

Print to stderr if it wasn't asked but the user should know about it." So outputting it to stdout should happen when it's asked via --help, and outputting it to stderr should happen when it's part of an error.

It's useful to stay quiet when the program is meant for conditions and failure is normal. For example: `test`/`[`, `false`, `grep` (when no matches are found), etc. Also when the program is meant as a sort of wrapper to other programs, like `ssh localhost false`, `script -qec false /dev/null`, `true | xargs false`, etc.</p><p>&gt; A message like "incorrect arguments, use --help" can itself go to stderr. Not --help itself though.</p><p>I don't agree that it's incorrect to save the user the step of calling --help, when it's obvious they need to see that info from an incorrect call. Once decided that including the --help message in an error is right, I don't think it's correct to include it in stdout when it's not expected.</p><p>This isn't an odd behavior either, including the --help message (or at least just the synopsis) in stderr on incorrect options is the behavior I'm seeing in utilities like GNU's `bash`, `grep`, and OpenBSD's `netcat`, for example.

Probably the most profitable use for this is for individual functions to override some callback.<p>But without even dynamic scope, you have no nice way of restoring the previous one, which could be one that some intermediate caller installed for itself.</p><p>It could be used to delay the definition of functions. Say that for whatever reason, we put a large number of functions into a file and don't need them all to be defined at once. There can be functions which, when invoked, define sets of functions.</p><p>A module could be written in which certain functions are intended to be clobbered by the user with its own implementation. A function which defines those functions to their original state would be useful to recover from a bad redefinition, without reloading that module.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wiki-body" data-view-component="true">
                <p>I cannot count the number of times I’ve heard, “This product is X, but open source.”</p>
<p>And I’ll admit it—I’ve done the same when describing Lago. When I’m not in the “startup pitch” mood, I default to, “We’re Stripe Billing, but open source”. Or my co-founder might say, “We’re like an open-source Chargebee.” Frankly, it gets the job done.</p>
<p>Of course, if that’s all there was to us, we would have failed by now. What we’ve learned is that open-source tools can’t rely on being an open-source alternative to an already successful business. A developer can’t just imitate a product, tag on an MIT license, and call it a day. As awesome as open source is, in a vacuum, it’s not enough to succeed.</p>
<p>To be clear, I’m talking about open-source projects that compete with popular paid solutions. Commercial open source, so to speak. Some community-driven, sponsored products—like <a href="https://react.dev/" rel="nofollow">React</a>, <a href="https://typeorm.io/" rel="nofollow">TypeORM</a>, or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">VSCode</a>—have different priorities. They are either bankrolled by a larger organization (e.g., Meta for React) or rely on donations to fund development (e.g., TypeORM). They aren’t businesses at heart.</p>
<p>But open-source companies, like us, need to be more than just an open-source alternative to succeed. They either need a concrete reason for why they are open source or have to surpass their competitors.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-profit-not-usage-is-a-measure-of-success"><a href="#profit-not-usage-is-a-measure-of-success">Profit, not usage, is a measure of success</a></h2>
<p>Excluding non-profit projects that are sponsored by donations or parent organizations, a typical open-source business needs profit to be the ultimate north star.</p>
<p>For some, this might be a tough pill to swallow. But a for-profit business exists for profit. Definitionally and practically. Profit is what allows the company to hire employees, grow, and sustain itself—it is quite literally what funds ongoing development. And there’s nothing wrong with that; the fact that businesses can be profitable while building free software is a great thing. It’s not that open-source companies aspire to gouge customers—but they do aspire to remain in business.</p>
<p>This is precisely what has enabled <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" rel="nofollow">MongoDB</a> to grow into one of the largest databases with over <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/company#:~:text=We%20have%204%2C600%2B%20people%20contributing%20to%20our%20success." rel="nofollow">4,600</a> employees. (Granted, MongoDB eventually switched to a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license" rel="nofollow">special SSPL license</a> to add specific restrictions on Cloud Providers from distributing a service without contributing to the project, which isn’t OSI approved, but is open-source practically).</p>
<p>But why make this point? Well, splitting the hair between profit and usage is important to measuring long-term success. If a project gets great adoption but cannot drive revenue, it will die. Some wishful thinking might argue that the community will take over, but there’s been little evidence to indicate this happens.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-how-open-source-does-not-winby-being-cheaper"><a href="#how-open-source-does-not-winby-being-cheaper">How open source does not win—by being cheaper</a></h2>
<p>Catering to the price-conscious is a losing battle.</p>
<p>Imagine a buddy who wants to create an open-source version of <a href="https://amplitude.com/" rel="nofollow">Amplitude</a>. She argues that Amplitude is pretty expensive, particularly prohibitive for some early-stage companies, and larger companies could save a fortune by using an open-source version.</p>
<p>In theory, sure. While this pitch might resonate with early-stage companies, those same price-conscious early-stage companies will either use an open-source version or a free tier. That is not enough to sustain the business. Building a cheaper alternative is typically a ticket to future bankruptcy.</p>
<p>What about larger companies? With some caveats, larger companies aren’t worried about going out of business because their Amplitude is too expensive. They might be price-conscious in terms of negotiating a contract in context of their budget, but most SaaS software is just a line item at the end of the day. What matters more is that the solution is (a) a good solution, (b) around for the long haul, and (c) easy to manage. And, unfortunately, deploying an open-source solution can be tricky to manage.</p>
<p>The caveat is if the solution is a massive cost on the overall budget, then a corporation may seek out a more price-friendly solution; there are plenty of companies that needed to kick Oracle when their database costs skyrocketed due to usage. But most open-source solutions aren’t replacing a top-three line item, and therefore price isn’t the north star deciding factor.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-how-open-source-winsby-solving-a-transparency-problem"><a href="#how-open-source-winsby-solving-a-transparency-problem">How open source wins—by solving a transparency problem</a></h2>
<p>A great case for an open-source solution is when a transparency problem is present. What is a transparency problem? It’s when a solution being closed source creates distrust between the client and vendor.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the previous example—open-source Amplitude. That product actually does exist, and it is winning: <a href="https://posthog.com/" rel="nofollow">PostHog</a>. Growing with Airbus, DHL, and Staples as clients, PostHog combines a few product SaaS solutions together and is open source. It’s actually super open source—even the blog source code and <a href="https://posthog.com/roadmap" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> is available publicly. We’ve modeled a lot of our open-source mantras after them.</p>
<p>PostHog is positioned as a better product than its competitors because analytics tools need to process sensitive client data such as IP addresses, names, session recordings, etc. In a world of increasing data regulations (e.g., GDPR and CCPA), it can be daunting for third parties to store that data. So PostHog provides an alternative—either (a) self-host an analytics solution yourself or (b) hire PostHog as a third party to do it, but with transparency into how that data is stored and how possibly migrating to self-hosted in the future would work.</p>
<p>This split is important. Even if the most privacy-conscious technique is to self-host the open-source solution (which often leads to no revenue for the developer), many companies will still opt for a hosted model. But they do so now with assurances of how the software works—line by line—and the process of migrating to a self-hosted model in the future if necessary. It’s not that open-source companies win by preventing the need for a third party; they win by allowing for the open audit of how it works.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are many early open-source solutions taking advantage of these selling points. <a href="https://www.medplum.com/" rel="nofollow">Medplum</a> is an open-source electronic health record platform competing with closed-source incumbents; being open-source gives users assurance of exactly what is and isn’t supported by the platform. <a href="https://supertokens.com/" rel="nofollow">SuperTokens</a> is an open-source alternative to authentication solutions like <a href="http://auth0.com/" rel="nofollow">Auth0</a>; logins deal with sensitive data including names, emails, and passwords, and by being open source, Supertokens is able to capture more trust. <a href="https://tableflow.com/" rel="nofollow">TableFlow</a> is an open-source alternative to CSV import platforms like <a href="https://flatfile.com/?" rel="nofollow">Flatfile</a>; once again, the imported data is sensitive.</p>
<p>One of the biggest ones is <a href="https://min.io/" rel="nofollow">Minio</a>, which is an open-source alternative to AWS S3 storage. Given that S3 often stores customer PII (either inadvertently via screenshots or actual structured JSON files), Minio is a great alternative to companies mindful of who has access to user data. Of course, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/privacy-features/#:~:text=We%20prohibit%2C%20and%20our%20systems,or%20to%20comply%20with%20law." rel="nofollow">AWS claims that AWS personnel</a> doesn’t have direct access to customer data, but by being closed-source, that statement is just a function of trust.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on. We could say the same about our <a href="https://www.getlago.com/blog/engineers-need-open-source-to-end-their-billing-nightmares" rel="nofollow">own story</a>; we deal with billing and product usage information, which is pretty high on the list of sensitive content. By being open source, we’re able to better build trust among our users.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-how-open-source-winsby-solving-an-extensibility-problem"><a href="#how-open-source-winsby-solving-an-extensibility-problem">How open source wins—by solving an extensibility problem</a></h2>
<p>One of the big benefits of open source is that it opens the development of niche features to the community. While the core product is typically maintained by a central engineering team, integrations or plugins are often built by community developers and then occasionally merged into the main branch. Conversely, closed-source solutions struggle with this because they rely on their engineering team</p>
<p>This is particularly advantageous for open-source companies building systems that require lots of connections with other libraries, frameworks, or applications. For instance, Airbyte, an open-source ELT platform, blew up because of community-driven additions to its connectors. The same could be said about Elastic, an even bigger originally open-source company that hosts a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/integrations/data-integrations" rel="nofollow">bastion of data integrations</a>.</p>
<p>One of the founders I’ve met is Advait Ruia of Supertokens. For them, extensibility was a core part of their value proposition, as their community members are able to build integrations with uncommon authentication providers, benefiting everyone.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-how-open-source-winsby-being-better"><a href="#how-open-source-winsby-being-better">How open source wins—by being better</a></h2>
<p>Both of the above issues contribute to commercial open-source being a better product in the long run. But by tapping the community for feedback and help, open-source projects can also accelerate past closed-source solutions. PostHog—<a href="https://posthog.com/blog/15-million-series-b" rel="nofollow">who raised a $15M Series B</a>—started as an alternative to Amplitude and <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/" rel="nofollow">FullStory</a>, but has accelerated into a massive, encompassing solution that even competes with <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/" rel="nofollow">LaunchDarkly</a> and <a href="https://www.pendo.io/" rel="nofollow">Pendo</a>. This happened over the last few years, and they heavily credit their community as one of the core reasons.</p>
<p>Open-source projects—not just commercial open source—have served as a critical driver for the improvement of products for decades. However, some software is going to remain closed source. It’s just the nature of first-mover advantage. But when transparency and extensibility are an issue, an open-source successor becomes a real threat.</p>

<p>27th September 2023</p>
<p>This is a self-contained low-power computer with its own display and keyboard that you can program in uLisp, a version of the high-level language Lisp for microcontrollers:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/lispbadgepulse.jpg" alt="LispBadgePulse.jpg" width="560" height="370"></p>
<p><em>The Lisp Badge LE, a low-power computer programmed in Lisp<br>with a self-contained keyboard and display.</em></p>
<p>It's based on an AVR128DB48 which provides 128K bytes of flash memory, and 16K bytes of RAM. There's an integrated 45-key keyboard optimised for Lisp, using reverse-mounted buttons giving room for large key legends on the PCB.</p>
<p>It has a low-power monochrome display, readable in daylight without a backlight, so it's ideal for programming in the garden or on the beach! This gives 10 lines of 41 characters, or graphics with a resolution of 250x122 pixels, supported by several graphics commands.</p>
<p>You can use it to run programs that interface to components such as LEDs and push-buttons via the I/O pins, read the analogue inputs, and operate external devices via the I2C and SPI interfaces.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A few years ago I designed the <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2AEE">Lisp Badge</a>, a self-contained computer with its own display and keyboard, based on an ATmega1284, that you could program in Lisp. Since then I've been thinking about how I could improve it, and made a list of features I'd like to add.</p>
<p>On the one hand I wanted it to have a better keyboard, and be low power, powered from a button cell, with an eInk display that you could see in daylight. On the other hand I wanted it to have a colour TFT graphics display, and use a fast 32-bit ARM processor, with support for floating-point arithmetic.</p>
<p>I soon realised that these requirements are incompatible in a single design, and so set about designing two different Lisp Badges to meet the two sets of requirements. This Lisp Badge LE (low energy) is the first of those designs, and has the following new features:</p>
<h4>Processor and memory</h4>
<p>It’s based on an AVR128DB48 (or AVR128DA48) running at 24MHz, and provides 2800 Lisp objects, about the same as the original Lisp Badge. You can save the entire workspace to flash.</p>
<h4>Current consumption</h4>
<p>The Lisp Badge LE draws only 6mA from its CR2032 button cell, and so should have a life of about 40 hours. There’s a physical on/off switch too for long periods of inactivity.</p>
<h4>Lisp language</h4>
<p>The Lisp Badge LE runs the AVR version of uLisp which provides 16-bit integer arithmetic, arbitrary length symbols and strings, lists, multi-dimensional arrays, Arduino interface functions, debugging features, and built-in documentation.</p>
<h4>Display</h4>
<p>The display is a low-power monochrome graphics display&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup> which I explored in an earlier article; see <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?3YB0">Monochrome Low-Power Display Library</a>. It has&nbsp;a resolution of 250x122 pixels, and a text resolution of 10 lines of 41 characters per line. It supports reading back from the display, which makes it possible to support a full range of graphics functions, including plotting points,&nbsp;drawing lines, drawing outline and filled rectangles circles or triangles, and plotting characters and text at normal size or enlarged by any integer scale factor.</p>
<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>The keyboard takes advantage of push buttons that mount on the reverse of the board, with the button caps protruding through holes in the PCB. This makes it much easier to use than on the original Lisp Badge because it's easier to press the keys, and there's space for larger key legends. The push buttons are available from Adafruit&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>. or The Pi Hut in the UK&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It uses the same&nbsp;45-key layout as the original Lisp badge, with upper and lower-case characters, digits, and the symbols required by uLisp. However, it now provides an addition&nbsp;<strong>META</strong>&nbsp;modifier key in addition to <strong>SHIFT</strong>, allowing you to enter characters that don't have a dedicated key on the keyboard.</p>
<h4>Peripherals</h4>
<p>There’s a large piezo speaker that supports playing notes, and a reverse-mounting LED that shines through a hole on the front of the board.</p>
<p>Here's the full specification:</p>
<div>
<h3>Lisp Badge – Specification</h3>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> 107mm x 61mm (4.2" x 2.4").</p>
<p><strong>Display</strong>: 41 characters x 10 lines, or 250 x 122 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong>&nbsp;Integrated 45-key keyboard providing upper and lower-case characters, digits, and the symbols required by uLisp.</p>
<p>The <strong>META</strong> key pressed in conjunction with another key gives access to the following characters not available from the main keyboard:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>META +</strong></td>
<td>A</td>
<td>C</td>
<td>D</td>
<td>E</td>
<td>P</td>
<td>Q</td>
<td>T</td>
<td>U</td>
<td>V</td>
<td>&lt;</td>
<td>&gt;</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Character</strong></td>
<td>&amp;</td>
<td>:</td>
<td>$</td>
<td>!</td>
<td>%</td>
<td>?</td>
<td>@</td>
<td>^</td>
<td>|</td>
<td>{</td>
<td>}</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Memory available</strong>: 2800 Lisp cells (11200 bytes).</p>
<p><strong>Flash</strong>: 16384 bytes of flash are reserved for use to save the Lisp workspace using <strong>save-image</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Processor:</strong> AVR128DB48</p>
<p><strong>Clock speed:</strong> 24 MHz.</p>
<p><strong>Current consumption:</strong> Approx. 6 mA. A CR2032 cell has a typical capacity of 225 mAh, so this should give a life of about 40 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Types supported</strong>: list, symbol, integer, character, string, stream, and array.</p>
<p>An integer is a sequence of digits, optionally prefixed with "+" or "-". Integers can be between -32768 and 32767. You can enter numbers in hexadecimal, octal, or binary with the notations #x2A, #o52, or #b101010, all of which represent 42.</p>
<p>User-defined symbol names can have arbitrary names. Any sequence that isn't an integer can be used as a symbol; so, for example, 12a is a valid symbol.</p>
<p>There is one namespace for functions and variables; in other words, you cannot use the same name for a function and a variable.</p>
<p>Includes a mark and sweep garbage collector. Garbage collection takes 5 msec.</p>
<h4><strong>Language</strong></h4>
<p>uLisp, a subset of Common Lisp, with the following 196 Lisp functions and special forms:</p>
<p><strong>* + - / /= 1+ 1- &lt; &lt;= = &gt; &gt;= ? abs analogread analogreadresolution analogreference analogwrite and append apply apropos apropos-list aref array-dimensions arrayp ash assoc atom bit boundp break caaar caadr caar cadar caddr cadr car case cdaar cdadr cdar cddar cdddr cddr cdr char char-code characterp check-key closure cls code-char concatenate cond cons consp dacreference decf defcode defun defvar delay digitalread digitalwrite documentation dolist dotimes draw-char draw-circle draw-line draw-pixel draw-rect&nbsp;</strong><strong>draw-triangle&nbsp;</strong><strong>edit eq equal error eval evenp fill-circle fill-rect fill-screen&nbsp;</strong><strong>fill-triangle</strong><strong>&nbsp;first for-millis format funcall gc get-pixel globals glyph-pixel if ignore-errors incf integerp keyboard keywordp lambda length let let* list list-library listp load-image locals logand logbitp logior lognot logxor loop make-array makunbound mapc mapcan mapcar max member millis min minusp mod not note nothing nth null numberp oddp or pinmode plot plot3d plusp pop pprint pprintall prin1 prin1-to-string princ princ-to-string print progn push quote random read read-byte read-from-string read-line register require rest restart-i2c return reverse room save-image search second set set-cursor setf setq sleep sort streamp string string&lt; string= string&gt; stringp subseq symbolp t terpri third time trace truncate unless untrace unwind-protect when with-i2c with-output-to-string with-sd-card with-serial with-spi write-byte write-line write-string zerop</strong></p>
<p>It also provides 37 keywords such as <strong>:input</strong>, <strong>:output</strong>, and <strong>:led-builtin</strong>, as a convenient way of entering Arduino constants.</p>
<p>For a full definition see <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?3L" target="_blank">uLisp Language Reference</a>.</p>
<h4>Graphics extensions</h4>
<p>The Lisp Badge LE includes a graphics library to allow you to do plotting on the display; for details see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?31GT" target="_blank">Graphics extensions</a>. These work using a coordinate system with the origin at top left:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/graphicsdisplaycoords5.gif" alt="GraphicsDisplayCoords5.gif" width="265" height="135"></p><p>
The following example shows a plot of the fractal Dragon Curve; for the program see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?4JLZ" target="_blank">Dragon curve</a>:
</p><p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/lispbadgeledragon.jpg" alt="LispBadgeLEDragon.jpg" width="560" height="370"></p>
<p><em>A fractal Dragon Curve drawn in Lisp on the Lisp Badge LE using the graphics extensions.</em></p>
<h4>Assembler</h4>
<p>The Lisp Badge LE also includes an AVR assembler&nbsp;which allows you to generate and run machine-code functions, written in AVR mnemonics, using an assembler written in Lisp. For details see <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?3IUO">AVR assembler overview</a>.</p>
<p>The language includes several extensions specifically for the Lisp Badge, including <strong>plot</strong> and <strong>plot3d</strong>, for plotting graphs and 3d functions, and <strong>keyboard</strong> and <strong>check-key</strong> for reading the keyboard in real time. For details see <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?4JJ6" target="_blank">Lisp Badge LE extensions</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Interfaces</strong></h4>
<p>These interfaces are brought to headers at the edge of the Lisp Badge LE board. The numbers in brackets refer to Arduino pin numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eight analogue input pins using <strong>analogread</strong>: PD0 to PD7 (22 to 29).</li>
<li>VCC, GND, and UPDI.</li>
<li>Two analogue outputs using <strong>analogwrite</strong>:&nbsp;MOSI0 (4) and MISO0 (5).</li>
<li>Digital input and output using <strong>pinmode</strong>, <strong>digitalread</strong>, and <strong>digitalwrite</strong>:&nbsp;TX0 (0), RX0 (1), SCL0 (2), SDA0 (3), MOSI0 (4), MISO0 (5), SCK0 (6),&nbsp;and PD0 to PD7 (22 to 29)</li>
<li>I2C interface using <strong>with-i2c</strong> and <strong>restart-i2c</strong>: SCL0 (2) and SDA0 (3), plus VCC and GND.</li>
<li>SPI interface using <strong>with-spi</strong>: MOSI0 (4), MISO0 (5), and SCK0 (6), plus VCC and GND.</li>
<li>Serial interface (FTDI) using&nbsp;<strong>with-serial</strong>: TX0 (0) and RX0 (1), plus DTR, VCC, and GND.</li>
</ul>
<p>Analogue output PB4 (12) is connected to a piezo speaker, which can use&nbsp;<strong>analogwrite</strong> or<strong> note.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>SHIFT</strong> (33) and <strong>META</strong> (11) keys can be used as digital inputs, read with <strong>digitalread</strong> and referenced as <strong>:shift-key</strong> and <strong>:meta-key</strong>.</p>
<p>PA7 (7) is connected to an LED on the front panel, referenced as <strong>:led-builtin</strong>. You can turn it on and off with <strong>digitalwrite</strong>, or vary its brightness with <strong>analogwrite</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h3>Entering programs</h3>
<p>You can enter commands and programs by typing them at the keyboard, and pressing ENTER. A keyboard buffer is provided that buffers a full screen of text, and you can use the DEL key to delete characters and correct typing mistakes. The line editor&nbsp;includes parenthesis matching which&nbsp;automatically highlights matching brackets in inverse video as you type in a program. This makes it much easier to enter a program correctly, and is especially helpful in telling you how many closing brackets to type at the end of defining a function.</p>
<p>For example, the following program pulsates the built-in LED slowly on and off:</p>
<pre>(defun pulse (&amp;optional (up t))
  (dotimes (x 256)
    (analogwrite :led-builtin (if up x (- 255 x)))
    (delay 8))
  (pulse (not up)))</pre>
<p>It's shown nicely formatted here for clarity, but you can type it in as one continuous line, only pressing ENTER at the end. To run the program type:</p>
<pre>(pulse)</pre>
<h4>Connecting to a computer</h4>
<p>You can connect the Lisp Badge to a computer by plugging a 3.3V FTDI USB-to-serial converter onto the FTDI connector on the top right of the Lisp Badge, and then connecting this to the computer using a USB cable. You can then use the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to enter and edit programs as described in <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?19XT">Using uLisp</a>.</p>
<p>I used the 3.3V FTDI Basic Breakout from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>. When using it with the Lisp Badge it powers the Lisp Badge, and so the battery should be left switched off.</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's the main part of the circuit:</p>

<p><em>Circuit of the Lisp Badge, based on an AVR128DB48 microcontroller.</em></p>
<p>The keyboard arranges the keys in a matrix of four rows and 11 columns:</p>

<h4>► Parts list</h4>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>I created a PCB in Eagle, and ordered a set of boards from <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/" target="_blank">PCBWay</a>. I chose white PCBs to contrast with the black buttons. The board is the same width as the original Lisp Badge, but slightly taller to accomodate the larger display.</p>
<p>After a bit of experimentation I chose a board thickness of 1.2mm. With the standard 1.6mm thick PCB material the reverse-mounted buttons didn't protrude far enough through the holes, and 0.8mm made the boards too bendy, but 1.2mm was ideal.</p>
<p>The components, apart from the display, are mounted on the back of the board:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/lispbadgeleback.jpg" alt="LispBadgeLEBack.jpg" width="560" height="370"></p>
<p><em>The reverse side of the Lisp Badge printed circuit board.</em></p>
<p>The push buttons are mounted at a 15° angle, which makes it possible to pack them closer together. I've taken advantage of the fact that the terminals on each side of the push buttons are connected together to link the rows and columns of the key matrix across the board, and simplify the PCB track layout. A consequence of this is that if one push button is omitted, or has a faulty connection, all the other buttons to its left or below it across the keyboard may not work. Understanding this should help you track down any faulty soldering.</p>
<p>The PCB uses 0805&nbsp;resistors and capacitors. The LED is a reverse-mounting 1206 LED <sup id="cite_ref5"><a href="#cite_note5">[5]</a></sup> to make the front of the board flush.</p>
<p>The board will accommodate either a 16 x 16mm SMD piezo speaker <sup id="cite_ref6"><a href="#cite_note6">[6]</a></sup>, or a 11 x 9mm SMD piezo speaker&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref7"><a href="#cite_note7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The battery holder is an SMD 20mm coin cell holder available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref8"><a href="#cite_note8">[8]</a></sup>, or from Proto-PIC in the UK&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref9"><a href="#cite_note9">[9]</a></sup>. Note that on many button cells the negative terminal is concave, and doesn't make good contact with the pad on the PCB. I therefore recommend melting some solder on the circular PCB contact to provide extra thickness before mounting the battery holder.</p>
<p>The display is held in place with a double-sided self-adhesive foam pad, and then soldered to the board with the seven header pins. There are also four mounting holes if you prefer to use screw mounting. I recommend leaving the display uninstalled until you have tested the rest of the board, because it's likely to be sensitive to overheating.</p>
<p>I used a Youyue 858D+ hot air gun at 275°C to solder the small SMD components and push buttons, and then used a conventional soldering iron for the display, battery holder, switch, piezo speaker, and connectors.</p>
<p>The PCB has space for a 5 x 3.2mm 32.768kHz crystal and its capacitors which you could use with the RTC peripheral to provide accurate timekeeping. However, I didn't fit it on the prototype as the internal clock is already pretty accurate.</p>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>The Lisp Badge program is based on the code for the AVR version of uLisp Version 4.4 (see <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?1AA0" target="_blank">Download uLisp</a>), with the addition of routines to handle the display and keyboard, and the plot extensions.</p>
<h4>Display</h4>
<p>The display routine is based on the routine I developed for the display in my project <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?3YB0">Monochrome Low-Power Display Library</a>. The display driver is the ST7302&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref10"><a href="#cite_note10">[10]</a></sup>, and it shares some similarities with the ST7735 used for colour TFT displays. Here's the display layout:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/graphicdisplaylayout6.gif" alt="GraphicDisplayLayout3.gif" width="436" height="198"></p>
<p>The display is divided into 11 lines, each of which is 12 pixels high, and 125 columns, each of which is 2 pixels wide. Note that because 122 isn't an exact multiple of 12, only part of the last line actually appears on the display.</p>
<p>Unlike on the colour TFT displays each pixel isn't individually addressable; in fact, the minimum update is to write three bytes to the display, which defines the state of a block of 2x12 pixels corresponding to one column and one row. Fortunately the display supports reading back the display memory, so it's not necessary to maintain a copy of the display in RAM to do things like line drawing; instead, to set a single pixel we can read the 2x12 block, change one pixel, and write it back.</p>
<h4>Reading from the display</h4>
<p>The&nbsp;routine&nbsp;<strong>ReadBlock()</strong>&nbsp;reads a 12x2 pixel block from the display memory specified by&nbsp;the column, from 0 to 124, and the line, from 0 to 10:</p>
<pre>uint32_t ReadBlock (uint8_t column, uint8_t line) {
  uint32_t pix = 0;
  PORT_TOGGLE(1&lt;&lt;cs);
  Command2(CASET, 25+line, 25+line);
  Command2(RASET, column, column);
  Command(RAMRD);
  PORT_INPUT(1&lt;&lt;mosi);                     // mosi input
  for (uint8_t i=0; i&lt;25; i++) {
    PORT_TOGGLE(1&lt;&lt;sck);
    pix = pix&lt;&lt;1 | (PORT_IN&gt;&gt;mosi &amp; 1);
    PORT_TOGGLE(1&lt;&lt;sck);
  }
  PORT_OUTPUT(1&lt;&lt;mosi);                    // mosi output
  PORT_TOGGLE(1&lt;&lt;cs);
  return pix;
}</pre>
<p>When reading from display memory you have to do a dummy read, which is why the main loop is executed 25 times rather than 24 times.</p>
<p>The companion routine <strong>PlotBlock()</strong> writes back a 12x2 pixel block to the display memory:</p>
<pre>void PlotBlock (uint32_t block, uint8_t column, uint8_t line) {
  PORT_TOGGLE(1&lt;&lt;cs);
  Command2(CASET, 25+line, 25+line);
  Command2(RASET, column, column);
  Command(RAMWR); Data(block&gt;&gt;16); Data(block&gt;&gt;8); Data(block);
  PORT_TOGGLE(1&lt;&lt;cs);
}</pre>
<h4>Scrolling</h4>
<p>The display doesn't provide hardware scrolling in the vertical direction, so scrolling is done in software by calling <strong>ScrollDisplay()</strong>, which uses the <strong>ReadBlock()</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>PlotBlock()</strong> routines:</p>
<pre>void ScrollDisplay () {
  uint32_t block, block2;
  for (uint8_t x = 0; x &lt; Columns*3; x++) {
    block = ReadBlock(x, 0);
    for (uint8_t y = 1; y &lt; Lines; y++) {
      block2 = ReadBlock(x, y);
      if (block2 != block) {                   // Optimisation if already the same
        PlotBlock(block2, x, y-1);
        block = block2;
      }
    }
  }
  ClearLine(LastLine);
}</pre>
<p>The routine optimises the scrolling by only writing blocks when necessary if they have been changed by the scrolling.</p>
<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>The keyboard uses the AVR128DB48's Timer/Counter TCB3 to generate an interrupt at about 250Hz. Each call of the interrupt service routine takes the next column low in the keyboard matrix, and it then tests to see if any of the four row inputs has been pulled low by the pressing of a push button. If so, the button's position is looked up in the key table <strong>Keymap[]</strong> to translate it to the ASCII code of the key. This also takes into account the state of the SHIFT and META keys, which are connected to dedicated inputs.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;keyboard buffer buffers a full screen of text, so you can use the DEL key to delete characters and correct typing mistakes. The line editor includes parenthesis matching which automatically highlights matching brackets in inverse video as you type in a program.</p>
<h3>Installing a bootloader</h3>
<p>To program the Lisp Badge I recommend using Spence Konde's <a href="https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore" target="_blank">DxCore on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The first step is to install a bootloader using a UPDI programmer. I used a SerialUPDI programmer, based on a 3.3V FTDI USB-to-serial converter. Because the display is only tolerant of 3.3V you should power the Lisp Badge from 3.3V while programming, or do the programming before connecting the display to the board.</p>
<p>Choose the <strong>AVR DB-series (Optiboot)&nbsp;</strong>option under the&nbsp;<strong>DxCore</strong>&nbsp;heading on the&nbsp;<strong>Board</strong>&nbsp;option on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu. Check that the subsequent options are set as follows (leave other options at their defaults):</p>
<p><strong>Chip: "AVR128DB48"<br>Clock Speed: "24MHz internal"</strong><br> <strong>Bootloader Serial Port (Bootloader burn req'd): "USART0 (default pins): TX PA0, RX PA1"</strong></p>
<p>Set the <strong>Programmer</strong> option as appropriate for the UPDI programmer you are using. Then choose <strong>Burn Bootloader</strong>.</p>
<h3>Uploading the Lisp Badge code</h3>
<p>The next step is to install the Lisp Badge code via the serial connection, using the bootloader you have just installed. Plug a 3.3V FTDI USB-to-serial converter into the FTDI connector on the PCB. I used the SparkFun FTDI Basic Breakout&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref11"><a href="#cite_note11">[11]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Leave the <strong>DxCore</strong> options set as described above, and choose the USB port from the <strong>Port</strong> submenu. Then choose <strong>Upload</strong> from the <strong>Sketch</strong> menu to upload uLisp.</p>
<p>Note that this stage will fail if you didn't set the <strong>Bootloader Serial Port</strong> correctly in the previous step, and you'll need to go back and repeat that step with the correct setting.</p>
<p>You should then be able to choose <strong>Serial Monitor</strong> from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu in the Arduino IDE, and type Lisp commands at the uLisp prompt.</p>

<p><em>War Thunder</em> has leaked restricted military documents&nbsp;<em><span><strong>AGAIN</strong></span></em> for the third time in a month. This time it’s the AH-64D Apache Longbow attack helicoptor.</p>
<p>User BarteG98PL posted the “fully unclassified” technical manual for the Apache Longbow on the&nbsp;<em>War Thunder</em> forums.</p><!--?php if(! rcp_user_has_active_membership()): ?-->

<p><em>War Thunder</em> players are increasingly testing the waters for what “restricted information” means and are posting “unclassified” documents that still have some big caveats.</p>
<p>In the case of the <a href="https://nichegamer.com/war-thunder-player-leaks-restricted-military-documents-again/">Eurofighter Typhoon DA7</a>, the documents were readily available for most consumers but are embargoed to non-NATO countries. The <a href="https://twitter.com/7thRanger/status/1701274530168045751">F-117 Nighthawk</a> was a similar case of documents acquired legally but are restricted under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>The case for the AH-64D Apache Longbow is a bit stronger though, as the leaked document allegedly included a big <em>“<a href="https://forum.warthunder.com/t/technical-manual-for-ah-64d-longbow-apache/27350/4">DOD AND DOD CONTRACTORS ONLY</a>”&nbsp;</em>warning all over it.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23892781/openai-chatgpt-live-web-results-browse-with-bing">https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23892781/openai-chatgpt-live-web-results-browse-with-bing</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37681047">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>OpenAI <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1707077710047216095?s=20">posted today</a> that ChatGPT can once more trawl the web for current information, offering answers taken directly from “current and authoritative” sources, which it cites in its responses. The feature, called Browse with Bing, is only open to those with <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1707077713490854127?s=20">Plus and Enterprise subscriptions</a> for now, but the company says it will roll it out “to all users soon.”</p><p>Microsoft’s Bing Chat on Windows, in the Edge browser, and in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/24/23805493/bing-ai-chat-google-chrome-safari">third-party browser plugins</a> could already return live information from the web, and so can Google’s Bard in <a href="https://support.google.com/bard/answer/13275745?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid#:~:text=A%20supported%20browser%3A%20Chrome%2C%20Safari,Firefox%2C%20Opera%2C%20or%20Edgium.">Chrome and other browsers</a>. Both also offer links when searching, as ChatGPT’s Browse with Bing feature now does. Meta just announced at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23889627/meta-connect-quest-3-developer-conference-announcements-news">Meta Connect</a> that it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23891128/meta-ai-assistant-characters-whatsapp-instagram-connect">also use Bing to power real-time web results</a> in the Meta AI Assistant it’s adding to WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger.</p><p>It’s a little confusing to get ChatGPT to search the web for you. The company provides instructions for the browser version, but I didn’t find the same for the iOS app. I figured it out, though. Assuming you have a subscription, it’s: three dots menu &gt; Settings &gt; New Features &gt; Browse with Bing. Then, start a new chat, tap GPT-4, and “Browse with Bing.” Then your searches should return information from current websites.</p><p>It’s a little slow, but it works.

            <p>Engineers at MIT and in China are aiming to turn seawater into drinking water with a completely passive device that is inspired by the ocean, and powered by the sun.</p>

<p>In a paper appearing today in the journal <em>Joule,</em> the team outlines the design for a new solar desalination system that takes in saltwater and heats it with natural sunlight.</p>

<p>The configuration of the device allows water to circulate in swirling eddies, in a manner similar to the much larger “thermohaline” circulation of the ocean. This circulation, combined with the sun’s heat, drives water to evaporate, leaving salt behind. The resulting water vapor can then be condensed and collected as pure, drinkable water. In the meantime, the leftover salt continues to circulate through and out of the device, rather than accumulating and clogging the system.</p>

<p>The new system has a higher water-production rate and a higher salt-rejection rate than all other passive solar desalination concepts currently being tested.</p>

<p>The researchers estimate that if the system is scaled up to the size of a small suitcase, it could produce about 4 to 6 liters of drinking water per hour and last several years before requiring replacement parts. At this scale and performance, the system could produce drinking water at a rate and price that is cheaper than tap water.</p>

<p>“For the first time, it is possible for water, produced by sunlight, to be even cheaper than tap water,” says Lenan Zhang, a research scientist in MIT’s Device Research Laboratory.</p>

<p>The team envisions a scaled-up device could passively produce enough drinking water to meet the daily requirements of a small family. The system could also supply off-grid, coastal communities where seawater is easily accessible.</p>

<p>Zhang’s study co-authors include MIT graduate student Yang Zhong and Evelyn Wang, the Ford Professor of Engineering, along with Jintong Gao, Jinfang You, Zhanyu Ye, Ruzhu Wang, and Zhenyuan Xu of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China.</p>

<p><strong>A powerful convection</strong></p>

<p>The team’s new system improves on their <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/passive-solar-powered-water-desalination-0207" target="_blank">previous design</a> — a similar concept of multiple layers, called stages. Each stage contained an evaporator and a condenser that used heat from the sun to passively separate salt from incoming water. That design, which the team tested on the roof of an MIT building, efficiently converted the sun’s energy to evaporate water, which was then condensed into drinkable water. But the salt that was left over quickly accumulated as crystals that clogged the system after a few days. In a real-world setting, a user would have to place stages on a frequent basis, which would significantly increase the system’s overall cost.</p>

<p>In a follow-up effort, they <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/solar-desalination-system-inexpensive-0214" target="_blank">devised a solution</a> with a similar layered configuration, this time with an added feature that helped to circulate the incoming water as well as any leftover salt. While this design prevented salt from settling and accumulating on the device, it desalinated water at a relatively low rate.</p>

<p>In the latest iteration, the team believes it has landed on a design that achieves both a high water-production rate, and high salt rejection, meaning that the system can quickly and reliably produce drinking water for an extended period. The key to their new design is a combination of their two previous concepts: a multistage system of evaporators and condensers, that is also configured to boost the circulation of water — and salt — within each stage.</p>

<p>“We introduce now an even more powerful convection, that is similar to what we typically see in the ocean, at kilometer-long scales,” Xu says.</p>

<p>The small circulations generated in the team’s new system is similar to the “thermohaline” convection in the ocean — a phenomenon that drives the movement of water around the world, based on differences in sea temperature (“thermo”) and salinity (“haline”).</p>

<p>“When seawater is exposed to air, sunlight drives water to evaporate. Once water leaves the surface, salt remains. And the higher the salt concentration, the denser the liquid, and this heavier water wants to flow downward,” Zhang explains. “By mimicking this kilometer-wide phenomena in small box, we can take advantage of this feature to reject salt.”</p>

<p><strong>Tapping out</strong></p>

<p>The heart of the team’s new design is a single stage that resembles a thin box, topped with a dark material that efficiently absorbs the heat of the sun. Inside, the box is separated into a top and bottom section. Water can flow through the top half, where the ceiling is lined with an evaporator layer that uses the sun’s heat to warm up and evaporate any water in direct contact. The water vapor is then funneled to the bottom half of the box, where a condensing layer air-cools the vapor into salt-free, drinkable liquid. The researchers set the entire box at a tilt within a larger, empty vessel, then attached a tube from the top half of the box down through the bottom of the vessel, and floated the vessel in saltwater.</p>

<p>In this configuration, water can naturally push up through the tube and into the box, where the tilt of the box, combined with the thermal energy from the sun, induces the water to swirl as it flows through. The small eddies help to bring water in contact with the upper evaporating layer while keeping salt circulating, rather than settling and clogging.</p>

<p>The team built several prototypes, with one, three, and 10 stages, and tested their performance in water of varying salinity, including natural seawater and water that was seven times saltier.</p>

<p>From these tests, the researchers calculated that if each stage were scaled up to a square meter, it would produce up to 5 liters of drinking water per hour, and that the system could desalinate water without accumulating salt for several years. Given this extended lifetime, and the fact that the system is entirely passive, requiring no electricity to run, the team estimates that the overall cost of running the system would be cheaper than what it costs to produce tap water in the United States.</p>

<p>“We show that this device is capable of achieving a long lifetime,” Zhong says. “That means that, for the first time, it is possible for drinking water produced by sunlight to be cheaper than tap water. This opens up the possibility for solar desalination to address real-world problems.”</p>

<p>“This is a very innovative approach that effectively mitigates key challenges in the field of desalination,” says Guihua Yu, who develops sustainable water and energy storage systems at the University of Texas at Austin, and was not involved in the research. “The design is particularly beneficial for regions struggling with high-salinity water. Its modular design makes it highly suitable for household water production, allowing for scalability and adaptability to meet individual needs.”</p>

<p>Funding for the research at Shanghai Jiao Tong University was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>But we wanted to make the technology available more broadly. This is where Llama 2 came in.</p></div><div><p>As our history shows, we believe deeply in the power of the open source community. We believe that state-of-the-art AI technology is safer and better aligned when it’s open and accessible to everyone.</p><p>Additionally, where there are areas of high entropy, it’s advantageous to build bridges and leverage the innovation that inevitably arises. This was true for PyTorch, where breakthroughs like Stable Diffusion, GPT 3, and GPT 4 continually disrupted the world of AI, and it’s true for Llama as well. For us at Meta, we can summarize the value back along three axes:</p><p><u>Research:</u> New techniques, performance optimizations, tools, and evaluation methods, including work on safety, provide Meta leverage from the research community to more quickly incorporate learnings. Many of these communities are also nascent, and collaborating in the open makes it much easier to make progress;</p><p><u>Enterprise and commercialization:</u> The more enterprises and startups build on our technology, the more we can learn about use cases, safe model deployment, and potential opportunities; and</p><p><u>Developer ecosystem:</u> LLMs have fundamentally changed AI development, and new tools and approaches are emerging daily for manipulating, managing, and evaluating models. Having a lingua franca to the community enables us to quickly leverage these technologies, accelerating our internal stack.</p><p>But this isn’t new for Meta. Just as with <a href="http://pytorch.org/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>PyTorch</u></a> and dozens of other publicly released or open source projects, this philosophy is deeply ingrained in our company’s DNA.</p></div><div><p>One thing is for certain: The generative AI space moves rapidly, and we’re all learning together about the capabilities and applications of this technology. Meta remains committed to an open approach for today’s AI. Here are a few of the areas of focus for us as we continue on this journey together:</p><p><u>Multimodal:</u> Just as the world isn’t made up entirely of text, AI can embrace new modalities to enable even more immersive generative experiences;</p><p><u>Safety and responsibility:</u> Generative AI has revitalized the world of responsible AI. We will place even greater emphasis on safety and responsibility, developing new tools, building partnerships, and utilizing Llama as a vehicle for our community to continue to learn about how to build safely and responsibly; and</p><p><u>A focus on community:</u> Much like PyTorch, we see this as a community of developers that have a voice, and we want to give them agency and a vehicle to further their innovation. We aim to provide new ways for the community to showcase work, contribute, and tell their stories.</p></div><div><p>During the <a href="https://www.metaconnect.com/en/home" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Meta Connect</u></a> keynote, we talked a lot about our Llama models and the future of open access.

<p dir="auto">Open exchange format for user data between Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-motivation" dir="auto"><a href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">The DAWproject format provides a (vendor-agnostic) way of transferring user data between different music applications (DAWs).</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, there is no file-format which is purpose-built for this task.
Standard MIDI files can represent note data, but it is often a lower-level representation (no ramps) of data than what the DAW uses internally, which forces consolidation on export. AAF only covers audio and doesn't have any concept of musical-time, which limits it to post-audio workflows . Most plug-ins do allow you to save presets to a shared location, but this has to be done for each instance. What most users end up doing is just exporting audio as stems.</p>
<p dir="auto">The aim of this project is to export all translatable project data (audio/note/automation/plug-in) along with the structure surrounding it into a single DAWproject file.</p>
<p dir="auto">The table below aims to explain the scope format from a music-production perspective and how it compares to other methods of data transfer.</p>

<p>Earthworms are important drivers of global food production, contributing to approximately 6.5% of grain yield and 2.3% of legumes produced worldwide each year, according to new work published by Colorado State University scientists in the journal <i>Nature Communications. </i>

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>These new estimates from a trio of CSU researchers mean <a href="https://phys.org/tags/earthworms/" rel="tag">earthworms</a> may account for as much as 140 million metric tons of food produced annually—roughly comparative to the amount of cereal grains (rice, wheat, rye, oats, barley, maize and millet) grown annually by Russia, the world's fourth-largest producer.
</p><p>"This is the first effort that I'm aware of that's trying to take one piece of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/soil+biodiversity/" rel="tag">soil biodiversity</a> and say, 'OK, this is the value of it; this is what it's giving us on a global scale,'" said Steven Fonte, associate professor of agroecosystem ecology in the Department of Soil and Crop Sciences at CSU, and the study's lead author.
</p><p>Earthworms help establish healthy soils by supporting <a href="https://phys.org/tags/plant+growth/" rel="tag">plant growth</a> in multiple ways—building good soil structure, assisting in water capture and aiding in the beneficial churn of organic matter that makes nutrients more available to plants. Other research has also shown that earthworms can facilitate the production of plant-growth-promoting hormones and help plants protect themselves against common soil pathogens. Some estimates have indicated earthworms can increase overall plant productivity by about 25%.
</p><p>Fonte and his colleagues—Nathan Mueller, an associate professor in the Department of Ecosystem Science and Sustainability, and Marian Hsieh, a doctoral student in the same department—estimated the contribution of earthworms to global food production by overlaying and analyzing maps of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/earthworm/" rel="tag">earthworm</a> abundance, soil properties, fertilize rate and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/crop+yields/" rel="tag">crop yields</a>.
</p><p>The analysis indicated that earthworms had a more significant impact on <a href="https://phys.org/tags/grain+production/" rel="tag">grain production</a> in the global south—notably, 10% of grain yield in Sub-Saharan Africa and 8% in Latin America and the Caribbean.
</p><p>It's likely the earthworms contributed more in those areas, Fonte said, because farmers there tend to have less access to fertilizer and pesticides. Instead, they rely more on earthworm-rich organic matter like manure and crop residues, which help stimulate the beneficial effect earthworms have on plants.


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>"Earthworms are contributing a lot in these areas where we have fewer chemical inputs," Fonte said.
</p><p>For this study, Fonte and his colleagues analyzed earthworm impacts on four grain crops: rice, maize, wheat and barley; the group examined a set of legumes that included soybeans, peas, chickpeas, lentils and alfalfa, among others.

<p>Fonte said he thinks soil biodiversity has historically been undervalued, and that he hopes this work will bring more attention to how healthy soils can have positive, tangible impacts on crops.
</p><p>"If we manage our soils in a more sustainable way, we can better harness or leverage this biodiversity and produce more sustainable agroecosystems," Fonte said. "This work highlights that potential."
</p><p>Fonte noted that other recent research has shown that soils contain as much as half the world's biodiversity, a significant increase from previous estimates of approximately 25%. "Soils are just such an intricate habitat," he said. "But there's really been very few efforts to understand what that biodiversity means to our global crop yields."
</p><p>Diana Wall, a professor in the Department of Biology and the science chair of the Global Soil Biodiversity Initiative, was excited by the data published in the <i>Nature Communications</i> paper. "This, to me, is a really clever, very data-rich paper," Wall said. "It's really impressive."
</p><p>This information could also have implications in future efforts to mitigate drought and erosion, Fonte said. For example, he said, earthworms can improve soil porosity, aiding in the beneficial capture and retention of water.
</p><p>Fonte cautioned that he and his colleagues are not advocating for anyone to transplant earthworms into places they do not already exist. Rather, he hopes this work shows how improved management of soil biology in places where earthworms already call home has the potential to enhance agricultural productivity and reduce our reliance on agrochemicals.
</p><p>This study marks an important first step, Fonte said, but he hopes that researchers will continue to dig into the positive benefits that other soil organisms have on crops.
</p><p>"Soils are still this huge, big black box that we don't fully understand," Fonte said. "This work helps show that there's a lot of opportunity that we're just kind of ignoring."
</p><p>He added, "There are probably other <a href="https://phys.org/tags/soil/" rel="tag">soil</a> organisms that are even more important, especially microbial communities."

		<p>I encountered yet another discussion about <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/">OpenBSD PF</a> versus <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/firewalls/">FreeBSD PF</a>. For those who are new to the discussion: OpenBSD developers created PF in 2001, and it rapidly improved to become the most approachable open source packet filter. FreeBSD ported PF over to its kernel in 2004, with occasional updates since. Today a whole bunch of folks who don’t program echo cultish wisdom that one or the other version of PF has fallen behind, not kept up on improvements, or otherwise betrayed their community. My subtler comments have been misinterpreted, so let’s try this.</p>
<p>These claims are garbage.</p>
<p>First, and most importantly: <a href="https://freshbsd.org/freebsd/src/branch/main?q=pf+openbsd">FreeBSD PF developers work with OpenBSD devs all the time</a>, and <a href="https://freshbsd.org/openbsd/src/branch/HEAD?q=pf+freebsd">OpenBSD PF developers pull stuff from FreeBSD</a><span id="easy-footnote-1-23127"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-23127" title="Commit history links courtesy of <a href=&quot;https://cathode.church/@meena/111133478906743121&quot;>Mina</a>. Yes, I could have looked it up, but she <em>thought</em> to do so."><sup>1</sup></a></span>. You get a lot of noise about certain people being jerks about the other project–and both projects absolutely have jerks. (And yes, anyone who has read my books knows that I am a cross-platform jerk.) But for the most part, folks want to work together.</p>
<p>PF is absolutely an OpenBSD creation, though, so why isn’t the OpenBSD version the Single Source of Truth? Why doesn’t FreeBSD just consider OpenBSD a vendor and pull that code in? Because the OpenBSD and FreeBSD kernels are wholly different.</p>
<p>Back when I wrote <a href="https://mwl.io/nonfiction/nope">Absolute BSD</a>, I could realistically write a single book that would basically apply to the three major open source BSDs. Yes, the various projects objected to being lumped together, but if you knew any one of them you could stumble through the others. This is no longer true. FreeBSD’s kernel uses a wholly different locking model than OpenBSD. OpenBSD’s memory protections have no equivalent in FreeBSD. These are not things you can manage with a shim layer or kernel ABI. These are big, complicated, intrusive differences. You can’t tar up one version and dump it in the other’s kernel. It won’t work. If you do a hack job of making it work, it will perform badly.</p>
<p>Yes, you can find “proof” that one PF or the other is faster under particular workloads on specific hardware. I have no doubt that some of them are not only accurate, but honest. There are other workloads, though, and other hardware, and other conditions. Regardless of who wins a particular race, the constant competition to achieve peak performance benefits everyone. I’m not going to link to any of the benchmarks, because <a href="https://mwl.io/nonfiction/wtf#l2e1">I have made my opinions on benchmarking very clear elsewhere</a>.<span id="easy-footnote-2-23127"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-23127" title="&amp;#8220;The natural impulse to compare your server against others, to whup your neighbor, is exactly that: natural. It’s like flipping rocks to find tasty grubs. Sleeping in trees coveting the upper-class caves inhabited by the snooty grizzly bears. Perishing within twenty years of What Is Vitamin C Anyway? We invented civilization to escape dysentery, cleaning ourselves with mud, and benchmarking.&amp;#8221;"><sup>2</sup></a></span> Pick what you want and roll with it.</p>
<p>Every PF developer is trundling along, doing their best to make things work.</p>
<p>Are features missing from one or the other? Yep. I’m not going to list examples because, as the above links show, each project plucks what they find useful from the other. These things are freely given, with glad hearts, but they take time to integrate. Filling message boards with staunch declarations that <em>my team’s PF is better</em> is not only tedious, it wholly misses the point.</p>
<p>People are working together to improve the world.</p>
<p>And the PF syntax is the most approachable in all of open source Unix.</p>
<p>(Partisan fanboy comments will be mercilessly whacked.)</p>

<h5>Thus spake the Master Programmer:</h5>
<p><span size="+1"><b>"When you have learned to snatch the error code
from the trap frame, it will be time for you to leave."</b></span>
</p><hr>
<h4>1.1</h4>
<p>
Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void.  waiting
alone and unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion.
It is the source of all programs.  I do not know its name, so I will
call it the Tao of Programming.
</p><blockquote>
If the Tao is great, then the operating system is great.
<br>
If the operating system is great, then the compiler is great.
<br>
If the compiler is great, then the application is great.
<br>
The user is pleased, and there is harmony in the world.
</blockquote>
The Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of
morning.
<hr>
<h4>1.2</h4>
<p> 
The Tao gave birth to machine language.  Machine language gave birth
to the assembler.
</p><p>
The assembler gave birth to the compiler.  Now there are ten thousand
languages.
</p><p>
Each language has its purpose, however humble.  Each language
expresses the Yin and Yang of software.  Each language has its place
within the Tao.
</p><p>
But do not program in <tt>COBOL</tt> if you can avoid it.
</p><hr>
<h4>1.3</h4>
<p>
In the beginning was the Tao.  The Tao gave birth to Space and Time.
</p><p>
Therefore Space and Time are the Yin and Yang of programming.
</p><p>
Programmers that do not comprehend the Tao are always running out of
time and space for their programs.  Programmers that comprehend the
Tao always have enough time and space to accomplish their goals.
</p><p>
How could it be otherwise?
</p><hr>
<h4>1.4</h4>
<p>
The wise programmer is told about Tao and follows it.  The average
programmer is told about Tao and searches for it.  The foolish
programmer is told about Tao and laughs at it.
</p><p>
If it were not for laughter, there would be no Tao.
</p><p>
The highest sounds are hardest to hear.  Going forward is a way to
retreat.  Great talent shows itself late in life.  Even a perfect
program still has bugs.
</p><hr>
<h3>BOOK 2</h3>
<h2><i>The Ancient Masters</i></h2>
<h5>Thus spake the Master Programmer:</h5>
<p><span size="+1"><b> "After three days without programming, life
becomes meaningless."</b></span>
</p><hr>
<h4>2.1</h4>
<p>
The programmers of old were mysterious and profound.  We cannot fathom
their thoughts, so all we do is describe their appearance.
</p><blockquote>
Aware, like a fox crossing the water.
<br>
Alert, like a general on the battlefield.  
<br>
Kind, like a hostess greeting her guests.  
<br>
Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood.  
<br>
Opaque, like black pools in darkened caves.
</blockquote>
Who can tell the secrets of their hearts and minds?
<p>
The answer exists only in Tao.
</p><hr>
<h4>2.2</h4>
<p>
The Grand Master Turing once dreamed that he was a machine.  When he
awoke, he exclaimed:
</p><p>
"I don't know whether I am Turing dreaming that I am a machine, or a
machine dreaming that I am Turing!"
</p><hr>
<h4>2.3</h4>
<p>
A programmer from a very large computer company went to a software
conference and then returned to report to his manager, saying: "What
sort of programmers work for other companies?  They behaved badly and
were unconcerned with appearances.  Their hair was long and unkempt
and their clothes were wrinkled and old.  They crashed our hospitality
suite and they made rude noises during my presentation."
</p><p>
The manager said: "I should have never sent you to the conference.
Those programmers live beyond the physical world.  They consider life
absurd, an accidental coincidence.  They come and go without knowing
limitations.  Without a care, they live only for their programs.  Why
should they bother with social conventions?
</p><p>
They are alive within the Tao."
</p><hr>
<h4>2.4</h4>
<p>
A novice asked the Master: "Here is a programmer that never designs,
documents or tests his programs.  Yet all who know him consider him
one of the best programmers in the world.  Why is this?"
</p><p>
The Master replied: "That programmer has mastered the Tao.  He has
gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the
system crashes, but accepts the universe without concern.  He has gone
beyond the need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else
sees his code.  He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his
programs are perfect within themselves, serene and elegant, their
purpose self-evident.  Truly, he has entered the mystery of Tao."
</p><hr>
<h3>BOOK 3</h3>
<h2><i>Design</i></h2>
<h5>Thus spake the Master Programmer:</h5>
<p><span size="+1"><b> "When a program is being tested, it is too late
to make design changes."</b></span>
</p><hr>
<h4>3.1</h4>
<p>
There once was a man who went to a computer trade show.  Each day as
he entered, the man told the guard at the door:
</p><p>
"I am a great thief, renowned for my feats of shoplifting.  Be
forewarned, for this trade show shall not escape unplundered."
</p><p>
This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions
of dollars of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man
carefully.  But the man merely wandered from booth to booth, humming
quietly to himself.
</p><p>
When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes,
but nothing was to be found.
</p><p>
On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the
guard, saying: "I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will
be even better."  So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to
no avail.
</p><p>
On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his
curiosity no longer.  "Sir Thief," he said, "I am so perplexed, I
cannot live in peace.  Please enlighten me.  What is it that you are
stealing?"
</p><p>
The man smiled.  "I am stealing ideas," he said.
</p><hr>
<h4>3.2</h4>
<p>
There once was a Master Programmer who wrote unstructured programs.  A
novice programmer, seeking to imitate him, also began to write
unstructured programs.  When the novice asked the Master to evaluate
his progress, the Master criticized him for writing unstructured
programs, saying, "What is appropriate for the Master is not
appropriate for the novice.  You must understand Tao before
transcending structure."
</p><hr>
<h4>3.3</h4>
<p>
There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the
warlord of Wu.  The warlord asked the programmer: "Which is easier to
design: an accounting package or an operating system?"
</p><p>
"An operating system," replied the programmer.
</p><p>
The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.  "Surely an
accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating
system," he said.
</p><p>
"Not so," said the programmer, "When designing an accounting package,
the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different
ideas: how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it
must conform to the tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not
limited by outside appearances.  When designing an operating system,
the programmer seeks the simplest harmony between machine and ideas.
This is why an operating system is easier to design."
</p><p>
The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.  "That is all good and well, but
which is easier to debug?"
</p><p>
The programmer made no reply.
</p><hr>
<h4>3.4</h4>
<p>
A manager went to the Master Programmer and showed him the
requirements document for a new application.  The manager asked the
Master: "How long will it take to design this system if I assign five
programmers to it?"
</p><p>
"It will take one year," said the Master promptly.
</p><p>
"But we need this system immediately or even sooner!  How long will it
take if I assign ten programmers to it?"
</p><p>
The Master Programmer frowned.  "In that case, it will take two
years."
</p><p>
"And what if I assign a hundred programmers to it?"
</p><p>
The Master Programmer shrugged.  "Then the design will never be
completed," he said.
</p><hr>
<h3>BOOK 4</h3>
<h2><i>Coding</i></h2>
<h5>Thus spake the Master Programmer:</h5>
<p><span size="+1"><b> "A well-written program is its own Heaven; a
poorly-written program is its own Hell."</b></span>
</p><hr>
<h4>4.1</h4>
<p>
A program should be light and agile, its subroutines connected like a
string of pearls.  The spirit and intent of the program should be
retained throughout.  There should be neither too little nor too much.
Neither needless loops nor useless variables; neither lack of
structure nor overwhelming rigidity.
</p><p>
A program should follow the "Law of Least Astonishment".  What is this
law?  It is simply that the program should always respond to the users
in the way that least astonishes them.
</p><p>
A program, no matter how complex, should act as a single unit.  The
program should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward
appearances.
</p><p>
If the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state of
disorder and confusion.  The only way to correct this is to rewrite
the program.
</p><hr>
<h4>4.2</h4>
<p>
A novice asked the Master: "I have a program that sometimes runs and
sometimes aborts.  I have followed the rules of programming, yet I am
totally baffled.  What is the reason for this?"
</p><p>
The Master replied: "You are confused because you do not understand
Tao.  Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans.
Why do you expect it from a machine that humans have constructed?
Computers simulate determinism; only Tao is perfect.
</p><p>
The rules of programming are transitory; only Tao is eternal.
Therefore, you must contemplate Tao before you receive Enlightenment."
</p><p>
"But how will I know when I have received Enlightenment?"  asked the
novice.
</p><p>
"Your program will run correctly," replied the Master.
</p><hr>
<h4>4.3</h4>
<p>
The Master was explaining the nature of Tao to one of his novices.
</p><p>
"The Tao is embodied in all software -- regardless of how
insignificant," said the Master.
</p><p>
"Is the Tao in a hand-held calculator?" asked the novice.
</p><p>
"It is," came the reply.
</p><p>
"Is the Tao in a video game?" asked the novice.
</p><p>
"It is even in a video game," said the Master.
</p><p>
"Is the Tao in the <tt>DOS</tt> for a personal computer?" asked the novice.
</p><p>
The Master coughed and shifted his position slightly.  "The lesson is
over for today," he said.
</p><hr>
<h4>4.4</h4>
<p>
Prince Wang's programmer was coding software.  His fingers danced upon
the keyboard.  The program compiled without and error message, and the
program ran like a gentle wind.
</p><p>
"Excellent!"  the Prince exclaimed.  "Your technique is faultless!"
</p><p>
"Technique?"  said the programmer, turning from his terminal, "What I
follow is Tao -- beyond all techniques!  When I first began to
program, I would see before me the whole problem in one mass.  After
three years, I no longer saw this mass.  Instead, I used subroutines.
But now I see nothing.  My whole being exists in a formless void.  My
senses are idle.  My spirit, free to work without a plan, follows its
own instinct.  In short, my program writes itself.  True, sometimes
there are difficult problems.  I see them coming, I slow down, I watch
silently.  Then I change a single line of code and the difficulties
vanish like puffs of idle smoke.  I then compile the program.  I sit
still and let the joy of the work fill my being.  I close my eyes for
a moment and then log off."
</p><p>
Prince Wang said, "Would that all of my programmers were as wise!"
</p><hr>
<h3>BOOK 5</h3>
<h2><i>Maintenance</i></h2>
<h5>Thus spake the Master Programmer:</h5>
<p><span size="+1"><b> "Though a program be but three lines long,
someday it will have to be maintained."</b></span>
</p><hr>
<h4>5.1</h4>
<blockquote>
A well-used door needs no oil on its hinges.
<br>
A swift-flowing stream does not grow stagnant.
<br>
A deer blends perfectly into the forest colors.
<br>
Software rots if not used.
</blockquote>
These are great mysteries.
<hr>
<h4>5.2</h4>
<p>
A manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish the
program on which he was working.  "I will be finished tomorrow," the
programmer promptly replied.
</p><p>
"I think you are being unrealistic," said the manager, "Truthfully,
how long will it take?"
</p><p>
The programmer thought for a moment.  "I have some features that I
wish to add.  This will take at least two weeks," he finally said.
</p><p>
"Even that is too much to expect," insisted the manager, "I will be
satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete."
</p><p>
The programmer agreed to this.
</p><p>
Several years later, the manager retired.  On the way to his
retirement luncheon, he discovered the programmer asleep at his
terminal.  He had been programming all night.
</p><hr>
<h4>5.3</h4>
<p>
A novice programmer was once assigned to code a simple financial
package.
</p><p>
The novice worked furiously for many days, but when his Master
reviewed his program, he discovered it contained a screen editor, a
set of generalized graphics routines, and an artificial intelligence
interface, but not the slightest hint of anything financial.
</p><p>
When the Master asked about this, the novice became indignant.  "Don't
be so impatient," he said, "I'll put in the financial stuff
eventually."
</p><hr>
<h4>5.4</h4>
<blockquote>
Does a good farmer neglect a crop he has planted?
<br>
Does a good teacher overlook even the most humble student?
<br>
Does a good father allow a single child to starve?
<br>
Does a good programmer refuse to maintain his code?
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>BOOK 6</h3>
<h2><i>Management</i></h2>
<h5>Thus spake the Master Programmer:</h5>
<p><span size="+1"><b> "Let the programmers be many and the managers few
-- then all will be productive."</b></span>
</p><hr>
<h4>6.1</h4>
<blockquote>
When managers hold endless meetings, the programmers write games.
<br>
When accountants speak of quarterly profits, the development budget is
about to be cut.
<br>
When senior scientists talk blue sky, the clouds are about to roll in.
</blockquote>
Truly, this is not the Tao of Programming.
<blockquote>
When managers make commitments, game programs are ignored.
<br>
When accountants make long-range plans, harmony and order are about to
be restored.
<br>
When senior scientists address the problems at hand, the problems will
soon be solved.
</blockquote>
Truly, this is the Tao of Programming.
<hr>
<h4>6.2</h4>
<blockquote>
Why are programmers non-productive?  Because their time is wasted in
meetings.
<br>
Why are programmers rebellious?  Because the management interferes too
much.
<br>
Why are the programmers resigning one by one?  Because they are burnt
out.
<br>
Having worked for poor management, they no longer value their jobs.
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h4>6.3</h4>
<p>
A manager was about to be fired, but a programmer who worked for him
wrote a new program that became popular and sold well.  As a result,
the manager retained his job.
</p><p>
The manager tried to give the programmer a bonus, but the programmer
refused it, saying, "I wrote the program because I thought it was an
interesting concept, and thus I expect no reward."
</p><p>
The manager upon hearing this remarked, "This programmer, though he
holds a position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty of
an employee.  Let us promote him to the exalted position of management
consultant!"
</p><p>
But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying, "I exist
so that I can program.  If I were promoted, I would do nothing but
waste everyone's time.  Can I go now?  I have a program that I am
working on."
</p><hr>
<h4>6.4</h4>
<p>
A manager went to his programmers and told them: "As regards to your
work hours: you are going to have to come in at nine in the morning
and leave at five in the afternoon."  At this, all of them became
angry and several resigned on the spot.
</p><p>
So the manager said: "All right, in that case you may set your own
working hours, as long as you finish your projects on schedule."  The
programmers, now satisfied, began to come in at noon and work to the
wee hours of the morning.
</p><hr>
<h3>BOOK 7</h3>
<h2><i>Corporate Wisdom</i></h2>
<h5>Thus spake the Master Programmer:</h5>
<p><span size="+1"><b> "You can demonstrate a program for a corporate
executive, but you can't make him computer literate."</b></span>
</p><hr>
<h4>7.1</h4>
<p>
A novice asked the Master: "In the East, there is a great
tree-structure that men call 'Corporate Headquarters'.  It is bloated
out of shape with vice presidents and accountants.  It issues a
multitude of memos, each saying 'Go Hence!' or 'Go Hither!' and nobody
knows what is meant.  Every year new names are put onto the branches,
but all to no avail.  How can such an unnatural entity exist?"
</p><p>
The Master replied: "You perceive this immense structure and are
disturbed that it has no rational purpose.  Can you not take amusement
from its endless gyrations?  Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of
programming beneath its sheltering branches?  Why are you bothered by
its uselessness?"
</p><hr>
<h4>7.2</h4>
<p>
In the East there is a shark which is larger than all other fish.  It
changes into a bird whose wings are like clouds filling the sky.  When
this bird moves across the land, it brings a message from Corporate
Headquarters.  This message it drops into the midst of the
programmers, like a seagull making its mark upon the beach.  Then the
bird mounts on the wind and, with the blue sky at its back, returns
home.
</p><p>
The novice programmer stares in wonder at the bird, for he understands
it not.  The average programmer dreads the coming of the bird, for he
fears its message.  The Master Programmer continues to work at his
terminal, unaware that the bird has come and gone.
</p><hr>
<h4>7.3</h4>
<p>
The Magician of the Ivory Tower brought his latest invention for the
Master Programmer to examine.  The Magician wheeled a large black box
into the Master's office while the Master waited in silence.
</p><p>
"This is an integrated, distributed, general-purpose workstation,"
began the Magician, "ergonomically designed with a proprietary
operating system, sixth generation languages, and multiple state of
the art user interfaces.  It took my assistants several hundred man
years to construct.  Is it not amazing?"
</p><p>
The Master Programmer raised his eyebrows slightly.  "It is indeed
amazing," he said.
</p><p>
"Corporate Headquarters has commanded," continued the Magician, "that
everyone use this workstation as a platform for new programs.  Do you
agree to this?"
</p><p>
"Certainly," replied the Master.  "I will have it transported to the
Data Center immediately!"  And the Magician returned to his tower,
well pleased.
</p><p>
Several days later, a novice wandered into the office of the Master
Programmer and said, "I cannot find the listing for my new program.
Do you know where it might be?"
</p><p>
"Yes," replied the Master, "the listings are stacked on the platform
in the Data Center."
</p><hr>
<h4>7.4</h4>
<p>
The Master Programmer moves from program to program without fear.  No
change in management can harm him.  He will not be fired, even if the
project is cancelled.  Why is this?  He is filled with Tao.
</p><hr>
<h3>BOOK 8</h3>
<h2><i>Hardware and Software</i></h2>
<h5>Thus spake the Master Programmer:</h5>
<p><span size="+1"><b> "Without the wind, the grass does not move.
Without software hardware is useless."</b></span>
</p><hr>
<h4>8.1</h4>
<p>
A novice asked the Master: "I perceive that one computer company is
much larger than all others.  It towers above its competition like a
giant among dwarfs.  Any one of its divisions could comprise an entire
business.  Why is this so?"
</p><p>
The Master replied, "Why do you ask such foolish questions?  That
company is large because it is large.  If it only made hardware,
nobody would buy it.  If it only made software, nobody would use it.
If it only maintained systems, people would treat it like a servant.
But because it combines all of these things, people think it one of
the gods!  By not seeking to strive, it conquers without effort."
</p><hr>
<h4>8.2</h4>
<p>
A Master Programmer passed a novice programmer one day.
</p><p>
The Master noted the novice's preoccupation with a hand-held computer
game.
</p><p>
"Excuse me," he said, "may I examine it?"
</p><p>
The novice bolted to attention and handed the device to the Master.
"I see that the device claims to have three levels of play: Easy,
Medium, and Hard," said the Master.  "Yet every such device has
another level of play, where the device seeks not to conquer the
human, nor to be conquered by the human."
</p><p>
"Pray, Great Master," implored the novice, "how does one find this
mysterious setting?"
</p><p>
The Master dropped the device to the ground and crushed it with his
heel.  Suddenly the novice was enlightened.
</p><hr>
<h4>8.3</h4>
<p>
There was once a programmer who wrote software for personal computers.
"Look at how well off I am here," he said to a mainframe programmer
who came to visit.  "I have my own operating system and file storage
device.  I do not have to share my resources with anyone.  The
software is self-consistent and easy-to-use.  Why do you not quit your
present job and join me here?"
</p><p>
The mainframe programmer then began to describe his system to his
friend, saying, "The mainframe sits like an ancient Sage meditating in
the midst of the Data Center.  Its disk drives lie end-to- end like a
great ocean of machinery.  The software is as multifaceted as a
diamond, and as convoluted as a primeval jungle.  The programs, each
unique, move through the system like a swift-flowing river.  That is
why I am happy where I am."
</p><p>
The personal computer programmer, upon hearing this, fell silent.  But
the two programmers remained friends until the end of their days.
</p><hr>
<h4>8.4</h4>
<p>
Hardware met Software on the road to Changtse.  Software said: "You
are Yin and I am Yang.  If we travel together, we will become famous
and earn vast sums of money."  And so they set forth together,
thinking to conquer the world.
</p><p>
Presently, they met Firmware, who was dressed in tattered rags and
hobbled along propped on a thorny stick.  Firmware said to them: "The
Tao lies beyond Yin and Yang.  It is silent and still as a pool of
water.  It does not seek fame; therefore, nobody knows its presence.
It does not seek fortune, for it is complete within itself.  It exists
beyond space and time."
</p><p>
Software and Hardware, ashamed, returned to their homes.

      Not in the public domain      </p><div><p>
        This is a very useful book on knots. It is truly the knot bible. </p><p>

Unfortunately, however, this is the 1993 version and contains corrected material that are still protected under the copyright laws. To the reviewer who claimed that this book is in public domain, you are wrong. The Internet Archive contains much material, including game source codes that were stolen from game software companies, that are illegal to distribute. (Regarding the stolen source code, you need to know how to look for them in the IA because the uploaders used "special" words that are recognizable only by those who know what the stolen files represent.) I've also seen books (including proprietary material stolen from private corporations that have words like "proprietary" or "confidential" marked in them) posted in IA that were published within the past couple of decades and thus are still copyrighted. So this says that the IA simply does not have the resources to go through every uploaded file and delete the ones that are not legal to download. There are simply too many of them for any single individual like me to report them to IA for deletion. Just trying to report them to the IA would be a full-time job.</p><p>

As for this Ashley book, for it to be truly in the public domain, it needs to be the original 1944 version, the one that has errors that the 1993 version corrected. However, there is also the possibility that the copyright owner may have given the permission for the 1993 version of the book to be available via the IA, without releasing the book into the public domain, but I don't know how IA would be able to know this without contacting the copyright owner.      </p></div>

      Wow      </p><div><p>
        I loved reading "knot books" when I first started sailing. Sailing of course is no requisite for studying knots! or "bends".... </p><p>

This is a lovely book written by a lovely man who cared enough about the world to share this work, which took him at least eleven years to create. </p><p>

PS- this title surely IS in public domain, so- the comment from the "public domain police" is unnecessary. If in the case a copyrighted file is in the Archive by mistake, it will quickly be removed.       </p></div>

      Public Domain?      </p><div><p>
        The copyright laws in the USA say that a work enters public domain 70 years after the death of the author. Mr. Ashley died in 1947, so it is plausible that it would enter public domain this year. But, it was posted last year. And, the copyright notice is from an edition with amended material dated 1993.</p><p>

Is this truly public domain?      </p></div>
