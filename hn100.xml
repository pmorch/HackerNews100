<p>We will be bringing Kagi Translate soon inside Kagi Search as a widget for instant translation inside search results.</p>

<p>We do not translate dynamically created content (eg. pages where content is loaded with JavaScript) or paywalled pages.</p>

<p>Kagi Translate uses a combination of LLMs, selecting and optimizing the best output for each task. While this creates immensey powerful translation capabilities, it can occasionally lead to quirks that we’re actively working to resolve.</p>

<h2>Next</h2>

<p>This isn’t just about better translation. It’s about raising standards in everyday tools. We believe that privacy and quality can coexist, that powerful tools don’t need to track their users, and that the best technology should simply work without compromises for the user.</p>

<p>Kagi Translate joins our family of tools (we call them ‘treats’): <a href="https://kagi.com/smallweb">Small Web</a>, <a href="https://kagi.com/summarizer">Universal Summarizer</a>, and <a href="https://kagi.com/fastgpt">FastGPT</a> alongside <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi Search</a> and <a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion Browser</a>.</p>

Standard size here is 3/8 inch which is the outer diameter of the tubing. They are easy to work with as you only need a tube cutter (or hacksaw with fine tooth pitch) and a wrench. You cut the tube, slide a compression nut over, slide the ferrule(s) on, insert the tube into the fitting, finger tighten the compression nut, make sure everything is aligned then tighten nut with wrench. No solder, no fancy crimp tools. You can disassemble and reassemble without leaks. The only issue is the ferrule winds up becoming swaged to the tube after wrench tightening so you have to cut the tube end off behind the ferrule if you want to replace the nut.</p><p>However, instead of using rigid metal or plastic tubing you commonly find a flexible hose assembly[1]. Only fancy installs use custom formed polished rigid tube for the look. We also tend to leave most of the plumbing in the walls and only the shut off valve protrudes from the wall. Maybe there are flexible hoses available in your region.</p><p>When I installed my bidet all I needed was a 3/8 compression tee[2] which they make specifically to tap shutoff valves. The bidet came with a 3/8 connection hose so that went to the tee and I was up and running. The big issue was electric - no outlets in the bathroom. So having seen how Japan loves extension cords I too used one, ran a 12 AWG cord out to the hall to a GFI adapter plugged into a socket. Jank but highly unlikely to cause a fire.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Plumbing-Plumbing-Parts-Supply-Lines/Toilet-Connector/N-5yc1vZbqjnZ1z138l5" rel="nofollow">https://www.homedepot.com/b/Plumbing-Plumbing-Parts-Supply-L...</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breezliy-Lead-Free-Compression-Outlet-Connect/dp/B0BDLBZ9P6/" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Breezliy-Lead-Free-Compression-Outlet...</a></p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Cargo e-bikes are tempting. I also have two kids and I've managed to work it out with just two seats on my bike (one front, one back) and now that the big one is tall enough to ride his bike I've got a "follow-me tandem" which allow me to tug him uphill, but carrying sports equipment is starting to be a hassle, so I'm seriously considering buying a cargo ebike to replace my current set-up.</p>

                  <p>I'm in Portland and I say that anyone that lives on the Eastside within 82nd and works within those bounds should just get a bike, it's sooo much faster to get around the city. We have infamously small city blocks so all those intersections make driving a car very slow through the city and for good reason as it's safer. If you hop on a bike and take a greenway that has all the stop signs facing perpendicular traffic you can zoom around the city no problem. It's the exact same amount of time (from door to desk) for me to drive to work as it is to bike to work (including the shower). It's just shy of 7 miles. No brainer.</p>

Invaluable for any computer, electronic, or right to repair hobbyists.</p><p>Barely Under $1000
 - a Sebo E3 Premium canister vacuum ($950 after using resellers 10% off offer)</p><p>Our family's traditional standup vacuum (I forgot which brand but they're almost all identical) died after a few years of use and we were fed up with having to replace it. Most consumer vacuums available in the US suffer significantly from planned obsolescence, so I did some research and came across this German import Sebo e3 canister vacuum. Previously I had never heard of canister vacuums, they're literally never advertised in the US. Apparently Shark makes a few, but I had to specifically google "shark canister vacuum" to find them as there is no mention of them on their official website. It only took a couple raving reviews of canister vacuums to convince me of their potential, so I took the plunge with the Sebo.</p><p>I can safely say that this vacuum is a complete gamechanger. It is so much quieter, lighter, maneuverable, easy to use, and cleaner. No longer do floating dust particles cloud the windows' sun rays. No longer does my cat appear covered in dust because she found a spot I neglected to clean. No longer do I have to worry about breaking a weakening but crucial plastic clip or retainer when emptying the vacuum. Every part that experiences stress is metal and designed for longevity rather than aesthetics. Dare I say I even enjoy vacuuming now! It used to be a pain to lug around an entire upright vacuum over every square inch of the floor. Even the bags are better than emptying a canister. The bags are biodegradable and seal inside the vacuum, meaning dust never has a chance to escape. I used to have to empty the canister vacuum outside because of how much dust it released. Yes, the high price tag is rather intimidating for a vacuum purchase, but it's well worthwhile as it's been going for four years strong with absolutely zero issues. Also, most US resellers offer 10% off if you just call them to order it.</p></div></td></tr>

Comes with TSA Pre and Global Entry.</p><p>- ChatGPT $20/mth and Claude $20/mth. Completely changed how I ideate and work.</p><p>- Cosori Air Fryer $70 + a stack of wax paper. Changes my food bill and health. I can buy a bunch of healthy stuff from Costco, and make delicious meals daily in under 20 mins.</p><p>- AirTags ($28/piece). I tag my car, my luggage, my wallet, my keys, etc. And I never get anxious again.</p><p>- Black socks from Amazon. I bought 17 pairs of identical black socks, so I don’t ever have to match socks again. I can just grab any two.</p><p>- Samsers folding Bluetooth Keyboard $60. I pair this compact foldable keyboard with my iPhone and iPad, so I can type with an actual keyboard anywhere I go.</p><p>There are also a bunch of high quality grooming tools like a Panasonic electric razor, Tweezerman tweezers, rounded scissors, etc. that improveme my quality of life. There’s also a clever porcelain $4 toothbrush holder from Muji that is amazing. There’s also a toothpaste squeezer from Amazon.</p><p>Health wise, I’ve gotten better sleep from heavy curtains which blocks street noise. Also a wedge pillow has helped decrease snoring. An Aroma USB heated eye mask has helped with dry eye.</p><p>Under $1000:</p><p>- $180 per pair - 2 pairs of AirPods Pro 2. ANC for 10 hour work day, peace of mind.</p><p>- $200 Apple Watch Series 7. I charge it twice a day when I shower but otherwise I wear it all the time. Great for health tracking and sleep alarm, but it’s most useful feature for me is Apple Pay. I pay for stuff with a double click on the dial, no need to whip out my phone. It also unlocks my Mac automatically. I used to wear Tissots but no more. I’m sold on Apple Watch.</p><p>- $180 Levoit humidifier</p><p>- $200 Coway Air purifier.</p><p>- $100 Allbirds shoes. They’re expensive but I’ve had mine for 4 years, worn daily. They’re tech bro shoes but they do live up to their reputation.</p><p>- $120 Patagonia Better Sweater vest. This is more of a finance bro getup but it is warm and pairs with anything and still looks smarter than a hoodie. This matters. As much as tech people don’t care about dressing well, the person who dresses just a bit better gets taken just a bit more seriously. Humans are hardwired for superficial things unfortunately.</p><p>- $150/week up to deductible (I have HSA so high deductible but folks on FSA can get therapy for more cheaper plus most therapists have sliding scale). Best investment ever is weekly therapy sessions. I’ve worked through so many things that I’m a much more regulated person and am able to heal from a lot of stuff that were affecting new relationships. I wish I did this 20 years sooner.</p></div></td></tr>

    <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN! We’re James and Brandon building Codebuff (<a href="https://codebuff.com/">https://codebuff.com</a>). Codebuff is like Cursor Composer, but in your terminal: it modifies files based on your natural language requests. You can try it with `npm i -g codebuff` and start using it immediately for free. We have no login gate, and we give all accounts up to $20 worth of credits.</p><p>Codebuff is different because we simplified the input to one step: you type what you want done in your terminal and hit enter. Then Codebuff looks through your whole codebase and makes the edits it wants, to existing source files or new ones. It also can run your tests, the type checker, or install packages to fulfill your request.</p><p>Demo video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ0NOMsu0dA" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ0NOMsu0dA</a></p><p>It all started at a hackathon. I was trying out Sonnet 3.5 which had recently come out and seeing if I could use it to write code. The script I cobbled together that day pulled codebase context in one step and used it to rewrite files with changes in the second step. This two step process still exists today. Incidentally, my hackathon script worked rather poorly and my demo failed to produce any useful code.</p><p>But that weekend I thought about the kind of errors it made, and realized that with more context on our codebase, it might have been able to get the change right. For example, it tried to create an endpoint on our server (at my previous startup), but it didn't know that you needed to edit 3 specific files to do this (yeah... our backend was not that clean). So I hand-wrote a guide to our codebase, like I was instructing a new hire. I put it in a markdown file and passed it into Sonnet 3.5's system prompt.  And the crazy thing is that it started producing wayyy better code. So, I started getting excited. In fact, this code guide idea still exists in Codebuff today as knowledge.md files which are automatically read on every request.</p><p>I didn't think of this project as a startup idea at first. I thought it was just a simple script anyone could write. But after another week, I could see there were more problems to solve and it should be a product.</p><p>In the week between applying to YC and the interview, I could not get Codebuff to edit files consistently. I tried many prompting strategies to get it to replace strings in the original file, but nothing worked reliably. How could I face my interviewer if I could not get something basic like this to work? On the day before my interview, in a Hail Mary attempt, I fine-tuned GPT-4o to turn Claude's sketch of changes into a git patch, which would add and remove lines to make the edits. I only finished generating the training data late at night, and the fine-tuning job ran as I slept.</p><p>And, holy hell, the next morning it worked! I pushed it to production just in time for my YC interview with Dalton. Soon after, Brandon joined and we were off to the races.</p><p>So, how does Codebuff work exactly? You invoke it in your terminal, and it starts by running through the source files in that directory and subdirectories and parsing out all the function and class names (or equivalents in 11 languages). We use the tree-sitter library to do this. It builds out a codebase map that includes these symbols and the file tree.</p><p>Then, it fires off a request to Claude Haiku 3.5 to cache this codebase context so user inputs can be responded to with lower latency. (Prompt caching is OP!). We have a stateless server that passes messages along to Anthropic or OpenAI. We use websockets to ferry data back and forth to clients. We didn't have authentication or even a database for the first three months. Codebuff was free to install and used our API keys for all requests. Luckily, no one exploited us for too much free Claude usage haha. Major thanks to Brandon for saving this situation by building out our database (Postgres + Drizzle), server (Bun, hosted on Render, auth (using the free Auth.js), website (NextJS also hosted on Render), billing (Stripe), logging (BetterStack), and dashboard (Retool). This is the best tech stack I’ve ever had.</p><p>When the user sends an input message, we prompt Claude to pick files that would be relevant (step 1). After picking files, we load them into context and the agent responds. It invokes tools using xml tags that we parse. It literally writes out &lt;edit_file path="src/app.ts"&gt;…&lt;/edit_file&gt; to edit a particular file, and has other tags to run terminal commands, or to ask to read more files. This is all we really need, since Anthropic has already trained Claude with very similar tools reach state of the art on the SWE benchmark.</p><p>Codebuff has limited free usage, but if you like it you can pay $99/mo to get more credits. We realize this is a lot more than competitors, but that’s because we do more expensive LLM calls with more context.</p><p>We’re already seeing Codebuff used in surprising ways. One user racked up a $500 bill by building out two Flutter apps in parallel. He never even looked at the code it generated. Instead, he had long conversations with Codebuff to make progress and fix errors, until the apps were built to his satisfaction.

        <p>After 15 years, Google banned me from <a href="https://voice.google.com/">Google Voice</a>.
This post is a summary of what happened, with the hope that it might help
someone in the future who runs into the same situation. <a href="#retrospective">At the
end</a>, I have some
thoughts about the latent danger of being banned from Google at any time with no
notice.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background<a href="#background"></a></h2>
<p>I got my first cell phone in high school and immediately signed up for Google
Voice simply because I wanted to be able to send and receive texts from my
computer. So my Google Voice number is the only one I’ve ever given out to
friends, and I use it as my phone number whenever I can. The only time I use my
“real” Verizon phone number is when I can’t receive verification codes because
some services block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP">VoIP</a> numbers.</p>
<p>That was a minor annoyance, and I’ve loved being able to text and even call from
any device, even if my phone was off or not in service (e.g. traveling
internationally). So I stuck with it for 15 years. My only worry has been that
it seems like another product that Google could easily decide to kill off and
send to the <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Google graveyard</a> at any moment. But
that turned out to be the wrong worry for me.</p>
<h2 id="getting-banned">Getting Banned<a href="#getting-banned"></a></h2>
<p>My problems started on October 4, 2024. I got a notification on my phone saying
I had been logged out of my Google account. This had never happened to me
before, and I thought someone might be trying to hack into my account. I was
concerned but not terribly worried because I had two-factor authentication
turned on. On my personal laptop, I saw a notification that I had been logged
out of Google Drive.</p>
<p>I logged back in on my phone and laptop, going through two-factor authentication
both times. Then I checked the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/notifications">security
log</a> for my Google account. I saw
that my account had been disabled at 12:55 pm, but the log didn’t have any
details about why. Logging back in had restored my account at 2:38 pm.</p>
<p>The log didn’t have any other security activity, like login attempts. I even
reviewed my <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/">full Google activity</a> but didn’t see
anything that I didn’t recognize.  Everything seemed back to normal, so I went
back to work.</p>
<p>A few hours later, I tried sending some pictures in a group text in Google
Voice. The first picture went through fine. But when I tried to send a second
one, I received an error message that said something like “Sorry, there was an
error. Please try again later.” I retried a few times. Then I tried sending a
plain text message to my wife and got the same error.</p>
<p>I was worried that it was related to my account being deactivated, but the
optimist in me thought that maybe Google Voice was having an outage. Until I got
home and went on my laptop to check Google Voice in my browser. It redirected me
to <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40039?p=grandcentral">this Google support
page</a> with this
message:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>My heart sank. Getting banned by Google’s automated systems is a situation that
I have read <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hacker+news+google+account+disabled+site:news.ycombinator.com">plenty of
stories</a>
about, and I had an idea of what was next: a Kafkaesque situation in which I
would probably never talk to an actual human being, I’d never get any useful
details, and I would likely be forced to accept losing my phone number.</p>
<p>I tried making an outbound call. It didn’t work. I asked my wife to call me.
That didn’t work either. I asked my wife to text me. From her perspective, it
looked like it worked, but I never received it. That was even worse because it
meant that anyone who texted me wouldn’t get any indication that anything was
wrong.</p>
<h2 id="first-appeal">First Appeal<a href="#first-appeal"></a></h2>
<p>The Google support page advised me to <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/contact/suspended">submit a
form</a> appealing the
suspension. I did so immediately, explaining that I was suspended right after
sending a picture and noting that I had been logged out of my Google account
earlier in the day. I received an automated email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for contacting us about restoring access to your Google Account.</p>
<p>Google will review your appeal as soon as possible. Most requests take 2
business days to review, but some might take longer.</p>
<p>You may be able to download your data from some Google services. To get
started, sign in to your account. If your account is eligible, you’ll see a
link to download your data.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did try to use <a href="https://takeout.google.com/">Google Takeout</a> to export my
data, but Google Voice no longer shows up in the list of products, even though
I’m sure it did in the past because I have <a href="https://support.google.com/voice/answer/10130510?hl=en">exported my Google Voice
data</a> before. So the
suspension presumably affected that as well.</p>
<p>I subscribe to a <a href="https://one.google.com/about">Google One</a> plan. I knew that
one of the more understated benefits is the ability to get live support from an
actual person, something that is generally impossible with Google. I had nothing
to lose, so I started a chat. It ended up being a waste of time because the
person I talked to was fixated on me mentioning getting logged out of my
account. So they started recommending ways to protect my account. When I brought
the conversation back to the Google Voice suspension, they were unable to access
the ticket that was created when I submitted my appeal. So I ended the
conversation.</p>
<p>On October 6 (two days later), I heard back about my appeal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We have reviewed your request and cannot reinstate your Google Voice service.
Your Google Voice service has been suspended for violations of our <a href="https://support.google.com/voice/answer/9230450?hl=en">Google
Voice Policies</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions, please consult the <a href="https://support.google.com/voice/#topic=13968863">Google Voice Help
Center</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Google Voice Support Team</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="second-appeal">Second Appeal<a href="#second-appeal"></a></h2>
<p>On October 7, I submitted a second appeal. I explained that I reviewed the
Google Voice policies and did not believe I violated any of them. I never sent
large quantities of texts, I never sent commercial texts, I only texted friends
and family, and there was nothing remotely inappropriate about the picture I
sent right before I was suspended. The picture was of four adults around a baby
in a stroller on a sidewalk. The baby is dressed and even has a blanket on him.
I added that that was the only text I sent on the day I was suspended, and I
didn’t make any calls that day.</p>
<p>On October 8, I received the same reply that I got for the first appeal.</p>
<p>I considered writing this blog post immediately, posting it to Hacker News, and
hopefully getting enough traction that someone at Google would see it and do
something about it. But I didn’t bother because even on the off chance that it
worked, I wouldn’t be able to trust Google Voice again and would still want to
port my phone number out.</p>
<h2 id="reclaiming-my-number">Reclaiming My Number<a href="#reclaiming-my-number"></a></h2>
<p>At this point, porting my number out was my only priority. I didn’t want to tell
all my friends and family to use a new number. And I didn’t want to deal with
trying to update my number for a countless number of services, especially since
I’m sure it’d be a hassle for many of them without access to the old number.</p>
<p>I did some searching and learned that the Google Voice subreddit has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Googlevoice/comments/17n4zl2/google_voice_service_suspensions/">an entire
document on
suspensions</a>.
People apparently post about suspensions often enough that the subreddit
disallows threads on suspensions since there’s nothing they can do about them.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Googlevoice/comments/1dr47m4/account_suspended_reclaiming_your_number_and_your/">one wonderfully detailed
post</a>
(“Account Suspended - Reclaiming your Number and your Dignity; a How-To Guide”)
that has been removed because of the subreddit’s rule. But that post, as well as
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1filpr1/got_my_suspended_google_voice_number_back_fcc/">another
one</a>
that is still up, said the posters were able to get their numbers out by <a href="https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us">filing
complaints</a> with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission">FCC</a>. So I
planned to do that, expecting the whole process to take a couple of months.</p>
<p>On October 9, I added a new line to my Verizon plan as a target for my Google
Voice number. A silver lining is that with the new line, I was able to get a new
iPhone 15 for almost free after bill credits. I initiated a port in request for
my Google Voice number. I expected the port to fail, since I was unable to
access my Google Voice account to <a href="https://support.google.com/voice/answer/1065667?hl=en">unlock the
number</a>. Then I would
submit the FCC complaint.</p>
<p>But to my pleasant surprise, the port went through in a couple of days! I
activated service on the new iPhone with my old Google Voice number. I did have
an issue where I could make calls and send and receive texts, but I couldn’t
receive calls. I called the Verizon port center (1-888-844-7095), and the person
who helped me did something on their end to truly finish off the port. After
that, I could receive calls as well. So I never needed to use the FCC’s muscle.</p>
<p>Then I did a <a href="https://www.verizon.com/support/swap-devices-faqs/">number swap</a>
between my Verizon lines so that I can use my former Google Voice number on my
Android phone instead of the iPhone.</p>
<p>After a couple of days, I looked up the number on
<a href="https://freecarrierlookup.com/">FreeCarrierLookup</a>, and it showed up as a
wireless Verizon number. Previously, it showed up as a landline, and the carrier
was <a href="https://www.bandwidth.com/">Bandwidth</a>, which is
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19049200">apparently</a> what powers Google
Voice SMS in the backend.</p>
<p>On October 23, I received an email from Google Voice saying that my number was
ported away:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Danny Guo,</p>
<p>This email is to confirm that your Google Voice number (xxx-xxx-xxxx) has been
ported away from Google Voice. Calls made to that number will no longer ring
your forwarding phones and new voicemails won’t appear in your Google Voice
inbox.</p>
<p>Your Google Voice account has been downgraded accordingly, but your existing
voicemails and text messages remain available in your inbox. You can also
continue placing calls from Gmail.</p>
<p>You can upgrade your account at any time by getting a new Google Voice number.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>The Google Voice team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now when I open Google Voice on my phone, it asks me to pick a new number as if
I’m starting from scratch. But on web, it still redirects me to the suspension
page.</p>
<h2 id="retrospective">Retrospective<a href="#retrospective"></a></h2>
<p>I have conflicted thoughts about what happened. I’ve used Google services for
the majority of my life. In college, I remember playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Would_you_rather">would you
rather</a> at lunch, and a friend
asked if I’d rather lose access to everything Google or lose a physical sense. I
really had to think about it.</p>
<p>I’ve only ever used Android smartphones and smartwatches, despite being
virtually the only one among my friends and family to not have switched to
iPhone. Which makes me the person who tends to get grief for ruining group chats
by turning them into <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009">green
bubbles</a>.</p>
<p>And I directly pay Google by subscribing to Google One, YouTube Premium, and
Google Workspace (just for my custom domain email).</p>
<p>One major reason I’ve stuck with Google for so long is that I value using
services that are multiplatform. I may have an Android phone and watch, but I
also have a MacBook and an iPad.</p>
<p>And I still think Google Search can be pretty magical. Despite <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/google-search-size-usefulness-decline/675409/">its
decline</a>
and the fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLM</a>s are
just better for certain searches.</p>
<h3 id="fear">Fear<a href="#fear"></a></h3>
<p>But relying on Google worries me because of all the stories I’ve read about
people being banned. Sure, some of those cases might be lacking some details
that would justify the bans, but I was convinced enough to put a lot of effort
into migrating away from Gmail several years ago. Consider how important your
email account is to your digital life and how awful it would be to suddenly lose
access to your email with no warning.</p>
<p>By now, everything important uses my custom domain email address. I do use
Google Workspace for it, so i’m technically still using Gmail. But the point is
that I control the address. If Google bans me one day, all I have to do is
update my DNS records to switch to something like
<a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a>.</p>
<p>The possibility of a Google ban is also one small reason I haven’t gotten into
Android development. I could <a href="https://medium.com/@antaresone/google-just-terminated-my-google-play-developer-account-forever-f62d6362b6ac">accidentally violate their
terms</a>
and get banned from publishing apps in an instant.</p>
<p>And I deliberately do not take any pictures of my infant son nude on the off
chance it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html">gets flagged as child sexual abuse
material</a>
after being uploaded into Google Photos, and my entire Google account is banned.
With my recent situation, I consider myself lucky that I was at least only
banned from Google Voice.</p>
<p>It says something that my biggest issue with Google isn’t that their services
aren’t good anymore or that they kill things off all the time. It’s that I’m
afraid they will just ban me with no recourse. It finally happened, and it
wasn’t even for a service that I was worried about.</p>
<h3 id="caveats">Caveats<a href="#caveats"></a></h3>
<p>I work in software and in fintech. I can understand that Google operates at such
a massive scale that many things have to be automated, and even if there are
some false positives, that could be a worthy tradeoff to Google to not have to
put humans into the loop.</p>
<p>I also understand the logic of not telling people what rules they broke because
you don’t want bad actors to get a better understanding of the system because
that would allow them to fine tune their attacks accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="curiosity">Curiosity<a href="#curiosity"></a></h3>
<p>But I’m still frustrated about temporarily losing my phone number. Sure I never
paid for Google Voice, but Google never gave me an option to pay for it. In this
case, I would have happily paid $100 just to find out why exactly I was banned.
What rule or model decided I needed to be banned?</p>
<p>Part of it is curiosity. Was the last picture I sent the issue? Getting logged
out of my phone earlier in the day suggests it wasn’t. But I didn’t do anything
else on Google Voice that day, and I barely sent any texts or made any calls in
the days before. I’m confident that if a real person looked at my account,
they’d agree something in the automation went wrong. You may have some
skepticism. Unfortunately, I can’t provide my activity, since I can’t see it
anymore after the app recognized that my number was ported out. But I’m <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Googlevoice/comments/1fcw44j/google_voice_exit_strategy_update/">not the
only
one</a>
dealing with this kind of a situation.</p>
<p>I wonder if I should be more upset. Maybe I should actually try to vote with my
wallet and switch to that iPhone, move my files from Google Drive to iCloud or
Dropbox, and migrate to Fastmail. But I know Google can afford to simply not
care.</p>

				<p><span>What if the future of energy could be as limitless as the stars? As nuclear fission powers today’s reactors, researchers are looking toward nuclear fusion as a cleaner, safer, and long-lasting source of energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Nuclear power plants are largely considered as one of the most reliable sources of energy. Inside the plants, reactors use fission to heat water into steam, which is then used to spin turbines and produce carbon-free electricity. However, nuclear fission produces nuclear waste, which requires great amounts of regulation for safe storage and disposal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Nuclear fusion, on the other hand, does not create long term radioactive waste. For years, scientists and experts have been looking to harness the power of nuclear fusion, but there has been no long term success due to the incredible amounts of pressure and high temperatures required in the nuclear fusion process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A team of researchers have been working on potential solutions to this issue for the past three years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Nuclear Fusion Project is the result of a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute research professor <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/jeff-schneider/">Jeff Schneider</a>, students from both the Robotics Institute and Machine Learning Department, and the </span><a href="https://www.pppl.gov/"><span>Princeton Plasma Physics Lab</span></a><span>.</span><span> With funding from the Department of Energy, the team has been able to make significant advancements using artificial intelligence (AI) to help control the challenging dynamics of nuclear fusion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Fission and fusion differ in how they create energy. Fission occurs when a neutron collides with a larger atom, forcing the atom to excite and split into two smaller atoms. Fusion occurs when two atoms collide and create a heavier atom, such as when two hydrogen atoms combine to create a helium atom. This process produces the intense energy that fuels the sun and stars.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We would like to mimic that process here on Earth in some way that’s controlled,” said Jeff Schneider. “The most successful way we’ve discovered so far is with a tokamak.”</span></p>

<p><span>Inside of tokamak reactors, hydrogen is superheated until it becomes a plasma. The plasma is formed into a donut shape, which is wrapped by magnets. The magnetic fields keep the plasma in place while it is heated to the temperatures and pressures needed to create a fusion reaction.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The problem is all the dynamics of the process are non-linear and unstable,” said Schneider. “What we’re doing is using AI to learn those dynamics and, more importantly, learn controllers that do online adjustments at high speeds to keep the plasma in place.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In June, the team brought together AI experts and plasma physicists to conduct experiments with the tokamak at the <a href="https://d3dfusion.org/">DIII-D National Fusion Facility</a> in San Diego.</span><span>&nbsp;The team focused on using machine learning algorithms to prevent a plasma instability known as a tearing mode. By employing a heating method similar to microwave technology, they targeted the heating to suppress tearing modes. As a result, they successfully reduced their occurrence during the experiment. A paper detailing these exciting results is currently in progress.</span></p>
<p><span>The Department of Energy has renewed its grant, providing an additional three years of funding for the team’s research. Building on their previous successes, they are preparing for their next experiment, which aims to further investigate the application of reinforcement learning in controlling key aspects of plasma behavior. This ongoing work is positioning Carnegie Mellon University as one of the leaders in global nuclear fusion research.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The implications of successful nuclear fusion are immense, offering a clean and abundant energy source that has the potential to help mitigate major global issues like climate change, water scarcity, and food distribution.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>2024-11-07 13:09</p>
<p>Instant messaging is dominated by mainstream apps today, each with their own ecosystems, closed protocols, and business models based on data collection and user engagement. In this landscape, XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) might seem like a relic, yet it offers a powerful, open, and privacy-respecting alternative that deserves more recognition. Despite its versatility and potential, XMPP has struggled to gain the popularity it deserves. Here, we'll explore why XMPP hasn't reached widespread adoption, why it remains relevant, and how it might be the best option for those seeking a flexible, secure, and open-source messaging tool.</p>
<h3>What makes XMPP unique?</h3>
<p>XMPP isn't just a messaging protocol; it's a foundational technology that provides decentralized, extensible communication. Built on XML, it supports a variety of messaging types (text, voice, video, and even file transfer) without being locked to a single platform or app. Since it's an open protocol, anyone can run their own XMPP server, maintain complete control of their data, and use any compatible client.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://xmpp.org/software/?platform=all-platforms">the wide array of XMPP clients</a> available across all major operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, KaiOS), users have a choice to pick the interface and features that suit them best. XMPP has a rich ecosystem of clients that cater to different preferences, from simple, lightweight clients to those packed with advanced features. And with <a href="https://xmpp.org/software/?platform=all-platforms">a plethora of servers</a> that can be self-hosted, including open-source options like <a href="https://prosody.im/">Prosody</a> and <a href="https://www.ejabberd.im/">ejabberd</a>, setting up a personal or community server is accessible, even for those with modest technical skills.</p>
<h3>Security and privacy with XMPP</h3>
<p>One of XMPP's major strengths is its potential for secure communication. Out of the box, XMPP can already secure messages with TLS encryption. However, it becomes much more versatile when you activate specific XEPs (XMPP Extension Protocols). Here are some that make XMPP even more robust and useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OMEMO (XEP-0384)</strong>: provides end-to-end encryption that ensures messages can't be read by anyone except the intended recipient(s), offering privacy similar to Signal's protocol.</li>
<li><strong>MAM (Message Archive Management, XEP-0313)</strong>: allows message synchronization across devices by enabling server-side message archiving, making it possible to retain and access message history across different clients without sacrificing privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Message Carbons (XEP-0280)</strong>: enables message synchronization across multiple devices by copying outgoing and incoming messages, ensuring conversations are consistent across all connected clients.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP File Upload (XEP-0363)</strong>: enables file sharing over XMPP by allowing users to upload files to a server via HTTP, making them accessible through secure links. This XEP facilitates sharing images, documents, and other files easily and securely within chats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these XEPs provide a way to make XMPP a secure, synchronized, and feature-rich messaging system across devices, rivaling what proprietary apps offer without requiring you to give up control or trust a third-party service.</p>
<h3>Why doesn't XMPP have more success?</h3>
<h4>1. <strong>Lack of awareness</strong></h4>
<p>XMPP doesn't have the marketing muscle that proprietary platforms enjoy. As a protocol, it doesn't have a single corporation pushing it forward. Instead, it relies on a community of developers and volunteers. This means the average person has likely never heard of XMPP, let alone considered using it.</p>
<h4>2. <strong>Fragmentation and inconsistency</strong></h4>
<p>With XMPP, the decentralized nature can be both a strength and a weakness. Unlike a centralized service, XMPP's decentralized model means that different clients and servers can have varying levels of compatibility depending on which XEPs are supported. For users, this can create friction and a sense of inconsistency, particularly when switching between clients or servers that may not fully implement the same extensions. However, <a href="https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Conferences/Summit_24">XMPP Summits</a> help developers to improve compatibility between software.</p>
<h4>3. <strong>Complexity and user experience</strong></h4>
<p>While setting up and running an XMPP server can be straightforward for someone with technical skills, it's not as effortless as signing up for a mainstream app. For the non-tech-savvy user, terms like "XEP", "OMEMO", and even "server" may feel overwhelming. XMPP's vast configurability is appealing to those who enjoy flexibility, but it can be daunting for users accustomed to more user-friendly apps. If you don't want to install an XMPP server, <a href="https://providers.xmpp.net/">just join an existing one</a>!</p>
<h4>4. <strong>Network effect</strong></h4>
<p>Mainstream messaging apps benefit from the network effect: the more people who use them, the more useful they become. XMPP has struggled to build this critical mass. When users open an XMPP client and see an empty contact list, they're likely to revert to apps where their friends, family, and colleagues are already present. If you have an XMPP address, share it with your contacts (as you do with your email address).</p>
<h3>Why XMPP is still the right tool for many</h3>
<p>For privacy advocates, technologists, and those who value control over their data, XMPP remains a compelling choice. Its decentralized architecture prevents single points of failure and <strong>mitigates risks of censorship or data exploitation</strong>. The fact that it's open-source means that the community can continually audit, improve, and adapt XMPP to new security standards without relying on a corporation's goodwill.</p>
<p>Even more, XMPP has a place in niches where decentralized control and configurability are essential. Many organizations, communities, and even countries with stringent data privacy laws are looking to open protocols like XMPP for their communication needs. Developers working on SmolWeb, IndieWeb, and LowTech projects may find that XMPP aligns with their principles far better than any centralized, corporate-owned platform.</p>
<h3>The future of XMPP</h3>
<p>For XMPP to gain traction, it needs a stronger ecosystem of clients with user-friendly interfaces and seamless integration of essential XEPs like OMEMO and MAM. Additionally, a larger user base could help dispel the perception that XMPP is only for "techies". Projects and communities like <a href="https://conversations.im/">Conversations</a> (on Android), <a href="https://dino.im/">Dino</a>, <a href="https://gajim.org/">Gajim</a> or <a href="https://www.kaidan.im/">Kaidan</a> (for desktop), <a href="https://siskin.im/">Siskin</a> or <a href="https://monal-im.org/">Monal</a> (for iOS) and <a href="https://git.disroot.org/badrihippo/convo">Convo</a> (for KaiOS) are working to close the user experience gap, making it easier for people to join and use XMPP networks without a technical background.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as concerns about data privacy and digital sovereignty grow, XMPP's appeal could increase among users and developers looking for alternatives to surveillance-heavy platforms. If more users discover the freedom and flexibility of XMPP, we might see a resurgence in interest, with new communities forming around this open standard.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Whether you're looking to host your own server, control your data, or explore an alternative to centralized platforms, XMPP is worth a look. If you are aware of the benefits of federated networks such as Fediverse or Email, XMPP should become your instant messaging tool!</p>

				<h3>from the <i>if-you-build-it-they-will-come</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>For years we’ve noted how U.S. broadband is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/09/20/as-net-neutrality-debate-reheats-remember-the-real-problem-is-telecom-monopoly-power/">expansive, patchy, and slow</a>&nbsp;thanks to mindless consolidation, regulatory capture, regional monopolization, and limited competition. That’s resulted in a growing number of pissed off towns, cities, cooperatives, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/02/18/chattanooga-built-own-broadband-network-now-top-ranked-work-home-city-us/">city-owned utilities</a>&nbsp;building their own, locally-owned broadband networks in a bid for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/05/31/community-owned-broadband-network-again-tops-list-of-most-popular-isps/">better, cheaper, faster broadband</a>.</p>
<p>Regional giants like Comcast, Charter, or AT&amp;T could have responded to this organic trend by offering better, cheaper, faster service. But ultimately they found it far cheaper to undermine these efforts via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/06/02/telecom-lobbyists-have-had-the-fcc-under-their-boot-heel-for-7-straight-years-and-nobody-much-seems-to-care/">regulatory capture</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/03/republicans-trying-to-kill-program-that-brings-affordable-broadband-to-the-poor/">congressional lobbying</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/04/comcast-brings-fiber-to-city-that-it-sued-7-years-ago-to-stop-fiber-rollout/">lawsuits</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/24/dumb-state-laws-blocking-community-broadband-could-mar-historic-subsidy-efforts/">protectionist state laws</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2014/08/04/minority-astroturf-group-gets-comcast-affiliated-news-site-to-remove-article-about-minority-astroturfing-net-neutrality/">misleading disinformation</a>.</p>
<p>Currently <a href="https://communitynets.org/content/state-state-preemption-stalled-moving-more-competitive-direction?mc_cid=229ee1be3f&amp;mc_eid=eb527a594e">sixteen states have laws</a> — usually ghost written by regional telecom monopolies — restrict or outright ban community broadband. Some of these laws are outright bans on community broadband, basically letting Comcast or AT&amp;T veto your local infrastructure voting rights. Others erect elaborate, cumbersome restrictions on the financing and expansion of such networks and <em>pretend that’s not a ban</em>. </p>
<p>The good news: The Institute For Local Self Reliance (where I study and write about broadband access) notes that these sixteen laws are a <a href="https://communitynets.org/content/state-state-preemption-stalled-moving-more-competitive-direction?mc_cid=229ee1be3f&amp;mc_eid=eb527a594e">notable reduction from the 21 state laws we had in 2020</a>. What caused the change? The pandemic home education and telecommuting boom highlighted the essential nature of broadband (or more accurately, the expensive, sluggish, terrible nature of monopoly options).</p>
<p>As a result, several states voted to roll back the efforts and <a href="https://communitynets.org/content/state-state-preemption-stalled-moving-more-competitive-direction?mc_cid=229ee1be3f&amp;mc_eid=eb527a594e">take a more serious look at community owned and operated broadband networks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In 2021,&nbsp;<a href="https://communitynets.org/content/arkansas-takes-huge-step-forward-removing-barriers-municipal-broadband">Arkansas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://communitynets.org/content/washington-state-removes-all-barriers-municipal-broadband">Washington</a>&nbsp;passed legislation significantly rolling back legislative barriers on publicly owned broadband networks. In 2023,&nbsp;<a href="https://communitynets.org/content/colorado-repeal-community-broadband-ban-turning-point-decades-making">Colorado</a>&nbsp;rolled back a law that required communities to hold a referendum vote to opt out of a state ban on municipal broadband. That law was repealed after over 120 communities across the state overwhelmingly voted to opt out of the state preemption law, fueled no doubt by the&nbsp;<a href="https://communitynets.org/content/municipal-broadband-colorado-big-winners-latest-wave-state-grants">success</a>&nbsp;of the municipal networks in&nbsp;<a href="https://estespark.colorado.gov/utilities">Estes Park</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://communitynets.org/content/fort-collins-municipal-network-celebrates-20000-subscriber-milestone">Fort Collins</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://communitynets.org/content/loveland-colorados-municipal-fiber-network-crosses-finish-line">Loveland</a>. In May of 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://communitynets.org/content/minnesota-strikes-down-preemption-laws-blocking-municipal-broadband">Minnesota</a>&nbsp;followed suit, rolling back its preemptions laws.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are numerous funding and deployment models when it comes to community broadband. Some municipalities build open access fiber networks themselves (see: <a href="https://www.utopiafiber.com/">Utah’s UTOPIA</a>), allowing for numerous competitors. Others are built off the back of city-owned electric utilities (see: <a href="https://epb.com/fi-speed-internet/?#choose-your-plan">Chattanooga’s EPB</a>). Some are fiber cooperatives (see the <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/weekly/how-did-north-dakota-become-crown-jewel-internet-midwest/">success had in North Dakota</a>). Some are public private partnerships.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/harvard-study-shows-why-big-telecom-is-terrified-of-community-run-broadband/">Data routinely shows</a> these networks provide faster, better, cheaper service than regional cable and phone giants. Staffed and backed by locals, they tend to be more in tune with the needs of locals. They’re extremely unlikely to engage in predatory pricing, privacy, or net neutrality violations. You’ll usually enjoy local customer service. They incentivize regional monopolies to actually try. </p>
<p>There’s $42.5 billion in infrastructure bill subsidies that should start reaching the states early next year. A lot of this money will land in the laps of the usual regional monopolies. But a lot of it is going to wind up in the hands of local community-owned networks, which is a dramatic policy shift from years past. As a result, companies like Charter, AT&amp;T, and Comcast have ramped up the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/11/04/telecoms-bankroll-more-misleading-attacks-on-community-broadband-networks/">use of fake consumer groups built specifically to mislead locals</a>.</p>
<p>Community broadband isn’t some magic panacea. Like any other business model, it requires competent planning, intelligent financing, and stellar leadership. But it should be the democratic choice of a community whether to pursue such options. Not the decision of a Comcast executive living half a world away.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/alphapapa">Adam Porter</a> (alphapapa) reached out to <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley">John
Wiegley</a> (johnw) to ask about his current Org Mode
workflow. John figured he'd experiment with a
braindumping/brainstorming conversation about Org
Mode in the hopes of getting more thoughts out of
his head and into articles or blog posts. Instead
of waiting until someone finally gets the time to
polish it into something beautifully concise and
insightful, they decided to let me share snippets
of the transcript in case that sparks other ideas.
Enjoy!

<div id="text-org-review">
<blockquote>
<p>
Today I was playing a lot with <a href="https://github.com/brabalan/org-review">org-review</a>. I'm
just trying to really incorporate a strong review
process because one of the things I started doing
recently is that this <a href="https://fireflies.ai/">[Fireflies AI]​</a> note taker
that's running in the background. Now, it produces
terrible transcripts, but it produces great
summaries. And at the bottom of every summary,
there's a list of all the action items that
everyone talked about associated with the names.
</p>

<p>
So I now have some automation, that will all I
have to do is download the word document and then
I have a whole process in the background that uses
Pandoc to convert it to Org Mode. Then I have
Elisp code that automatically will suck it into
the file that I dedicate to that particular
meeting.
</p>

<p>
It will auto-convert all of the action items into
Org-mode tasks where it's either a TODO if it's
for me, or if it's a task for somebody else,
tagged with their name.

Then, when I have a one-on-one with a person in
the future, I now have a one-on-one template that
populates that file, and part of the template is
under the agenda heading. It uses an a dynamic
block that I've written: a new type of dynamic
block that can pull from any agenda file. And what
it does is it [takes] from all of those meetings,
all of the action items that are still open that
are tagged with their name.
</p>

<p>
This has been actually really, really effective.
Now, I don't jump into a one-on-one being like,
"Well, I didn't prepare so I don't know what to
talk about." I've usually got like 10 to 30 items
to go through with them to just see. Did you
follow up? Did you complete this? Do we need to
talk about this more?
</p>

<p>
I want to incorporate org-review. Scheduling is
not sufficient for me to see my tasks. What I need
is something that is like scheduling, but isn't
scheduling. That's where org-review comes in. I
have a report that says: show me everything that
has never been reviewed or everything that is up
for review.
</p>

<p>
Then I have a whole Org key space within agenda
for pushing the next review date to a selected
date or a fixed quantity of time. So if I hit <code>r
r</code>, it'll prompt for the date that I want to see
that again. But if I hit <code>r w</code>, it'll just push it
out a week.
</p>

<p>
Every day I try to spend 15 minutes looking at the
review list of all the tasks that are subject for
review. I don't force myself to get through the
whole list. I count it as success if I get through
20 of the tasks. Because earlier I had 730 of
them, right? I was just chewing on them day by
day.
</p>

<p>
But now I'm building this into the Org agenda
population, because in the dynamic block match
query, I can actually say: only populate this
agenda with the tasks that are tagged for them
that are up for review. That way, if we're in the
one-on-one and they say, "Oh I'm working on that
but I won't get to it for a month," I'll say,
"Let's review that in a month." Then next week's
one-on-one won't show that tasks. I don't have to
do that mental filtering each time.
</p>

<p>
This is something I've been now using for a few
weeks. I have to say I'm still streamlining, I'm
still getting all the inertia out of the system by
automation as much as possible, but it's helping
me stay on top of a lot of tasks.
</p>

<p>
I'm surprised by how many action items every
single meeting generates. It's like, it's like
between 5 and 12 per meeting. And I have 3 to 7
meetings a day, so you can imagine that we're
generating up to a hundred action items a week.
</p>

<p>
In the past, I think a lot of it was just subject
to the whims of people's memory. They'll say, "I'm
going to do that," and then… Did they remember to
do that? Nobody's following up. Three months later, somewhere,
they'll go like, "Oh yeah we talked about that, didn't we?"
</p>

<p>
So I'm trying to now stem the the tide of lost
ideas. [My current approach] combines dynamic
blocks with <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">org-roam</a> templates to make new files
for every meeting and it combines org-review to
narrow down the candidate agendas each time
appropriately, and it combines a custom command to
show me a list of all tasks that are currently
needing review.
</p>

<p>
Reviewing isn't just about, "Is the thing done?"
It's also, "Did I tag it with the right names? Did
I delegate? Did I associate an effort quantity to
it?" (I'm using efforts now as a way to quickly
flag whether a day has become unrealistically over-full.)
</p>

<p>
I only started using <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Column-View.html">column view</a> very, very
recently. I've never used it before. But now that
I'm using <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Effort-Estimates.html">effort strings</a>, it does have some nice
features to it: the ability to see your properties
laid out in a table.

<h2 id="distinctions">John on making meaningful distinctions (semantic or operational)</h2>
<div id="text-distinctions">
<blockquote>
<p>
Today's agenda has 133 items on it. I need
ways to narrow that agenda down.
</p>

<p>
I've used a lot of different tasks management
philosophies. We're always looking for more
efficiency, and we're looking for more personal
adaptation to what works for us. I've gone
from system to system. What I'm starting to realize is
that the real value in all of these
systems is that they're different
enough from whatever you're using
today, that they will force you to
think about the system you're making
for yourself, that is their value.
</p>

<p>
That's why I think there should always be a huge
variety of such systems and people should always
be exploring them. I don't believe any one one
system can work for everybody, but we all need to
be reflecting on the systems that we use. Somebody
else showing you, "Hey, I do it this way" is a
really nice way to juxtapose whatever system
you're using.
</p>

<p>
I discovered through reading Karl Voit's articles
that there are three
principal information activities: searching, filtering, and browsing.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Hierarchies</b> assist with browsing.</li>
<li><b>Tagging</b> assist with filtering and keywords.</li>
<li><b>Metadata</b> assist with searching.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Those are the three general ways
that we approach our data.
</p>

<p>
We have to do work to draw distinctions between
that data. The whole reason that we're drawing
distinctions between that data is to narrow our
focus to what is important.
</p>

<p>
I have over 30,000 tasks in my Org Mode
overall. 23,000 of them are TODOs. Several
thousand of them are still currently open. I'm
never gonna see them all. Even if I wanted to, I'm
never gonna see them all. I don't know what to
search for. I don't know what the query should be.
I have to use tagging and scheduling and
categorization and everything.
I believe that that is the work
of a knowledge worker is to introduce
these distinctions. That takes
time and it takes effort.
</p>

<p>
What's really important is to draw meaningful
distinctions. Make distinctions that matter.
</p>

<p>
I could tag things with like the next time I go to
Walmart, so that I could do a filtered query to
show me all things that I might want to do at
Walmart, but is that worth the effort or is just
tagging it as an errand enough? Because that list
will get within the size range that I can now
eyeball them all and mentally filter out the
ones that I need for Walmart.
</p>

<p>
What makes a meaningful distinction? I
believe there are two things that make a
distinction meaningful. One is semantic, and one
is operational.
</p>

<p>
A <b>semantic distinction</b> is a distinction that
changes the meaning of the task. If I have a task
that says "Set up Zoom account", if that's in my
personal Org Mode, that has one level of priority
and one level of focused demand. If it's in my
work list, that has a totally different importance
and a totally different focused demand. It changes
the nature of the task from one that is low
urgency (maybe a curiosity) to high urgency that
might impact many people or affect how I can get
my work done. That distinction is meaningful or
semantic. It changes the meaning of the task.
</p>

<p>
An <b>operational distinction</b> changes how I
interact with the task. [For example, if I tag a
phone call, I can] group all of my phone calls
during a certain time of the day. That changes
my nature of interaction with the task. I'm doing
it at a different time of day or doing it in
conjunction with other tasks. That helps narrow my
focus during that section of time that I have
available for making calls. It's an operational
distinction. if it's changing how you interact
with the task.
</p>

<p>
You're succeeding at all of this if on any given
day and any given time, <b>what's in front of your
eyes is what should be in front of your eyes</b>.
That's what all of this is about. If an
operational distinction is not aiding you in that
effort, it's <b>not worth doing</b>. It's not
meaningful enough to go above the bar.

<h2 id="ex-distinctions">John on examples of distinctions that weren't personally worth it</h2>
<div id="text-ex-distinctions">
<blockquote>
<p>
I'm trying to narrow and optimize down to the
minimum distinctions necessary to remain
effective. If I can ever get rid of a distinction,
I'm happy to do it.
</p>

<p>
I used to have projects and have categories,
or what <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/">PARA</a> method calls areas.
Projects are different from areas and
that they have a definition of
completion and they have a deadline,
but that's the only distinction.
I realized that distinction
doesn't do me any good because
if it has a deadline, that's the distinction, right?
</p>

<p>
Calling it an area or calling it a project… I
can just have projects without deadlines and then
that's good enough. I have a query that shows me
all projects whose deadlines are coming up within
the next month, and then I'm aware of what I need
to be aware of. I don't need to make the
distinction between the ones that have and don't
have deadlines. I just need to assign a deadline
so the deadline was sufficient discrimination. I
didn't need the classification difference between
area and project.
</p>

<p>
And then [PARA's] distinction between projects,
areas, and archives. I realize that there's only
one operational benefit of an archive, and it's to
speed things up by excluding archives from the Org
ID database or from the org-roam-dbsync. That's
it. That's the only reason I would ever exclude
archives, because I want to search in archives.
org-agenda-custom-commands is already only looking
at open tasks. In a way, it's by implication
archiving anything that's done in terms of its
meaning.
</p>

<p>
This is all just an
example of me looking at the para
method and realizing that none of
their distinctions really meant something for me.
</p>

<p>
What was meaningful was:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it have a deadline?</li>
<li>Is it bounded or not bounded?</li>
<li>Do I want to included in the processing of items?</li>
<li>[Is it a habit?]</li>

<div id="outline-container-habits">
<h2 id="habits">John on habits</h2>
<div id="text-habits">
<blockquote>
<p>
I did decide to draw the distinction of habits. I
want them to look and feel different because I'm
trying to become more habit-heavy.
</p>

<p>
I read this really brilliant book called <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic
Habits</a> that I think has changed my life more than
any other. I've read a lot of really good time
management books but this book far and away has
made the biggest impact on my life. One of its
philosophical points that it makes that is so
profound is that goal-oriented thinking is less
successful in the long run than behavior-oriented
thinking or habit- or system-oriented thinking.
Instead of having a goal to clean your office,
have a habit to remove some piece of clutter from
your office like each time you stand up to go get
a snack. You seek habits that in the aggregate
will achieve the goals you seek to do.
</p>

<p>
I'm trying now to shift a lot of things in my
to-do lists that were goals. I'm trying to
identify the habits that will create systems of
behavior that will naturally lead to those goals.
I want habits to be first
class citizens, and I want to be
aware of the habits I'm creating.
</p>

<p>
I think the other thing that Atomic Habits
did is it changed my conception of what a habit
is. Before, I thought of a habit as "using the
exercise bike" or something like that, which
always made it a big enough task that I would keep
pushing it off. Then I would realize I'd pushed it
off for six months and then I would unschedule it
and give up on it because it was just it would
just be glaring at me with a look of doom from my
agenda list.
</p>

<p>
What's important is the consistency,
not the impact of any one particular
accomplishing of that habit.
It's a habit.
If I do it daily, it's doesn't matter
how much of it I do.
So even if it just means I get on the
bike and I spin the pedals for three
minutes, literally, that's successful
completion.
</p>

<p>
Any time you have a new habit, one of the
activities in mastering that habit is to keep
contracting the difficulty of the habit down,
down. You've got to make it so stupidly small and
simple to do, that you do it just for the fun of
marking it done in the agenda, right?
</p>

<p>
I have a habit to review my vocabulary lists
for languages that I'm learning. I'm okay with one
word. As long as I ran the app and I studied
one word, that's success.
</p>

<p>
What you find happening is that you'll do the one
word, and now because you're there, because you're
in the flow of it, you're like, "I'll do two. You know, I'm already here.
What's the big difficulty in doing
two?"
</p>

<p>
So you make the success bar super
low. You're trying to almost
trick yourself into getting into the
flow of whatever that activity is.
</p>

<p>
[org-habit org-ql list] So I have all of these
habits here, and every single habit on this list
is super easy to do. Five minutes is all that it
would take, or even one minute for most of them. I
use different little icons to group them. It also
keeps the title of the habit really small. I found
that when the titles were really long. I didn't
like reading it all the time. It just was a wall
of text. When it's these one word plus an icon, it
just kind of jumps out.

being a hamster on a hamster wheel.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, one of the timers is called flywheel
mode. The idea is: just do a little bit. Like, if
I'm just having a mental block, I can't stand working
on that test today, I'm going to do five minutes.
I can spend five minutes doing whatever. Next
time, we do 10 minutes in 15. Pretty soon, I'm
doing 45 minutes at a stretch. Maybe when I sit
down to do 5, I'll actually do 15. I'm just slowly building up that
mental momentum. I'll allow myself to quit after
5 minutes, but I end up doing 20.

<p>
Momentum is key. There's a flip side to this whole
concept of the value of iterative improvement. The
opposite remains also true.
</p>

<p>
<b>Consistent good is your best ally, and inconsistent bad is also your ally.</b> It's when the
reverse is true that you have inconsistent good
and consistent bad, that's what leads you into
roads of doom.
</p>

<p>
That never occurred to me before. I would always
be one of those people who would set myself up
with a goal, like, I want to lose 20 pounds. I
would struggle to achieve it. I would be dismayed
because of how hard it was to get there, and then
you'd have a day when you're like, you get off the
wagon and you're like, The game is lost. And then
and then you can't get back on again. Whereas now
it's like that wagon, it's not so easy to get off
of. I have to really make a concerted effort to be
consistently bad in order to make things horrible
again.
</p>

<p>
I almost want to change org-habit to have a
different kind of visualization, because streaks
are not motivators for me. Streaks punish you for
losing one day out of 200, right? I don't want a
graph that shows me streaks. I want a graph that
shows me consistency. If I have 200 days and I've
missed five of them, I'm super consistent. Maybe I
could do this with colors. Just show a bar with
that color, and don't show individual asterisks to
show when I did it or when I didn't do it, because
I find streaks anti-motivating.

<p>
The whole principle around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190218084858/http://llamagraphics.com/products/life-balance">Life Balance [by Llamagraphics]​</a> was: you take all of your tasks,
you categorize them, you associate difficulty
to them and priority and everything else. Then
it tries to use heuristics to determine if
your life is being balanced, [and it percolates certain tasks to the top of your list].
</p>

<p>
If the system's doing a
good job, then your agenda list
should always be A-Z pretty much
the best order in which you ought to
do things.
It didn't just do category-based
balance, it also did difficulty-based
balance. You should only be
doing super hard stuff once in a while. You do a hard
thing, then you do lots of easy
things, then you do a hard thing.
</p>

<p>
Now, I'm wondering… This idea of
momentum is very similar to the idea
of balance.
"Have established momentum
with a system of behavior" is similar
to "Have an established balance with
all of the tasks that I do related to
different activities."
Is there a data architecture that would allow me to do both of
these things.
</p>

<p>
The whole idea of making the habits be colors and
then sorting them according to the spectrum is
literally just to achieve balance among how much
attention I'm paying to different habits.

<p>
My fundamental system right now is
there's like two <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql">org-ql</a> views.
There's the view of tasks that are
scheduled for today or have a
deadline of today,
and then there's a view of tasks that
I've decided that they
need to be done, but I haven't
decided when to do them yet.
</p>

<p>
[Top list]: I just pick the next task off the list
or reschedule if it's not important enough now.
But then when that's empty, if it ever gets that
way, it's the second view. I decide, okay, there's
something I need to do. I can do that on Tuesday.
Then it disappears until I need to think about it
again.
</p>

<p>
This separates deciding what to do from when to
do. Then I can just switch into my own manager
mode for a moment, and then switch into "just put
your head down and do the work mode."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
[More details]
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The top view is basically tasks that have a
deadline, that are relevant to now (either
deadline today or in the past), or it's an item
that I've scheduled to work on today or in the
past.
</p>

<p>
The view below, that is items that have no
planning date. I need to give them one, or maybe
they can just sit in that list of projects that
have no next task. I use a project heading to
[note] something that needs to be subdivided if I
don't have a next task for it, then that'll show
up there to remind me to give it one. Once it has
a next task, [that] task would appear instead of
the project heading until I schedule it. Anything
I've forgotten to schedule yet will show up in
that list.
</p>

<p>
Below that I just have
a small window that shows me things.
I've completed or clocked in the past
week.
</p>

<p>
And then, another small window shows me anything
that's a project status so I can get an overview.
</p>

<p>
In the work file itself, I have a number of links
to org-ql views, like "Show me all my top level
projects," "Show me tasks I need to talk to my
boss about" or somebody else.

<blockquote>
<p>
Org Mode is really a database, right?
It's a database of of highly
structured data that has a lot of
associated metadata.
</p>

<p>
The value of that data requires a certain
level of consistency which is work that we have to
do. In the same way we do work drawing
distinctions, we need to do work to keep that data
consistent. Am I using this [property]? Am I using
this tag to mean the right thing or whatever? Karl
Voit says that one of the most valuable things if
you're going to use tagging to organize your data
is a constrained tag vocabulary. Make a fixed
list. Then it's an error if you tag something and
it's not in that list, because you either need to
expand the list or you need to choose a better
tag. That's really valuable.
</p>

<p>
Even though I use <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Org-Syntax.html">org-lint</a> on all my org files, I
found serious data errors. [The newline before an
initial star had been lost], and then Org wouldn't
see the entry. I never knew that it wasn't even
being a participant in any of my queries. I just didn't know stuff like that.
</p>

<p>
I created a whole bunch of Haskell libraries that
allow me to <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/org-jw">parse Org Mode data</a>. It's a very
opinionated parser. It's a very strict parser. It
will not parse data files that do not have the
exact shape and text and taxonomy that I want.
</p>

<p>
I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/org-jw/blob/main/org-lint/src/Org/Lint.hs">linting module</a> that basically encodes
every single rule that I have ever wanted to apply
to my data. Like, in the title of an Org Mode
heading. I don't want two spaces. I don't want
extra excess white space. That should be a rule
right?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
[Multiple examples, including when a file had TODO
entries but didn't have a TODO filetag.]
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
My linter makes sure that this rule is
consistently maintained. Being able to have an
aggressive, thorough, universal consistency
throughout all of my org data has really put my
mind at ease. I can't break my data because I just
won't be able to commit the broken data into git.
I find myself adding new linting rules on a weekly
basis. The more that I add, the more value my data
has, because the more regular it is, the more
normal, the more searchable.

Maybe I'll try <a href="https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits/discussions/689">Loop Habits</a>, which can export to CSV.</li>
<li>A custom consistency checker might be good to
make for things like tags, or at least an
interactive function that prompts me to choose
from a controlled vocabulary.</li>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Recent work suggests that large language models may implicitly learn world models. How should we assess this possibility? We formalize this question for the case where the underlying reality is governed by a deterministic finite automaton. This includes problems as diverse as simple logical reasoning, geographic navigation, game-playing, and chemistry. We propose new evaluation metrics for world model recovery inspired by the classic Myhill-Nerode theorem from language theory. We illustrate their utility in three domains: game playing, logic puzzles, and navigation. In all domains, the generative models we consider do well on existing diagnostics for assessing world models, but our evaluation metrics reveal their world models to be far less coherent than they appear. Such incoherence creates fragility: using a generative model to solve related but subtly different tasks can lead it to fail badly. Building generative models that meaningfully capture the underlying logic of the domains they model would be immensely valuable; our results suggest new ways to assess how close a given model is to that goal.

  <p>Incomplete data structures challenge our notion of mutability</p>
  <p><em>November 6, 2024</em></p>
</div>

<p>Chapter 15 from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262691635/the-art-of-prolog/">The Art of Prolog</a> contains this dictionary implementation:</p>
<pre><code>lookup(Key, dict(Key,X,Left,Right), Value) :-
    !,X=Value.
lookup(Key, dict(Keyl,X,Left,Right), Value) :-
    Key &lt; Keyl, lookup(Key,Left,Value).
lookup(Key, dict(Keyl,X,Left,Right), Value) :-
    Key &gt; Keyl, lookup(Key,Right,Value).
</code></pre>
<p>Believe it or not, these six lines of code implement a dictionary as an ordered, binary search tree. The rule <code>lookup/3</code> can be used to both add to and get from the dictionary.</p>
<p>This query calls <code>lookup/3</code> with a key, a variable, and a value. The variable is instantiated to a new dictionary containing the key-value pair and the variables <code>_A</code> and <code>_B</code> in the left and right branches:</p>
<pre><code>?- lookup(123, Dict, "foo").
   Dict = dict(123,"foo",_A,_B).
</code></pre>
<p>This query includes a second clause which adds another key-value pair, which is placed in the right branch of the first pair:</p>
<pre><code>?- lookup(123, Dict, "foo"),
   lookup(456, Dict, "bar").
   Dict = dict(123,"foo",_A,dict(456,"bar",_B,_C)).
</code></pre>
<h3 id="immutable">Immutable?</h3>
<p>Since values in logic programming are immutable - why does adding a key-value pair to the dictionary not need to copy and return a new version of the dictionary?</p>
<p>The answer is because it’s an incomplete data structure. The binary tree’s left and right branches are variables, whose values can be determined later. So the lookup rule traverses the tree until it finds a matching key, or it finds a variable and “unifies” that branch making its key and value match its arguments.</p>
<p>Instead of being mutable, the dictionary is partially-instantiated. Think of it as an unfinished sketch of a binary tree, where instead of <code>nil</code>, the leaves have a value of “TBD”.</p>
<p>Yet it’s immutable since once a concrete value is specified, it cannot be changed without making a copy.</p>
<p>A more commonly encountered incomplete data structure is the <a href="https://pbrown.me/blog/difference-lists-explored/">difference list</a>. These are partially-instantiated linked-lists with a variable for a tail. Prepending values to the tail appends them to the list in constant time.</p>
<h3 id="refactoring-the-dictionary">Refactoring the dictionary</h3>
<p>To get a key’s value, we provide the value as a variable:</p>
<pre><code>?- lookup(123, Dict, "foo"),
   lookup(123, Dict, Value).
   Dict = dict(123-"foo",_A,_B), Value = "foo".
</code></pre>
<p>Checking for existence is a little tricky though:</p>
<pre><code>?- lookup(123, Dict, Value).
   Dict = dict(123-Value,_A,_B).
</code></pre>
<p>The query “succeeded” but the value didn’t exist, we got a variable back! We can use <code>nonvar/1</code> to check that our variable contains a value</p>
<pre><code>?- lookup(123, Dict, Value), nonvar(Value).
   false.
</code></pre>
<p>The Art of Prolog authors Sterling and Shapiro note some other limitations of the dictionary:</p>
<blockquote>
<q>If the key is non-numeric, the predicates &lt; and &gt; must be generalized. The cut is necessary ... because of the nonlogical nature of comparison operators, which will give errors if keys are not instantiated.</q>

<p>—&nbsp;The Art of Prolog, Chapter 15.3, <em></em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>But that was twenty years ago. Let’s refactor it!</p>
<pre><code>lookup(Key, dict(Key1-Value1, Left, Right), Value) :-
  (   Key = Key1 -&gt;
      Value = Value1
  ;   compare(&lt;, Key, Key1) -&gt;
      lookup(Key, Left, Value)
  ;   lookup(Key, Right, Value)
  ).
</code></pre>
<p>This version uses a single rule, with an if/then control structure to avoid leaving behind choicepoints, since we know each key in the dictionary is unique.</p>
<p>Instead of a numeric comparison, it uses <code>compare/3</code> to sort any key types. This is a newer predicate which uses Prolog’s <a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/sorting">standard order</a> so keys can be strings, atoms, numbers, it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>We also store pairs as the pair type (<code>Key-Value</code>), instead of two separate values. This makes easy to serialize a dictionary into a list of pairs, which are sortable using the builtin <code>keysort/2</code>:</p>
<p>Extending our previous query:</p>
<pre><code>?- lookup(123, Dict, "foo"),
   lookup(456, Dict, "bar"),
   to_list(Dict, Ls),
   keysort(Ls, Ms).
   Ls = [456-"bar",123-"foo"],
   Ms = [123-"foo",456-"bar"].
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we can make our code clearer by wrapping <code>lookup/3</code> with two new rules: <code>add/3</code> and <code>get/3</code>.</p>
<p>The full implementation is on <a href="https://github.com/dnmfarrell/dict">GitHub</a>.</p>
