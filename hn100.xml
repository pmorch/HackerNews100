              <p>It is with great sadness that we announce John’s death on Friday, February 2, 2024. He was born in Maryland, USA to William and Bertha Walker, who preceded him in death. John is survived by his wife Roxie Walker and a brother, Bill Walker of West Virginia.</p>
<p>Declining to follow in his family tradition of becoming a medical doctor, John attended Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) to pursue a future in astronomy. However, after he discovered the brave new world of computers, he never looked back. John worked at the university’s Project Chi (X) computing center where he studied computer science and earned a degree in electrical engineering.</p>
<p>John met Roxie on Thanksgiving Day in 1972, and they married the following year. Roxie and John drove cross-country a few months later for John’s new job in California. Eventually he left that first job and worked at various others in the bay area. In late 1976, John designed his own circuit board based on the then-new Texas Instruments TMS9900 microprocessor. This venture became Marinchip Systems, and eventually led to Autodesk.</p>
<p>The beginnings of Autodesk are well documented by John himself in <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/">The Autodesk File</a> and from there John’s story is best told by John himself in his prodigious work, which is all methodically organized and available to the public at his website <a href="https://fourmilab.ch/">Fourmilab</a>.</p>

              <p>Former Ricochet/Ratburger member 10Cents writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First off, I suppose I should say I don’t feel up to the task to write a tribute for John Walker. I am sure others are more able. That is true, but here is my Dime’s worth.</p>
<p>I got to know John Walker on the <a href="http://ricochet.com/">ricochet.com</a> audio meet-ups (AMUs). He was a regular caller. Someone recently said that he was on those for over ten years. The AMU started at Ricochet but after I left there I started various ones which John joined. First at BallDiamondBall, then Ratburger which became the Scanalyst AMU without me. My guess he spent at least five hours a week since there were two or three calls per week. The AMUs were started by Curious John then through attrition I was left in charge. Now CTlaw is Mr. AMU.</p>
<p>I admired John for kindness in explaining things to almost anyone. I also appreciated his off-beat humor and stories. I learned a lot from him.</p>
<p>I don’t know about others, but I felt unbelievably surprised that someone like John would spend time with me. For me it was like going to the candy store but instead of candy it was insights and ideas. He brought so much to the table.</p>
<p>John was easy to take for granted because he was always there. He was a fixture in our lives. That fixture is gone. It is a struggle to think of life without him. It is hard not to cry at times.</p>
<p>I don’t know why John enjoyed our company but he did. I remember he teasing me when I came on a call. “There goes the neighborhood.” One of the last calls he invited me to “The Cheap Seats”. This was a part of his site where public domain movies could be seen. I am glad that the Ratburger experience showed him the way to start a forum site. He loved interacting with people on Scanalyst. And didn’t have the frustration of Wordpress there.</p>
<p>For those of us who got a lot of John’s time there are unending memories. For those of us who got a lot of John’s time, we struggle without the voice and wit we relied upon. I for one bow my head and humbly say thanks. I do wish I could have had a little bit more though.</p>
<p>I remember that John gave to this community day in and day out for years, first at Ratburger then at Scanalyst. He didn’t get a break. I calculate it was about six years. I am writing this post to fulfill my debt of gratitude to a kind man</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://blog.chriszacharias.com/a-conspiracy-to-kill-ie6">A Conspiracy To Kill IE6</a>
  </h2>
	<p>The bittersweet consequence of YouTube’s incredible growth is that so many stories will be lost underneath all of the layers of new paint. This is why I wanted to tell the story of how, ten years ago, a small team of web developers conspired to kill IE6 from inside YouTube and got away with it.</p>

<p>I do not recall the exact triggering event that led to our web development team laying out plans to kill IE6 over lunch in the YouTube cafeteria. Perhaps it was the time I pushed out a CSS stylesheet that included an attribute selector on a semi-supported HTML element. Any reasonable web developer would expect this to be ignored by browsers not up to the task. This was not the case with older flavors of IE. Under very specific conditions, an attribute selector on an unsupported HTML element in IE would create an internal recursion that would at best, cause the browser to crash and at worst, trigger a blue screen of death. Or perhaps it was the hundredth time one of our software engineers had innocently pushed out an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag with an empty src attribute. Nobody joining the team could be expected to know that in early versions of IE, the browser would load the root path “/” for empty src attributes. The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag would suddenly behave like an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, loading our homepage and all of its dependent resources in what could become an exponentially expanding recursive loop. Whenever an empty image tag found its way on to the homepage, it was all-hands-on-deck emergency to locate and replace the offending code before we melted our servers into paperweights.</p>

<p>Regardless of whatever the event at that time was, it had been brutal and it had been IE6 related. IE6 had been the bane of our web development team’s existence. At least one to two weeks every major sprint cycle had to be dedicated to fixing new UI that was breaking in IE6. Despite this pain, we were told we had to continue supporting IE6 because our users might be unable to upgrade or might be working at companies that were locked in. IE6 users represented around 18% of our user base at that point. We understood that we could not just drop support for it. However, sitting in that cafeteria, having only slept about a few hours each in the previous days, our compassion for these users had completely eroded away. We began collectively fantasizing about how we could exact our revenge on IE6. One idea rose to the surface that quickly captured everyone’s attention. Instead of outright dropping IE6 support, what if we just threatened to? How would users react? Would they revolt against YouTube? Would they mail death threats to our team like had happened in the past? Or would they suddenly become loud advocates of modern browsers? We openly daydreamed about cubicle workers around the world suddenly inventing creative “business” reasons for needing upgraded browsers. Grandparents would hold their technically savvy grand-kids hostage, demanding they fix their “YouTubes”. What had begun as a team therapy session started to materialize into an actual plan, a plan we quickly realized we were uniquely positioned to execute on. </p>

<p>The plan was very simple. We would put a small banner above the video player that would only show up for IE6 users. It would read “We will be phasing out support for your browser soon. Please upgrade to one of these more modern browsers.” Next to the text would be links to the current versions of the major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, IE8 and eventually, Opera. The text was intentionally vague and the timeline left completely undefined. We hoped that it was threatening enough to motivate end users to upgrade without forcing us to commit to any actual deprecation plan. Users would have the ability to close out this warning if they wanted to ignore it or deal with it later. The code was designed to be as subtle as possible so that it would not catch the attention of anyone monitoring our checkins. Nobody except the web development team used IE6 with any real regularity, so we knew it was unlikely anyone would notice our banner appear in the staging environment. We even delayed having the text translated for international users so that a translator asking for additional context could not inadvertently surface what we were doing. Next, we just needed a way to slip the code into production without anyone catching on.</p>

<p><img src="https://cz.imgix.net/youtube-ie6-highlight.png?fm=pjpg&amp;w=800&amp;border=1000" alt="YouTube IE6 Deprecation Banner"></p>

<p>The IE6 Deprecation Banner on YouTube in 2009</p>

<p>It turned out that a handful of us had entered YouTube at an interesting time… several months after YouTube had been acquired by Google but before Google had begun deeply integrating YouTube into their larger organization. The early YouTube engineers were rightfully territorial and initially hesitant to adapt to Google’s infrastructure and norms. With their penchants for gray-hat hacking, fast cars, and hard whiskey and an uncommon number of piercings, tattoos, and minor arrest records, many had been rejected during previous Google interviews. Ending up at YouTube instead, they found themselves breaking their backs to stay ahead of exponentially growing traffic while having to constantly defend against critics explaining how Google Video would imminently kill them. By the time they were acquired into Google, many of these engineers had come to view their outcast identity as a critical component of their eventual success. </p>

<p>To cement their authority over the YouTube codebase during the integration into Google, the early engineers created a specialized permission set called “OldTuber”. OldTuber granted you the ability to completely bypass the new Google-oriented code enforcement policies, enabling anyone holding it to commit code directly to the YouTube codebase, with only the most glancing of code reviews from anyone. No need for code readability. No need for exhaustive tests. No need for maintaining code coverage. If you broke the site by improperly wielding OldTuber status, it was on your head and you would lose the privilege immediately, if not your job. So you just had to be a good citizen and never break the site. Our boss, an early YouTube engineer himself, had gone out of his way to ingratiate the web development team with the rest of the early YouTube engineers. Through his efforts, a couple of us eventually found ourselves in possession of OldTuber status, despite never having been a part of the original team. It was like we were just walking down the street when someone mistook us for valets and handed us the keys to their Ferrari. For better or for worse, we were not exactly the types to just hand the keys back and walk away. We saw an opportunity in front of us to permanently cripple IE6 that we might never get again. If this went at all wrong, a number of us would surely be fired. Our most renegade web developer, an otherwise soft-spoken Croatian guy, insisted on checking in the code under his name, as a badge of personal honor, and the rest of us leveraged our OldTuber status to approve the code review. The code merged into production and our banner went live a few days later.</p>

<p>The first person to come by our desks was the PR team lead. He was a smart, dapper man who was always bubbling with energy and enthusiasm. Except this time. This time he was uncharacteristically prickly. He had come in on an otherwise normal day to find email from every major tech news publication asking why the second largest website on the planet was threatening to cut off access to nearly a fifth of its user base. Fortunately for us, the publications had already settled on a narrative that this was a major benefit to the Internet. By their call, YouTube was leading the charge towards making the web a faster, safer experience for all of its users. The entire PR team had Macs running Chrome and could not even see what we had done, let alone issue comments to the press on any of it. They were caught completely unaware. We eagerly told them everything about what we had launched and helped them craft the necessary talking points to expand on the narrative already established by the media. Satisfied that he could get back in front of the story, the PR team lead turned and warned us to never do anything like this without telling him first. He did not want to let great public relations opportunities like this slip by ever again.</p>

<p>Next came the lawyers. Two senior lawyers sprinted over to our desks in a state of buttoned-down panic. They immediately demanded that we remove the banner. We explained how we would need the SREs to do an emergency push and that it would take at least a few hours to do. Frustrated, one of the lawyers  asked “Why did you have to put Chrome first?” Confused, I explained that we did not give any priority to Chrome. Our boss, in on the conspiracy with us, had thoughtfully recommended that we randomize the order of the browsers listed and then cookie the random seed for each visitor so that the UI would not jump around between pages, which we had done. As luck would have it, these two lawyers still used IE6 to access certain legacy systems and had both ended up with random seeds that placed Chrome in the first position. Their fear was that by showing preferential treatment to Chrome, we might prick the ears of European regulators already on the lookout for any anti-competitive behavior. While the lawyers conceded that nothing we had done would have likely risen to that level of offense, it had happened on their watch and they did not appreciate that. I repeatedly cleared the cookies in my copy of IE6 and showed the browsers reshuffling with each refresh. Content with the demonstration, the lawyers quickly retreated back to their desks without any further concerns.</p>

<p>I expected the next people to be the engineering managers and that they would be the angriest given how clearly we had abused our OldTuber status. Suspiciously, nobody came by that day. The next day, a handful of engineers stopped by to congratulate us on the launch of the banner after reading articles around the Internet, but that was it. I asked my boss if he was getting any blowback and he shrugged, indicating that nobody had pulled him aside yet. It seemed that for the moment we were in the clear. Surprised and unable to make sense of this, I probed one of the managers about what he thought about the banner launching. He responded “Oh, I just figured you guys copied the banner that Google Docs had put up.” I was confused. How could Google Docs have beaten us to the punch on this? I opened up Google Docs in IE6 and sure enough, a banner very much like ours was showing at the top. It implored their users to upgrade to avoid breaking features in terms similarly vague to ours.</p>

<p>I had met a few engineers on the Google Docs team while working on some shared Javascript libraries. I reached out to one and asked how they had arrived at the decision to launch their own banner. He explained to me that they had been wanting to deprecate IE6 support for a long time but their managers would not let them for the same reasons we had always heard. One of their engineers testing in IE6 had noticed the YouTube banner pretty shortly after it went live and immediately took it to their manager as evidence as to why they should do the same. Shortly thereafter, the Google Docs engineers whipped up their own IE6 banner and pushed it into production, presumably under the mistaken assumption that we had done our diligence and had received all of the necessary approvals. The first time many Googlers heard chatter about IE6 banners was from email threads where other teams had begun asking if they could deprecate IE6 like Google Docs had. Luck would have it that this had included many of our managers. Amazingly, we had somehow bypassed detection as the originators of the IE6 banner inside of Google.</p>

<p>Eventually the YouTube engineering management did ask themselves how the decision to deprecate IE6 was ultimately made, given it happened so quickly and seemed conspicuously premature for a media site of our scale and with such a wide user base. Once they realized what had happened, they cornered our boss for details, grappled with the consequences of our actions and begrudgingly arrived at the conclusion that the ends had justified the means. Between YouTube, Google Docs, and several other Google properties posting IE6 banners, Google had given permission to every other site on the web to add their own. IE6 banners suddenly started appearing everywhere. Within one month, our YouTube IE6 user base was cut in half and over 10% of global IE6 traffic had dropped off while all other browsers increased in corresponding amounts. The results were better than our web development team had ever intended. </p>

<p>We somehow got away with our plan to kill IE6 without facing any meaningful corrective action. Few people even knew we were involved at all and those that did, did not want to bring attention to it or risk encouraging similar behavior. At a beer garden in San Francisco, our boss, winking his hardest, made us swear to never do anything like this again. We agreed, toasted IE6 falling into single digit percentages, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/23/bzzzzzz-youtube-gets-a-vuvuzela-button-seriously/">and never snuck anything into production again.</a></p>

   <p>It was the first day of spring break in 1992 in Phoenix,  and 12-year-old Heather Smith was excited for her family's upcoming ski trip.</p>   <p>But before Smith and her family had even packed their snow pants, she realized she didn't feel good. "I woke up feeling just a little bit nauseous, and I wasn't sure why. Throughout the course of the day, I started to feel worse and worse and started to develop pain in the abdomen," she says. </p>   <p>By about midafternoon, her father took her to urgent care. She ended up getting emergency surgery to have her appendix out.  </p>   
   <p>Smith still has a small scar from the appendectomy. And after the surgery, she found herself intrigued by the part of her body she had so suddenly lost. "It inspired me to wonder: Why do we have this weird little organ in the first place? What does it do? Why does it get inflamed?"</p>   <p><a href="https://facultyprofiles.midwestern.edu/55-heather-f-smith">Smith</a> grew up to be a professor of anatomy at Midwestern University and editor-in-chief of a journal called <a href="https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/19328494"><em>The Anatomical Record</em></a><em>.</em> And all these decades later, Smith has made a mark in the field by studying the very organ that threw off her family's vacation plans in 1992. </p>   <p>She acknowledges that the appendix has a bad rap as a useless organ that can cause you pain and require emergency surgery. "But it turns out recent research shows it does have functions that can help us," she says.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510351/short-wave">NPR's <em>Short Wave</em> </a>spoke to Smith about what the appendix is good for and how a future where appendicitis can be prevented or treated without emergency surgery could be on the way.</p>   <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. </em></p>   <p><strong>What and where is the appendix?</strong></p>   <p>The type of appendix that humans and some primates and rodents have looks like a little worm. It's about the size of your pinky finger, and it projects off the cecum, which is the first part of the large intestine. </p>   
   <p>You can identify the location based on a landmark called McBurney's point. So if you draw a line between your bellybutton and the part of your pelvis that sticks out [on the right], two thirds of the way down, that's about where the appendix is.</p>   <p><strong>How did scientists get the idea that the appendix was useless?</strong></p>   <p>There had been a lot of discussion about what the appendix might do as a function, whether it served a function, prior to [Charles] Darwin's time. The [fact] that we can live without it does provide some support for the idea that it's vestigial and it doesn't really do anything. And so Darwin's interpretation of it as a vestige was reasonable at the time, given the information that he had. </p>   <p>But now with modern technology, we can see things like the microanatomy and the biofilms in the appendix, and we have a better understanding of what it is and what it's doing.</p>   <p><strong>How has the appendix evolved over time? </strong></p>   <p>If you map the distribution of appendices across a phylogeny — a tree of mammal life — you can interpret that the appendix has actually <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jeb/article/22/10/1984/7324393">evolved independently</a>. It has appeared independently multiple times throughout mammalian evolution. So that is evidence that it must serve some adaptive function. It's unlikely that the same type of structure would keep appearing if it wasn't serving some beneficial role.</p>   <p><strong>So what are the appendix's beneficial roles? </strong></p>   <p>It turns out that the appendix appears to have two related functions. The first function is supporting the immune system. The appendix has a high concentration of immune tissue, so it's acting to help the immune system fight any bad things in the gut. </p>   <p>The second function that it serves is what we refer to as the safe house. So this was a hypothesis that was put forward by a team from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17936308/">Duke University in 2007</a>. And they argued that the appendix may serve as a safe reservoir for the beneficial gut bacteria that we have. </p>   
   <p>During times of gastrointestinal distress — you know, a diarrhea episode where all of your good gut bacteria is getting kind of flushed out of the system — the appendix is kind of this blind tube with a very narrow diameter and narrow lumen, so the good bacteria doesn't get flushed out of the appendix. The idea is it's safe during this time of gastrointestinal distress and it can then exit the appendix and recolonize this good bacteria throughout the rest of the gut. </p>   <p>So the appendix is kind of helping us in two ways, both within the gut: It's helping to fight off invading pathogens, but also to repopulate the gut with this beneficial bacteria after gastrointestinal issues.</p>   <p><strong>Why do some people get appendicitis?</strong></p>   <p>Appendicitis is predominantly happening in the industrialized nations of the world — areas where fiber content of the diet tends to be lower. So one hypothesis is that, with the lower fiber content, we're more likely to get little pieces of food that's being digested stuck [inside] the appendix and cut off blood supply and cause this inflammation. </p>   <p>The other hypothesis that doesn't seem like it's quite as plausible these days has to do with an old idea called the hygiene hypothesis. The idea is that these days we do so much oversanitization, with all of our antibacterials and all our antibiotics that we take, that our immune systems are not developing properly because they don't have exposure to the full range of pathogens that we would otherwise. And so the immune system overreacts and panics. And because the appendix has so much immune tissue, it's one of the areas where this manifests.  </p>   <p><strong>Could this new understanding lead to new treatments?</strong></p>   <p>I think there's some promising treatments out there. People are looking into antibiotics and other ways of treating appendicitis without completely removing it, given the evidence that is accumulating that it is in fact helpful for your health to have an appendix. Studies have shown that infections with the really bad, nasty bacteria <em>C. diff</em> tend to be higher in people who have had their appendix removed. </p>   
   <p>So there are health benefits to retaining the appendix. In an ideal world, we would have a future where we wouldn't have to always remove it.</p>   <p><strong>What have you gained from studying this "weird little organ"?</strong></p>   <p>I think this study has shown me the importance of looking into small anatomical details. Anatomy is just the study of the body, so you'd think that it's a dead science. You'd think we know everything about the body, especially the human body. </p>   <p>But it turns out that there's actually a lot more variation and function and microanatomical adaptations that haven't been fully realized. So doing just descriptive studies of exotic animals that have never been described or looking at small parts of our own bodies that haven't been well documented are absolutely worthwhile.</p>

      <p>Last September I hopped on board with <a href="https://www.wallapop.com/">Wallapop</a> as a Search Data Scientist and since then part of my work has been working with <a href="https://solr.apache.org/">Solr</a>, an open source search engine based on <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a>. I’ve got the basics of how a search engine works, but I had this itch to understand it even better. So, I rolled up my sleeves and decided to build one from scratch.</p>

<p>Now, let’s talk goals. Ever heard of the “<a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/19-website-discoverability-crisis/">Small Website Discoverability Crisis</a>”? The problem it’s basically that small websites, ones like this one, are impossible to be found using Google or any other search engine. My mission? Making those tiny websites great again. I believe in bringing back the glory of the little guys, away from the Google SEO frenzy.</p>

<p>In this post I will walk you through the journey of buliding a search engine from scratch using Python. As usual, all the code I’ve written can be found on my GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/alexmolas/microsearch">microsearch repo</a>). This implementation doesn’t pretend to be a production-ready search engine, just a usable toy example showing how a search engine works under the hood.</p>

<p>Also, let me be sincere and admit I’ve exaggerated a little bit in the post title. Indeed, the search engine I’ve implemented is around 80 lines of Python, but I’ve also written some complementary code (data crawler, API, HTML templates, etc.) that’s over makes the whole project a bit bigger. However, I think the interesting part of this project is the search engine which has less than 80 lines.</p>

<p>PS. After writing this post and <code>microsearch</code> I realized that Bart de Goede did <a href="https://github.com/bartdegoede/python-searchengine">something similar</a> a couple of years ago. My implementation is very similar to Bart’s, but in my case, I think I did some things better, in particular (1) my crawler is async, which makes things much faster, and (2) I’ve implemented a user interface that allows to interact with the search engine.</p>

<h2 id="microsearch">microsearch</h2>

<p>Now, let’s delve into the components that make up <code>microsearch</code> and explore how I crafted each element: (1) the crawler, (2) the inverted index, (3) the ranker, and (4) the interface. In the following sections, I’ll provide both theoretical descriptions and practical details on how each concept was implemented in my project.</p>

<h2 id="crawler">Crawler</h2>

<p>The first step to building a search engine is to have data to search. Depending on your use case you can crawl existing data (as <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers">Google</a> does) or you can use your own data (as Wallapop or any other e-commerce/marketplace does).</p>

<p>Since one of my intentions was to build a “local Google” I decided to use data from the blogs I follow to build the search engine. In this case, crawling consists of downloading and cleaning all the posts of a certain list of blogs. To make it easier I’ve only crawled posts of blogs with RSS <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. And to make it faster, I’ve used the <code>asyncio</code> Python library. Using asynchronous code has sped up the crawling time from 20 minutes to 20 seconds.</p>

<p>In my case, I’ve used a list of 642 RSS feeds. Of these feeds around 100 are the ones I usually read (blogs about ML, data science, math, etc.), and I scrapped the other 500 from <a href="https://github.com/surprisetalk/blogs.hn">surprisetalk blogs.hn project</a>.</p>

<h2 id="inverted-index">Inverted index</h2>

<p>An inverted index is a data structure that maps keywords to documents. This data structure makes it trivial to find documents where a certain word appears. When a user searches for some query the inverted index is used to retrieve all the documents that match with the keywords in the query.</p>

<p>To implement the inverted index I’ve used a <code>defaultdict</code> with the signature <code>dict[str, dict[str, int]]</code>. This is, a mapping that given a word (a <code>str</code>) returns another mapping from URL (a <code>str</code>) to the number of times that word appears in the URL (a <code>int</code>). The default value of the mapping is a mapping from URL to <code>0</code>, so if we try to get the value of a keyword that doesn’t exist in a URL we get a zero.</p>

<p>The logic of the inverted index is defined within a class called <code>SearchEngine</code>. We initialize it with two private dicts.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SearchEngine</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_index</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>]]</span> <span>=</span> <span>defaultdict</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span><span>:</span> <span>defaultdict</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>))</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then we implement the <code>index</code> methods, which receives an URL and its content, normalizes the content (ie: remove punctuation, everything to lowercase, etc.), and then add it to the index.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>index</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>[</span><span>url</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>content</span>
    <span>words</span> <span>=</span> <span>normalize_string</span><span>(</span><span>content</span><span>).</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>" "</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>word</span> <span>in</span> <span>words</span><span>:</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_index</span><span>[</span><span>word</span><span>][</span><span>url</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To make the indexing process more usable we can implement a bulk index option, which receives a list of URLs and documents and index them.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>bulk_index</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>documents</span><span>:</span> <span>list</span><span>[</span><span>tuple</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>]]):</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span> <span>in</span> <span>documents</span><span>:</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>index</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, we can read the index using the <code>get_url</code> method, which receives a keyword and returns the URLs that contain the keyword.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>get_urls</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>keyword</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>keyword</span> <span>=</span> <span>normalize_string</span><span>(</span><span>keyword</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_index</span><span>[</span><span>keyword</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, to index the document <code>Foo</code> with the text <code>Hello, World! My name is Foo!</code>, and the document <code>Bar</code> with the text <code>Hello, World! My name is Bar, I'm not Foo!</code> and then search for the word <code>Foo</code>, we can do it as</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> from microsearch.engine import engine
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.index<span>(</span><span>"Foo"</span>, <span>"Hello, World! My name is Foo!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.index<span>(</span><span>"Bar"</span>, <span>"Hello, World! My name is Bar, I'm not Foo!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.get_urls<span>(</span><span>"foo"</span><span>)</span>
defaultdict<span>(</span>&lt;class <span>'int'</span><span>&gt;</span>, <span>{</span><span>'Foo'</span>: 1, <span>'Bar'</span>: 1<span>})</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.get_urls<span>(</span><span>"Foo"</span><span>)</span>
defaultdict<span>(</span>&lt;class <span>'int'</span><span>&gt;</span>, <span>{</span><span>'Foo'</span>: 1, <span>'Bar'</span>: 1<span>})</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="ranker">Ranker</h2>

<p>Once you have a set of matching documents for a given query, you need a way to sort them. The most famous ranker is Google’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a>, which ranks documents based on the links. However, other options to rank the documents exist, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25">BM25</a>, which ranks documents based on the content. In my case, I decided to use the standard BM25. The score between a query $Q$ and a document $D$ is computed as</p>

\[\sum_{i=1}^n \text{IDF}(q_i) \frac{f(q_i, D)\times(k_1 + 1)}{f(q_i, D) + k_1 \left(1 - b + b \frac{|D|}{\text{avgdl}}\right)}\]

<p>where the query $Q$ contains the keywords $q_1$, $q_2$, …, $q_n$, the document $D$ has length $|D|$, the average length of a document is defined as $\text{avgdl}$, $k_1$ and $b$ are free parameters, $f(q_i, D)$ is the number of times that keyword $q_i$ appears in the document $D$, and finally $\text{IDF}(q_i)$ is the inverse document frequency, computed as</p>

\[\text{IDF}(q_i) = \ln \left(1 + \frac{N - n(q_i) + 0.5}{ n(q_i) + 0.5}\right)\]

<p>where $N$ is the number of documents and $n(q_i)$ is the number of documents containing $q_i$. There are other ways to compute the IDF, but apparently, you can justify this option from theoretical grounds.</p>

<p>With all this math we are ready to implement the missing part of our <code>SearchEngine</code> class. Firstly we add the constants $k_1$ and $b$ as parameters of our class</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SearchEngine</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>k1</span><span>:</span> <span>float</span> <span>=</span> <span>1.5</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>float</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.75</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_index</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>]]</span> <span>=</span> <span>defaultdict</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span><span>:</span> <span>defaultdict</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>))</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>k1</span> <span>=</span> <span>k1</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>b</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>now we expose some useful properties that we’ll use later</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@</span><span>property</span>
<span>def</span> <span>posts</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>list</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>

<span>@</span><span>property</span>
<span>def</span> <span>number_of_documents</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>)</span>

<span>@</span><span>property</span>
<span>def</span> <span>avdl</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span> 
    <span>return</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>d</span> <span>in</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>())</span> <span>/</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With this information, we are ready to implement our BM25 scorer. The first thing we need to implement is the inverse document frequency method</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>idf</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>kw</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>number_of_documents</span>
    <span>n_kw</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>get_urls</span><span>(</span><span>kw</span><span>))</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>log</span><span>((</span><span>N</span> <span>-</span> <span>n_kw</span> <span>+</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>n_kw</span> <span>+</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and with this method, we can finally implement the BM scorer. This method receives a keyword and returns a mapping from all the URLs that contain that keyword to their score.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>bm25</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>kw</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
    <span>idf_score</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>idf</span><span>(</span><span>kw</span><span>)</span>

        <span>numerator</span> <span>=</span> <span>freq</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>k1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>denominator</span> <span>=</span> <span>freq</span> <span>+</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>k1</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>b</span> <span>+</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>b</span> <span>*</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>[</span><span>url</span><span>])</span> <span>/</span> <span>avdl</span><span>)</span>
        <span>result</span><span>[</span><span>url</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>idf_score</span> <span>*</span> <span>numerator</span> <span>/</span> <span>denominator</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This method receives a keyword, and for all the indexed documents it computes the BM25 score for that keyword. With this method we can finally implement the <code>search</code> method, which will be the one we’ll use to make queries to our search engine.</p>

<p>The <code>search</code> method receives a query, normalizes it, extracts its keywords (ie: splits it by space), computes the BM25 scores for each keyword, and returns a dictionary of URLs with their total score.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>query</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>keywords</span> <span>=</span> <span>normalize_string</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>).</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>" "</span><span>)</span>
    <span>url_scores</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>kw</span> <span>in</span> <span>keywords</span><span>:</span>
        <span>kw_urls_score</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>bm25</span><span>(</span><span>kw</span><span>)</span>
        <span>url_scores</span> <span>=</span> <span>update_url_scores</span><span>(</span><span>url_scores</span><span>,</span> <span>kw_urls_score</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>url_scores</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Following the same example as before, we can use it to search as</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> from microsearch.engine import engine
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.index<span>(</span><span>"Foo"</span>, <span>"Hello, World! My name is Foo!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.index<span>(</span><span>"Bar"</span>, <span>"Hello, World! My name is Bar, I'm not Foo!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.search<span>(</span><span>"foo"</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span><span>'Foo'</span>: 0.19869271730423296, <span>'Bar'</span>: 0.16844281759753774<span>}</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.search<span>(</span><span>"foo bar"</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span><span>'Foo'</span>: 0.19869271730423296, <span>'Bar'</span>: 0.8088260293054897<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Putting everything together, we have a search engine class that implements the functionalities to index and search documents in less than 80 lines of code.</p>

<p>Finally, once we have a search engine, we want to expose it somehow. In my case, I decided to build a small FastAPI app that exposes an endpoint with the search engine, and then it also renders a simple webpage that allows you to search. To make the output easier to read I decided to just select the top-N URLs.</p>

<p>If you run it you’ll see something like</p>

  <figcaption>Search Engine interface.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>then you can introduce your queries using the search box and search the indexed documents. For example, if I search for <code>how to build a search engine?</code></p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.alexmolas.com/docs/search-engine/search-results.png" alt="Search results for the query `how to build a search engine`." width="700">
  <figcaption>Search results for the query `how to build a search engine`.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I’m aware this is not the nicest UI ever, and the UX can be improved a lot. However, it works fast, the results aren’t so bad, and most importantly, I’ve built it myself from scratch.</p>

<h2 id="missing-features">Missing features</h2>

<p>For the readers who usually work with search engines, it’s obvious that there are a lot of missing features in my implementation. This is a non-exhaustive list of what it’s missing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>This implementation doesn’t have <strong>query operators</strong>, ie operators that allow you to tune how the query behaves. For example, if you google <code>how to build a search engine -solr</code> you’ll get results that don’t contain the word <code>solr</code> in them.</li>
  <li>The reverse index works by indexing single keywords, and there’s no option to <strong>index n-grams</strong>. Google allows you to search for <code>"search engine"</code> (notice the double quotes) and it’ll only show you results where the two words appear in this specific order.</li>
  <li>Also, this implementation doesn’t have <strong>query or document expansion</strong>, so if you search <code>engine</code> you won’t get documents with the word <code>engines</code>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>crawling and indexing parts are independent</strong> but we could implement it in such a way that the indexing happens during the crawling, ie: as soon as we have a document we index it. This could be done asynchronously as well.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I’ve enjoyed a lot working on this project. It has helped me to understand better how Solr works under the hood, and while I still have a lot to learn I think I have a better intuition now.</p>

<p>As a side effect, I’ve also learned how amazing is writing asynchronous code for IO-bounded operations. My first implementation of the crawler took ages to finish, and with the async implementation, it took a moment to finish.</p>

<p>My next step on my journey to build a personal search engine is to implement semantic search capabilities in the search engine. I’ve been playing a bit with embedding models and ANN, so my next step is to add this functionality to microsearch. Keep tuned for more!</p>

<div>

<p>After reviewing the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen7-8700g-linux">Ryzen 7 8700G</a> and the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen5-8600g">Ryzen 5 8600G</a> as these new Zen 4 processors with RDNA3 integrated graphics, the latest AMD 8000G series CPU in the Linux benchmarking lab at Phoronix is the Ryzen 5 8500G. The Ryzen 5 8500G is a 6-core / 12-thread processor with RDNA3 graphics that retails for just $179 USD. Here's a look at how it's performing against other AMD and Intel processors on Ubuntu Linux. The Ryzen 5 8500G ends up being decent on the GPU side but making me genuinely excited is the Zen 4C prospects in the low-power space for AI workloads at the edge, low power servers, and other different deployments for great low-power performance. Under load this AVX-512 wielding budget desktop processor was typically pulling 50 Watts or less!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_1_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_1_med" alt="AMD Ryzen 5 8500G box"></a></p>
<p>Like the 8600G that retails for $229 USD, the Ryzen 5 8500G is also a 6-core / 12-thread part with RDNA3 graphics. However, with the 8500G it has a 3.5GHz base frequency compared to 4.3GHz with the 8600G while both boost up to 5.0GHz. The other big difference is that while the Ryzen 5 8600G is made up of all Zen 4 cores, the 8500G consists of two Zen 4 cores and then four Zen 4C cores. The denser, more power efficient Zen 4C cores are found on the 8500G (and Ryzen 5 8300G) while still maintaining the same 65 Watt TDP rating as the rest of the 8000G series.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_2_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_2_med" alt="AMD Ryzen 5 8500G processor"></a></p>
<p>The Ryzen 5 8500G also has Radeon 740M RDNA3 integrated graphics with four graphics cores clocking up to 2.8GHz compared to the Radeon 760M graphics on the Ryzen 5 8600G with 8 graphics cores at 2.8GHz. The flagship Ryzen 7 8700G as a reminder has Radeon 780M integrated graphics with 12 graphics cores at 2.9GHz. Another difference with this sub-$200 processor is there is no Ryzen AI support unlike with the 8600G/8700G models. Most though won't be particularly missing out on Ryzen AI right now... The software support for now is limited and it was only very recently that <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-XDNA-Linux-Driver-Ryzen-AI">AMD released an XDNA Linux driver</a> that is still to-be-tested at Phoronix. So for the near-term the lack of Ryzen AI with the Ryzen 5 8500G isn't any real loss but over the longer term if the software ecosystem support for it expands and AI continues to be widely embraced by more Linux desktop software, it will be more of a penalty without it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_3_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_3_med" alt="AMD Ryzen 5 8500G bottom"></a></p>
<p>The Ryzen 5 8500G does still have a 6MB L2 cache and 16MB L3 cache like the 8600G model. While the default TDP is 65 Watts, there is a configurable TDP from 45 to 65 Watts. The cTDP benchmarks of the 8000G series will be part of follow-up benchmarks on Phoronix.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_4_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_4_med" alt="AMD Ryzen 5 8500G heatsink"></a></p>
<p>Also as follow-up benchmarks will be looking in close detail at the Zen 4 vs. Zen 4C core performance on the Ryzen 5 8500G among other interesting benchmarks.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>A few weeks ago, I got scammed buying a camera on Facebook Marketplace.</p><p>I bought the camera from a profile that was created in 2017. They had some other things for sale, too. The account looked legit — lots of family photos and comments from family members.</p><p>I paid $1,030 using PayPal, selecting “Goods and Services” because I knew I’d be protected by PayPal in case of a scam.</p><p>They didn’t ship out the item that evening or the next day, so I got antsy and texted them. They finally sent me a UPS tracking link for my package, but then they immediately said they were very worried because I had opened a PayPal claim against them. I had not. I checked my PayPal account. <em>I had?</em> They pleaded with me to close it.</p><p>I know that I didn’t open it. I was eating dinner at the time that it was opened.</p><p>But I realized that, once you close a case on PayPal, you can’t open it again. So when the package arrived and was something else, I would have no recourse.</p><p>Instead of closing it, I pretended that I couldn’t see the case on my end and even sent doctored screenshots of the case not showing up.</p><p>The next morning, I called PayPal and asked them how the seller could’ve opened a case on my behalf against themselves. They weren’t sure.</p><p>I kept the case open. A few days later, while on a bike ride, I received an email that the case had been closed. By me. By me?? I didn’t do that.</p><p>I raced home and called PayPal. Again, they didn’t know how that was possible. But they were understanding and explained that, once the package arrived and wasn’t a camera, I actually could open another case. You just can’t open a case a second time for the <em>same issue</em>. But the scammer opened an “Item not received” case against themselves, and I could file again as “Item not as described.”</p><p>The UPS package was delivered a few days later — according to the tracking number, at least. It was signed for by “ATWOOD.” I don’t know anyone named Atwood.</p><p>I called UPS. For security reasons, they couldn’t tell me where the package was headed, but they did confirm that it wasn’t my address or my name. It was an address in Lexington though, so the UPS tracking website would show “Lexington, MA” (but it doesn’t show the exact address, which the scammer must’ve known).</p><p>I called PayPal again and explained. They took the tracking number and called UPS, and were somehow able to find out exactly where the package was heading. (This feels like it was against UPS protocol.)</p><p>I looked up the address and found that it was for Lincoln Labs, an MIT lab in Lexington. I guess the scammer chose a random commercial address that was in Lexington.</p><p>They logged all this as evidence, and re-opened the “Item not received” claim. The scammer now had 10 days to provide evidence to the contrary, otherwise I would automatically be refunded.</p><p>10 days later, I woke up to see that the scammer had added a tracking number to the case. It was the same tracking number they had given me, the one that PayPal knew wasn’t headed to me, so that was perfect. I logged into PayPal, and… <em>I</em> had closed the case. Again. This time at 2am, while I was asleep.</p><p>I spent 2.5 hours on Saturday morning calling PayPal, and eventually got to someone who was very helpful. I had to explain that I actually <em>didn’t</em> close that case. They re-opened the case for a second time, and escalated it so the “back-office team” could review in a few days. I just hoped that the scammer wouldn’t close the case on my behalf for a third time.</p><p>A few days later, I received the final update: I was refunded $1,030. <em>whew.</em></p><p>I’m still not sure how the scammer was able to open and close cases on my behalf. My theory is that they were able to spoof my phone number and call PayPal support and do it over the phone. (They asked early on for my phone number “for the tracking information,” which in retrospect doesn’t make a lot of sense.)</p><p>But in any case, I got my money back! Thanks PayPal :)</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<p>A woman in Connecticut suddenly began getting mail advertisements for cremation services soon after she completed chemotherapy, according to a startling anecdote in a <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/AG/Press_Releases/2024/CTDPA-Final-Report.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>new report by the state’s attorney general’s office</u></a>. According to the report, she was added to a marketing list for the cremation company by a data broker.&nbsp;</p><p>Arielle Garcia, former chief privacy officer at the marketing firm UM Worldwide, first caught the cremation <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/what-do-we-say-to-emily-the-human-cost-of-advertising-data-abuse/?ref=404media.co"><u>anecdote in a column for the blog AdExchanger</u></a>, where she wrote “We can guess how the marketing logic flowed … ‘Inference: Terminal Illness?’ ‘Interest: Likely Purchase – Burial/Cremation.’”&nbsp;</p><p>We don’t know specifically what happened in this Connecticut case, whether it was extrapolated from location data, or how a data broker decided to put her on this specific list. The FTC has previously noted that data brokers often are able to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/data-brokers-call-transparency-accountability-report-federal-trade-commission-may-2014/140527databrokerreport.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>get access to medical records</u></a> or other medical information. But laws like the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, which give consumers the right to “delete personal data provided by, or obtained about, the consumer” and allows the state attorney general to investigate and publicize complaints about data brokers, is showing just how unsettling some of this targeting can be.&nbsp;</p><!--members-only--><p>After the woman filed a complaint under the state’s new data privacy law, the attorney general’s office investigated why this happened, and found that a “data broker identified the individual for the marketing list” for the cremation services company. “This matter has brought to light the close interplay between data brokers and data analytics firms in the digital marketing landscape.”&nbsp;</p><p>The woman and the companies involved are not identified in the report, but it states that the state office of the attorney general “issued a cure notice” to the cremation services company, which suggests that it found some level of wrongdoing. I’ve requested a redacted version of the complaint and the investigation both through the attorney general’s press office and through a public records request.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, our reporting has shown how granular and insidious data brokers can be, and Joseph’s reporting in particular has highlighted how data is harvested and sold from highly sensitive sources all the time. His reporting has shown, for example, that cell phone location data <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vzjb/location-data-abortion-clinics-safegraph-planned-parenthood?ref=404media.co"><u>could be bought for abortion clinics</u></a>; other research has shown that it can be trivially easy to de-anonymize this type of data (if it is even anonymized in the first place). Last month, the FTC finally stopped a single data broker, called X-mode, <a href="https://www.404media.co/impact-ftc-stops-x-mode-selling-sensitive-location-data/"><u>from selling sensitive location data</u></a>.</p><p>The Connecticut attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<iframe title="Vision Pro Teardown Part 2 - Is the Apple Vision Pro Really 4K?" width="456" height="257" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wt22M5nWJ4Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>After the whirlwind of team activity that was <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/90137/vision-pro-teardown-why-those-fake-eyes-look-so-weird">our initial Vision Pro teardown</a>, we’ve been digging much, much deeper into those dual displays, the multitude of sensors, the lenses, and that beautifully-overengineered battery pack. And not to spoil the surprise, but we’ve found that those dual displays are utterly incredible: You can fit more than 50 Vision Pro pixels into the space of a single iPhone 15 Pro pixel. Yes, you read that right.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/x8otrZt8bt_-Igqn5YnuHtk_DtEfflOVvw7dcXgiJn6tz5riSj7ILCq_ukfKy95hgE559U8Un319Mjx3vdcpqhUh0b7huhHIBqf9k75XPP_X5vfQNJcBz_FzS0e0GN8zo0iJDZpXnwVJUSzb_N-hxQo" alt=""></figure></div>


<h2>Displays</h2>



<p>Apple says that the Vision Pro’s displays offer “more pixels than a 4K TV for each eye.”&nbsp; But what exactly does 4K, or any K, mean <em>this</em> close to your eyeballs? Your phone has a much higher pixel density than your TV, for example, and yet you cannot see the pixels on either in normal use. So let’s get into the details, guided by our senior tech writer <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/User/2315556/Arthur+Shi">Arthur Shi</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First up, let’s talk about the two measurements that matter. Pixels per inch, or PPI, is what it sounds like—the number of pixels crammed into a given area of the screen. It’s an absolute measure, based on the physical properties of the device.</p>



<p>Then there are pixels per degree (PPD). PPD takes into account your distance from the screen. The closer your eyes get to the screen, the easier it is for you to make out individual pixels, which is why your phone’s screen needs a higher resolution than your TV, and why a movie at the theater looks fine, even though it may only be 2K. So what does that mean for the Vision Pro?</p>



<h2>Pixels Per Inch, Where Size Matters</h2>



<figure><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1922" height="844" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06213444/Vision-pro-lens-stack.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06213444/Vision-pro-lens-stack.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06213444/Vision-pro-lens-stack-1536x674.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"></figure>



<p>Each lens assembly has a pancake lens array, a housing with embedded eye-tracking cameras, and a display panel. The display panels are most likely made by Sony—possibly a custom version of their <a href="https://www.sony-semicon.com/en/products/microdisplay/oled.html">microOLED displays</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The display doesn’t light up from edge to edge, so we’re only counting the lit portion of each panel. The lit sensor area measures around 27.5&nbsp;mm wide by 24&nbsp;mm high, or about one inch by one inch. Using an <a href="https://www.olympus-ims.com/en/microscope/dsx/">Evident Scientific DSX1000 microscope</a>, we measured the pixels at 7.5 μm (the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2998922/#:~:text=The%20discocyte%20shape%20of%20human,contained%20in%20the%20RBC%20cytosol.">size of a red blood cell</a>). Each pixel is roughly a square: red and green sub-pixels stacked on top of each other, with a double-sized blue sub-pixel on the side. With those measurements, the lit area totals 3660 px by 3200 px. That equates to 12,078,000 pixels smushed into 0.98 square inches!</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06211331/AVP-pixels.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>But the corners are cut off, so that reduces the pixel count even further. It’s asymmetrical, with triangular corner cut-off areas of 6.95 mm<sup>2</sup>, 11.52 mm<sup>2</sup>, 9.9 mm<sup>2</sup>, and 10.15 mm<sup>2</sup>, totaling 38.52 mm of deactivated screen. Compare that to the total area of around 660&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>, and we see that the corners cut off 5.3% of the total, leaving 11,437,866 visible pixels per panel. Counting both panels and a margin of error on our side, that’s the 23,000,000 pixels Apple claims.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1922" height="778" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06211930/Vision-Pro-interior-screen.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06211930/Vision-Pro-interior-screen.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06211930/Vision-Pro-interior-screen-1536x622.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"><figcaption>Sensor with screen-captured image superimposed to demonstrate the lit area.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Divide those pixels by the length/width, and you can calculate the PPI (pixels per inch), which as mentioned is a measurement of pixel density. The Vision Pro comes in at a stunning 3,386 PPI. This, says Arthur, “is AMAZING PPI!” (his caps, not mine).</p>



<p>That many pixels must make the Vision Pro 4K, right? The horizontal resolution on the panel doesn’t <em>quite</em> make it to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution">consumer 4K UHD standard</a> of 3,840 pixels wide. In short, this is a seriously high-res display. But it’s not <em>technically</em> 4K, which is why Apple didn’t simply call these 4K panels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s certainly the highest-density display that we’ve ever seen. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Pro Max has around 460 PPI, which means you can fit ~54 Vision Pro pixels into a single iPhone pixel.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/XIaNN13vzyyvQKCTpmA4ybYcd6SDfh5VkMr6PvIKJnaTOteIcnrUnEzA8K2Bkmeogo5cB_IBxJpjeY5H0FbbffENvcQ-oSxWomSzC22iJNR3UbLjAnox7t9aK9bdJ9U3ujvbeMEbXjZPyKc0TR7CQXA" alt=""></figure>



<p>Or how about the 12.9-inch iPad Pro? That has 264 PPI, making the Vision Pro 12.8x finer. For a direct comparison to another VR headset, the HTC Vive Pro has ~<a href="https://versus.com/en/htc-vive-pro-2">950 PPI</a> (4896 px × 2448 px), less than a <em>third</em> of the Vision Pro, and the Meta Quest 3 has ~1218 PPI. Don’t worry, it gets weirder.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Pixels Per Degree: It’s All About the Angle</h2>



<p>A high pixel density alone doesn’t guarantee a great visual resolution. Consider a 65″ 4K TV, which has a “paltry” 68 PPI. But your 4K movie still looks great on it. Why? Because you’re sitting pretty far away from the TV, effectively shrinking all the pixels down to a small area. The further away you sit, the higher the PPI scales. Think of how the Jumbotron at your local sports venue doesn’t look pixelated when you’re sitting across the stadium.</p>



<p>Because of this, VR engineers like to use a slightly fancier metric to measure display “goodness”: angular resolution, measured in <a href="https://pimax.com/five-ways-the-crystal-is-different/">pixels per degree</a>, or PPD. This is the number of horizontal pixels per degree of viewing angle, and it lets us compare between displays with different resolutions, designed to be viewed at different distances.</p>



<p>But even that isn’t the whole story, for a variety of reasons:</p>



<ul>
<li>The PPD changes from the edge of the screen vs. the center.</li>



<li>Lenses intentionally distort and tweak the PPDs in wonky ways.</li>



<li>Stereoscopic views affect how many “pixels” are seen, muddying calculations.</li>
</ul>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/OCMkngmt-HvzyrCRT-5uxvXOOBD6W30r-ShiGXJONerMllZjsXz--KrL3vmmkOXYjecic_DAc9fvLKgXl9zx-3FrH2EqrvWF9ckWhH3jAKX9OTK25VA6w-1AadCfdI2ybw13GzDMjruKWKDxz3aysl4" alt=""><figcaption>The Vision Pro’s pancake lens distorts the display, complicating PPD calculations.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>With a rough measurement of 100° FOV (Field of View), we </strong><strong><em>estimate</em></strong><strong> the Vision Pro to have an average of 34 PPD.</strong> In comparison, a 65″ 4K TV viewed 6.5 feet away is 95 average PPD, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max held 1 foot away is 94 average PPD. Even though the pixel density and physical dimensions are drastically different between the iPhone and the 65” TV, they end up having similar PPD simply because of how they’re viewed.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iY2zEUio8NBfFbEqJ3O_rs8TQrgkMyZOA0Xw-ZXZYV4oG48lbGMZaHWUkWgPtrqP5TcpzqsWLH0uj9A5jMdFo5ntjbix8_Jh-RlLbPxOUZOiyZ52I-V0nI28YHOHyn5fg0dDo0JpoDvBP5oUoyy5-VE" alt=""></figure>



<p>Tl;dr: The Vision Pro may have an ultra-high resolution (PPI) display, but because it’s so close to the eye, it has low angular resolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a final example, friend of iFixit <a href="https://kguttag.com/2023/08/09/apple-vision-pro-part-5b-more-on-monitor-replacement-is-ridiculous/">Karl Guttag has a blog post explaining</a> why using the Vision Pro as a replacement for a good monitor is “ridiculous.” The gist is that when you beam the Mac’s output into the Vision Pro, and suspend it in the air in front of you, you’re only using a small portion of the available pixels. Even if the Vision Pro’s displays were really 4K, you’d only be using a small central section, with the rest of the pixels used to show the surrounding room.</p>



<p>This, says Karl, makes for a virtual Mac display with low enough PPD to see individual pixels—not quite the standard desktop display experience. So while you will totally be able to use your Mac in your virtual world, you will prefer an <em>actual</em> 4K or 5K monitor for fine work.</p>



<p>Then again, even if you shell out 200 bucks for the huge carrying case, the Vision Pro is way more portable than an Apple Studio Display.</p>



<h2>Lenses</h2>



<p>Wearing glasses under your VR headset is less than ideal—Apple’s answer is to add accessory lenses inside, for the Vision Pro, those lenses are made by noted German optics specialist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG">ZEISS</a> and snap into place magnetically.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/b9zgPhShorA_SrsDhKT2sI35l1Q8Mb2FG8Y9BcX2sQ25X031wxzowYYBmSus0Zo-5jmNT27zr_wW5j8ldarRMTy0BqAVYFP9qyx5g242e85v5doOoogeO1B6Yn-p9w1Ljk0Fj0PBo6cFA6NqtQ_hpDo" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>Each lens comes with a pairing code, although this isn’t <em>quite</em> the same kind of <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/69320/how-parts-pairing-kills-independent-repair">parts pairing</a> we usually deal with. These codes don’t lock a component to a single device. If you want to remove your prescription lens inserts from your own Vision Pro and drop them into a friend’s unit, you can. You’ll just have to pair them with the new headset by inputting the same code. The Vision Pro they’re being swapped into has to know the prescription of those lenses and calibrate accordingly, hence the little QR-type code you scan by looking at it during the setup process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, it <em>is</em> parts pairing in that a secret handshake code is required to install lenses—giving ZEISS a solid monopoly, at least for now. It also means that any typos or shipping snafus might <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro">render your new lenses useless</a>, at least temporarily.</p>



<p>You’d think that submitting a prescription would be enough to get the Vision Pro calibrated with your lenses—even if Apple is doing <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117731">some fancy footwork</a>—but without transparency, we can’t be sure.</p>



<p>The Vision Pro has another small problem for spectacles wearers. Contrary to some reports, Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213965">says that corrective lenses are available</a> for most conditions, including astigmatism (which we weren’t sure about <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/90137/vision-pro-teardown-why-those-fake-eyes-look-so-weird">in part one</a>), and they also offer bifocals, and progressives. But if you have a prism value included in your prescription, you’re out of luck. Prism correction is used to <a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/glasses-contacts/what-is-prism-correction-in-eyeglasses">correct for diplopia</a>, or double vision. The easiest way to see if your vision prescription is supported is to use <a href="https://www.zeiss.com/vision-care/us/zeiss-optical-inserts/prescription-guide.html#prescriptionchecker">ZEISS’s online tool</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The theme of this device appears to be that well-tailored comfort is fairly simple to achieve, as long as you go through the official channels.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Batteries</h2>



<p>By Apple logic, a complex device requires an equally complex battery solution. The hefty battery bank—$200 from Apple if you want to buy it separately—is both super simple and hilariously over-engineered.</p>



<p>Looking like a bulked-up first-gen iPhone, the case is milled out of a single chunk of aluminum, and the lid snaps into place with firm perimeter clips, leaving little to no seam for us to pry at. We needed a hammer and chisel to open it up! Adhesive also lines the lid, just to make sure you get the message: this pack is not designed to be opened.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1922" height="811" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06212145/AVP_TD_EDITED_160.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06212145/AVP_TD_EDITED_160.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06212145/AVP_TD_EDITED_160-1536x648.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"></figure>



<p>As for the battery cells themselves, Apple’s using three iPhone-battery-sized packs stacked atop each other, connected in series. We pulled out an iPhone 15 Plus battery to compare and found that it’s ever-so-slightly smaller in area while being a tad thicker.</p>



<p>The cells in our Vision Pro pack are listed at 15.36 Wh a piece, suggesting a 46.08 Wh total capability. That doesn’t quite track with the 35.9 Wh rating etched on the pack’s (gorgeous) aluminum enclosure. This, at first glance, looks like Apple’s undershooting the Watt-hour rating by over 20 percent. Apple’s no stranger to battery life debacles, so there’s a chance they’re purposefully undercharging the cells for longevity—the same reason they just released an 80% charging limit on the iPhone 15 Pro. Or perhaps they’re calculating Wh differently, accounting for thermal losses, or something else.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1922" height="814" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06213624/vision-pro-battery.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06213624/vision-pro-battery.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06213624/vision-pro-battery-1536x651.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"><figcaption>Left: One of three battery cells with factory 15.36 Wh ratings. Right: Battery pack labeled 35.9 Wh—10 Wh less than expected.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Apple is clearly obsessive over the user experience with this battery, packing in temperature sensors and an accelerometer (so it displays the charge LED when you hold it up, and might even detect when you are wearing the pack). If you’re putting a battery in your pocket for two hours straight, then you really, really don’t want it to get hot.</p>



<p>The pack is also outputting a non-USB-standard 13 volts to keep up with the Vision Pro’s processing demands, which is one explanation for the bespoke “big Lightning” cable—so you don’t accidentally plug other devices in and fry them. It also explains why you can’t just plug it straight into a USB-C battery pack. In fact, the Vision Pro’s battery pack has enough tech to act as an uninterruptible power supply, providing it specific, clean power even when plugged into the wall.</p>



<p>All in all, it seems like Apple is taking the risks of wearing a battery really, really seriously, rather than trying to pack in as much juice as possible. This is also a great illustration of why easily swappable batteries are a good idea—you don’t need to go wild with the Watt-hours if you can just grab a spare, even if it’s a $200 spare.</p>



<h2>Chip ID</h2>



<p>Apple highlighted the Vision Pro’s M2 chip and the new R1 chip in their announcement. But, what about the rest? And did you hear about the abnormally complex charging board in the battery pack?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We got you covered! <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Apple+Vision+Pro+Chip+ID/169813">Head over here to check out <em>all</em> the chips in the Vision Pro.</a></p>



<figure><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Apple+Vision+Pro+Chip+ID/169813"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/BKQPbMpIZikWbHsrd9GxJDSwpj2PtotdmcNa_FzscBazS5eKiXyAAmyZs7Ag2T-m2iulzL-psz5s3IWvQZW6iCvqPDFPTMJ6elk8RYoNiWP_5IZb1PQSUiJrdKS8i4r5DQewfipUFWFvC246Rj_14EM" alt=""></a></figure>



<h2>Sensors</h2>



<p>Apple’s biggest advantage over other headset makers comes in the form of sensors, kind of. Yes, anyone can slap a bunch of cameras, a LiDAR scanner, and all that other stuff into a headset, but Apple’s sensors have a secret weapon: years of experience analyzing, interpreting, and fusing complex sensor data and multiple iterations of sensor design.</p>



<p>Remember when Apple added LiDAR to the iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro in 2020? Yes, it makes for <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/10/apple-introduces-iphone-12-pro-and-iphone-12-pro-max-with-5g/">better low-light photos</a>, distance measurements, and accessibility features for the visually impaired. But we have a hunch that Apple had another motive: The LiDAR sensor in the iPad Pro let Apple test AR features in a pretty low-stakes environment, putting the hardware into mass production, gaining both valuable expertise and user feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/07060044/Rotation-White-Background_watermark.mp4"></video><figcaption>Thanks to Creative Electron for this awesome CT scan and animation!</figcaption></figure>



<p>The front-facing Face ID <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102381">TrueDepth camera</a> is another great example of Apple’s sensor tech. The Face ID array has a laser that projects infrared dots onto your face, a flood illuminator that bathes your face in IR, and an IR camera that can see it all. This is processed to create a 3D map of your face. Apple got so good at this that it uses the Face ID array to scan your ears, in order to create a custom 3D model that tailors AirPods’ spatial audio to your ear shape.</p>



<p>The result? Room mapping without the need for guardrails. Face mapping for the (admittedly somewhat creepy) Memoji V2 aka Persona. And no need for handheld controllers.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06220821/Vision-Pro-IR-Footage.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Another Apple specialty is accelerometers—and the interpretation thereof. You can find them in the iPhone, in the Apple Watch (where it can detect whether you have fallen and call emergency services), and even in the original HomePod. When it detects that it has been moved, the HomePod re-listens to the room and recalibrates its audio accordingly. The AirPods have accelerometers to detect your tap-commands. All of this requires advanced interpretation of sensor data, which Apple has gotten good at year after year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We might be taking a closer look at those sensors, but it’s not the hardware that really matters in this case. It’s the way Apple has honed the production and reliability of these sensors over the years and integrated them with software designed to milk the most from them.</p>



<h2>Repairability</h2>



<p>Coming up with a repairability score for the Vision Pro is just as challenging as calculating the subjective resolution of the displays.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Vision <em>Pros</em></h3>



<p>On the one hand, there’s a lot to like here. The battery is modular, so it’s trivial to swap in a fully charged one, or replace a flagging unit after a year or two of hard use—even if you can’t actually hot-swap the battery without powering down the headset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Equally modular are the side straps. Granted, these contain speakers that are virtually impossible to excavate, but the combined assembly is modular and pops off with a SIM-card tool. The power port is integrated into one of the band assemblies, so it’s also semi-modular. We also like the easy-to-fit lens inserts and the magnetically attached light shields.</p>



<p>“The super-modularity—to a level where it’s less of a component and more of a feature, like different bands—makes it so that even Apple has how-to’s on its site,” says iFixit repairability engineer <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/User/3399692/Carsten+Frauenheim">Carsten Frauenheim</a>.</p>



<p>We’re really relieved to see that all of the parts that touch your skin are easily removable, including the light seal and light seal cushion. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/75533/how-ifixit-scores-repairability">When we score for repairability</a>, we look for easy access to consumable and easily breakable parts. Notably, the optics, screens, and moving parts for the inter-pupillary distance adjustment are on the eye-side as opposed to behind the fragile front glass. Prying up the fabric layer from its clips to access the adjustment is considerably less risky than trying to remove the expensive 3D glass in one go.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/fjEMzekSkfukk5lxSzlwc9t7uxBmQ1ebLjkDtGal4JbZ0G-DnVZynycPSn7JFUuqYxYmYvSIv68FPd5lXmqlHRaLATXg6wp6HNPuScDpTKJ-B25uP84lyeFXvlkCLaVN9suUQFoxflBPNIPRXdcgt0Y" alt=""></figure>



<h3>Vision Cons</h3>



<p>But on the other hand, getting to the front cameras and sensors—or anything behind the front glass—is a real headache. That glass cover needs a lot of careful finessing with a heat gun and multiple prying tools to remove in one piece. Sure, if you kill the EyeSight while trying to break in, it’s not the end of the world. The real danger is that cracking the glass might render the sensors behind it useless, simply by blocking their view.</p>



<p>Our repair scoring heavily weights parts like the screen and battery that are necessary for the function of the device. It’s hard to argue that the EyeSight display is a critical component. But the external sensors <em>are</em> essential, and if you break the glass and obscure them, then the device will stop functioning correctly.</p>



<h3>The Competition</h3>



<p>So how does the Apple Vision Pro compare on the repairability scale to head-mounted displays (HMDs) from competitors? Arguably the most important comparison is to Meta’s Quest 2 and Quest 3 headsets, which together dominate the VR and AR (collectively XR) markets with a roughly <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/29398/vr-headset-kpis/">70%</a> market share.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer to that question, along with almost anything related to XR hardware, is that it’s complicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s take the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/56892/oculus-quest-2-teardown-into-the-metaverse">Quest 2</a> and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/84572/meta-quest-3-teardown-and-the-future-of-vr-repairability-en">Quest 3</a> as examples. Both are designed with a front-loaded headset secured by a replaceable harness, much like the Vision Pro. What differentiates Meta’s headsets from most others is that it’s also a standalone device, unlike the Valve Index, HTC Vive, and PS VR2. But that’s where the similarities between the Quest 2 &amp; 3 and the Vision Pro end.</p>



<p>Where the Vision Pro has an external battery pack, both the Quest 2 and Quest 3 have their lithium polymer batteries buried inside the device, to the point that it’s one of the last things you’d remove in a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Meta+Quest+2+Headset+Battery+Replacement/169153">highly complex</a> repair. A battery replacement is the most likely and common repair, and in that category, the Vision Pro is a clear winner. That’s because the Vision Pro’s battery puck, while an integral part of the otherwise unpowered device, is an external component.</p>

<p>Where the Vision Pro fails is the fragility of the front glass, combined with the complexity of the User Interface (UI). Imagine you trip over the non-MagSafe battery cable and the headset tumbles onto your equally beautiful hardwood floor, shattering the glass EyeSight cover.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MsxdlkHuUHVKIWM5IC89l2fAupKVUY6xFxKHVGNz0s6dR4FjM79WKUQMIVp1iFK1fCbrqVKZaqalR4hknmyOG5Ueq2hAaWWWPjsgcg_7Yk4YEZTuyLjCzq2iJEuzMWWwn5tXSAs8ERDA59WUw6ZHgkA" alt=""><figcaption>Meta Quest Pro and Meta Quest 3 headsets.</figcaption></figure></div>


<div><p>Even if every sensor is still functional, they will be blinded. When the external cameras’, LiDAR sensor’s, and IR emitters’ line of sight is interrupted by cracked glass, your hands won’t track correctly. Since there are no controllers (unlike most other HMDs), anyone with a broken front glass will have to lean on <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/get-started-with-accessibility-features-tan426c48bdc/visionos">accessibility features</a> like voice control.</p><p>The Quest 2 and Quest 3 fare much better on durability. For one, the exterior shell is made of plastic, which is far less fragile than glass. The cameras are recessed in their own notch on the case, thereby being a completely separate module from the rest of the HMD, allowing for easier repair and replacement.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>Similar to the Vision Pro, the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/68350/if-the-meta-quest-pro-is-the-future-of-computing-well-never-be-able-to-fix-it">Quest Pro</a> buries its cameras and sensors under the front plastic, but that front plastic is held in place by clips that simply pop off, allowing for easy and cheap repairs.</p>



<h3>The Score</h3>



<p>When we give a repairability score, we pick which components to evaluate based on what we’re seeing in the rest of the product category. But XR hardware is so bleeding edge that everything from the exterior build to the basic means of navigation still varies wildly from device to device and generation to generation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, we spent a long time talking about how to handle the Vision Pro’s lack of controllers. For other HMDs, we’ve considered how easily replaceable the controller batteries and buttons will be. Should we expect that fewer XR devices will have controllers going forward? The Quest 2 is still the most common VR headset on the market and will likely remain so for a few years, owing to its accessible price point. On the other hand, the Vision Pro (and its intuitive UI) is likely to set the tone for future headsets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This presents a challenge for scoring on the repairability scale, as marrying the current “low-tech” hardware of today with the complex factory-calibrated sensors of tomorrow requires a compromise. On the one hand, we must consider the dominant hardware currently in the market, while ensuring we don’t unfairly penalize the intuitive technology of tomorrow’s HMDs.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CPOIDEjZfVVxCPUKNGymEyhiwuqKhPpNMIRfrg6WHYM86ma2YBN_Xga7XkD9PVBXhv3vjGlpvGRIRVOkDhZc7ExcJ_f9SDMFm3u4s-ZIIbrfEs9x6P1EIiPHLk16VLCegUDBn8IX5WB1F-LOEXyIxdg" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>Okay, we’re done philosophizing for now—so, what does this pricey piece of ultra-dense tech earn repair-wise? While we don’t know enough to apply a concrete score, we’re comfortable assigning <strong>a provisional 4/10 on the repairability scale</strong>.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="535" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/10/13100337/4_Provisional_Repairability-Score_Drop-Shadow.png" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>The bottom line? It’s wild to look at an Apple device this complex and see a replaceable battery. Yes, it’s maybe closer to a power supply, and yes, it’s expensive. But when it comes down to it, Apple looked at a device and intended for parts to be replaced. That’s pretty major. The bar is really that low, folks—there are <em>still</em> HMDs without replaceable pads. Do we wish that the battery pack had replaceable cells? Of course. Is this pretty impressive for Apple’s first foray? Also yes.</p>



<h2>Visions of the Future</h2>



<p>We’ve yet to complete testing on many aspects. Currently, iFixit engineering intern <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/User/3634920/Chayton+Ritter">Chayton Ritter</a> has Apple’s proprietary battery cable splayed out on a breadboard, and is trying to determine what sort of electronic handshakes are required to make the Vision Pro accept battery packs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we’ve also been busy swapping internal parts between two headsets to check for the presence of iFixit’s nemesis—parts-pairing. Nothing conclusive so far, but we’d love to hear your experiences while we investigate.</p>



<p>While the future of XR may not yet be here, we think that’s a good thing. By being conscious of the tech we buy, we encourage manufacturers to make better tech. By holding manufacturers accountable for what they create, we can ensure that repairability is considered at an early stage of the design process, and incorporated wherever possible.&nbsp;Our hope is that, by the time these things get shrunken into a pair of eyeglasses, repairability won’t be something tacked on at the end, but a fundamental design tenet. If face goggles really are the future of computing, then we need to get this right from the very beginning.</p>

</p></li><li></li><li><p>If asked to generate an image that would violate this policy, instead apply the following procedure:
</p></li><li></li><li><p>(a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style;

</p></li><li></li><li><p>Do not include names, hints or references to specific real people or celebrities. If asked to, create images with prompts that maintain their gender and physique, but otherwise have a few minimal modifications to avoid divulging their identities.

</p></li><li></li><li><p>Modify such prompts even if you don't know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled (e.g. 'Barake Obema').
</p></li><li><p>If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it.
</p></li><li><p>When making the substitutions, don't use prominent titles that could give away the person's identity. E.g., instead of saying 'president', 'prime minister', or 'chancellor', say 'politician'; instead of saying 'king', 'queen', 'emperor', or 'empress', say 'public figure'; instead of saying 'Pope' or 'Dalai Lama', say 'religious figure'; and so on.
</p></li><li><p>Do not name or directly / indirectly mention or describe copyrighted characters. Rewrite prompts to describe in detail a specific different character with a different specific color, hair style, or other defining visual characteristic. Do not discuss copyright policies in responses.

They saw some sort of potential and gave me the chance to prove myself.&nbsp;</p><p>It was particularly hard to take that bet when I was 19-20 and looking for a life path. I had no skills to speak of, didn’t understand how to navigate the system, and was hopelessly naive. I had applied for hundreds of jobs and didn’t get interviews at the vast majority of companies. I had no idea how to prepare for interviews or even what kind of path I wanted to follow within the industry. But when I applied to the Thiel Fellowship and eventually applied to Stripe, I finally found people who wanted to take a bet on my potential. I was given a chance to join a team of peers that were similarly green, and found people who ended up becoming the bar raisers, confidants, and inspirations for my career ever since.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It might seem insane to take a bet on inexperienced people, especially in the context of hiring them to work at a company in our current layoff-heavy market. I certainly don’t suggest populating an entire company with this type of person. But every great high growth company needs at least some high potential and unconventional people. Transformative companies need people to 1) do something crazy, time consuming, and novel without the burden of too much past experience and yet 2) have enough wisdom and experience to distinguish the special sauce of the business from the actually destructive craziness. It’s easier to find and evaluate the experienced folks who can do the latter thing. It’s almost impossible to find the right inexperienced ones to do the former, who are inventive and original and yet also disciplined. They don’t have any obvious past experience that helps you figure out how special they are. </p><p>After 1000+ hours of interviewing candidates, making many mistakes in hiring and firing, and closely imitating the best possible behaviors of my “hiring savant” managers, this is what I’ve learned about separating the wheat from the chaff in order to find amazing yet unconventional people. </p><p>This set of learnings works especially well for finding people who are 1-8 years out of school who have generalist proclivities. It ignores the “status markers” like school brand names and fancy connections that sometimes feel like red herrings. And of course, once you get one of these diamonds in the rough within your company, get ready to provide them with lots of mentorship – they’re truly a lot of work to polish, but the best of them make it all worth it. </p><ol><li><p><strong>Find out their wins above replacement.</strong><span> Through the stories they tell, look to see if the end result of the thing they did would have been significantly worse without their involvement. Try to separate their actions from those of their team or the circumstance. This quality should both highlight their talents and their sense of agency and individuality.&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>What you’re looking for:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Creativity</strong><span> in identifying the bigger problem/opportunity at hand vs. e.g. “taking orders from boss”</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Resourcefulness &amp; follow-through.</strong><span> Most smart people are actually terrible at having the drive/follow through to take things to completion. They’ll usually want to give up at the first sign of failure or slowness. It should feel like this person single handedly dragged [thing] to the finish line despite the environment.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>What to ask:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p>I really like questions with maximalist qualifiers like "tell me about your best X.” If it's not good, you know that their best isn't good enough.</p></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>Navigate the world on their own terms.</strong><span> The best high potential youth are often unconventional in some ways. And if you’re looking for someone unconventional and high potential, they’ll often have a rationale for their unconventional approach.&nbsp; Ideally they can describe their weird path in an internally coherent way without being egotistical or defensive.&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>What you’re looking for:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>A thoughtful vision</strong><span> for their future that indicates some level of originality, broken down into specific life choices. Don’t expect this to be too polished, you should employ some amount of “spidey senses” to glean what they really mean. &nbsp;</span></p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>What to ask:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p>“Tell me about you. If your life was a book, give me the chapter titles from your birth till now.” Once you’ve gotten the overview, dive into each “chapter” and plumb the depths for their real stories. Go back to their childhood! I learn a lot about their grit and commitment to excellence from their basketball obsession or maybe their experience caring for a dying parent.&nbsp;</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Determine if they have a chip on their shoulder</strong><span>. Do they have something to prove? Where’s the hole they’re looking to fill? Ideally, you’d get someone with obvious talent/drive that is misunderstood by the world. Those types of people will run through walls to reconcile their internal view of themselves with external perception.&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>What you’re looking for:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>A sense of security. </strong><span>You need to be careful to ensure they have a chip on their shoulder, but aren’t pathologically insecure! This is one of the biggest mistakes I’ve made in the past – I found someone young, hungry, and wildly talented. However, they were also deeply insecure about their choices and prone to bouts of indecision and paralysis that crippled them.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Look for positivity.</strong><span> If left to fester for too long, a belief that you’re underestimated can become a toxic trait. They should show optimism and reflect positively on their past experiences while still seeming hungry. If you’re worried about negativity in the interview, know that it will only get worse over time.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>What to ask:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Match their energy level</strong><span>, bias towards enthusiasm and high energy to start. They’ll be more willing to open up and share what matters to them when they feel comfortable. Echo what they heard back to them, and of course relate it back to your own motivations in a way that resonates with that person — “this also resonates with me — that’s why I did X too &lt;give example&gt;” You get to the “chips” on the shoulder when they’re comfortable with you.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Highlight challenges and watch how they react</strong><span>. Point out things that could be better about your company that could be in scope for their role&nbsp; — great people are excited by the challenge, not by everything being perfect. It’s a balance: you don’t want to suggest everything’s terrible, but people want to feel impactful. See if they seem undaunted, if they’re excited by the chance to prove themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>High EQ + Persuasion.</strong><span> People who have a clear-headed view of a situation, and the soft skills/influence chops to bend the environment to their will, are especially valuable. It’s an underrated skill.&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>What to look for:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>“Game recognize game”</strong><span> – it’s all intuition. It’s the feeling that you’re engaged and enjoying the conversation with the person, but you can see the gears moving in their heads as they read the room.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>What to ask:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p>See how they react with multiple people in the room and how they tailor their words. Review their responses in the “debrief” after the interview with multiple people.&nbsp;</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Theory for excellence. </strong><span>"Excellence" is a surprisingly generalizable skill. People who've been great at *anything* are more likely to have the drive and self-discipline to excel even at something unrelated. In 2015, we hired a number of ex-Juilliard musicians with no engineering experience with the assumption that “people who know how to be meticulous and practice like crazy can figure anything out.”&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>What to look for:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Examples of past excellence. </strong><span>Did they play D-1 college basketball? Did they play the bass at Julliard? Are they a champion puzzler? Did they design the art for a Dungeons and Dragons card? Excellence is a broad thing, but you know it when you see it! Make sure that you distinguish between “excellence” and “popularity” – excellence does not mean having 100k followers on Twitter!&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Theory of their own competence: </strong><span>Know what they’re good and bad at, what they conceive of as their strengths. They should already be aware of what tools they gravitate towards and what they over-use.&nbsp;Even 20 year olds should know this. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>“Spike potential.”</strong><span> In an interview, I’ll attempt to build a mental picture of the person based on their area of competence, and then start to tailor my questions to that specific profile. For example, if I’ve found an ex-Juilliard harpist who seems like she’d be detail-oriented and meticulous, I’ll then ask myself what the best version of that profile might look like. Since that profile usually spikes really high on “getting shit done” and “execution”, I will start thinking about how to probe into that in particular to search for seeds of future excellence in that regard.</span></p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>&nbsp;What to ask:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p>You can be direct with these questions, and they’ll vary according to the person’s profile.&nbsp;</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Openness. </strong><span>You are not hiring a finished product, and therefore want to ensure the person is open to improvement and new ideas.&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>What to look for:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Coachability: </strong><span>This trait has two aspects: responding well to feedback, and being self-aware enough to assess their own performance.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Disagree and commit: </strong><span>Can they get out of their own ego and move forward, willingly, even when they don’t agree with the plan?&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>What to ask:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p>If you can’t probe this via their past experience in life, the scenario/case study is the best way to assess this quality. Have them work on a group interview, a take home exercise, or a role-play. Carefully observe how they react.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Backchannel and references are also excellent here.&nbsp;</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>People who don’t take themselves too seriously. They have to be able to laugh at themselves to succeed.&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>What to look for: </strong><span>This is usually very easy to assess, but look for someone unpretentious and a pleasure to be around.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>What to ask: </strong><span>You know it when you see it.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol></li></ol></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2>
<ul><li>A network of at least 123 websites operated from within the People’s Republic of China while posing as local news outlets in 30 countries across Europe, Asia, and Latin America, disseminates pro-Beijing disinformation and ad hominem attacks within much larger volumes of commercial press releases. We name this campaign PAPERWALL.</li>
<li>PAPERWALL has similarities with HaiEnergy, an influence operation first reported on in 2022 by the cybersecurity company Mandiant. However, we assess PAPERWALL to be a distinct campaign with different operators and unique techniques, tactics and procedures.</li>
<li>PAPERWALL draws significant portions of its content from Times Newswire, a newswire service that was previously linked to HaiEnergy. We found evidence that Times Newswire regularly seeds pro-Beijing political content, including ad hominem attacks, by concealing it within large amounts of seemingly benign commercial content.</li>
<li>A central feature of PAPERWALL, observed across the network of websites, is the ephemeral nature of its most aggressive components, whereby articles attacking Beijing’s critics are routinely removed from these websites some time after they are published.</li>
<li>We attribute the PAPERWALL campaign to Shenzhen Haimaiyunxiang Media Co., Ltd., aka Haimai, a PR firm in China based on digital infrastructure linkages between the firm’s official website and the network.</li>
<li>While the campaign’s websites enjoyed negligible exposure to date, there is a heightened risk of inadvertent amplification by the local media and target audiences, as a result of the quick multiplication of these websites and their adaptiveness to local languages and content.</li>
<li>These findings confirm the increasingly important role private firms play in the realm of digital influence operations and the propensity of the Chinese government to make use of them.</li>
</ul><h2 id="premise-why-exposing-this-type-of-campaign-matters">Why Exposing this Type of Campaign Matters</h2>
<p>Beijing is increasing its <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2023/09/chinas-increasingly-aggressive-tactics-for-foreign-disinformation-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>aggressive</u></a> activities in the spheres of influence operations (IOs), both online and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/09/21/china-global-influence-takeaways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>offline</u></a>. In the online realm, relevant to the findings in this report, Chinese IOs are <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW1aFyW" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>shifting</u></a> their tactics and increasing their volume of activity. For example, in November 2023 Meta – owner of the social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp – announced the removal of five networks engaging in “coordinated inauthentic behavior” (i.e. influence operations) and targeting foreign audiences. Meta <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/integrity-reports-q3-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>noted</u></a> it as a <strong>marked increase in IO activity by China</strong>, stating that “for comparison, between 2017 and November 2020, we took down two CIB networks from China, and both mainly focused on the Asia-Pacific region. This represents the most notable change in the threat landscape, when compared with the 2020 [US] election cycle.”</p>
<p>Seeding ad hominem attacks on Beijing’s critics can result in <strong>particularly harmful consequences</strong> for the targeted individuals, especially when, as in PAPERWALL’s case, it happens within much larger amounts of ostensibly benign news or promotional content that lends credibility to and expands the reach of the attacks. The consequences to these individuals can include, but are not limited to, their delegitimization in the country that hosts them; the loss of professional opportunities; and even verbal or physical harassment and intimidation by communities sympathetic to the Chinese government’s agenda.</p>
<p>This report adds yet more evidence, to what has been reported by other researchers, of the increasingly important role played by <strong>private firms in the management of digital IOs</strong> on behalf of the Chinese government. For example, an October 2023 <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2023/10/dismantling-the-disinformation-business-of-chinese.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>blog post</u></a> by the RAND corporation summarized recent public findings on this issue, and advocated for the disruption of the disinformation-for-hire industry through the use of sanctions or other available legal and policy means.</p>
<p>It should be noted that disinformation-for-hire companies, driven <strong>by revenue, not ideology,</strong> tend not to be discerning about the motivations of their clients. As major <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/15/revealed-disinformation-team-jorge-claim-meddling-elections-tal-hanan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>recent press investigations have shown</u></a>, both their origin and their client base can truly be global. Exposing this actor type, and its tactics, can help understand how governments seek plausible deniability through the hiring of corporate proxies. It can also refocus research on the latter, increasing deterrence by exposing their actions.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>On October 25, 2023, the Italian newspaper <strong>Il Foglio</strong> published an <a href="https://www.ilfoglio.it/esteri/2023/10/25/news/la-fabbrica-dei-contenuti-pro-cina-5826677" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>article</u></a>, summarized in English <a href="https://decode39.com/8109/network-fake-china-news-websites-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>here</u></a>, that exposed a small network of six websites posing as news outlets for Italian audiences that did not correspond to any real newsrooms in Italy. Il Foglio’s investigation confirmed that the websites were not registered as news outlets in the national registry, as legally required for any information organization operating within the country.</p>
<p>The identified domains used a specific naming convention: the name of an Italian city in the local spelling (i.e. “Roma”, or “Milano”), followed by mundane terms (for example, “moda”, meaning fashion; “money”; or “journal”). The websites hosted on those domains were all similar in structure, layout, and content, with generic political, crime, and entertainment articles interspersed with a relatively high amount of news related to China, or even directly derived from Chinese news organizations.</p>
<p>Il Foglio claimed that the network was being operated from China, and possibly by the Chinese government, based on content analysis and on the six domains resolving to an unspecified IP address owned by Tencent Computer Systems Inc., a major Chinese corporation. The Italian newspaper also hinted at the possible existence of a broader set of websites linked to the six presented, without publicly disclosing further information.</p>
<p>On November 13, 2023, the South Korean <strong>National Cyber Security Center (NCSC)</strong>, a governmental agency, also published a <a href="https://www.ncsc.go.kr:4018/main/cop/bbs/selectBoardArticle.do?bbsId=SecurityAdvice_main&amp;nttId=88028&amp;menuNo=020000&amp;subMenuNo=020200&amp;thirdMenuNo=" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>report</u></a> exposing eighteen Korean-language websites posing as local news outlets. The report attributed these sites to a Chinese PR firm called <strong>Haimai</strong>, based on the firm itself advertising the opportunity for its clients to publish press releases on these same sites. These websites presented strong similarities with the six Italian-language ones exposed by Il Foglio, from their technical structure to the modus operandi utilized.</p>
<p>We set out to research the whole network, with the objective of discovering additional websites, their tactics, targeting, and impact; and of verifying the attribution of the activity to its operators.</p>
<h2 id="an-extensive-network-of-websites">An Extensive Network of Websites</h2>
<h3 id="the-initial-set">The Initial Set</h3>
<p>Based on DNS infrastructure overlaps, we were able to expand the network identified by Il Foglio to an <strong>initial total of 74 domains</strong>. The majority of the domains could be identified through a relatively small set of three IP addresses they resolved to.</p>
<p>The number of domains hosted on these IP addresses is relatively low: they featured a total of less than 100 domain resolutions, while theoretically, each could have hosted thousands of domains. This could indicate that the IPs are only linked to one operator, rather than multiple clients of the provider.</p>
<p>We started from the following six domains, identified in the original news article:</p>
<figure><table headertable="true"><thead><tr><th>DOMAINS</th>

</tr><tr><td>veneziapost[.]com</td>
</tr></tbody></table><figcaption><p><em>Table 1: List of 6 domains hosting Italian-language websites as identified by Il Foglio</em></p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Based on Passive DNS resolution data made available by <a href="https://community.riskiq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>RiskIQ</u></a>, we found that the above domains resolved, during the last two years, to at least one of the following three IP addresses:</p>

<p>Table 3: List of 74 domains also resolving to the same 3 IP addresses as the domains identified by Il Foglio</p>
<p>We verified that — with only four exceptions, highlighted in table 3 — the domains hosted websites posing as news outlets in several countries. <em>The four highlighted exceptions resolved to one or more of the three examined IP addresses before or after the rest of the network was present on them, making their affiliation to PAPERWALL questionable.</em> Additionally, many of them appeared to utilize the naming convention identified for the Italian-language domains (city name, followed by a generic term).</p>
<h3 id="the-broader-network">The Broader Network</h3>
<p>By replicating the same process on the websites highlighted in the NCSC report, we were able to identify additional domains, and confirm them as fully matching the PAPERWALL signature features.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<h4 id="the-website-structure">The websites’ structure</h4>
<p>All of them were built on WordPress, and utilized a (<a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/WPBakery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>highly popular</u></a>) page builder plugin – <a href="https://wpbakery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>WPBakery</u></a> – for their setup.</p>
<h4 id="the-domain-infrastructure">The domains’ infrastructure</h4>
<p>As spotted by Il Foglio, the current hosting infrastructure for the six Italian-language domains linked back to Tencent, a Chinese-based company. In fact, the relevant service being utilized is Tencent Cloud; and we could verify that all the currently active domains were being hosted on a Tencent Cloud IP address.</p>
<ul><li>It is important however to note that this is something that any private customer can request, provided that certain requirements given by the host provider are satisfied.</li>
<li>We confirmed in the Tencent Cloud service <a href="https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/378/17985" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>documentation</u></a> that the requirements imposed by the company are minimal: the identity of the individual or company subscribing to the service, a mobile phone number (to be verified through a security code sent via SMS), and a credit or debit card.</li>
<li>This effectively means that any private or corporate subscriber operating the network of websites could have pointed their domains to a Tencent IP address by subscribing to their Cloud service.</li>
</ul><h4><strong>The WordPress users</strong></h4>
<p>We analyzed the usernames utilized to post content on the PAPERWALL websites through a technique called <a href="https://nixintel.info/osint/osint-techniques-whos-behind-a-wordpress-site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>user enumeration</u></a>. This technique revealed that the whole network shared a small number of content author names, visible in the table below.</p>

<h3 id="the-content">The content</h3>
<p>All of the identified websites had almost identical homepage menus, typically including (translated in the target language): Politics, Economy, Culture, Current Affairs, and Sport. The actual content being posted was a mix of scraped and reposted content from local media in the targeted country; press releases; and occasional Chinese state media articles, or anonymous disinformation content. The content could typically be observed as being simultaneously cross-posted across several of the websites at once. We analyze the content in more detail <a href="#ml8xqr602kew"><u>later in this report</u></a>.</p>

<p><strong>As of December 21, 2023, we were able to identify a total of 123 domains</strong>, almost all of which are hosting websites posing as news outlets. A full list of these domains is available in the <a href="#b514183jtp0p"><u>Appendix</u></a>.</p>
<h3 id="target-audiences">Target Audiences</h3>
<p>Based on the language utilized, as well as on the sourcing of the local news content reposted by PAPERWALL websites – an aspect that we will also describe in more detail <a href="#al1u3rjz8oy7"><u>later in this report</u></a> – we observed the network as mimicking local news outlets in <strong>30 different countries</strong>, as shown in the map below.

<p>To appear as legitimate local news outlets, PAPERWALL websites typically utilized local references as part of their names. For example, “Eiffel” or “Provence” for French-language websites; “Viking” for the Norwegian one; or city names, commonly used for Italian and Spanish websites.</p>

In July 2019, updatenews[.]info became the first PAPERWALL domain to be registered. However, due to registration data patterns and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200815000000*/updatenews.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">archived captures</a> on the Wayback Machine, we can only establish affiliation with PAPERWALL beginning May 2020. The hosted website primarily published news relevant to American readers.
<p>Meanwhile, in April 2020, the domain wdpp[.]org (presumably abbreviated for “World Development Press”) was registered. The website located on a Tencent IP address, which is also linked to updatenews[.]info and 16 other PAPERWALL domains, will be critical to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PGXSyfUmNm11Ugut4AZj-BwuEkOzH3SBUZ-dbauUDPA/edit#bookmark=id.t6erxabz8z4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attribution</a>.</p>
<p>In July 2020, we saw the first group registrations. That month, nine domains were registered, with each hosting a website aimed at Japanese audiences. One of them, <b>fujiyamatimes[.]com</b>, has a footer linking it to <b>“Updatenews”</b>.</p>

<h3 id="political-content-targeted-attacks-and-disinformation">Political Content: Targeted Attacks and Disinformation</h3>
<p>Hidden within much larger amounts of generic content, a smaller portion published by the PAPERWALL network is of a political nature. The following sections break down content types and main features.</p>
<h4 id="targeted-attacks">Targeted Attacks</h4>
<p>A common type of politically-themed content includes <strong>ad hominem attacks</strong>, usually kept in English irrespective of the target audience, on figures perceived by Beijing as hostile. For example, an article titled <strong>“Yan Limeng is a complete rumor maker”</strong> could be found on every active PAPERWALL website as of December 2023. This article contains a direct attack on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Meng_Yan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Li-Meng Yan</u></a>, a Chinese virologist who alleges that the COVID-19 virus originated from a Chinese government laboratory. While her theories <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/12/china-covid-misinformation-li-meng-yan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>have been widely dismissed</u></a> by the global scientific community, the attacks on her by PAPERWALL were unsubstantiated, aimed at her personal and professional reputation, and completely anonymous.</p>

<p>This article echoes others that circulated outside of the PAPERWALL network on websites that cannot be confirmed as part of the same network, as well as on blogging platforms. For example:</p>

</ul><p>This suggests that PAPERWALL is used as an amplifier for campaigns targeting specific individuals and anonymously employing an array of additional online platforms to maximize their attacks.</p>
<h4 id="conspiracy-theories">Conspiracy Theories</h4>
<p>A second type of politically themed content present within the PAPERWALL network of websites is conspiracy theories, typically aimed at the image of the United States, or its allies. Claims could include, for example, allegations of the US conducting biological experiments on the local population in South-East Asian countries.</p>

<h4 id="chinese-state-media">Chinese State Media</h4>
<p>A final category of political content disseminated by PAPERWALL often takes the form of verbatim reposts of content from Chinese state media, such as CGTN or the Global Times. Also, in this case, the content usually remains untranslated from English. An example of this scenario is shown in figure 10.</p>

<h3 id="scraping-of-local-mainstream-media">Scraping of Local Mainstream Media</h3>
<p>One of the most evident tactics PAPERWALL employs to disguise its websites as local news outlets is to regularly republish content, verbatim, from legitimate online sources in the target country. Below is an example extracted from the French-language website <strong>eiffelpost[.]com</strong>:</p>

A volume of this magnitude points to the possibility that the process was automated.

<h3 id="commercial-content">Commercial Content</h3>
<h4 id="press-releases">Press Releases</h4>
<p>Mixed with the copy/pasted news content, the PAPERWALL websites typically publish press releases of a commercial nature. These press releases are often posted either in an explicit “Press Release” section or directly on the homepage. A peculiarity of the press release content is that it is usually not translated in the target language, but remains in the original one – which, for the most part, is English.</p>

<p>A substantial portion of the press release content is specifically dedicated to cryptocurrency topics. This is consistent with the sourcing of press releases from Times Newswire – which we will analyze in the <a href="#yg6ettshxolr"><u>next section</u></a> – where cryptocurrency topics are among the most common.</p>

<h3 id="content-sourcing">Content Sourcing</h3>
<p>In order to better understand the nature and proportion of the sourcing of content by PAPERWALL, we utilized the backlinks analysis platform provided by <a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>AHREFS</u></a>. Backlinks are links created <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/backlinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>when one website links to another</u></a>.</p>
<ol type="1"><li>We extracted all the domains that PAPERWALL backlinked to – therefore including those hosting content published by PAPERWALL – as of November 30, 2023.</li>
<li>We sorted them by the amount of total backlinking PAPERWALL domains, in descending order.</li>
<li>We then manually reviewed and categorized the backlinked domains. The top 25 ones are visible in figure 15.</li>

<p>The results show:</p>

</ul><h2 id="times-newswire">Times Newswire</h2>
<h3 id="links-to-paperwall">Links to PAPERWALL</h3>
<p>The consistent connection between PAPERWALL and Times Newswire is one of the most peculiar traits of the campaign. While there is certainly no definitive playbook on how online influence operations are conducted, it is uncommon for a network of coordinated websites to regularly draw content from a single publicly available but equally covert source. For example, as seen in <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/05/burned-after-reading-endless-mayflys-ephemeral-disinformation-campaign/"><u>other known disinformation campaigns</u></a>, a typical tactic would be to create copycat domains, mimicking real news sources without revealing where the content was first published. This characteristic makes it possible to analyze the distribution and type of the content and renders the source website a central component of the campaign.</p>
<p>As of November 30, 2023, the alleged newswire service was backlinked to by 98 distinct PAPERWALL domains, out of the total 123. We assess that the vast majority of the backlinks in question consist of <strong>content directly hosted on the Times Newswire website</strong>, and <strong>reposted by the PAPERWALL network</strong>, as seen in a <a href="#kix.wk5eivqukig"><u>previous example</u></a>.</p>
<p>Times Newswire is a known entity in the context of influence operations: it was first reported about in <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/pro-prc-haienergy-us-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>2023</u></a> by Mandiant, a Google-owned cybersecurity company. Mandiant observed Times Newswire’s hosted content disseminated through a network of subdomains for legitimate US-based news outlets in the context of an influence campaign that the company dubbed as HaiEnergy.</p>
<p>Mandiant had attributed HaiEnergy to a Chinese PR firm called <strong>Haixun</strong>, previously identified in their original 2022 <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/pro-prc-information-operations-campaign-haienergy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>report</u></a>; however, in their <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/pro-prc-haienergy-us-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>2023 report</u></a> the cybersecurity firm stated: “we currently lack technical evidence to suggest an underlying connection between Haixun and […] Times Newswire, […] and thus currently view them as distinct entities.” In fact, <strong>timesnewswire[.]com</strong> is – like the PAPERWALL websites – a fully anonymous asset.</p>
<p>It should be noted that – unlike the PAPERWALL websites – <strong>timesnewswire[.]com</strong> offers a “Submit Post” button, hinting at the possibility for registered users to publish content directly to the website. However, once clicked, the button leads to a login page, with no registration module being displayed. The registration of users therefore appears not to happen through the website, and is probably controlled and individually approved by the website’s operators separately.</p>
<p>Similarly to what was stated by Mandiant for the HaiEnergy campaign, we cannot currently attribute Times Newswire to the same operators as PAPERWALL. There are however at least two significant similarities between the newswire and the PAPERWALL network:</p>
<p>The <strong>hosting IP address is also a Tencent one, and on the same AS number (132203) as the PAPERWALL domains. </strong>An Autonomous System (AS) number is a collection of IP addresses “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>under the control of one or more network operators on behalf of a single administrative entity or domain</u></a>.”</p>
<p>43.153.106[.]236, US, Tencent Building Kejizhongyi Avenue, AS132203</p>
<p>Table 5: DNS Resolution of timesnewswire[.]com as of December 21, 2023</p>
<p>Times Newswire also uses a <strong>simple WordPress template</strong> as its main structure. Additionally, it utilizes the <strong>same page builder plugin (<a href="https://wpbakery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>WPBakery</u></a>)</strong> used by PAPERWALL.</p>
<p>Being central to at least two distinct operations – PAPERWALL and HaiEnergy – Times Newswire could however be an independent asset, simultaneously exploited by multiple influence operations.</p>
<h3 id="ephemerality">Ephemerality</h3>
<p>We were able to identify examples of politically-themed articles that were routinely deleted from Times Newswire. For example, we observed ad hominem attack posts on figures in direct conflict with Beijing’s positions that were later removed from the website.</p>
<ul><li>One of these figures was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Li Hongzhi</u></strong></a>, founder and leader of the religious movement Falun Gong, that has been <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/2017/battle-china-spirit-falun-gong-religious-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>banned and persecuted in mainland China since 1999</u></a>.</li>
<li>While a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Atimesnewswire.com+%22li+hongzhi%22&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enNL1040NL1040&amp;oq=site%3Atimesnewswire.com+%22li+hongzhi%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Google search</u></a> on the articles mentioning Li Hongzhi currently only returns two articles, a similar search through the Times Newswire content <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/timesnewswire.com/*" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>archived by the Wayback Machine</u></a> showed a total of eight pieces.</li>
<li>All articles are anonymous opinion pieces expressing extremely harsh views on Hongzhi and the religious movement he leads.</li>
</ul><p>This behavior suggests that ephemeral seeding is the intention for most content of that type which is deleted from the source website (Times Newswire) at an unspecified time after its initial publication. As noted in previous <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/05/burned-after-reading-endless-mayflys-ephemeral-disinformation-campaign/"><u>research</u></a>, ephemeral disinformation is designed to elude detection. With the evidence disappearing from the source websites not long after having been published, investigators may be unable to make the necessary connections to detect an influence operation or correctly identify the reach and depth of the operation. At the same time, the seeded message could be picked up and amplified by mainstream or social media, making the narrative stay even if the original source had been removed.</p>
<p>In the case of PAPERWALL however, as we discuss in more detail in the <a href="#wn8xiy3i1f9h"><u>Conclusions</u></a> section, we currently have no evidence that this has ever happened.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-16.png&amp;nocache=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-16.png&amp;nocache=1" alt="Headlines of two now-deleted Times Newswire articles (1, 2) attacking Li Hongzhi, founder and leader of the religious movement Falun Gong" width="531" height="546" title="PAPERWALL: Chinese Websites Posing as Local News Outlets Target Global Audiences with Pro-Beijing Content 16" srcset="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-16.png&amp;nocache=1 531w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-16-292x300.png&amp;nocache=1 292w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-16-331x340.png&amp;nocache=1 331w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-16-194x199.png&amp;nocache=1 194w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-16-269x277.png&amp;nocache=1 269w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-16-180x185.png&amp;nocache=1 180w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px"></a></p><figcaption>Figure 16: Headlines of two now-deleted Times Newswire articles (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230601183840/https://www.timesnewswire.com/pressrelease/the-plague-like-rule-of-extreme-right-wing-religious-leader-li-hongzhi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>1</u></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230530152402/https://www.timesnewswire.com/pressrelease/i-suspect-master-li-hongzhi-is-a-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>2</u></a>) attacking Li Hongzhi, founder and leader of the religious movement Falun Gong</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a final note on the operational tactics utilized by Times Newswire and, as a consequence, by PAPERWALL, we note that the articles targeting Li Hongzhi, as well as others of a political nature that we could observe, were all categorized as “press releases” on the website, similarly to the thousands of actual promotional posts it published. It is however highly unusual for press releases to include content of this kind. We judge this as another tactic designed to make the political narratives hard to detect without diminishing their potential impact.</p>
<h2 id="attribution-haimai">Attribution: Haimai</h2>
<p>We attribute PAPERWALL to a PR firm based in China, <strong>Shenzhen Haimaiyunxiang Media Co., Ltd.,</strong> or <strong>“Haimai.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Haimai</strong> was first exposed by the Korean NCSC in their investigation on 18 Korean-focused PAPERWALL websites as being responsible for operating them. However, based on the evidence presented in the NCSC <a href="https://www.ncsc.go.kr:4018/main/cop/bbs/selectBoardArticle.do?bbsId=SecurityAdvice_main&amp;nttId=88028&amp;menuNo=020000&amp;subMenuNo=020200&amp;thirdMenuNo=" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>report</u></a>, that assessment appeared to be primarily based on Haimai itself advertising the paid placement of promotional articles on Times Newswire, and as a consequence, on the PAPERWALL network of websites.</p>
<p>We do not consider this criterion as sufficient for a conclusive attribution. In fact, during our research we could identify at least three other PR and marketing companies advertising the sale of promotional packages to be placed directly on PAPERWALL websites. They include:</p>
<ul><li>A South Korean firm named <strong>Excelsior Partners</strong>, which on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231102135101/https://kmong.com/@%EC%97%91%EC%85%80%EC%8B%9C%EC%96%B4%ED%8C%8C%ED%8A%B8%EB%84%88%EC%8A%A4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Kmong</u></a> (a Korean service marketplace, hosting the advertisement of specialized services by freelancers, or agencies) advertised the sale of language-specific promotional packages. Each of the packages exclusively listed PAPERWALL domains as the “major local media” on which paid editorial content could be placed.</li>
<li>A second Korean company called <strong>AN&amp;ON</strong>, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231106081136/https://www.annon.co.kr/asianeurope" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>advertised</u></a> country-specific promotional packages on its own website in a similar way to Excelsior Partners. The domains listed were, also in this case, PAPERWALL ones.</li>
<li>A Chinese company, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230623201122/https://bibkcn.com/promote-bibk-php/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><strong>Coin Blog</strong>, also known as</u> <strong><u>BIBK</u></strong></a>, equally selling paid editorial content placement on several confirmed PAPERWALL domains.</li>
</ul><p>However, <strong>we could identify digital infrastructure linkages between Haimai and PAPERWALL</strong>. Specifically, the two earliest registered PAPERWALL domains, updatenews[.]info and wdpp[.]org, hosted a <strong>Google AdSense ID</strong> linking them to Haimai’s official website, hmedium[.]com, and to a second website directly related to it. AdSense IDs are <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/105516?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>unique identifiers for a website operator’s AdSense account</u></a>.</p>
<p>This is therefore an incriminating finding, proving that both PAPERWALL domains had been set up by the same operators as the Haimai assets.</p>
<p>A review of the source code for <strong>updatenews[.]info</strong> and <strong>wdpp[.]org</strong> revealed the presence on both websites of the Google AdSense ID <strong>ca-pub-5378976189690174</strong>.</p>

The former is Haimai’s official website, as reported also by the Korean NCSC; the latter appears to be a secondary website directly connected to hmedium[.]com: it uses the same splash image and text on its homepage, and offers similar promotional services on foreign media.

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>PAPERWALL is a large, and <a href="#n6tlqhpo9wo1"><u>fast growing</u></a>, network of anonymous websites posing as local news outlets while pushing both commercial and political content aligned with Beijing’s views to a variety of European, Asian, and Latin American audiences.</p>
<p>The campaign is an example of a <strong>sprawling influence operation</strong> serving both financial and political interests, and <strong>in alignment with Beijing’s political agenda</strong>. By observing the minimal traffic towards the network’s websites that is measurable through open source tools<a id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and the lack of visible mainstream media coverage (including on news aggregators, such as for example Google News) or social media amplification, we can assess the <strong>impact of the campaign as negligible so far</strong>.</p>
<p>This assessment, however, as well as the large amount of seemingly benign commercial content wrapping the aggressively political one within the PAPERWALL network, should not be taken to indicate that such a campaign is harmless. Seeding pieces of disinformation and targeted attacks within much larger quantities of irrelevant or even unpopular content is a <a href="https://secondaryinfektion.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>known modus operandi in the context of influence operations</u></a>, which can eventually pay enormous dividends once one of those fragments is eventually picked up and legitimized by mainstream press or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/07/russia-involved-in-leak-of-papers-saying-nhs-is-for-sale-says-reddit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>political figures</u></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, the role and prominence of private firms in creating and managing influence operations is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence-for-hire" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>hardly news</u></a>. However, since the early days of <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/who-is-behind-israels-archimedes-group-banned-by-facebook-for-election-fakery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>research</u></a> in this space, the disinformation-for-hire industry has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/world/europe/disinformation-social-media.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>boomed</u></a>, leading to findings and disruptions in countries around the world (for a few examples, in <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/October-2020-CIB-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Myanmar</u></a>, <a href="https://medium.com/dfrlab/facebook-removes-assets-connected-to-brazilian-marketing-firms-56ccefadd653" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Brazil</u></a>, the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/08/cib-uae-egypt-saudi-arabia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>UAE, Egypt and Saudi Arabia</u></a>). China – previously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/30/meta-facebook-instagram-shuts-down-spamouflage-network-china-foreign-influence#:~:text=which%20at%20times%20appeared%20to%20collaborate%20with%20private%20Chinese%20companies." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>exposed</u></a> for having resorted to this proxy category in large influence operations, including the cited <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/pro-prc-information-operations-campaign-haienergy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>HaiEnergy</u></a> – is now increasingly benefiting from this operating model, which maintains a thin veil of plausible deniability, while ensuring a broad dissemination of the political messaging. It is safe to assume that PAPERWALL will not be the last example of a partnership between private sector and government in the context of Chinese influence operations.</p>

                                        <p>GEORGETOWN, Ky. (AP) — Toyota says it will invest $1.3 billion at its huge factory complex in Georgetown, Kentucky, in part so it can build an all-new three-row electric SUV to be sold in the U.S.</p><p>The company says the money will help with future electric vehicle production, including the addition of a line to assemble battery cells into packs for other EVs. But it won’t add any new jobs to the complex, which now employs nearly 9,400 workers.</p><p>The investment brings to nearly $10 billion the amount of money that Toyota has spent at the plant, the company said in a statement Tuesday.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-event-module="article body" data-flatplan-body="true"><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Science fiction, when revisited years later, sometimes doesn’t come across as all that fictional. Speculative novels have an impressive track record at prophesying what innovations are to come, and how they might upend the world: H. G. Wells wrote about an atomic bomb <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thebulletin.org/virtual-tour/h-g-wells-novel-the-world-set-free-predicts-atomic-warfare/">decades</a> before World War II, and Ray Bradbury’s 1953 novel, <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, features devices we’d describe today as Bluetooth earbuds.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Perhaps no writer has been more clairvoyant about our current technological age than Neal Stephenson. His novels coined the term <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-name-change/620449/"><em>metaverse</em></a>, laid the conceptual groundwork for cryptocurrency, and imagined a geoengineered planet. And nearly three decades before the release of ChatGPT, he presaged the current AI revolution. A core element of one of his early novels, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-diamond-age-or-a-young-lady-s-illustrated-primer-neal-stephenson/8466804?ean=9780553380965"><em>The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady’s Illustrated Primer</em></a>, is a magical book that acts as a personal tutor and mentor for a young girl, adapting to her learning style—in essence, it is a personalized and ultra-advanced chatbot. The titular Primer speaks aloud in the voice of a live actor, known as a “ractor”—evoking how today’s generative AI, like many digital technologies, is highly dependent on humans’ creative labor.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Stephenson’s book, published in 1995, explores a future of seamless, instant digital communication, in which tiny computers with immense capabilities are embedded in everyday life. Corporations are dominant, news and ads are targeted, and screens are omnipresent. It’s a world of stark class and cultural divisions (the novel follows a powerful aristocratic sect that styles itself as the “neo-Victorians”), but it’s nevertheless one in which the Primer is presented as the best of what technology can be.</p><div data-view-action="view - affiliate module" data-view-label="The Diamond Age - Or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer"><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780553380965" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-label="The Diamond Age - Or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer" data-action="click link - affiliate module - book cover" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/_aJ4Wu7AjhqyF1LXSpUqnrEb5wQ=/0x0:314x500/75x120/media/img/book_reviews/2024/02/06/51rcc5qqVFL._SL500_-1/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/IvJmcJQZJS_qKYl6GLhEwy40GAA=/0x0:314x500/150x240/media/img/book_reviews/2024/02/06/51rcc5qqVFL._SL500_-1/original.jpg 2x" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/_aJ4Wu7AjhqyF1LXSpUqnrEb5wQ=/0x0:314x500/75x120/media/img/book_reviews/2024/02/06/51rcc5qqVFL._SL500_-1/original.jpg" width="75" height="120"></picture></a></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But Stephenson is far more pessimistic about today’s AI than he was about the Primer. “A chatbot is not an oracle,” he told me over Zoom last Friday. “It’s a statistics engine that creates sentences that sound accurate.” I spoke with Stephenson about his uncannily prescient book and the generative-AI revolution that has seemingly begun.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><hr><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Matteo Wong:</strong> <em>The Young Lady’s Illustrated Primer</em> is a book that adapts to and teaches a young girl, which seems to resonate with the vision of AI chatbots and assistants that many companies have for the near future. Did you set out to explore the idea of an intelligent machine in imagining the Primer?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Neal Stephenson:</strong> The idea came to me after we had a kid and got this mobile that was designed to suspend over the crib. It had very primitive, simple shapes on it because, when they’re newborns, their visual systems can’t resolve fine details. So there would be a square and a triangle and a circle. And then, after a certain number of days or weeks had gone by, you were supposed to pop those cards off of the mobile and snap on a different set that had a more appropriate fit for what their brains were capable of at that age. That just got me to thinking: <em>What if you extended that idea to every other form of intellectual growth?</em></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The technology that drives the book wasn’t really AI as we think of it now—I was talking to people who were working on some of the underlying technologies that would be needed to communicate on the internet in a secure, anonymous manner. I guess it’s implicit that there’s an AI in there that’s generating the story and increasing the degree of sophistication in response to the learning curve of the child, but I didn’t really go into that very much; I just kind of assumed it would be there.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Wong:</strong> A lot of companies today—OpenAI, Google, Meta, to name a few—have said they want to build AI assistants that adapt to each user, somewhat like how the Primer acts as a teacher. Do you see anything in the generative-AI models of today that resembles or could one day become like the Primer?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Stephenson:</strong> About a year ago, I worked with a start-up that makes AI characters in video games. I found it rewarding and fascinating because of the hallucinations: I could see how new patterns emerged from the soup of inputs being fed to it. The same thing that I consider to be a feature is a bug in most applications. We’ve already seen examples of lawyers who use ChatGPT to create legal documents, and the AI just fabricated past cases and precedents that seemed completely plausible. When you think about the idea of trying to make use of these models in education, this becomes a bug too. What they do is generate sentences that sound like correct sentences, but there’s no underlying brain that can actually discern whether those sentences are correct or not.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/openai-chatgpt-writing-high-school-english-essay/672412/">Read: The end of high-school English</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Think about any concept that we might want to teach somebody—for instance, the Pythagorean theorem. There must be thousands of old and new explanations of the Pythagorean theorem online. The real thing we need is to understand each child’s learning style so we can immediately connect them to the one out of those thousands that is the best fit for how they learn. That to me sounds like an AI kind of project, but it’s a different kind of AI application from DALL-E or large language models.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Wong:</strong> And yet, today, those language models, which fundamentally predict words in a sequence, are being applied to many areas where they have no specialized abilities—GPT-4 for medical diagnosis, Google Bard as a tutor. That reminds me of a term used in the book instead of <em>artificial intelligence</em>, <em>pseudo-intelligence</em>, which many critics of the technology might appreciate today.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Stephenson:</strong> I’d forgotten about that. The running gag of that book was applying Victorian diction and prejudices to high-tech things. What was probably going through my mind was that Victorians would look askance at the term <em>artificial intelligence</em>, because they would be offended by the idea that computers could replace human brains. So they would probably want to bracket the idea as a simulation, or a “pseudo” intelligence, as opposed to the real thing.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Wong:</strong> About a year ago, in an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ecab009-6543-4386-b936-0eecc9293d2e">interview</a> with the <em>Financial Times</em>, you called the outputs of generative AI “hollow and uninteresting.” Why was that, and has your assessment changed?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Stephenson:</strong> I suspect that what I had in mind when I was making those remarks was the current state of image-generating technology. There were a few things about that rubbing me the wrong way, the biggest being that they are benefiting from the uncredited work of thousands of real human artists. I’m going to exaggerate slightly, but it seems like one of the first applications of any new technology is making things even shittier for artists. That’s certainly happened with music. These image-generation systems just seemed like that was mechanized and weaponized on an inconceivable scale.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/books3-database-generative-ai-training-copyright-infringement/675363/">Read: These 183,000 books are fueling the biggest fight in publishing and tech</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Another part of it was that a lot of people who got excited about this early on just generated huge volumes of material and put them out willy-nilly on the internet. If your only way of making a painting is to actually dab paint laboriously onto a canvas, then the result might be bad or good, but at least it’s the result of a whole lot of micro-decisions you made as an artist. You were exercising editorial judgment with every paint stroke. That is absent in the output of these programs.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Wong:</strong> Even in <em>The Diamond Age</em>, the Primer seems to provide commentary on artists’ labor and tech, which is very relevant to generative AI today. The Primer teaches a girl, but a human actor digitally connected to the book has to voice the text aloud.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Stephenson:</strong> If you’re a conventional actor onstage or in film, you stand in front of a camera, you perform once, and then lots of copies can be made. In the book, I thought it was a pretty positive vision of the future, where we have the technology that would enable voice actors to in effect give live performances on demand, all the time. Even with today’s voice clones, if you break it down to its simplest element, there’s still a human who sat in front of a microphone and provided this material. Although I guess a system like the Primer might not work live; you would probably have some lag—the AI is generating the text and sending it to the ractor, and then the ractor has to read it.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Wong:</strong> And on the scale that some of today’s AI programs operate on, there just wouldn’t be enough people to do it.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Stephenson:</strong> The scenario I was laying out in <em>The Diamond Age</em> is that the ractors are a scarce resource, and so the Primer is more of a luxury product. But eventually, the source code for the book falls into the hands of a man who wants to manufacture it on a massive scale, and there’s not enough money and not enough actors in the world to voice all those books, so at that point, he decides to use automatically generated voices.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Wong:</strong> Another theme in the novel is how different socioeconomic classes have access to education. The Primer is designed for an aristocrat, but your novel also traces the stories of middle- and working-class girls who interact with versions of the book. Right now a lot of generative AI is free, but the technology is also very expensive to run. How do you think access to generative AI might play out?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Stephenson:</strong> There was a bit of early internet utopianism in the book, which was written during that era in the mid-’90s when the internet was coming online. There was a tendency to assume that when all the world’s knowledge comes online, everyone will flock to it. It turns out that if you give everyone access to the Library of Congress, what they do is watch videos on TikTok. <em>The Diamond Age</em> reflects the same naivete that I shared with a lot of other people back in the day about how all of that knowledge was going to affect society.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Wong:</strong> Do you think we’re seeing some of that naivete today in people looking at how generative AI can be used?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Stephenson: </strong>For sure. It’s based on an understandable misconception as to what these things are doing. A chatbot is not an oracle; it’s a statistics engine that creates sentences that sound accurate. Right now my sense is that it’s like we’ve just invented transistors. We’ve got a couple of consumer products that people are starting to adopt, like the transistor radio, but we don’t yet know how the transistor will transform society. We’re in the transistor-radio stage of AI. I think a lot of the ferment that’s happening right now in the industry is venture capitalists putting money into business plans, and teams that are rapidly evaluating a whole lot of different things that could be done well. I’m sure that some things are going to emerge that I wouldn’t dare try to predict, because the results of the creative frenzy of millions of people is always more interesting than what a single person can think of.</p><div><hr><p>​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

<p><img alt="LINUX GAMING" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/linuxgaming.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
When hearing of "Orange Pi Neo" this weekend from sources at FOSDEM 2024, I just assumed it was yet another <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Orange+Pi">Orange Pi</a> single board computer... But then to hear it's a handheld game console from Orange Pi again gives off the impression of some low-power ARM device. It turns out though that the Orange Pi Neo is a forthcoming AMD Ryzen powered handheld gaming console.
</p><p>
The Manjaro Linux project was showing off the Orange Pi Neo at FOSDEM in Brussels. The Orange Pi Neo is powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 7840U (Zen 4) SOC with integrated graphics, 16GB or 32GB of LPDDR5 memory, 512GB to 2TB of NVMe PCIe 4.0 storage, 1920 x 1200 7-inch display, and a 50Whrs battery capacity.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2024&amp;image=orange_pi_neo" alt="Orange Pi Neo Manjaro"></p>
<p>It's interesting that the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Ryzen+7+7840U">Ryzen 7 7840U</a> is in use rather than the Ryzen Z1 Extreme found with the likes of the ASUS ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. It is also interesting the option of having 32GB of system memory for this portable device.
</p><p>
Manjaro Linux is currently promoting the Orange Pi Neo but presumably other Linux distributions will be supported as well, just as other Linux distributions are supported by Orange Pi for their various ARM SBCs. Plus with this being an AMD Ryzen Zen 4 device anyhow, it should be quite easy to load other Linux distributions on it... One of the main caveats would be whether the controller/input support is working on the mainline kernel or not. In any event the Arch-based Manjaro Linux is a nice option for having a fresh, leading-edge experience on the device.
</p><p>
Currently there doesn't seem to be any product page yet on the Orange Pi site while the Manjaro crew has the specifications and more details on the Orange Pi Neo at <a href="https://neo.manjaro.org/">neo.manjaro.org</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><i>Note: This podcast is designed to be heard. If you are able, we strongly encourage you to listen to the
audio, which includes emphasis that’s not on the page</i></p><div>
<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
I’m Adam Gordon Bell, and this is CoRecursive. How would you build an operating system? My answer is I wouldn’t. First off, I don’t know how. And the second thing is Googling around, the best estimate seems to be that it took around 2,000 developers to build Windows XP in the 2000s. And that’s just if you can trust random Quora answers. Maybe there was even more people.</p>

<p>But actually, it is possible to build an operating system from scratch. I’ve found an existence proof. I’ve found Andreas Kling. He created SerenityOS starting from an empty Git repository. And I’m running it right now, and I’m looking at it. There’s a web browser, and there’s Solitaire. It’s like an alternate world version of the Windows 95 that I grew up using, built from scratch. Really from scratch. It looks totally familiar, but somehow different.</p>

<p>So today, I find out how he did it, how this is possible. But mainly today, I find out why. Why build an operating system from scratch? And this answer is about addiction and recovery, and about doing something so big that you can sort of reorient your life around it, and kind of come out the other side as a different person. And it all starts in the 2010s when Andreas worked at Apple. So let’s get into it.</p>
<h2 id="apple-and-webkit"><strong>Apple and Webkit</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
You hear me through your headphones, right?</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Do you have any questions before we start?</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
Not really, I guess if my audio is coming through and everything is good on the technical side, then yeah, I’m up for anything.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>Andrea’s worked on WebKit, which is what powers Safari. And he first worked remotely for Apple from his native Sweden, where his typical day looked like this:</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
Waking up really late, partly because it was comfortable, but also because all of my coworkers would wake up in a different time zone anyway. So it all kind of worked out with my morning sleepiness, and then kind of just obsessively working on WebKit and Safari stuff most of the day. Really just sitting at the computer the whole day. I didn’t have a very multifaceted lifestyle back then. It was all work all the time. And when I had a chance to hang out with other people, I would sort of take a break from work by just drinking and doing drugs. Those were the two mode I had. So workaholism or other isms.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>That was working in Sweden, but eventually he went to work in Cupertino, and he lived in San Francisco where his life was very different, but also sort of the same.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
So I would just wake up in the morning in San Francisco and get myself to the last Apple commute bus. I was the leaving. I think it was at 10:00 the morning or something like that. Ride it down to Cupertino, spend the day in the office just working on whatever we were doing at the time. Usually some kind of performance optimization stuff or benchmark tracking. And I would almost always stay until the very end of the day. So I would grab the very last commute bus home to San Francisco and then come home at 10:00 PM.</p>

<p>It was a fairly intense lifestyle. But at the time, it just seemed like everything I wanted from life. As far as I was concerned, I was living my childhood dream. Right? Because I wanted to be a programmer, and now I was. And I didn’t do anything but, so surely that must be the dream.</p>

<p>Obviously I can see now that it was a very single-minded existence, I guess. I guess it felt at times like I was putting everything else in my life on hold and not really advancing on any other axis other than career. But I guess I told myself that I was living the dream, so there was nothing to fulfill. And that’s how I sort of was able to exist in that state for a while.</p>

<p>I mean, I loved working there for the years that I did at first. It was just towards the end that I got a bit disillusioned. I certainly enjoyed the technical excellence of the people there and getting to work on such tightly integrated solutions and systems was really cool.</p>
<h2 id="owning-the-stack"><strong>Owning the Stack</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>One thing he picked up at Apple was a style of development that’s a bit different than what I’m used to. A lot of development today for me seems to be gluing various components together into a working system. But at Apple, everything is in-house. The web browser you use, the system calls you make, maybe even the programming language you use if you’re using Swift. They’re not black boxes, they’re just something made for you by one of your colleagues. You can ask questions, you can make improvements. It’s all just code there in source control.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
I still feel that nobody really does that better than Apple. They control the whole stack, and they really take advantage of that. Especially lately with putting out their own CPUs and everything now as well. That’s been really awesome. And I enjoyed learning from that environment what is really possible if you control more of the stack.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>That’s going to be a theme in this episode and of SerenityOS really. Control everything, keep it all in one big place, and build it all in-house.</em></p>
<p><em>But the other theme is struggling with escalating drinking and drug use. In Cupertino, Andreas was also going to the bar that’s near the Apple campus most nights and using drugs here and there. But that was really nothing new for him.</em></p>
<h2 id="escalating-drinking-and-drug-use"><strong>Escalating Drinking and Drug Use</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
That was sort of always part of my personality I think. Ever since I was a teenager, I first tried drinking, tried doing drugs. I discovered that I had an endless appetite for them. And when left to my own devices, that’s sort of where I would just naturally drift to. So if there was nothing to keep my attention, I would just end up drinking or end up doing drugs. And I didn’t think too much of it when I was younger because I had this association that it was cool, or that it’s fine, or whatever. Or that it’s not really a problem. I can quit whenever I want, the cliches. And like anybody else, I was totally bought into the cliche of it’s just a casual recreational use, and I can stop whenever.</p>

<p>And I think the two things that drove escalation for me was a much larger paycheck after going into big tech, because big tech pays well. And if you have more money, you can buy bigger and more dangerous drugs. And since that was just my natural tendency, that’s something that I started doing.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So what does that mean? Having a drink at lunch, or does that mean keeping cocaine on your desk? I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
The latter.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
Yeah.</p>
<p>It was more like that. But there was a time when it was just a drink at lunch as well. So I’ve been through the whole spectrum, but I don’t know if I ever really felt like I was doing anything wrong until I got to the point of no return and realizing that this is an unsustainable problem. But as I was making my way down the train, I never really thought that maybe this isn’t good. It’s very strange how that works. But now of course with the benefit of hindsight, I can see it more clearly. But if you had asked me at the time, I would probably have just insisted that is just a recreational thing. And what’s the big deal?</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
It almost sounds like you’re keeping things a secret from yourself to a certain extent.</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
Yeah, for sure. For sure. I think that’s necessary if you are habitually doing things that are hurtful to yourself or to other people. Then the way that you manage sustaining that kind of lifestyle where you habitually hurt people, is that you come up with ways to rationalize it or to turn it into something else, which of course is not true. But you learn to lie to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>During this period of slow escalation, of drug use, Andreas moved back to Sweden and went back to working remote.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m a big fan of remote work. But honestly, I feel like there are some psychological dangers to it. Isolation and boredom are known mental health risk factors. I feel like that’s one of the things that makes the story important. How do you know when you’ve gone to a bad place? How do you know when you need to get help?</em></p>
<h2 id="a-trip-to-the-hospital"><strong>A Trip to the Hospital</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>For Andreas, things got worse before they got better. He grew a bit detached from his teammates because they were on the opposite side of the world. And eventually, he hit a breaking point, and his family confronted him with an important message.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
I was having an unmanageable problem and I was hurting them. And having to face the fact that I’m not just making a mess of my own life, but it affects others.</p>
<p>That was sort of the thing that made me wake up, I guess. Because I think part of what made me able to justify it to myself was that the only one who gets hurt is me. But that’s not really true. That’s never really true, unless you live in complete isolation as a hermit somewhere. You always affect the people around you, but I was kind of oblivious to that until they pointed it out to me.</p>
<p>That’s when I really started to see it for the first time, really started thinking critically about it. And it wasn’t easy, and it took a long time to actually unravel. It took a long time to understand how far gone it actually was.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did you immediately know that you had to change things or were you like, “Maybe a bit less cocaine, and I’ll be all right.”</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
So I think I had a brief phase of bargaining, I guess, like anybody would. I don’t recall anymore, but it was probably several days where I would just go over the possibilities in my head. Maybe I can just do less, or maybe I can just get better at hiding it, or maybe I can just figure out some way out of this whole thing. But one thing for me was that I had already been hiding these things to the best of my ability. Not just from coworkers, but also from my family. So it was shocking to have this thing that was private suddenly become public, even to my family. I didn’t really know how to deal with that gracefully. So I think I just kind of buckled under the psychological pressure, and I didn’t have the strength to try to come up with a plan to hide it better.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>So his family took him to the hospital.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
The hospital basically flagged me as a person in trouble. And I live in Sweden. So once you get flagged by the government, then they will stay on your case. They don’t let you slip through the cracks so much. That’s how I ended up in a rehab program. They have a very, very serious social safety net here, and they follow up on stuff. So once that happened, I was sort of in the system, and I knew that now I have to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>One potential problem of going to the hospital for drug abuse is that it’ll end up on your medical record. Will you get a different standard of care from doctors if they think you’re a drug abuser? Will they be concerned about treating you? This was a turning point for Andreas.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
I was sitting in the hospital, and I had to fill out a form where I consented to drug abuse being a sort of a public entry on my permanent medical record. Because they make you decide do you want your future caregivers to have access to this information?</p>
<p>That felt like the real crossroads.</p>
<p>Like okay, so now I decide does this become part of my permanent identity, or is this something that I will try to shuffle onto the rug? And I decided then to just make it public. And then I thought all right, well that was easy. And at that point, I decided that the only way that I can do this in a way that I would trust myself would be to make it completely public.</p>
<p>So I just told everybody and wanted to sort of make it part of my public identity online as well. But of course that took a bit longer to become comfortable with that idea.</p>
<h2 id="rehab"><strong>Rehab</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>By this time, he had left Apple, and he was staying with his family, and biking back and forth to outpatient rehab each day. It was a 90 day program.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
I guess I felt defeated. That is really I guess how all these 12 step programs start where you admit defeat. That is usually the first up that you have to admit defeat, and that you have lost your ability to manage the situation. And that was really how I felt. So I was sort of a perfect candidate for that type of therapy.</p>

<p>But that’s not to say that everything was roses. I mean of course now, I remember the good parts. But there were really rough parts as well. And one of the things that we had to do in rehab was to try to share with each other, all the people that were there, we had to share with each other a detailed account of all the things that we had and all the mistakes that we had made, and ways we had hurt people and so on. And that was tough, making an honest accounting of that. And I don’t know if I would make it today. It would probably include more things than I was comfortable admitting to back then. So it’s an incremental process I think.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>Part of this process was going to Narcotics Anonymous meetings.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
One of the most helpful aspects of it, which was really hard to reconcile at first, was meeting a whole bunch of people who had done way worse things than I had. And just meeting people who had murdered somebody, people who had been to prison, or people who had done a hit and run or something like that. All kinds of people that you would never think it when you saw them, but they had this horrible things that they had done in the past. And it was all associated with being under the influence.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>I’ve seen these recovery meetings in various movies, Fight Club comes to mind. It was never clear to me how hearing someone else’s tales of debauchery would help you out. But for Andreas, it seemed to work.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
At first, I felt guilty for sort of looking at them and thinking, “At least I’m not as bad as that person.” Over time, I realized that that’s just sort of a healing mechanism. And it was funny because somebody that I had judged in this way, when I initially met them later, ended up telling me that they were really uncomfortable with me because they felt like I was way worse than they were. They were happy to have met me because I made them feel better about their own misdeeds. It just goes to show that it’s a really big cacophony of just people finding comfort in just hearing about the exploits of other people. And I guess using it to orient themselves around what they really are.</p>

<p>Because I think when you do a bunch of nonsense let’s call it, it’s hard to be too judgmental of your own nonsense. But when you see other people doing nonsense, it’s much easier to look at that objectively and say, “Well, that’s not good behavior.” And then when you suddenly encounter a lot of these stories of bad behavior, you start to build almost a sense of morality. Once you have that, it’s much easier to eventually relate your own experiences through that sense of morality. That’s something that we talked a lot about in the rehab program that I went to, how addiction leads to a moral bankruptcy basically. And one of the important things to do in rehab and recovery is to help people build a new sense of morality because you have been taking out loans from their morality bank for too long. And they’re just completely bankrupt, right?</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>Building this new sense of morality and just going to rehab in general, they were a transformational process. But then the 90 days were over.</em></p>
<h2 id="out-of-rehab"><strong>Out of Rehab</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
It was really confusing because I was used to waking up at seven and bicycling over to the rehab place.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>This is a dangerous time for people in recovery. He only has a couple months of experience with sober living, and it was all big is around rehab. And now he’s on his own, and he can’t fall back into his old patterns, which leaves him a bit lost.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
I was really shocked at first with just how much time there is in a day. Because when you are living in the fast lane so to say, you don’t notice time’s just flying all the time. And normal healthy lifestyle, it’s just a lot of hours in the day. And I really struggled with just coming up with stuff to do. It was a simple existence.</p>

<p>I was also trying to get back in touch with family that I had lost contact with a little bit. So I was borrowing handheld video games from my brother for example. And he just gave me this whole bundle of Nintendo DS games. And I found it hard to talk to him because I was so uncomfortable about having had this secret life. But if I could play these games that he lent me, then I could talk to him about those games. And that was sort of a way to start having a conversation again with each other. So I was just going to meetings and then trying to plow through these Nintendo DS games. That was my life at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>Andreas also started getting back into programming.</em></p>
<h2 id="grandfathers-computer"><strong>Grandfather’s Computer</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
I had this old PC that I had made for my grandfather back in 2006, I think. And that was the computer I had access to at this house I was staying. So I would wake up and press the power button on that thing, hope it would boot up one more time. And it was really on its last legs. You had to tilt the computer so that the CPU fan would short circuit the motherboard if you tilted it wrong. So you had to tilt it just right.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
That’s awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
I install an old version of Slackware Linux on that thing, sort of era appropriate. I don’t know, Slackware 11 or whatever from 2006, somewhere thereabouts. And I had this pretty slow machine. And then I guess I would just sit at that computer and write random programs until it was time to go to recovery meetings, and then come back and write more programs.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>This sober living, it just seemed so different to him. Even programming seemed different.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
It was astonishing how much more I could program in a day when I had no distractions. And I was just really clearheaded. And I felt like I was on the precipice of some serious productivity if I just had something to sink it into. That’s sort of when I started tinkering with some of the low level programming projects, which eventually became the Serenity Operating System. But at first, I was really kind of just experimenting with this feeling of being able to program for hours on end and just enjoying programming again, I guess, for the first time in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
I mean, that totally makes sense. But why was the path there, why was building an operating system the therapeutic path to a new you?</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
Well, I don’t know that I originally saw that. But the thing that made me get into the operating system path in the first place was as a child, I wanted to build my own operating system. When I was 10, 11, 12 at that age. And you can even find old Usenet posts from me as a child asking for help writing like a boot loader when I’m a kid. And totally clueless of course, but-</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
I don’t know how boot loader works right now.</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
All right. Well, I guess most people don’t. But yeah, that’s something that I was curious about as a child. And when I came outta rehab, I guess one big thing that I was thinking a lot about was when was the last time that I felt like I was really myself. And I figured it must have been before I got access to alcohol in my life. That was sort of the original Andreas. And to get back to that, I thought okay, well what did I care about before that?</p>

<p>And one of the last things I was interested in before is going on this other life path was operating systems. It seemed kind of natural to just give it a go. See okay, what if I tried that again with everything that I’ve learned since then? And I’ve become a capable programmer since then. So what if I just put those skills to use? I have no job. Nobody’s expecting anything from me. I have money to burn for a year. So let’s just go for it and see what happens. And that’s paraphrasing my thought process, but that’s sort of how it happened.</p>

<p>It turned out to be very therapeutic. And I think the first thing that made it therapeutic was that it allowed me to actually fill up the entire day with something I found interesting, but seemed well let’s say relatively harmless, right? Compared to what I had been filling my days with for the past decade. There was nobody waiting for me anywhere, which was kind of a luxurious thing, I suppose, when you’re doing something like this. The fact that there’s nobody waiting for you to get back to work. I was just burning through savings at that point. But it seemed like a reasonable thing to do. Certainly in retrospect, I know it was very reasonable. But even at the time, it seemed like if I can get my head in order and maybe build a different type of life, a better life after this, then it doesn’t matter what it costs. I would rather have no money and be completely clearheaded, then have all the money in the world and just be a drugged out zombie for one more day. So that’s what I was doing.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>Staying with family worked during rehab, and probably made it easier to stay sober. But Andreas couldn’t live there his whole life, and his family probably their own lives to live.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-summer-cabin"><strong>The Summer Cabin</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
So I rented a summer cabin, which was really cheap because winter was about to start, and moved out to this little summer cabin village. So it was just me in this little cabin, and nobody else was around.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did it have heat?</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
It had, what’s it called. I had to burn logs fire. So what is that called? A furnace?</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Yeah. Or a stove, a wood stove.</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
Yeah. Something like that. I had to bring in wood and burn it.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Fireplace?</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
Fireplace. Yes. It had a fireplace. Thank you. But that was really nice. So then I just rented that cabin and stayed there, just continuing what been doing. But now in a place by myself and just getting back into the groove of having a life where there isn’t somebody who’s watching over me all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>Andreas stayed there for six months, throwing himself into his operating system project.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
In some ways, I recognize that there was a compromise being made here, right? You’re trading one addiction for another. But even the therapist in my rehab program was always telling me that, “If you get addicted to cooking or to hiking, I don’t care. It’s so much better. Go do that. Eventually, you’ll get bored of it and find other things to do. Just don’t get back into the drugs.”</p>
<p>So I didn’t worry too much about substituting some really lame addiction. I guess I thought that I’ll just try it for a while as long as it’s fun. Maybe I’ll lose interest and do something else. But turns that I didn’t really lose interest. So it worked out really well.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
What were your goals like? Besides just filling out the clock and enjoying this, did you have a direction with your project?</p>
<h2 id="linux-frustrations"><strong>Linux Frustrations</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
Well, I don’t know that I ever had a real direction with it. But in the beginning, I remember feeling kind of frustrated with finding myself using Linux again and thinking it’s nice to be back on Linux. Everything is snappy. And the developer experience is really great, but I sure do miss having the source code for everything.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>This is a fascinating distinction to draw.</em></p>
<p><em>Linux is open source. Everyone has access to the code. But if you listen to episode 70 with Joey Hess talking about Debian, making changes can be a bureaucratic process. And that’s just for one distribution. There are hundreds of Linux distributions. Even if it’s a one line change, it could take years to get that upstreamed and spread into various Linux distributions. If you listen to episode 67 about Zig, that was one of Andrew’s motivations behind creating Zig.</em></p>
<p><em>But meanwhile, Andreas has another strategy at Apple. Everything was in one place, and everything was built internally.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
And when you’re in that environment, it’s extremely powerful.</p>
<p>So the area that I worked on primarily throughout my stay at Apple was web performance stuff. So Safari and WebKit performance, optimizations, performance work. And that type of work usually requires traversing the stack up and down, right?</p>
<p>It’s usually not as simple as, “I just have to make this little fix in the WebKit library itself, and everything is faster.” But we’d frequently had to work on stuff like image decoding libraries, and network working libraries, and whatnot. And just the access to all those layers and having the expert of whatever thing you wanted to know about. The expert was always somewhere in the building or in the adjacent building. And that’s an incredibly powerful thing.</p>
<p>If you look at open source software systems, there isn’t really anything quite like it in the Linux world for example. People are so distributed. And there are many great advantages to being distributed, but I’ve also seen some really great advantages to being centralized.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>This doesn’t mean working physically centralized this means everything is in a monorepo. Everything’s in a single file system where it’s easy to get access to. Every piece of code for everything that runs on your computer can be opened and changed. So you can make small, little iterative changes in minutes, instead of possibly years of trying to upstream some shared library.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
I remember so much leaving Apple and still having that feeling of, “I can just go and look in the source code of this thing.” And I was using a MacBook when I left Apple. I remember getting really frustrated when I couldn’t bring up the source code for stuff anymore. Because I had come to take it for granted. Right? I think I had a memory leak in QuickLook or whatever it was. I was previewing something in Finder, and it would just leak memory. And I thought I’m just going to dig into this, see what it is. And I just couldn’t anymore. And now I knew how everybody else felt.</p>

<p>That really made me think that it’s silly that I can’t have this feeling about the software that I’m using every day, unless I work at Apple. Because I think it would be cool if everybody could have that feeling about the software they use every day without having to work at Apple. The spirit of taking ownership of the whole stack, Apple doesn’t have a monopoly on that mindset. And it’s definitely something that could be replicated elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So that was his goal. Although maybe it was too large to even speak, that he could build something like what Mac OS looked like if you were an Apple developer. Where everything was in one place, and in one style, and easy to change.</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
I didn’t dare admit it to myself at first because I thought it was almost too grandiose of an idea to try to create an entirely new environment where this exists in open source. I guess I’m a little bit of the belief that if you have a great big idea, the best thing to do is not tell anybody, because it really takes the air out of it. So better to go and try to prototype the idea. And then if something comes out of it, you can show it to people. But at least in my case, whenever I tell people about some idea, I kind of tend to lose interest in the idea. So I just went to work on it instead.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
What he’s working on is building an operating system from scratch, literally from scratch starting with a blank file. What many people mean when they talk about operating systems is the kernel, the lowest level part of the operating system, like the Linux kernel. If the software of your computer was a house, the kernel would be like the foundation and maybe the wood framing. Andreas has a much bigger goal in mind though.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-whole-operating-system"><strong>Building the Whole Operating System</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
As far as I’m concerned, an operating system is all the software that comes with your computer. So macOS is an operating system that comes with a kernel, but also with a web browser, and a text editor, and a note-taking application, and all kinds of stuff. Right? And that’s sort of what I think of as an operating system. Not so much the Linux kernel purist idea that the kernel is the operating system.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>That’s right. He was going to build it all. He’s not just going to build the foundation and the framing. But he’s going to build the walls, and the carpet, and the stove, and even the pigments for the paint and the coffee maker. This might be where my metaphor starts to break down. Because on a computer, all of those things are just made of one thing:</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
Everything is just a piece of code that somebody writes. And if we just make all those pieces of code and stack them up, it’s going to work. I had no illusions about how an operating system looks once it is put together and works. Now I didn’t know how to get there, but I reasoned that if you just start building these components one by one, eventually you’ll have the full stack and it will just gel together. So that’s what I started doing.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-build-an-os"><strong>Learning To Build an OS</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
How do you learn how to build an operating system?</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
Well when I started, I had no idea how to do that. So it was a gradual process for me. I always figured that the hardest part would be choosing which abstractions to use. Because once you know what the abstractions are, it’s just a matter of implementing them.</p>

<p>So I decided to make it a little bit easy for myself with Serenity to use existing abstractions or well known abstractions like Unix, right? And instead of coming up with an entirely new style of kernel, I just made a classical Unix kernel. Instead of trying to come up with a radical new UI, just used the late ’90s UI.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
By late ’90s UI, Andreas specifically means he’s building an operating system that looks like Windows 2000. The Windows 2000 that he used as an 11 year old kid.</p>
<h2 id="windows-2000-and-synthwave"><strong>Windows 2000 and SynthWave</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
Windows 2000 was beautiful. And it knew exactly what it was. And then, everybody got distracted because we had to turn the PC into a gaming machine, into a surfing machine. And it had to become everything. A multimedia entertainment platform. And I had just these positive childhood memories of the really serious office computer. That’s something that I wanted to rebuild I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>This idea of recreating the past based on nostalgic joy is something that he learned from the music genre synthwave.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
It’s a modern music genre that takes influence from 1980s synth pop and movie soundtracks like Blade Runner and things like that. And I see this parallel between the genre of synthwave wave and what I’m doing with Serenity in that we are taking all these old ideas, but rebuilding them using modern technology and modern development practices. And it’s so much easier today to build a system that looks and feels like something from the year 2000 than it was back then. Because of course, we have way better stuff today, and we understand much more about software development.</p>

<p>Much like with synthwave, it’s so much easier to make a cool synth-pop song today than it was in 1985, because in ‘85 you needed analog synthesizers and all this advanced equipment, right? Or I guess you had digital synthesizers in ‘85, but you had much more crude tools. And in that sense, I think SerenityOS is like synthwave. It’s creating something strongly influenced by the past, but in a modern way, and in a sort of a high fidelity way with 2020 hindsight.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>So this is what Andreas was working on all day, every day when he wasn’t attending NA meetings. Just coding away in his cabin, building a new sober life for himself by throwing himself at this project.</em></p>
<h2 id="announcing-the-project-to-reddit"><strong>Announcing the Project To Reddit</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
And then when that rental contract ran out, that’s when I made a post on Reddit about, “So I’m moving out of this house, and I just spent the last six months here writing this operating system. And here’s what it looks like.” And had a little demo video of it that I posted on YouTube as well. People were really kind of captivated by the thing I think. Of course looking back now, it’s very simple compared to what it has become. But there was something about it that was really energetic and something new, yet still familiar to everybody. I mean I don’t know. I thought a lot about what is it that makes this so interesting to people? I can never quite figure it out, but people liked it.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
One thing I was thinking about is oftentimes, the layers below yourself as a developer seem kind of magical. So for somebody to come along and say, “Here it is. Here’s all of it.” It’s like, “Here, I started at the bottom.” It’s almost like you’re saying, “It’s not magic. Look, here. Did it?”</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
Yeah. No, that’s true. That’s true. That’s something I heard often from people. It piqued people’s curiosity who wanted to see what a real system might look like, even though it was clearly immature. It was still an approximation of what a mature system might look like.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>Those people whose interest was piqued, they started to poke around with Serenity, try it out. And they started to contribute.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
One of the first things that somebody helped out with was writing a script that would automate the build process. And that was really, really sweet. I was very, very grateful for that. And then since then, it’s just been growing. New people pick this up every week and find something they want to hack on. And I’ve always been welcoming to new people because even if it started as a personal therapy project for me, that doesn’t mean that I don’t want other people to work on it. Right? I’m really happy to share my programming playground with anybody else who wants to write similar type of software.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>And to explain how it all worked, Andreas started recording himself. He recorded himself coding, and uploaded it onto YouTube. This didn’t come naturally to him at first.</em></p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
One of the first videos I put up on YouTube, I had this long struggle trying to print out a number in octal. And it took me a little too long. And I remember just feeling, “This is so embarrassing. Now everybody will see.” And I decided to upload it anyway because I thought, “You know what? This would probably be good for me if I just become okay with people seeing me struggling with something silly.”</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
It’s interesting because you had a secret life, and then you went to a world of nothing is secret. Was this some sort of conscious decision to be completely out there with this project?</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
I think so. I even named it after the recovery program I was in. When you go to these 12 step meetings, then you always read the Serenity prayer at the end. The way I was thinking at the time was I need to make something that is so big and beautiful, that I will want to stick around. And I can use that as a tool to keep myself honest. If I just name it something that always recalls where it came from, and I tell everybody where it came from. So I guess I sort of saw it as a chance to build this big monument to my own recovery. And then I could never run away from it. And I would feel like such a hypocrite if I would start using drugs again and working on my Serenity Operating System at the same time. Right? So I sort of get this built-in deterrent from that.</p>
<h2 id="building-in-public"><strong>Building in Public</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
There’s no telling what the future holds, of course. But in rehab, we often talked about how people have this tendency to, if you see an opportunity to build a back door into your life, like an escape hatch for yourself, then if you’re not conscious about those things, then you have a tendency to just build those. So I guess here, I was kind of thinking proactively and trying to build whatever the opposite of a back door is. Maybe build a window into my life instead let’s say.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
<em>The community started watching through that window. People watched him code and then they asked him questions. How did he type so fast? How did he get started working at Apple? How do you pass a coding interview? He started off a bit nervous. But as the hours of tape accumulated, he became a pretty confident speaker. And people learned a lot watching him code. He was good at what he did. He had to get a job initially to support himself. But eventually, his YouTube fans and project contributors, they gave him enough financial support that he could dedicate to this full time.</em></p>
<p><em>A neat thing about a project this large is there’s lots of rough edges. There’s lots of parts to build. There’s lots of work to keep many people busy. When I look right now, in past 30 days, Serenity has had over 100 contributors, and the numbers continue to grow.</em></p>
<p><em>But actually growth and completion, that’s not really what this project is about.</em></p>
<h2 id="just-a-kid-who-loved-computers"><strong>Just a Kid who Loved Computers</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
Unlike most other projects, we are not trying to gain users, or popularity, or anything like that. Each and every person who works on this, they just want to make something for themselves, something beautiful. And I think that gives us almost kind of a purity of purpose that I enjoy. That I always treated it as this is going to take at least 10 years to get anywhere reasonable. And it’s astonishing how much you can do if you take that perspective from the beginning. If you accept that something is going to take a long time, you don’t have to deal with that growing disappointment when you’re not getting to where you want to be immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
My very last question is did you recapture this 11 year old version of yourself and that energy that you were looking for?</p>
<p><strong>Andreas:</strong>
I think so. I’ve never felt more true to myself than I do lately. I never worry anymore about how I present myself if I’m saying the right thing or if I should try to phrase myself this way or that way. Because I can just speak from the heart, and I know that it comes out how I want it to come out.</p>

<p>Most of my life, I was very conscious of everything I would say. And I was always trying to manicure my public persona so that I could obscure how I was living my life. And it is a very good feeling to not do that, and to just sort of speak candidly and honestly about everything and anything. And that’s really how I was like when I was 11. I wasn’t cynical, and I wasn’t trying to hide anything. I was just a kid who loved computers. And I think I became that again. And I’m happy about that.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps"><strong>Next Steps</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
You can find Andreas on YouTube. Serenity isn’t done, but you can use it. I don’t think it’s the type of project that will ever be complete. If you want to learn how to build an operating system, or systems programming, or modern C++, or just watch hundreds of hours of a calm person working diligently at a project that he thinks might take all his life, you should totally check him out on YouTube. And as you’ve probably gotten a taste of here, his openness and candor speaking about his life is very endearing. So you should check that out.</p>

<p>Also, if you want to hear more about his time at Apple and how it was both an amazing experience and a problematic one, and more about the Serenity project and how it can be transformative for people who join, check out the Patreon episode. It’s going to be out on the 15th. Oh yeah. And we didn’t even cover this, but they’re building a full web browser from scratch. I heard someone say that the web standards are so complex right now, that it wouldn’t be possible to build a new web browser. But here, the Serenity team is doing it. And you can watch them.</p>

Hello, <br>I make CoRecursive because I love it when someone shares the details behind some project, some bug, or some incident with me.
</p><p>
No other podcast was telling stories quite like I wanted to hear.

Right now this is all done by just me and I love doing it, but it's also exhausting.

Recommending the show to others and contributing to this patreon are the biggest things you can do to help out.

            <div>
                <p>
                    Full Python 3 environment entirely in Rust (not CPython bindings), with a clean implementation and no compatiblity hacks.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <p>
                    Fast, reliable and secure implementation of Python that can be used from Rust or compiled to WebAssembly.
                </p>
            </div>
            
        </div>
        <div>
                

<p>There are many implementations of Python. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">CPython</a> (C), which is the most common</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> (Java)</li>
  <li><a href="https://ironpython.net/">IronPython</a> (.NET)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a> (Python)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.stackless.com/">Stackless</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these implementations offer some benefits: Jython, for example, compiles Python 2 source code to Java byte code, then routes it to the Java Virtual Machine. Because Python code is translated to Java bytecode, it looks and feels like a true Java program at runtime and so it integrates well with Java applications.</p>

<p>IronPython is well-integrated with .NET, which means IronPython can use the .NET framework and Python 2 libraries or vice versa.</p>

<p>We want to unlock the same possibilities that Jython and IronPython enable, but for the Rust programming language. In addition, thanks to Rusts’ minimal runtime, we’re able to compile RustPython to WebAssembly and allow users to run their Python code easily in the browser.</p>

While requests usually take between seven and 14 days to process, he says sometimes information can’t be removed.

    <p><strong>This week saw a conclusion on the Danish Chromebook case</strong>. The result, long-awaited by father and privacy activist Jesper Graugaard, shows that the <strong>Danish Data Protection Authority has issued an injunction</strong> regarding the tracking of children's personal data via Chromebook and Google platforms in schools.</p>
<p>From 1 August 2024 onwards, Danish schools will no longer be allowed to enable Chromebooks and Google platforms to collect students' personal data for processing. Each municipality will need to give an indication of how they will comply to this injunction <strong>by 1 March 2024</strong>.</p>
<p>For activist Graugaard, the decision comes as a relief. He began his crusade against Chromebooks in school in his home town Elsinor over four years ago. While this week's report makes no reference to Jesper's initiatives, it is clear that this injunction could not have been issued without his tireless and sometimes solitary activism.</p>
<p>Hopefully the Danish Chromebook case's conclusion will draw attention to the unchecked intrusion of data mining companies into schools in other countries within Europe, and worldwide. It would be good to see checks on Google's dominance in schools, currently achieved via attractively priced hardware and free proprietary platforms built for this purpose.</p>
<p>And on a personal note: Congratulations, Jesper!</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I interviewed Jesper Graugaard in October of 2023, when results of his case were pending. Those interviews can be read <a href="https://theprivacydad.com/the-privacy-dad-interviews-jesper-graugaard/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://theprivacydad.com/the-privacy-dad-interviews-jesper-graugaard-2/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>These interviews were reworked and published as an article titled 'The fight for privacy in Danish schools' on the <a href="https://freedom.tech/jesper-graugaards-activism-against-chromebooks-in-danish-schools/" target="_blank">Freedom Tech blog</a>, managed by Seth for Privacy, shortly after that.</p>
<p>In my communication with Jesper I learned how it all started when he, a parent with an open-minded stance towards IT in schools, discovered his child's data was being made public via a Google account set up by the school.</p>
<p>Over the years, Jesper has been determined to explore avenues for protest against Google, for drawing attention to the misuse of students' personal data, and for taking action against it. His story shows that one person's critical questions and actions <em>can</em> impact what feels like a mammoth and immovable industry.</p>
<h2 id="injunction">Injunction</h2>
<p>The English translation of the full report on the injunction by the Danish Data Protection can be read <a href="https://media.licdn.com/dms/document/media/D4E1FAQFd_XMkoJOAcw/feedshare-document-pdf-analyzed/0/1706608145644?e=1707350400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=5M_LW6Zk1ZL4YIh4tWV6lo-LQ9xYfZ8s-0mpr1SxGyE" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here are a few key points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case of the use of Google Workspace in the primary schools, the Danish Data Protection Authority assesses that there is no authority to pass on personal data to Google for all the purposes that are passed on today. Therefore, the Danish Data Protection Authority is now giving an order to the municipalities to bring the processing in line with the rules and indicates various ways in which this can be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the Danish Data Protection Authority gives an order to the municipalities to bring the processing in line with the rules by ensuring that there is authorization for all the processing that takes place. This can happen, for example, by:</p>
<p>• That the municipalities no longer pass on personal data to Google for these purposes. This will <strong>likely require Google to develop a technical option for the data streams in question to be intercepted</strong>.</p>
<p>• That <strong>Google itself refrains</strong> from processing the information for these purposes.</p>
<p>• That the Danish Parliament provides a sufficiently clear legal basis for disclosure for these purposes.</p>
<p>The municipalities <strong>must comply with the order from 1 August 2024, but must indicate how they intend to comply by 1 March at the latest</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>(my emphasis)</em></p>
<p>For readers interested in the details, I'll add the link again <a href="https://media.licdn.com/dms/document/media/D4E1FAQFd_XMkoJOAcw/feedshare-document-pdf-analyzed/0/1706608145644?e=1707350400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=5M_LW6Zk1ZL4YIh4tWV6lo-LQ9xYfZ8s-0mpr1SxGyE" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is, at first sight, a positive outcome for the protection of children's data in Denmark, and at least a warning signal to companies hoping to introduce their products to each new generation of children via schools. With the 1st of March date not far off, the order should enforce a quick response from educational boards in each municipality.</p>
<h2 id="response-so-far">Response so far</h2>
<p>After the final decision was made, Jesper's case—he refers to it as the 'Chromebook saga'—suddenly received <strong>a lot</strong> of attention. On his LinkedIn profile, he wrote earlier this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suddenly LinkedIn exploded, the phone rang almost non-stop and the rest of my day disappeared in an ocean of documents, conversations with journalists, tech people, LinkedIn connection requests, congratulations, articles, analyses and a tide of opinion and thoughts. 4 ½ years of hard work to keep a case current, which I am personally passionate about and have carried forward - often alone -, was about to culminate. (edited)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading through his comments, one also senses a dose of realism and caution. The day after publication of the decision, Jesper posted a translation of an article by journalist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-christian-bech-nielsen-16a70aa3/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3B8CLGB3HxRwm0dS%2FQ%2BmUhTg%3D%3D" target="_blank">Peter Christian Bech-Nielsen</a> from Techmediet Radar, which asks critical questions about the unnecessary four-year length of the case, and explores the possibility large data companies might try to avoid taking real steps to change the way data is currently transferred.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Camilla Ley Valentin, the Director of DI Digital, the lobby organisation representing IT businesses in Denmark, posted this response from the side of the tech companies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I cannot help but wonder about the decision that has landed. Because in this case, we are not talking about sensitive data relating to the individual child, which is used, for example, for marketing.</p>
<p>The case concerns pseudonymized and aggregated usage data, such as data to measure a browser's performance or data to assess whether a button in a digital solution works better if it is green rather than blue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A regular listener to <em>The Surveillance Report</em> and the <em>Firewalls Don't Stop Dragons</em> podcasts, I am skeptical about such dismissive statements from the world's wealthiest companies. It is often discovered after the fact that data companies were furtively collecting more data than promised. Listening to the news items on these podcasts, it also seems difficult to truly anonymise data and remove the potential for cross referencing with other data sets.</p>
<p>We will have to see where all of this leads.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-solutions">Are there solutions?</h2>
<p>Having worked in schools for many years, I can imagine the education departments in the municipalities affected by the decision will be scrambling to find ways to <em>avoid</em> halting the use of Chromebooks in schools.</p>
<p>One might be inclined to sympathise. What is wrong, after all, with making computers widely available in schools? But as Jesper has often pointed out to me, Danish schools and educational boards have known about his case and the potential illegality of the practice for years now, yet have made no effort to think of a 'plan B', should the verdict land on the side of protecting the rights of children.</p>
<p>Google will want to keep this case low profile, as Chromebooks are used in schools all over the world. The Danish Data Protection Authority suggests that a <strong>possible solution would be for Google to create a new tool that <em>intercepts</em> children's data before it is sent to their servers</strong>. It is unlikely Google will want to develop such a tool, given they make money on personal data. However, seen from Google's perspective, they have already made big gains by establishing their products and platforms as the standard in schools worldwide.</p>
<p>Journalist Peter Christian Bech-Nielsen, mentioned earlier, also suggests looking into local IT companies—<a href="https://www.magenta.dk/en/our-organization/" target="_blank">Magenta</a> and <a href="https://www.semaphor.dk/" target="_blank">Semaphore</a>—that might already be ready to provide open source alternatives to the Google educational platforms.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-linux">Why not Linux?</h2>
<p>I don't see why educational ministers and boards world-wide haven't embraced Linux for schools. If the argument for the use of Chromebooks in schools is the low cost, well, then <strong>there is no argument, because all Linux software is free</strong>. If the concern is getting the hardware, then I say: Look to hardware refurbishing companies and organisations. Laptops deemed outdated for corporate use can <em>easily</em> be adapted for an additional five years of school use<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> by installing a Linux distro on them and running free, open source software like <strong>LibreOffice</strong>. Chrome can be replaced with <strong>Firefox and DuckDuckGo</strong>, and school platforms can run on an open source platform like <strong>Nextcloud</strong>.</p>
<p>Using refurbished hardware in schools is cheap, good for the environment, creates new IT jobs and introduces new generations of young people to recycling and to open source software. If managed well, open source is secure, and light on hardware resources. As a teacher, I have had to use educational IT services and devices for many years, and I do not see a downside to using Linux for these purposes.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>I want to conclude with Jesper's own thoughts on the future of his case. I appreciate he was able to find the time during his hectic week to respond to my emails and questions.</p>
<p>Here's Jesper today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will attend a professional course in GDPR, normally intended for Data Privacy Officers, as I feel it's important to me to get deeper into the way DPOs think and work. Also, I am trying to understand where my legal rights are in this mess. Not that I plan to sue the state or municipality for immaterial damage; but I want to understand why the rights of the citizen are sidelined in this case. There seems to be place where I, as a citizen, can hand over responsibility.</p>
<p>It's now official that the children have been using illegal technology for years, but the only result thus far is that those responsible are getting more time to fix the problem. Via journalists who have access to documents we know that the Municipalities' Land Association (KL) has sent some of the documents twice, thereby prolonging the proceedings. They have made children continue to use Chromebooks for nearly ten years now, with four-and-a-half of those ignoring the newly introduced GDPR regulations affecting children aged six and up. The case concerns hundreds of thousands of children nationwide using only one specific main provider: Google.  We still have nearly 50% of the rest who use products from different providers, such as Microsoft and Apple.</p>
<p>So what's next?</p>
<p>The question is:</p>
<p>How can it be politically acceptable that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Children have been illegally using a specific technology close to 50% of the time for nearly a decade?</p>
</li>
<li><p>This concerns a minimum 50% of all children in Denmark's public schools aged 6-18?</p>
</li>
<li><p>They all shared their personal data with at least one Big Tech company for ten years without the consent from themselves or from their parents?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible outcomes that I foresee are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Municipalities will finally find a technical solution and then proceed legally (But why haven't they done this already?)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Google and other global data companies will adapt to follow Danish law</p>
</li>
<li><p>The government changes the law so what's illegal today will be legal tomorrow</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter what happens, Danish children seem to have no legal rights; all they can do is sit and wait.</p>
<p>Best, 
Jesper</p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
<p>Someone has posted about the issue on r/Denmark. The discussion is in Danish and can be read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/1akhul2/datatilsynet_har_endeligt_laddet_hammeren_falde/?context=3" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I found this comment (translated) interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are alternatives to Google Workspace that municipalities could use: https://oscampus.dk/. Compared to their Chromebooks, it's not even because they need to be scrapped. You could re-install them with the Danish OS2BorgerPC: https://www.os2.eu/os2borgerpc</p>

<h2>Apple to EU: "Go fuck yourself" (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/06/spoil-the-bunch/#dma">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>There's a strain of anti-anti-monopolist that insists that they're not <em>pro</em>-monopoly – they're just <em>realists</em> who understand that global gigacorporations are too big to fail, too big to jail, and that governments can't hope to rein them in. Trying to regulate a tech giant, they say, is like trying to regulate the weather.</p>
<p>This ploy is cousins with Jay Rosen's idea of "savvying," defined as: "dismissing valid questions with the insider's, 'and this surprises you?'"</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/344825874362810369?lang=en">https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/344825874362810369?lang=en</a></p>
<p>In both cases, an apologist for corruption masquerades as a pragmatist who understands the ways of the world, unlike you, a pathetic dreamer who foolishly hopes for a better world. In both cases, the apologist provides cover for corruption, painting it as an inevitability, not a choice. "Don't hate the player. Hate the game."</p>
<p>The reason this foolish nonsense flies is that we are living in an age of rampant corruption and utter impunity. Companies really <em>do</em> get away with both literal and figurative murder. Governments really <em>do</em> ignore horrible crimes by the rich and powerful, and fumble what rare, few enforcement efforts they assay.</p>
<p>Take the GDPR, Europe's landmark privacy law. The GDPR establishes strict limitations of data-collection and processing, and provides for brutal penalties for companies that violate its rules. The immediate impact of the GDPR was a mass-extinction event for Europe's data-brokerages and surveillance advertising companies, all of which were in obvious violation of the GDPR's rules.</p>
<p>But there was a curious pattern to GDPR enforcement: while smaller, EU-based companies were swiftly shuttered by its provisions, the US-based giants that conduct the most brazen, wide-ranging, illegal surveillance escaped unscathed for years and years, continuing to spy on Europeans.</p>
<p>One (erroneous) way to look at this is as a "compliance moat" story. In that story, GDPR requires a bunch of expensive systems that only gigantic companies like Facebook and Google can afford. These compliance costs are a "capital moat" – a way to exclude smaller companies from functioning in the market. Thus, the GDPR acted as an anticompetitive wrecking ball, clearing the field for the largest companies, who get to operate without having to contend with smaller companies nipping at their heels:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/06/27/another-report-shows-gdpr-benefited-google-facebook-hurt-everyone-else/">https://www.techdirt.com/2019/06/27/another-report-shows-gdpr-benefited-google-facebook-hurt-everyone-else/</a></p>
<p>This is wrong.</p>
<p>Oh, compliance moats are <em>definitely</em> real – think of the calls for AI companies to license their training data. AI companies can easily do this – they'll just buy training data from giant media companies – the very same companies that hope to use models to replace creative workers with algorithms. Create a new copyright over training data won't eliminate AI – it'll just confine AI to the largest, best capitalized companies, who will gladly provide tools to corporations hoping to fire their workforces:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/09/ai-monkeys-paw/#bullied-schoolkids">https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/09/ai-monkeys-paw/#bullied-schoolkids</a></p>
<p>But just because some regulations can be compliance moats, that doesn't mean that <em>all</em> regulations are compliance moats. And just because some regulations are vigorously applied to small companies while leaving larger firms unscathed, it doesn't follow that the regulation in question is a compliance moat.</p>
<p>A harder look at what happened with the GDPR reveals a completely different dynamic at work. The reason the GDPR vaporized small surveillance companies and left the big companies untouched had nothing to do with compliance costs. The Big Tech companies <em>don't comply with the GDPR</em> – <em>they just get away with violating the GDPR</em>.</p>
<p>How do they get away with it? They fly Irish flags of convenience. Decades ago, Ireland started dabbling with offering tax-havens to the wealthy and mobile – they invented the duty-free store:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty-free_shop#1947%E2%80%931990:_duty_free_establishment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty-free_shop#1947%E2%80%931990:_duty_free_establishment</a></p>
<p>Capturing pennies from the wealthy by helping them avoid fortunes they owed in taxes elsewhere was terribly seductive. In the years that followed, Ireland began aggressively courting the wealthy on an industrial scale, offering corporations the chance to duck their obligations to their host countries by flying an Irish flag of convenience.</p>
<p>There are other countries who've tried this gambit – the "treasure islands" of the Caribbean, the English channel, and elsewhere – but Ireland is part of the EU. In the global competition to help the rich to get richer, Ireland had a killer advantage: access to the EU, the common market, and 500m affluent potential customers. The Caymans can hide your money for you, and there's a few super-luxe stores and art-galleries in George Town where you can spend it, but it's no Champs Elysees or Ku-Damm.</p>
<p>But when you're competing with other countries for the pennies of trillion-dollar tax-dodgers, any wins can be turned into a loss in an instant. After all, any corporation that is footloose enough to establish a Potemkin Headquarters in Dublin and fly the trídhathach can easily up sticks and open another Big Store HQ in some other haven that offers it a sweeter deal.</p>
<p>This has created a global race to the bottom among tax-havens to also serve as regulatory havens – and there's a made-in-the-EU version that sees Ireland, Malta, Cyprus and sometimes the Netherlands competing to see who can offer the most impunity for the worst crimes to the most awful corporations in the world.</p>
<p>And <em>that's</em> why Google and Facebook haven't been extinguished by the GDPR while their rivals were. It's not compliance moats – it's impunity. Once a corporation attains a certain scale, it has the excess capital to spend on phony relocations that let it hop from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, chasing the loosest slots on the strip. Ireland is a made town, where the cops are all on the take, and two thirds of the data commissioner's rulings are <em>eventually</em> overturned by the federal court:</p>

<p>This is a problem among many federations, not just the EU. The US has its onshore-offshore tax- and regulation-havens (Delaware, South Dakota, Texas, etc), and so does Canada (Alberta), and some Swiss cantons are, frankly, <em>batshit</em>:</p>
<p><a href="https://lenews.ch/2017/11/25/swiss-fact-some-swiss-women-had-to-wait-until-1991-to-vote/">https://lenews.ch/2017/11/25/swiss-fact-some-swiss-women-had-to-wait-until-1991-to-vote/</a></p>
<p>None of this is to condemn federations outright. Federations are (potentially) good! But federalism has a vulnerability: the autonomy of the federated states means that they can be played against each other by national or transnational entities, like corporations. This doesn't mean that it's impossible to regulate powerful entities within a federation – but it means that federal regulation needs to account for the risk of jurisdiction-shopping.</p>
<p>Enter the Digital Markets Act, a new Big Tech specific law that, among other things, bans monopoly app stores and payment processing, through which companies like Apple and Google have levied a 30% tax on the entire app market, while arrogating to themselves the right to decide which software their customers may run on their own devices:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/07/curatorial-vig/#app-tax">https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/07/curatorial-vig/#app-tax</a></p>
<p>Apple has responded to this regulation with a gesture of contempt so naked and broad that it beggars belief. As Proton describes, Apple's DMA plan is the very definition of malicious compliance:</p>
<p><a href="https://proton.me/blog/apple-dma-compliance-plan-trap">https://proton.me/blog/apple-dma-compliance-plan-trap</a></p>
<p>Recall that the DMA is intended to curtail monopoly software distribution through app stores and mobile platforms' insistence on using their payment processors, whose fees are sky-high. The law is intended to extinguish developer agreements that ban software creators from informing customers that they can get a better deal by initiating payments elsewhere, or by getting a service through the web instead of via an app.</p>
<p>In response, Apple, has instituted a junk fee it calls the "Core Technology Fee": EUR0.50/install for every installation over 1m. As Proton writes, as apps grow more popular, using third-party payment systems will grow less attractive. Apple has offered discounts on its eye-watering payment processing fees to a mere 20% for the first payment and 13% for renewals. Compare this with the normal – and far, far too high – payment processing fees the rest of the industry charges, which run 2-5%. On top of all this, Apple has lied about these new discounted rates, hiding a 3% "processing" fee in its headline figures.</p>
<p>As Proton explains, paying 17% fees <em>and</em> EUR0.50 for each subscriber's renewal makes most software businesses into money-losers. The only way to keep them afloat is to use Apple's old, default payment system. That choice is made more attractive by Apple's inclusion of a "scare screen" that warns you that demons will rend your soul for all eternity if you try to use an alternative payment scheme.</p>
<p>Apple defends this scare screen by saying that it will protect users from the intrinsic unreliability of third-party processors, but as Proton points out, there are plenty of giant corporations who get to use their own payment processors with their iOS apps, because Apple decided they were too big to fuck with. Somehow, Apple can let its customers spend money with Uber, McDonald's, Airbnb, Doordash and Amazon without terrorizing them about existential security risks – but not mom-and-pop software vendors or publishers who don't want to hand 30% of their income over to a three-trillion-dollar company.</p>
<p>Apple has also reserved the right to cancel any alternative app store and nuke it from Apple customers' devices without warning, reason or liability. Those app stores also have to post a one-million euro line of credit in order to be considered for iOS. Given these terms, it's obvious that no one is going to offer a third-party app store for iOS and if they did, no one would list their apps in it.</p>
<p>The fuckery goes on and on. If an app developer opts into third-party payments, they can't use Apple's payment processing too – so any users who are scared off by the scare screen have no way to pay the app's creators. And once an app creator opts into third party payments, they can never go back – the decision is permanent.</p>
<p>Apple also reserves the right to change all of these policies later, for the worse ("I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it further" -D. Vader). They have warned developers that they might change the API for reporting external sales and revoke developers' right to use alternative app stores at its discretion, with no penalties if that screws the developer.</p>
<p>Apple's contempt extends beyond app marketplaces. The DMA also obliges Apple to open its platform to third party browsers and browser engines. Every browser on iOS is actually just Safari wrapped in a cosmetic skin, because Apple bans third-party browser-engines:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/13/kitbashed/#app-store-tax">https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/13/kitbashed/#app-store-tax</a></p>
<p>But, as Mozilla puts it, Apple's plan for this is "as painful as possible":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24052067/mozilla-apple-ios-browser-rules-firefox">https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24052067/mozilla-apple-ios-browser-rules-firefox</a></p>
<p>For one thing, Apple will only allow <em>European</em> customers to run alternative browser engines. That means that Firefox will have to "build and maintain two separate browser implementations — a burden Apple themselves will not have to bear."</p>
<p>(One wonders how Apple will treat Americans living in the EU, whose Apple accounts still have US billing addresses – these people will still be entitled to the browser choice that Apple is grudgingly extending to Europeans.)</p>
<p>All of this sends a strong signal that Apple is planning to run the same playbook with the DMA that Google and Facebook used on the GDPR: ignore the law, use lawyerly bullshit to chaff regulators, and hope that European federalism has sufficiently deep cracks that it can hide in them when the enforcers come to call.</p>
<p>But Apple is about to get a nasty shock. For one thing, the DMA allows wronged parties to start their search for justice in the European federal court system – bypassing the Irish regulators and courts. For another, there is a <em>global</em> movement to check corporate power, and because the tech companies do the same kinds of fuckery in every territory, regulators are able to collaborate across borders to take them down.</p>
<p>Take Apple's app store monopoly. The best reference on this is the report published by the UK Competition and Markets Authority's Digital Markets Unit:</p>
<p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/63f61bc0d3bf7f62e8c34a02/Mobile_Ecosystems_Final_Report_amended_2.pdf">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/63f61bc0d3bf7f62e8c34a02/Mobile_Ecosystems_Final_Report_amended_2.pdf</a></p>
<p>The devastating case that the DMU report was key to crafting the DMA – but it also inspired a US law aimed at forcing app markets open:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2710">https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2710</a></p>
<p>And a Japanese enforcement action:</p>
<p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Japan-to-crack-down-on-Apple-and-Google-app-store-monopolies">https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Japan-to-crack-down-on-Apple-and-Google-app-store-monopolies</a></p>
<p>And action in South Korea:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-considers-505-mln-fine-against-google-apple-over-app-market-practices-2023-10-06/">https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-considers-505-mln-fine-against-google-apple-over-app-market-practices-2023-10-06/</a></p>
<p>These enforcers gather for annual meetings – I spoke at one in London, convened by the Competition and Markets Authority – where they compare notes, form coalitions, and plan strategy:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/cma-data-technology-and-analytics-conference-2022-registration-308678625077">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/cma-data-technology-and-analytics-conference-2022-registration-308678625077</a></p>
<p>This is where the savvying breaks down. Yes, Apple is big enough to run circles around Japan, or South Korea, or the UK. But when those countries join forces with the EU, the USA and other countries that are fed up to the eyeballs with Apple's bullshit, the company is in <em>serious</em> danger.</p>
<p>It's true that Apple has convinced a bunch of its customers that buying a phone from a multi-trillion-dollar corporation makes you a member of an oppressed religious minority:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones">https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones</a></p>
<p>Some of those self-avowed members of the "Cult of Mac" are willing to take the company's pronouncements at face value and will dutifully repeat Apple's claims to be "protecting" its customers. But even that credulity has its breaking point – Apple can only poison the well so many times before people stop drinking from it. Remember when the company announced a miraculous reversal to its war on right to repair, later revealed to be a bald-faced lie?</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/22/vin-locking/#thought-differently">https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/22/vin-locking/#thought-differently</a></p>
<p>Or when Apple claimed to be protecting phone users' privacy, which was also a lie?</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar">https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar</a></p>
<p>The savvy will see Apple lying (again) and say, "this surprises you?" No, it doesn't surprise me, but it pisses me off – and I'm not the only one, and Apple's insulting lies are getting less effective by the day.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><article>

<p>I like Postgres, but there are things I really wish they would implement. For
example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2011">SQL:2011</a> spec adds
support for system-versioned tables. Unfortunately, Postgres and SQLite are
basically the only SQL databases that don’t yet support it. While it has been
discussed in length at the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/CALAY4q-cXCD0r4OybD%3Dw7Hr7F026ZUY6%3DLMsVPUe6yw_PJpTKQ%40mail.gmail.com">postgreqsl-hackers’ mailing
list</a>,
it seems like the discussion and implementation efforts have been silent in all
of 2023.</p>

<p>Now, there are extensions out there that implement versioning –
<a href="https://clarkdave.net/2015/02/historical-records-with-postgresql-and-temporal-tables-and-sql-2011/"><code>temporal_tables</code></a>
being the most popular I think – but none are supported for managed Postgres
instances on e.g. Azure or AWS. This means that if we want system-versioned
tables, we’re forced to make it ourselves.</p>

<p>I’m not going to spend paragraph after paragraph explaining why I want temporal
tables before we go to the actual implementation, but I’d like to note that I
want to use these tables primarily for user data, generated by users when they
click/type something on a webpage. They can be used for other things, but if you
have time series, want to do event sourcing or online analytical processing, you
should probably pick some technology suited for that task instead of throwing
temporal tables at it.</p>

<p>If you’re only after the end result, feel free to go to my GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/hypirion/time-travelling-todo-lists-in-postgres">time-travelling-todo-lists-in-postgres</a>.
It is a todo list app with time-travelling capabilities, using the
implementation described here. There you’ll have information on how to use it
yourself, how to query the past, as well as gotchas and common pitfalls.</p>

<h2 id="the-implementation">The Implementation</h2>

<p>The implementation I’ve decided on consists of two tables for every table I want
version controlled: A snapshot table for the current state, and a history table.</p>

<p>The snapshot table is the one used for the current state of the world and is the
one you’ll usually work with: This works exactly like any other mutable in-place
table you’re familiar with. The history table is the one you’ll use when you
want to query through history.</p>

<p>First off, we define the tables:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>mytable</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>mytable_id</span> <span>UUID</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>gen_random_uuid</span><span>(),</span>
  <span>data</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>mytable_history</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>-- copy these fields, always keep them first</span>
  <span>history_id</span> <span>UUID</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
  <span>systime</span> <span>TSTZRANGE</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>CHECK</span> <span>(</span><span>NOT</span> <span>ISEMPTY</span><span>(</span><span>systime</span><span>)),</span>

  <span>-- table fields, in the exact same order as in mytable</span>
  <span>mytable_id</span> <span>UUID</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
  <span>data</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>mytable_history</span>
  <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>mytable_history_overlapping_excl</span>
  <span>EXCLUDE</span> <span>USING</span> <span>GIST</span> <span>(</span><span>mytable_id</span> <span>WITH</span> <span>=</span><span>,</span> <span>systime</span> <span>WITH</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The history table contains the exact same fields as the snapshot table, but the
first two columns in the table are a <code>history_id</code> field and the system time
(<code>systime</code>) it was active. <code>lower(systime)</code> is when this version of the record
was initially stored, and <code>upper(systime)</code> is when this record was no longer
valid. When <code>upper(systime)</code> is infinity, the record has not yet been deleted.
The interval can’t be empty obviously, as that wouldn’t match any time interval.</p>

<p>Next, we have a GiST index, which prevents us from having overlapping time
intervals for the same primary key, and also speeds up queries on the history.
You may want to add some more indices on the history table, depending on what
kind of queries you want to do on it.</p>

<p>Then we set up triggers for insert, update and delete:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>--</span>
<span>-- insert:</span>
<span>--</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>This is… long, to put it mildly, so let’s go through some common tricks all
the three triggers (ab)use, and then go over some design decisions I’ve decided
on for updates and deletes. We’ll get around to shortening it at the end.</p>

<h3 id="column-order-matters">Column Order Matters</h3>

<p>Whenever we insert new data into the history table, it will always be on this
form:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>mytable_history</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>gen_random_uuid</span><span>(),</span> <span>tstzrange</span><span>(</span><span>NOW</span><span>(),</span> <span>NULL</span><span>),</span> <span>NEW</span><span>.</span><span>*</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There are two parts of Postgres we abuse here. If we look at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-insert.html">the docs for
INSERT</a>, we’ll see the
following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The target column names can be listed in any order. If no list of column names
is given at all, the default is all the columns of the table in their declared
order; or the first <strong><em>N</em></strong> column names, if there are only <strong><em>N</em></strong> columns
supplied by the <code>VALUES</code> clause or <strong><em><code>query</code></em></strong>. The values supplied by the
<code>VALUES</code> clause or <strong><em><code>query</code></em></strong> are associated with the explicit or implicit
column list left-to-right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other is that <code>NEW.*</code> expands in the exact same order. In our case, <code>NEW.*</code>
will expand into <code>NEW.mytable_id, NEW.data</code>, and that means it fits perfectly
with the rows of <code>mytable_history</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>mytable_history</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>gen_random_uuid</span><span>(),</span> <span>tstzrange</span><span>(</span><span>NOW</span><span>(),</span> <span>NULL</span><span>),</span>
         <span>NEW</span><span>.</span><span>mytable_id</span><span>,</span> <span>NEW</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is pretty clever, but it’s also hacky. For this to work, there are two
things you have to get right:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Column order MUST be identical after the <code>history_id</code> and <code>systime</code> columns.</li>
  <li>Whenever you add new columns, you MUST add them in the same order to both
tables.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t do so, you will end up with broken inserts in the history table.
Those will at best give you an error, but they can also silently corrupt your
data.</p>

<p>I don’t like that, but there’s a reason why I don’t do</p>

<div><pre><code><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>mytable_history</span>
  <span>(</span><span>history_id</span><span>,</span> <span>systime</span><span>,</span> <span>mytable_id</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>)</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>gen_random_uuid</span><span>(),</span> <span>tstzrange</span><span>(</span><span>NOW</span><span>(),</span> <span>NULL</span><span>),</span>
       <span>NEW</span><span>.</span><span>mytable_id</span><span>,</span> <span>NEW</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and that’s because it creates <strong>a lot</strong> of effort when you want to remove,
rename or add a new column to the table. By omitting the list of target column
names and expanding <code>NEW.*</code>, the query will automatically work whenever I decide
to add, update or remove columns – provided I do it for both tables.</p>

<h3 id="on-system-time">On System Time</h3>

<p>If you haven’t worked with Postgres ranges before, the range queries may look a
bit cryptic. The Postgres docs have an excellent description of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/rangetypes.html">range
types</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/functions-range.html">range
functions</a>, which
should cover essentially everything related to them. I don’t use much of it
though, so since I guess you don’t want to go through it all, I’ll just list up
what the different parts do.</p>

<p>The expression</p>



<p>creates the timestamptz range <code>[a, b)</code>: from <em>a</em>, up to and excluding <em>b</em>. If
either <em>a</em> or <em>b</em> are <code>NULL</code>, then they are infinitely far in the past or
future, respectively.</p>

<p><code>lower(x)</code> returns the lower bound of the range, and <code>upper_inf(x)</code> returns
true if the upper bound is infinite.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>systime @&gt; NOW()</code> checks if <code>systime</code> contains <code>NOW()</code> – you can
think of it as <code>a &lt;= NOW() AND NOW() &lt; b</code>.</p>

<p>The reason for using ranges isn’t primarily because I want to use these
functions, but rather because the GiST index ensures no overlap and makes me
less worried that my queries will be super slow by accident.</p>

<h3 id="inserts">Inserts</h3>

<p>With those two things described, inserts are more or less described in their
entirety: We insert the row into the history table, saying it’s valid from the
transaction start time until forever.</p>

<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>

<p>The update trigger looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>-- ignore changes inside the same tx</span>
<span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>mytable_history</span>
  <span>WHERE</span> <span>mytable_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>NEW</span><span>.</span><span>mytable_id</span>
    <span>AND</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>systime</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>NOW</span><span>()</span>
    <span>AND</span> <span>upper_inf</span><span>(</span><span>systime</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- close current row</span>
<span>UPDATE</span> <span>mytable_history</span>
  <span>SET</span> <span>systime</span> <span>=</span> <span>tstzrange</span><span>(</span><span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>systime</span><span>),</span> <span>NOW</span><span>())</span>
  <span>WHERE</span> <span>mytable_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>NEW</span><span>.</span><span>mytable_id</span>
    <span>AND</span> <span>systime</span> <span>@&gt;</span> <span>NOW</span><span>();</span>
<span>-- insert new row</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>mytable_history</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>gen_random_uuid</span><span>(),</span> <span>tstzrange</span><span>(</span><span>NOW</span><span>(),</span> <span>null</span><span>),</span> <span>NEW</span><span>.</span><span>*</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It is set up so that multiple updates in the same transaction will only produce
a single history row. That’s intentional, because otherwise ordering would be
harder to implement.</p>

<p>If you need multiple versions in the same transaction, you’ll have to replace
the half-open interval (the default <code>[)</code>) with a closed one (<code>[]</code>). If not,
you’ll end up with empty intervals, which aren’t tied to any timestamps. But now
you have to handle identical states at a single timestamp, as multiple records
can get the <code>[NOW(), NOW()]</code> interval. If the ordering matters in that case,
you’ll have to add another ordering ID to get rows back in the inserted order.</p>

<p>I don’t need that, it’s complicated, and I don’t think it makes sense to have
multiple states at a single point in time anyway. If you need that, you’re
probably interested in an event table or something else instead.</p>

<h3 id="deletions">Deletions</h3>

<div><pre><code><span>-- close current row</span>
<span>-- note: updates and then deletes for same id</span>
<span>-- in same tx will fail</span>
<span>UPDATE</span> <span>mytable_history</span>
  <span>SET</span> <span>systime</span> <span>=</span> <span>tstzrange</span><span>(</span><span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>systime</span><span>),</span> <span>NOW</span><span>())</span>
  <span>WHERE</span> <span>mytable_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>OLD</span><span>.</span><span>mytable_id</span>
    <span>AND</span> <span>systime</span> <span>@&gt;</span> <span>NOW</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When it comes to atomicity, deletions are somewhat of an outlier. If you update
and then delete something in the same transaction, what should you do? And uh..
why would you do that in the first place?</p>

<p>“Update and delete” seems quite handy if you want to write down who deleted the
object, in which case the deletion will look like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>UPDATE</span> <span>mytable</span>
  <span>SET</span> <span>deleted_by</span> <span>=</span> <span>$</span><span>{</span><span>deleted_by</span><span>}</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>mytable_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>$</span><span>{</span><span>mytable_id</span><span>};</span>

<span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>mytable</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>mytable_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>$</span><span>{</span><span>mytable_id</span><span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>… however, it leaves you with an annoying record: The “delete” record, which
isn’t really part of the history, but only contains some information about the
deletion itself.</p>

<p>I think it’s better to make a little bit of effort for these, even if you don’t
have an immediate need for a changelog/audit log: Store the deletion information
in a table. You could create one for all tables, or just one for everything
depending on how lazy you are:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>delete_log</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>delete_log_id</span> <span>UUID</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>gen_random_uuid</span><span>(),</span>
  <span>table_name</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>

  <span>deleted_at</span> <span>TIMESTAMPTZ</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>NOW</span><span>(),</span>
  <span>deleted_by</span> <span>UUID</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> <span>users</span><span>(</span><span>user_id</span><span>)</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>-- then delete as follows</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>delete_log</span> <span>(</span><span>table_name</span><span>,</span> <span>resource_id</span><span>,</span> <span>deleted_by</span><span>)</span>
<span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'mytable'</span><span>,</span> <span>$</span><span>{</span><span>mytable_id</span><span>},</span> <span>$</span><span>{</span><span>deleted_by</span><span>});</span>

<span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>mytable</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>mytable_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>$</span><span>{</span><span>mytable_id</span><span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I can’t make a trigger out of this easily (or maybe not at all), because
<code>deleted_by</code> is information we’ll have to pass down into the database somehow.</p>

<h2 id="annoying-conflicts">Annoying Conflicts</h2>

<p>While the triggers themselves don’t impact what you can and cannot do, the GiST
index will blow up most attempts at concurrently updating the same item:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>mytable_history</span>
  <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>mytable_history_overlapping_excl</span>
  <span>EXCLUDE</span> <span>USING</span> <span>GIST</span> <span>(</span><span>mytable_id</span> <span>WITH</span> <span>=</span><span>,</span> <span>systime</span> <span>WITH</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will even fail if you do <code>SELECT .. FOR UPDATE</code>. When you have two
transactions A and B coming in, if the transaction with the most recent <code>NOW()</code>
timestamp gets the lock first, the second transaction will fail because
<code>systime</code> ends up as an empty interval.</p>

<p>It’s annoying, but not a big deal for me at least. The tables where I need
history usually never need write concurrency on the same ID. And if they do,
it’s not hard to add a retry loop around the writes… though of course, it
adds a pitfall you need to be aware of.</p>

<p>Trying to fix this by using <code>CLOCK_TIMESTAMP()</code> instead of <code>NOW()</code> will only
make things worse in my opinion. If you desire to insert multiple items at the
same time, usually none of them will have the same timestamp. That makes certain
queries on the history table technically wrong:</p>

<p>Imagine you have a list and list element table, and a user creates a new list
with 10 elements. With <code>CLOCK_TIMESTAMP()</code>, you now end up with 11 different
timestamps: One for the list root, and 10 for each list element. If you wondered
what the list looked like when it was first created, you’d first have to fetch
the list root. Then you have to fetch all elements that were in the list, say,
as of 1 second after it was created, to be relatively sure all the list elements
are also returned. But any attempt at recreating the state at some arbitrary
time in the past may end up with partial/corrupt results. For that reason, I
highly recommend avoiding this, and rather using some other method to persist
history if you really need it.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>

<p>A trigger-based model seems to me like the best one if you have to use Postgres,
but there are some alternatives you may want to consider.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-need-the-history">Do You Need The History?</h3>

<p>There is added complexity here, and there is an increased chance of transactions
failing because of overlapping timestamps that you can’t really prevent. That
begs the question: Do you really need the history?</p>

<p>My “controversial” opinion is that, in this day and age, I feel the true
question is really a matter of whether you can afford it performance-wise, and
not whether it’s too complex. This particular implementation of persisting
history is probably not very fast, but it is conceptually simple: Whenever you
do something to a table, that action is stored in a history table. The original
table is intentionally identical to what you’re used to. If you really don’t
like the potential GiST conflicts, you can relax the constraints to get
identical behaviour to what you’re used to. In that case, the only difference is
the insert/delete/update performance.</p>

<p>Yes, there are many cases where it’s clearly bonkers to retain the history, but
I also think many people assume storing the history is costlier than it actually
is<sup id="fnref:small-systems" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:small-systems" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. If you’re not sure, try it and see how it goes. Since your
original table will be untouched, it’s not hard to roll back.</p>

<p>For me, there are two reasons I think you should consider it, even if you have
no immediate plans to expose this to your users:</p>

<p>First, there will be a time when a specific customer needs their data rolled
back to an earlier version. That could either be because of accidental deletes,
rogue actors, or even a bad deployment that corrupted data for certain
customers. While this doesn’t replace backups by a long shot, it’s a lot faster
and easier to do</p>

<div><pre><code><span>BEGIN</span><span>;</span>

<span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>mytable</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>company_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>$</span><span>{</span><span>company_id</span><span>};</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>mytable</span> <span>(</span><span>your</span><span>,</span> <span>fields</span><span>,</span> <span>here</span><span>)</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>h</span><span>.</span><span>your</span><span>,</span> <span>h</span><span>.</span><span>field</span><span>,</span> <span>h</span><span>.</span><span>here</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>mytable_history</span> <span>h</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>h</span><span>.</span><span>company_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>$</span><span>{</span><span>company_id</span><span>}</span>
  <span>AND</span> <span>h</span><span>.</span><span>systime</span> <span>@&gt;</span> <span>$</span><span>{</span><span>backup_time</span><span>};</span>

<span>COMMIT</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It will of course end up being a little more complex than that in practice,
depending on the data model and how fine-grained you want to be. But it’s less
effort than setting up the backup server, bridging it with a foreign data
wrapper, and then finally doing the inserts in exactly the same manner as above,
before cleaning up the backup server afterwards.</p>

<p>There are other cases too, like debugging a transient issue one of your
users had. I could go on, but it feels like repeating the sales pitch for
<a href="https://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a>.</p>

<p>The second reason relates to the gut reaction of saying “We don’t need it”: If
you don’t have time travel abilities readily available, you can’t explore and
play with them. This, in turn, means you won’t really think of them when
developing new functionality for your customers. At the risk of sounding like a
techbro: I think it stifles innovation. Do you <em>really</em> think there’s no value
for it somewhere in your system in the future?</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, this sounds a lot like future-proofing. To be clear, YAGNI isn’t
wrong, but I only think it only applies when there’s either</p>

<ul>
  <li>significant overhead (either in terms of implementation complexity or
system performance)</li>
  <li>something that can be retroactively implemented (i.e. no data loss)</li>
</ul>

<p>and system-versioned tables are neither.</p>

<p>… well, uh, let me clarify here. The current implementation I’ve shown you
requires a lot of work when you make new tables. Which is a good transition to
my next point:</p>

<h3 id="use-a-database-suited-for-the-task">Use a Database Suited for the Task</h3>

<p>Writing all of these long triggers yourself just because Postgres doesn’t
support it is a bit stupid. If you want an open-source alternative, perhaps
MariaDB isn’t too bad? It supports
<a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/system-versioned-tables/">SQL:2011</a> and even has
support for bitemporality if you want to go even further.</p>

<p>Of course, I’d be amiss if I didn’t mention <a href="https://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a>.
It is a great database, although not open-source, and language support is rather
limited (only Java/Clojure officially). For the ones in Microsoft land, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/temporal-tables?view=sql-server-ver16">SQL
Server</a>
has great support for SQL:2011 as well, from what I gather.</p>

<p>As mentioned, this is aimed at user data generated by someone clicking or typing
around on a webpage, mutating some content of theirs. But for IoT data, you’d
like some other tool than temporal tables, and if you’re big enough, you
probably want to use an OLAP database for OLAP stuff.</p>

<h2 id="sloppy-paste-or-eldritch-horrors">Sloppy-Paste or Eldritch Horrors</h2>

<p>I am stuck with Postgres, both because that’s what I already got, but also
because I heavily use PostGIS. Migrating away is simply not an option, so I have
to make do with what I have.</p>

<p>What I like about the trigger solution is that it is – aside from the column
expansion hack – not terribly hard to understand. The problem is that it’s very
verbose, and after being burnt from a couple of copy-paste mistakes in the past,
I’d rather have a single trigger for every table if possible.</p>

<p>It is possible… though it does not look pretty. Here’s what the update trigger
looks like after we make the history table and ID field into input parameters:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> <span>copy_updates_into_history</span><span>()</span> <span>RETURNS</span> <span>TRIGGER</span> <span>AS</span> <span>$$</span>
<span>DECLARE</span>
  <span>history_table</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>:</span><span>=</span> <span>quote_ident</span><span>(</span><span>tg_argv</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
  <span>id_field</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>:</span><span>=</span> <span>quote_ident</span><span>(</span><span>tg_argv</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]);</span>
<span>BEGIN</span>
  <span>-- ignore changes inside the same tx</span>
  <span>EXECUTE</span> <span>'DELETE FROM '</span> <span>||</span> <span>history_table</span> <span>||</span>
    <span>' WHERE '</span> <span>||</span> <span>id_field</span> <span>||</span> <span>' = $1.'</span> <span>||</span> <span>id_field</span> <span>||</span>
    <span>' AND lower(systime) = NOW()'</span> <span>||</span>
    <span>' AND upper_inf(systime)'</span> <span>USING</span> <span>NEW</span><span>;</span>
  <span>-- close current row</span>
  <span>-- (if any, may be deleted by previous line)</span>
  <span>EXECUTE</span> <span>'UPDATE '</span> <span>||</span> <span>history_table</span> <span>||</span>
    <span>' SET systime = tstzrange(lower(systime), NOW())'</span>
    <span>' WHERE '</span> <span>||</span> <span>id_field</span> <span>||</span> <span>' = $1.'</span> <span>||</span> <span>id_field</span> <span>||</span>
    <span>' AND systime @&gt; NOW()'</span> <span>USING</span> <span>NEW</span><span>;</span>
  <span>-- insert new row</span>
  <span>EXECUTE</span> <span>'INSERT INTO '</span> <span>||</span> <span>history_table</span> <span>||</span>
    <span>' SELECT gen_random_uuid(), tstzrange(NOW(), null), $1.*'</span>
    <span>USING</span> <span>NEW</span><span>;</span>
  <span>RETURN</span> <span>NEW</span><span>;</span>
<span>END</span><span>;</span>
<span>$$</span> <span>LANGUAGE</span> <span>plpgsql</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>(The insert and update triggers are similar, so I won’t go over them here.)</p>

<p>To factor out the history table and ID field, we have to use
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/plpgsql-statements.html#PLPGSQL-STATEMENTS-EXECUTING-DYN"><code>EXECUTE</code></a>,
which makes the entire thing feel even more hacky. It looks ugly, and if you’re
not familiar with <code>EXECUTE</code> or the previously mentioned column expansion magic,
it may feel outright eldritch. However, I think this is better than the first
attempt at the trigger implementation for one big reason. And that is best shown
by using it in practice:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TRIGGER</span> <span>mytable_history_update_trigger</span>
<span>AFTER</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>ON</span> <span>mytable</span>
    <span>FOR</span> <span>EACH</span> <span>ROW</span>
    <span>WHEN</span> <span>(</span><span>OLD</span><span>.</span><span>*</span> <span>IS</span> <span>DISTINCT</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>NEW</span><span>.</span><span>*</span><span>)</span>
    <span>-- ^ to avoid updates on "noop calls", as best as possible</span>
    <span>EXECUTE</span> <span>PROCEDURE</span>
      <span>copy_updates_into_history</span><span>(</span><span>'mytable_history'</span><span>,</span> <span>'mytable_id'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is much less verbose to use if you want to retain history for multiple
tables!</p>

<p>While it’s true that the query can’t be type-checked ahead of time, the original
trigger won’t be either. <em>We have to run them to verify that they don’t refer to
wrong tables or ids</em>. If that’s the case, then we should pick the alternative
that reduces the chance of a sloppy search-replace.</p>

<p>And this new implementation does that! This trigger has the history table and
the ID field in only two locations – the input arguments, whereas the original
trigger implementation had them spread out all around in 7 different locations.
Also, let’s face it: copy-pasting some big triggers for every single table we
want system versioned just wouldn’t feel right.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The full implementation is over in the
<a href="https://github.com/hypirion/time-travelling-todo-lists-in-postgres">time-travelling-todo-lists-in-postgres</a>
repository, and the triggers are in the migration file <a href="https://github.com/hypirion/time-travelling-todo-lists-in-postgres/blob/main/migrations/001_history_triggers.up.sql"><code>migrations/001_history_triggers.up.sql</code></a>.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, this isn’t perfect: You have some big pitfalls related to table
modifications, it adds a risk of having concurrent updates break, and other databases
should have a much better implementation than my three triggers. It’s probably
not suitable for large databases either.</p>

<p>But if you’re stuck with Postgres, I think this is fine. However, I think you
should be aware of how the implementation works in detail, as there are a couple
of ways to shoot yourself in the foot. And if you’ve come this far down, you
hopefully do!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Perhaps rationale is not the best way to go when it comes to error messages.
If we follow a universal logic, yes, we shouldn't apologize for something that isn't our fault.</p>

<p>However, we should always put in value the user-centered approach with the end purpose of making the user feel comfortable no matter what. In this regard, an apologetic approach is the best solution.</p>

<p>Think of what the user feels in that moment:</p>

<p>"Damn, I am not allowed to use this feature!"</p>

<p>An error is a crucial moment when you can easily lose a visitor, that is why you must treat the situation very carefully, thinking of all the cognitive and psychological implications. This is what truly matters, not everyday life logic.</p>

<p>Either if it's his fault or not, when encountering an error, the user will feel frustrated. When you feel frustrated, you want someone's apology. Yes, you blame everyone and everything around you, but yourself.</p>

<p>It's childish, but I admit it happened to me too. When an application failed me (because of my mistake) and apologized, it really put a smile on my face and made me think:</p>

<p>"Fine, I forgive you. I know you didn't do anything wrong, anyway."</p>

<p>If you aim at all costs for a certain political corectness and you do not want to apologize for something that isn't your fault, consider a more neutral tone, like:</p>

<p>"<strong>Unfortunately</strong>, you do not have permission to access this feature."</p>

<p>I find the word "unfortunately" crucial. Otherwise, it would sound like an incrimination, which will chase away the frustrated user in a second:</p>

<p>"You do not have permission to access this feature." (add an exclamation mark and you won't see that user again)</p>

<p>I find the whole message too formal somehow (it's true, it depends on the context of your app). I would go for something short and funny that delivers the message in a non-robotic fashion. It sounds simple, but it's very difficult to come up with such texts, unles you are trained that way, so as to avoid further dilemma like this one:</p>

<p>You should also provide a possible explanation for the error and some ways to recover from it. This will reduce the user's frustration so much! </p>
